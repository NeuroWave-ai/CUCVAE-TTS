8095_274345_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 No sooner had Charles taken into his hands the reins of government than he showed an impatience to assemble the great council of the nation and he would gladly for the sake of despatch have called together the same parliament which had sitten under his father and which lay at that time under prorogation 
8095_274345_000021_000001	train-clean-100	But being told that this measure would appear unusual he issued writs for summoning a new parliament on the seventh of May and it was not without regret that the arrival of the princess Henrietta whom he had espoused by proxy obliged him to delay by repeated prorogations their meeting till the eighteenth of June when they assembled at Westminster for the despatch of business 
none	none	The young prince unexperienced and impolitic regarded as sincere all the praises and caresses with which he had been loaded while active in procuring the rupture with the house of Austria And besides that he labored under great necessities he hastened with alacrity to a period when he might receive the most undoubted testimony of the dutiful attachment of his subjects 
8095_274345_000021_000004	train-clean-100	His discourse to the parliament was full of simplicity and cordiality 
none	none	He lightly mentioned the occasion which he had for supply He employed no intrigue to influence the suffrages of the members He would not even allow the officers of the crown who had seats in the house to mention any particular sum which might be expected by him Secure of the affections of the commons he was resolved that their bounty should be entirely their own deed unasked unsolicited the genuine fruit of sincere confidence and regard Rushworth vol i p one hundred seventy one Parl Hist vol vi p three hundred forty six Franklyn p one hundred eight The house of commons accordingly took into consideration the business of supply 
8095_274345_000023_000001	train-clean-100	They knew that all the money granted by the last parliament had been expended on naval and military armaments and that great anticipations were likewise made on the revenues of the crown 
8095_274345_000023_000002	train-clean-100	They were not ignorant that Charles was loaded with a large debt contracted by his father who had borrowed money both from his own subjects and from foreign princes 
8095_274345_000023_000003	train-clean-100	They had learned by experience that the public revenue could with difficulty maintain the dignity of the crown even under the ordinary charges of government 
8095_274345_000023_000004	train-clean-100	They were sensible that the present war was very lately the result of their own importunate applications and entreaties and that they had solemnly engaged to support their sovereign in the management of it 
8095_274345_000023_000005	train-clean-100	They were acquainted with the difficulty of military enterprises directed against the whole house of Austria against the king of Spain possessed of the greatest riches and most extensive dominions of any prince in Europe against the emperor Ferdinand hitherto the most fortunate monarch of his age who had subdued and astonished Germany by the rapidity of his victories 
none	none	Deep impressions they saw must be made by the English sword and a vigorous offensive war be waged against these mighty potentates ere they would resign a principality which they had now fully subdued and which they held in secure possession by its being surrounded with all their other territories To answer therefore all these great and important ends to satisfy their young king in the first request which he made them to prove their sense of the many royal virtues particularly economy with which Charles was endued the house of Commons conducted by the wisest and ablest senators that had ever flourished in England thought proper to confer on the king a supply of two subsidies amounting to one hundred and twelve thousand pounds A subsidy was now fallen to about fifty six thousand pounds Cabala p two hundred twenty four first edit This measure which discovers rather a cruel mockery of Charles than any serious design of supporting him appears so extraordinary when considered in all its circumstances that it naturally summons up our attention and raises an inquiry concerning the causes of a conduct unprecedented in an English parliament 
8095_274345_000026_000001	train-clean-100	So numerous an assembly composed of persons of various dispositions was not it is probable wholly influenced by the same motives and few declared openly their true reason 
8095_274345_000026_000002	train-clean-100	We shall therefore approach nearer to the truth if we mention all the views which the present conjuncture could suggest to them 
8095_274345_000027_000000	train-clean-100	It is not to be doubted but spleen and ill will against the duke of Buckingham had an influence with many 
none	none	So vast and rapid a fortune so little merited could not fail to excite public envy and however men s hatred might have been suspended for a moment while the duke s conduct seemed to gratify their passions and their prejudices it was impossible for him long to preserve the affections of the people 
8095_274345_000027_000002	train-clean-100	His influence over the modesty of Charles exceeded even that which he had acquired over the weakness of James nor was any public measure conducted but by his counsel and direction 
8095_274345_000027_000003	train-clean-100	His vehement temper prompted him to raise suddenly to the highest elevation his flatterers and dependants and upon the least occasion of displeasure he threw them down with equal impetuosity and violence 
none	none	Implacable in his hatred fickle in his friendships all men were either regarded as his enemies or dreaded soon to become such The whole power of the kingdom was grasped by his insatiable hand while he both engrossed the entire confidence of his master and held invested in his single person the most considerable offices of the crown 
8095_274345_000028_000000	train-clean-100	However the ill humor of the commons might have been increased by these considerations we are not to suppose them the sole motives 
8095_274345_000028_000001	train-clean-100	The last parliament of James amidst all their joy and festivity had given him a supply very disproportioned to his demand and to the occasion 
8095_274345_000028_000002	train-clean-100	And as every house of commons which was elected during forty years succeeded to all the passions and principles of their predecessors we ought rather to account for this obstinacy from the general situation of the kingdom during that whole period than from any circumstances which attended this particular conjuncture 
8095_274345_000029_000000	train-clean-100	The nation was very little accustomed at that time to the burden of taxes and had never opened their purses in any degree for supporting their sovereign 
8095_274345_000029_000001	train-clean-100	Even Elizabeth notwithstanding her vigor and frugality and the necessary wars in which she was engaged had reason to complain of the commons in this particular nor could the authority of that princess which was otherwise almost absolute ever extort from them the requisite supplies 
none	none	Habits more than reason we find in every thing to be the governing principle of mankind 
8095_274345_000029_000003	train-clean-100	In this view likewise the sinking of the value of subsidies must be considered as a loss to the king 
8095_274345_000029_000004	train-clean-100	The parliament swayed by custom would not augment their number in the same proportion 
8095_274345_000030_000000	train-clean-100	The Puritanical party though disguised had a great authority over the kingdom and many of the leaders among the commons had secretly embraced the rigid tenets of that sect 
8095_274345_000030_000001	train-clean-100	All these were disgusted with the court both by the prevalence of the principles of civil liberty essential to their party and on account of the restraint under which they were held by the established hierarchy 
8095_274345_000030_000002	train-clean-100	In order to fortify himself against the resentment of James Buckingham had affected popularity and entered into the cabals of the Puritans but being secure of the confidence of Charles he had since abandoned this party and on that account was the more exposed to their hatred and resentment 
8095_274345_000030_000003	train-clean-100	Though the religious schemes of many of the Puritans when explained appear pretty frivolous we are not thence to imagine that they were pursued by none but persons of weak understandings 
none	none	Some men of the greatest parts and most extensive knowledge that the nation at this time produced could not enjoy any peace of mind because obliged to hear prayers offered up to the Divinity by a priest covered with a white linen vestment The match with France and the articles in favor of Catholics which were suspected to be in the treaty were likewise causes of disgust to this whole party though it must be remarked that the connections with that crown were much less obnoxious to the Protestants and less agreeable to the Catholics than the alliance formerly projected with Spain and were therefore received rather with pleasure than dissatisfaction To all these causes we must yet add another of considerable moment The house of commons we may observe was almost entirely governed by a set of men of the most uncommon capacity and the largest views men who were now formed into a regular party and united as well by fixed aims and projects as by the hardships which some of them had undergone in prosecution of them Among these we may mention the names of Sir Edward Coke Sir Edwin Sandys Sir Robert Philips Sir Francis Seymour Sir Dudley Digges Sir John Elliot Sir Thomas Wentworth mister Selden and mister Pym Animated with a warm regard to liberty these generous patriots saw with regret an unbounded power exercised by the crown and were resolved to seize the opportunity which the king s necessities offered them of reducing the prerogative within more reasonable compass Though their ancestors had blindly given way to practices and precedents favorable to kingly power and had been able notwithstanding to preserve some small remains of liberty it would be impossible they thought when all these pretensions were methodised and prosecuted by the increasing knowledge of the age to maintain any shadow of popular government in opposition to such unlimited authority in the sovereign It was necessary to fix a choice either to abandon entirely the privileges of the people or to secure them by firmer and more precise barriers than the constitution had hitherto provided for them 
8095_274345_000032_000004	train-clean-100	In this dilemma men of such aspiring geniuses and such independent fortunes could not long deliberate they boldly embraced the side of freedom and resolved to grant no supplies to their necessitous prince without extorting concessions in favor of civil liberty 
8095_274345_000032_000005	train-clean-100	The end they esteemed beneficent and noble the means regular and constitutional 
8095_274345_000032_000006	train-clean-100	To grant or refuse supplies was the undoubted privilege of the commons 
8095_274345_000032_000007	train-clean-100	And as all human governments particularly those of a mixed frame are in continual fluctuation it was as natural in their opinion and allowable for popular assemblies to take advantage of favorable incidents in order to secure the subject as for monarchs in order to extend their own authority 
none	none	With pleasure they beheld the king involved in a foreign war which rendered him every day more dependent on the parliament while at the same time the situation of the kingdom even without any military preparations gave it sufficient security against all invasion from foreigners Perhaps too it had partly proceeded from expectations of this nature that the popular leaders had been so urgent for a rupture with Spain nor is it credible that religious zeal could so far have blinded all of them as to make them discover in such a measure any appearance of necessity or any hopes of success But however natural all these sentiments might appear to the country party it is not to be imagined that Charles would entertain the same ideas 
8095_274345_000033_000001	train-clean-100	Strongly prejudiced in favor of the duke whom he had heard so highly extolled in parliament he could not conjecture the cause of so sudden an alteration in their opinions 
8095_274345_000033_000002	train-clean-100	And when the war which they themselves had so earnestly solicited was at last commenced the immediate desertion of their sovereign could not but seem very unaccountable 
none	none	Even though no further motive had been suspected the refusal of supply in such circumstances would naturally to him appear cruel and deceitful but when he perceived that this measure proceeded from an intention of encroaching on his authority he failed not to regard these aims as highly criminal and traitorous 
8095_274345_000033_000004	train-clean-100	Those lofty ideas of monarchical power which were very commonly adopted during that age and to which the ambiguous nature of the English constitution gave so plausible an appearance were firmly rivetted in Charles and however moderate his temper the natural and unavoidable prepossessions of self love joined to the late uniform precedents in favor of prerogative had made him regard his political tenets as certain and uncontroverted 
none	none	Taught to consider even the ancient laws and constitution more as lines to direct his conduct than barriers to withstand his power a conspiracy to erect new ramparts in order to straiten his authority appeared but one degree removed from open sedition and rebellion 
8095_274345_000033_000006	train-clean-100	So atrocious in his eyes was such a design that he seems even unwilling to impute it to the commons and though he was constrained to adjourn the parliament by reason of the plague which at that time raged in London he immediately reassembled them at Oxford and made a new attempt to gain from them some supplies in such an urgent necessity 
8095_274345_000034_000000	train-clean-100	Charles now found himself obliged to depart from that delicacy which he had formerly maintained 
none	none	By himself or his ministers he entered into a particular detail both of the alliances which he had formed and of the military operations which he had projected Dugdale p twenty five twenty six He told the parliament that by a promise of subsidies he had engaged the king of Denmark to take part in the war that this monarch intended to enter Germany by the north and to rouse to arms those princes who impatiently longed for an opportunity of asserting the liberty of the empire that Mansfeldt had undertaken to penetrate with an English army into the Palatinate and by that quarter to excite the members of the evangelical unions that the states must be supported in the unequal warfare which they maintained with Spain that no less a sum than seven hundred thousand pounds a year had been found by computation requisite for all these purposes that the maintenance of the fleet and the defence of Ireland demanded an annual expense of four hundred thousand pounds that he himself had already exhausted and anticipated in the public service his whole revenue and had scarcely left sufficient for the daily subsistence of himself and his family that on his accession to the crown he found a debt of above three hundred thousand pounds contracted by his father in support of the palatine and that while prince of Wales he had himself contracted debts notwithstanding his great frugality to the amount of seventy thousand pounds which he had expended entirely on naval and military armaments After mentioning all these facts the king even condescended to use entreaties He said that this request was the first that he had ever made them that he was young and in the commencement of his reign and if he now met with kind and dutiful usage it would endear to him the use of parliaments and would forever preserve an entire harmony between him and his people 
8095_274345_000037_000000	train-clean-100	To these reasons the commons remained inexorable 
none	none	Notwithstanding that the king s measures on the supposition of a foreign war which they had constantly demanded were altogether unexceptionable they obstinately refused any further aid Some members favorable to the court having insisted on an addition of two fifteenths to the former supply even this pittance was refused though it was known that a fleet and army were lying at Portsmouth in great want of pay and provisions and that Buckingham the admiral and the treasurer of the navy had advanced on their own credit near a hundred thousand pounds for the sea service Parl Hist vol vi p three hundred ninety six Rush vol i p one hundred seventy seven one hundred seventy eight et cetera Parl Hist vol vi p three hundred ninety nine Franklyn p one hundred eight one hundred nine Journ tenth Aug sixteen twenty five Rush vol i p one hundred ninety Parl Hist vol vi p three hundred ninety Besides all their other motives the house of commons had made a discovery which as they wanted but a pretence for their refusal inflamed them against the court and against the duke of Buckingham When James deserted the Spanish alliance and courted that of France he had promised to furnish Lewis who was entirely destitute of naval force with one ship of war together with seven armed vessels hired from the merchants 
8095_274345_000042_000002	train-clean-100	These the French court had pretended they would employ against the Genoese who being firm and useful allies to the Spanish monarchy were naturally regarded with an evil eye both by the king of France and of England 
none	none	When these vessels by Charles s orders arrived at Dieppe there arose a strong suspicion that they were to serve against Rochelle The sailors were inflamed That race of men who are at present both careless and ignorant in all matters of religion were at that time only ignorant They drew up a remonstrance to Pennington their commander and signing all their names in a circle lest he should discover the ringleaders they laid it under his prayer book Pennington declared that he would rather be hanged in England for disobedience than fight against his brother Protestants in France The whole squadron sailed immediately to the Downs There they received new orders from Buckingham lord admiral to return to Dieppe 
8095_274345_000042_000010	train-clean-100	As the duke knew that authority alone would not suffice he employed much art and many subtleties to engage them to obedience and a rumor which was spread that peace had been concluded between the French king and the Hugonots assisted him in his purpose 
none	none	When they arrived at Dieppe they found that they had been deceived 
8095_274345_000042_000012	train-clean-100	Sir Ferdinando Gorges who commanded one of the vessels broke through and returned to England 
none	none	All the officers and sailors of all the other ships notwithstanding great offers made them by the French immediately deserted One gunner alone preferred duty towards his king to the cause of religion and he was afterwards killed in charging a cannon before Rochelle The care which historians have taken to record this frivolous event proves with what pleasure the news was received by the nation Franklyn p nine Rush vol i p one hundred seventy five one hundred seventy six et cetera three hundred twenty five three hundred twenty six et cetera The house of commons when informed of these transactions showed the same attachment with the sailors for the Protestant religion nor was their zeal much better guided by reason and sound policy It was not considered that it was highly probable the king and the duke themselves had here been deceived by the artifices of France nor had they any hostile intention against the Hugonots that were it otherwise yet might their measures be justified by the most obvious and most received maxims of civil policy that if the force of Spain were really so exorbitant as the commons imagined the French monarch was the only prince that could oppose its progress and preserve the balance of Europe that his power was at present fettered by the Hugonots who being possessed of many privileges and even of fortified towns formed an empire within his empire and kept him in perpetual jealousy and inquietude that an insurrection had been at that time wantonly and voluntarily formed by their leaders who being disgusted in some court intrigue took advantage of the never failing pretence of religion in order to cover their rebellion that the Dutch influenced by these views had ordered a squadron of twenty ships to join the French fleet employed against the inhabitants of Rochelle that the Spanish monarch sensible of the same consequences secretly supported the Protestants in France and that all princes had ever sacrificed to reasons of state the interests of their religion in foreign countries All these obvious considerations had no influence 
8095_274345_000044_000002	train-clean-100	Great murmurs and discontents still prevailed in parliament 
none	none	The Hugonots though they had no ground of complaint against the French court were thought to be as much entitled to assistance from England as if they had taken arms in defence of their liberties and religion against the persecuting rage of the Catholics And it plainly appears from this incident as well as from many others that of all European nations the British were at that time and till long after the most under the influence of that religious spirit which tends rather to inflame bigotry than increase peace and mutual charity On this occasion the commons renewed their eternal complaints against the growth of Popery which was ever the chief of their grievances and now their only one They demanded a strict execution of the penal laws against the Catholics and remonstrated against some late pardons granted to priests They attacked Montague one of the king s chaplains on account of a moderate book which he had lately published and which to their great disgust saved virtuous Catholics as well as other Christians from eternal torments Journ eighteenth April sixteen twenty six Franklyn p three et cetera Parl Hist vol vi p three hundred seventy four Journ first Aug sixteen twenty five Parl Hist vol vi p three hundred fifty three Journ seventh July sixteen twenty five Charles gave them a gracious and a compliant answer to all their remonstrances He was however in his heart extremely averse to these furious measures Though a determined Protestant by principle as well as inclination he had entertained no violent horror against Popery and a little humanity he thought was due by the nation to the religion of their ancestors That degree of liberty which is now indulged to Catholics though a party much more obnoxious than during the reign of the Stuarts it suited neither with Charles s sentiments nor the humor of the age to allow them An abatement of the more rigorous laws was all he intended and his engagements with France notwithstanding that their regular execution had never been promised or expected required of him some indulgence But so unfortunate was this prince that no measure embraced during his whole reign was ever attended with more unhappy and more fatal consequences The extreme rage against Popery was a sure characteristic of Puritanism The house of commons discovered other infallible symptoms of the prevalence of that party They petitioned the king for replacing such able clergy as had been silenced for want of conformity to the ceremonies They also enacted laws for the strict observance of Sunday which the Puritans affected to call the Sabbath and which they sanctified by the most melancholy indolence It is to be remarked that the different appellations of this festival were at that time known symbols of the different parties The king finding that the parliament was resolved to grant him no supply and would furnish him with nothing but empty protestations of duty or disagreeable complaints of grievances took advantage of the plague which began to appear at Oxford and on that pretence immediately dissolved them By finishing the session with a dissolution instead of a prorogation he sufficiently expressed his displeasure at their conduct Rushworth vol i p two hundred eighty one one Car I cap one Journ twenty first June sixteen twenty five Franklyn p one hundred thirteen Rushworth vol i p one hundred ninety The plague was really so violent that it had been moved in the house at the beginning of the session to petition the king to adjourn them Journ twenty first June sixteen twenty five So it was impossible to enter upon grievances even if there had been any The only business of the parliament was to give supply which was so much wanted by the king in order to carry on the war in which they had engaged him To supply the want of parliamentary aids Charles issued privy seals for borrowing money from his subjects The advantage reaped by this expedient was a small compensation for the disgust which it occasioned By means however of that supply and by other expedients he was though with difficulty enabled to equip his fleet 
8095_274346_000004_000001	train-clean-100	It consisted of eighty vessels great and small and carried an board an army of ten thousand men 
8095_274346_000004_000002	train-clean-100	Sir Edward Cecil lately created Viscount Wimbleton was intrusted with the command 
8095_274346_000004_000003	train-clean-100	He sailed immediately for Cadiz and found the bay full of Spanish ships of great value 
8095_274346_000004_000004	train-clean-100	He either neglected to attack these ships or attempted it preposterously 
8095_274346_000004_000005	train-clean-100	The army was landed and a fort taken but the undisciplined soldiers finding store of wine could not be restrained from the utmost excesses 
8095_274346_000004_000006	train-clean-100	Further stay appearing fruitless they were reembarked and the fleet put to sea with an intention of intercepting the Spanish galleons 
none	none	But the plague having seized the seamen and soldiers they were obliged to abandon all hopes of this prize and return to England Loud complaints were made against the court for intrusting so important a command to a man like Cecil whom though he possessed great experience the people judging by the event esteemed of slender capacity Charles having failed of so rich a prize was obliged again to have recourse to a parliament 
8095_274346_000005_000001	train-clean-100	Though the ill success of his enterprises diminished his authority and showed every day more plainly the imprudence of the Spanish war though the increase of his necessities rendered him more dependent and more exposed to the encroachments of the commons he was resolved to try once more that regular and constitutional expedient for supply 
8095_274346_000005_000002	train-clean-100	Perhaps too a little political art which at that time he practised was much trusted to 
none	none	He had named four popular leaders sheriffs of counties Sir Edward Coke Sir Robert Philips Sir Thomas Wentworth and Sir Francis Seymour and though the question had been formerly much contested he thought that he had by that means incapacitated them from being elected members But his intention being so evident rather put the commons more upon their guard Enow of patriots still remained to keep up the ill humor of the house and men needed but little instruction or rhetoric to recommend to them practices which increased their own importance and consideration The weakness of the court also could not more evidently appear than by its being reduced to use so ineffectual an expedient in order to obtain an influence over the commons Rushworth vol i p one hundred ninety two Parl Hist vol vi p four hundred seven Franklyn p one hundred thirteen Rushworth vol i p one hundred ninety six It is always an express clause in the writ of summons that no sheriff shall be chosen but the contrary practice had often prevailed D Ewes p thirty eight Yet still great doubts were entertained on this head See Journ ninth April sixteen fourteen The views therefore of the last parliament were immediately adopted as if the same men had been every where elected and no time had intervened since their meeting When the king laid before the house his necessities and asked for supply they immediately voted him three subsidies and three fifteenths and though they afterwards added one subsidy more the sum was little proportioned to the greatness of the occasion and ill fitted to promote those views of success and glory for which the young prince in his first enterprise so ardently longed But this circumstance was not the most disagreeable one 
8095_274346_000009_000002	train-clean-100	The supply was only voted by the commons 
none	none	The passing of that vote into a law was reserved till the end of the session A condition was thereby made in a very undisguised manner with their sovereign 
8095_274346_000009_000004	train-clean-100	Under color of redressing grievances which during this short reign could not be very numerous they were to proceed in regulating and controlling every part of government which displeased them and if the king either cut them short in this undertaking or refused compliance with their demands he must not expect any supply from the commons 
none	none	Great dissatisfaction was expressed by Charles at a treatment which he deemed so harsh and undutiful But his urgent necessities obliged him to submit and he waited with patience observing to what side they would turn themselves The duke of Buckingham formerly obnoxious to the public became every day more unpopular by the symptoms which appeared both of his want of temper and prudence and of the uncontrolled ascendant which he had acquired over his master Journ twenty seventh March sixteen twenty six Parliamentary History vol vi p four hundred forty nine Rushworth vol i p two hundred twenty four His credit with the king had given him such influence that he had no less than twenty proxies granted him this parliament by so many peers which occasioned a vote that no peer should have above two proxies The earl of Leicester in fifteen eighty five had once ten proxies D Ewes p three hundred fourteen Two violent attacks he was obliged this session to sustain one from the earl of Bristol another from the house of commons 
8095_274346_000015_000000	train-clean-100	As long as James lived Bristol secure of the concealed favor of that monarch had expressed all duty and obedience in expectation that an opportunity would offer of reinstating himself in his former credit and authority 
8095_274346_000015_000001	train-clean-100	Even after Charles s accession he despaired not 
8095_274346_000015_000002	train-clean-100	He submitted to the king s commands of remaining at his country seat and of absenting himself from parliament 
8095_274346_000015_000003	train-clean-100	Many trials he made to regain the good opinion of his master but finding them all fruitless and observing Charles to be entirely governed by Buckingham his implacable enemy he resolved no longer to keep any measures with the court 
none	none	A new spirit he saw and a new power arising in the nation and to these he was determined for the future to trust for his security and protection When the parliament was summoned Charles by a stretch of prerogative had given orders that no writ as is customary should be sent to Bristol That nobleman applied to the house of lords by petition and craved their good offices with the king for obtaining what was his due as a peer of the realm His writ was sent him but accompanied with a letter from the lord keeper Coventry commanding him in the king s name to absent himself from parliament This letter Bristol conveyed to the lords and asked advice how to proceed in so delicate a situation The king s prohibition was withdrawn and Bristol took his seat 
8095_274346_000016_000003	train-clean-100	Provoked at these repeated instances of vigor which the court denominated contumacy Charles ordered his attorney general to enter an accusation of high treason against him

none	none	The sovereign authority was with some difficulty reduced from its ancient and legal height but when once pushed downwards it soon became contemptible and would easily by the continuance of the same effort now encouraged by success be carried to the lowest extremity Prompted by these plausible motives Charles was determined immediately to dissolve the parliament When this resolution was known the house of peers whose compliant behavior entitled them to some authority with him endeavored to interpose and they petitioned him that he would allow the parliament to sit some time longer Not a moment longer cried the king hastily and he soon after ended the session by a dissolution As this measure was foreseen the commons took care to finish and disperse their remonstrance which they intended as a justification of their conduct to the people The king likewise on his part published a declaration in which he gave the reasons of his disagreement with the parliament and of their sudden dissolution before they had time to conclude any one act These papers furnished the partisans on both sides with ample matter of apology or of recrimination But all impartial men judged that the commons though they had not as yet violated any law yet by their unpliableness and independence were insensibly changing perhaps improving the spirit and genius while they preserved the form of the constitution and that the king was acting altogether without any plan running on in a road surrounded on all sides with the most dangerous precipices and concerting no proper measures either for submitting to the obstinacy of the commons or for subduing it Rushworth vol i p three hundred ninety eight Sanderson s Life of Charles I p fifty eight Franklyn p two hundred three et cetera Parliament Hist vol vii p three hundred After a breach with the parliament which seemed so difficult to repair the only rational counsel which Charles could pursue was immediately to conclude a peace with Spain and to render himself as far as possible independent of his people who discovered so little inclination to support him or rather who seemed to have formed a determined resolution to abridge his authority Nothing could be more easy in the execution than this measure nor more agreeable to his own and to national interest But besides the treaties and engagements which he had entered into with Holland and Denmark the king s thoughts were at this time averse to pacific counsels There are two circumstances in Charles s character seemingly incompatible which attended him during the whole course of his reign and were in part the cause of his misfortunes he was very steady and even obstinate in his purpose and he was easily governed by reason of his facility and of his deference to men much inferior to himself both in morals and understanding His great ends he inflexibly maintained but the means of attaining them he readily received from his ministers and favorites though not always fortunate in his choice The violent impetuous Buckingham inflamed with a desire of revenge for injuries which he himself had committed and animated with a love of glory which he had not talents to merit had at this time notwithstanding his profuse licentious life acquired an invincible ascendant over the virtuous and gentle temper of the king The new counsels which Charles had mentioned to the parliament were now to be tried in order to supply his necessities Had he possessed any military force on which he could rely it is not improbable that he had at once taken off the mask and governed without any regard to parliamentary privileges so high an idea had he received of kingly prerogative and so contemptible a notion of the rights of those popular assemblies from which he very naturally thought he had met with such ill usage But his army was new levied ill paid and worse disciplined nowise superior to the militia who were much more numerous and who were in a great measure under the influence of the country gentlemen It behoved him therefore to proceed cautiously and to cover his enterprises under the pretence of ancient precedents which considering the great authority commonly enjoyed by his predecessors could not be wanting to him A commission was openly granted to compound with the Catholics and agree for dispensing with the penal laws enacted against them By this expedient the king both filled his coffers and gratified his inclination of giving indulgence to these religionists but he could not have employed any branch of prerogative which would have been more disagreeable or would have appeared more exceptionable to his Protestant subjects From the nobility he desired assistance from the city he required a loan of one hundred thousand pounds The former contributed slowly but the latter covering themselves under many pretences and excuses gave him at last a flat refusal Rushworth vol i p four hundred thirteen Whitlocke p seven Rushworth vol i p four

adjacent counties to arm so many vessels as were appointed them The city of London was rated at twenty ships This is the first appearance in Charles s reign of ship money a taxation which had once been imposed by Elizabeth but which afterwards when carried some steps further by Charles created such violent discontents Of some loans were required to others the way of benevolence was proposed methods supported by precedent but always invidious even in times more submissive and compliant In the most absolute governments such expedients would be regarded as irregular and unequal These counsels for supply were conducted with some moderation till news arrived that a great battle was fought between the king of Denmark and Count Tilly the imperial general in which the former was totally defeated Money now more than ever became necessary in order to repair so great a breach in the alliance and to support a prince who was so nearly allied to Charles and who had been engaged in the war chiefly by the intrigues solicitations and promises of the English monarch After some deliberation an act of council was passed importing that as the urgency of affairs admitted not the way of parliament the most speedy equal and convenient method of supply was by a general loan from the subject according as every man was assessed in the rolls of the last subsidy That precise sum was required which each would have paid had the vote of four subsidies passed into a law but care was taken to inform the people that the sums exacted were not to be called subsidies but loans Had any doubt remained whether forced loans however authorized by precedent and even by statute were a violation of liberty and must by necessary consequence render all parliaments superfluous this was the proper expedient for opening the eyes of the whole nation The example of Henry VIII who had once in his arbitrary reign practiced a like method of levying a regular supply was generally deemed a very insufficient authority Rushworth vol i p four hundred fifteen Rushworth vol i p four hundred sixteen Rushworth vol i p four hundred eighteen Whitlocke p eight The commissioners appointed to levy these

person in his majesty s name upon his allegiance not to disclose to any one what his answer was So violent an inquisitorial power so impracticable an attempt at secrecy were the objects of indignation and even in some degree of ridicule That religious prejudices might support civil authority sermons were preached by Sibthorpe and Manwaring in favor of the general loan and the court industriously spread them over the kingdom Passive obedience was there recommended in its full extent the whole authority of the state was represented as belonging to the king alone and all limitations of law and a constitution were rejected as seditious and impious So openly was this doctrine espoused by the court that Archbishop Abbot a popular and virtuous prelate was because he refused to license Sibthorpe s sermon suspended from the exercise of his office banished from London and confined to one of his country seats Abbot s principles of liberty and his opposition to Buckingham had always rendered him very ungracious at court and had acquired him the character of a Puritan For it is remarkable that this party made the privileges of the nation as much a part of their religion as the church party did the prerogatives of the crown and nothing tended further to recommend among the people who always take opinions in the lump the whole system and all the principles of the former sect The king soon found by fatal experience that this engine of religion which with so little necessity was introduced into politics falling under more fortunate management was played with the most terrible success against him While the king instigated by anger and necessity thus employed the whole extent of his prerogative the spirit of the people was far from being subdued Throughout England many refused these loans some were even active in encouraging their neighbors to insist upon their common rights and privileges By warrant of the council these were thrown into prison Rushworth vol i p four hundred

to the nation that their ancestors had been so jealous of personal liberty as to secure it against arbitrary power in the crown by six several statutes and by an article of the Great Charter itself the most sacred foundation of the laws and constitution But the kings of England who had not been able to prevent the enacting of these laws had sufficient authority when the tide of liberty was spent to obstruct their regular execution and they deemed it superfluous to attempt the formal repeal of statutes which they found so many expedients and pretences to elude Rushworth vol i p four hundred

Edw III cap three one Richard II cap twelve Chap twenty nine Turbulent and seditious times frequently occurred when the safety of the people absolutely required the confinement of factious leaders and by the genius of the old constitution the prince of himself was accustomed to assume every branch of prerogative which was found necessary for the preservation of public peace and of his own authority Expediency at other times would cover itself under the appearance of necessity and in proportion as precedents multiplied the will alone of the sovereign was sufficient to supply the place of expediency of which he constituted himself the sole judge In an age and nation where the power of a turbulent nobility prevailed and where the king had no settled military force the only means that could maintain public peace was the exertion of such prompt and discretionary powers in the crown and the public itself had become so sensible of the necessity that those ancient laws in favor of personal liberty while often violated had never been challenged or revived during the course of near three centuries Though rebellious subjects had frequently in the open field resisted the king s authority no person had been found so bold while confined and at mercy as to set himself in opposition to regal power and to claim the protection of the constitution against the will of the sovereign It was not till this age when the spirit of liberty was universally diffused when the principles of government were nearly reduced to a system when the tempers of men more civilized seemed less to require those violent exertions of prerogative that these five gentlemen above mentioned by a noble effort ventured in this national cause to bring the question to a final determination And the king was astonished to observe that a power exercised by his predecessors almost without interruption was found upon trial to be directly opposite to the clearest laws and supported by few undoubted precedents in courts of judicature These had scarcely in any instance refused bail upon commitments by special command of the king because the persons committed had seldom or never dared to demand it at least to insist on their demand Sir Randolf Crew chief justice had been displaced as unfit for the purposes of the court Sir Nicholas Hyde esteemed more obsequious had obtained that high office yet the judges by his direction went no further than to remand the gentlemen to prison and refuse the bail which was offered Heathe the attorney general insisted that the court in imitation of the judges in the thirty fourth of Elizabeth should enter a general judgment that no bail could be granted upon a commitment by the king or council But the judges wisely declined complying The nation they saw was already to the last degree exasperated In the present disposition of men s minds universal complaints prevailed as if the kingdom were reduced to slavery And the most invidious prerogative of the crown it was said that of imprisoning the subject is here openly and solemnly and in numerous instances exercised for the most invidious purpose in order to extort loans or rather subsidies without consent of parliament Rushworth vol i p four hundred sixty two State Trials vol vii p one hundred forty seven State Trials vol vii p one hundred sixty one But this was not the only hardship of which the nation thought they had reason to complain The army which had made the fruitless expedition to Cadiz was dispersed throughout the kingdom and money was levied upon the counties for the payment of their quarters The soldiers were billeted upon private houses contrary to custom which required that in all ordinary cases they should be quartered in inns and public houses Those who had refused or delayed the loan were sure to be loaded with a great number of these dangerous and disorderly guests Many too of low condition who had shown a refractory disposition were pressed into the service and enlisted in the fleet or army Sir Peter Hayman for the same reason was despatched on an errand to the Palatinate Glanville an eminent lawyer had been obliged during the former interval of parliament to accept of an office in the navy v The soldiers ill paid and undisciplined committed many crimes and outrages and much increased the public discontents To prevent these disorders martial law so requisite to the support of discipline was exercised upon the soldiers By a contradiction which is natural when the people are exasperated the outrages of the army were complained of the remedy was thought still more intolerable v Though the expediency if we are not rather to say the necessity of martial law had formerly been deemed of itself a sufficient ground for establishing it men now become more jealous of liberty and more refined reasoners in questions of government regarded as illegal and arbitrary every exercise of authority which was not supported by express statute or uninterrupted precedent Rushworth vol i p four hundred nineteen Rushworth vol i p four hundred nineteen Rushworth vol i p four hundred twenty two Rushworth vol i p four hundred eighty one v Parl Hist vol vii p three hundred ten v Rushworth vol i p four hundred nineteen Whitlocke p seven It may safely be affirmed that except a few courtiers or ecclesiastics all men were displeased with this high exertion of prerogative and this new spirit of administration Though ancient precedents were pleaded in favor of the king s measures a considerable difference upon comparison was observed between the cases Acts of power however irregular might casually and at intervals be exercised by a prince for the sake of despatch or expediency and yet liberty still subsist in some tolerable degree under his administration But where all these were reduced into a system were exerted without interruption were studiously sought for in order to supply the place of laws and subdue the refractory spirit of the nation it was necessary to find some speedy remedy or finally to abandon all hopes of preserving the freedom of the constitution Nor did moderate men esteem the provocation which the king had received though great sufficient to warrant all these violent measures The commons as yet had nowise invaded his authority they had only exercised as best pleased them their own privileges Was he justifiable because from one house of parliament he had met with harsh and unkind treatment to make in revenge an invasion on the rights and liberties of the whole nation But great was at this time the surprise of all men when Charles baffled in every attempt against the Austrian dominions embroiled with his own subjects unsupplied with any treasure but what he extorted by the most invidious and most dangerous measures as if the half of Europe now his enemy were not sufficient for the exercise of military prowess wantonly attacked France the other great kingdom in his neighborhood and engaged at once in war against these two powers whose interests were hitherto deemed so incompatible that they could never it was thought agree either in the same friendships or enmities All authentic memoirs both foreign and domestic ascribe to Buckingham s counsels this war with France and represent him as actuated by motives which would appear incredible were we not acquainted with the violence and temerity of his character The three great monarchies of Europe were at this time ruled by young princes Philip Louis and Charles who were nearly of the same age and who had resigned the government of themselves and of their kingdoms to their creatures and ministers Olivarez Richelieu and Buckingham The people whom the moderate temper or narrow genius of their princes would have allowed to remain forever in tranquillity were strongly agitated by the emulation and jealousy of the ministers Above all the towering spirit of Richelieu incapable of rest promised an active age and gave indications of great revolutions throughout all Europe This man had no sooner by suppleness and intrigue gotten possession of the reins of government than he formed at once three mighty projects to subdue the turbulent spirits of the great to reduce the rebellious Hugonots and to curb the encroaching power of the house of Austria Undaunted and implacable prudent and active he braved all the opposition of the French princes and nobles in the prosecution of his vengeance he discovered and dissipated all their secret cabals and conspiracies His sovereign himself he held in subjection while he exalted the throne The people while they lost their liberties acquired by means of his administration learning order discipline and renown That confused and inaccurate genius of government of which France partook in common with other European kingdoms he changed into a simple monarchy at the very time when the incapacity of Buckingham encouraged the free spirit of the commons to establish in England a regular system of liberty However unequal the comparison between these ministers Buckingham had entertained a mighty jealousy against Richelieu a jealousy not founded on rivalship of power and politics but of

not previously informed All his military operations showed equal incapacity and inexperience Instead of attacking Oleron a fertile island and defenceless he bent his course to the Isle of Rhe which was well garrisoned and fortified having landed his men though with some loss he followed not the blow but allowed Toiras the French governor five days respite during which saint Martin was victualled

overlooked he began to think of a retreat but made it so unskilfully that it was equivalent to a total rout he was the last of the army that embarked and he returned to England having lost two thirds

CHAPTER LI CHARLES I There was reason to apprehend some disorder or insurrection from the discontents which prevailed among the people in England Their liberties they believed were ravished from them illegal taxes extorted their commerce which had met with a severe check from the Spanish was totally annihilated by the French war those military honors transmitted to them from their ancestors had received a grievous stain by two unsuccessful and ill conducted expeditions scarce an illustrious family but mourned from the last of them the loss of a son or brother greater calamities were dreaded from the war with these powerful monarchies concurring with the internal disorders under which the nation labored And these ills were ascribed not to the refractory disposition of the two former parliaments to which they were partly owing but solely to Charles s obstinacy in adhering to the counsels of Buckingham a man nowise entitled by his birth age services or merit to that unlimited confidence reposed in him To be sacrificed to the interest policy and ambition of the great is so much the common lot of the people that they may appear unreasonable who would pretend to complain of it but to be the victim of the frivolous gallantry of a favorite and of his boyish caprices seemed the object of peculiar indignation In this situation it may be imagined the king and the duke dreaded above all things the assembling of a parliament but so little foresight had they possessed in their enterprising schemes that they found themselves under an absolute necessity of embracing that expedient The money levied or rather extorted under color of prerogative had come in very slowly and had left such ill humor in the nation that it appeared dangerous to renew the experiment The absolute necessity of supply it was hoped would engage the commons to forget all past injuries and having experienced the ill effects of former obstinacy they would probably assemble with a resolution of making some reasonable compliances The more to soften them it was concerted by Sir Robert Cotton s advice that Buckingham should be the first person that proposed in council the calling of a new parliament Having laid in this stock of merit he expected that all his former misdemeanors would be overlooked and forgiven and that instead of a tyrant and oppressor he should be regarded as the first patriot in the nation The views of the popular leaders were much more judicious and profound When the commons assembled they appeared to be men of the same independent spirit with their predecessors and possessed of such riches that their property was computed to surpass three times that of the house of peers they were deputed by boroughs and counties inflamed all of them by the late violations of liberty many of the members themselves had been cast into prison and had suffered by the measures of the court yet notwithstanding these circumstances which might prompt them to embrace violent resolutions they entered upon business with perfect temper and decorum They considered that the king disgusted at these popular assemblies and little prepossessed in favor of their privileges wanted but a fair pretence for breaking with them and would seize the first opportunity offered by any incident or any undutiful behavior of the members He fairly told them in his first speech that If they should not do their duties in contributing to the necessities of the state he must in discharge of his conscience use those other means which God had put into his hands in order to save that which the follies of some particular men may otherwise put in danger Take not this for a threatening added the king for I scorn to threaten any but my equals but as an admonition from him who by nature and duty has most care of your preservation and prosperity The lord keeper by the king s direction subjoined This way of parliamentary supplies as his majesty told you he hath chosen not as the only way but as the fittest not because he is destitute of others but because it is most agreeable to the goodness of his own most gracious disposition and to the desire and weal of his people If this be deferred necessity and the sword of the enemy make way for the others Remember his majesty s admonition I say remember it Franklyn p two hundred thirty Sanderson p one hundred six Walker p three hundred thirty nine Rushworth vol i p four hundred seventy seven Franklyn p two hundred thirty three Rushworth vol i p four hundred seventy nine Franklyn p two hundred thirty four From these avowed maxims the commons foresaw that if the least handle were afforded the king would immediately dissolve them and would thenceforward deem himself justified for violating in a manner still more open all the ancient forms of the constitution No remedy could then be looked for but from insurrections and civil war of which the issue would be extremely uncertain and which must in all events prove calamitous to the nation To correct the late disorders in the administration required some new laws which would no doubt appear harsh to a prince so enamored of his prerogative and it was requisite to temper by the decency and moderation of their debates the rigor which must necessarily attend their determinations Nothing can give us a higher idea of the capacity of those men who now guided the commons and of the great authority which they had acquired than the forming and executing of so judicious and so difficult a plan of operations The decency however which the popular leaders had prescribed to themselves and recommended to others hindered them not from making the loudest and most vigorous complaints against the grievances under which the nation had lately labored Sir Francis Seymour said This is the great council of the kingdom and here with certainty if not here only his majesty may see as in a true glass the state of the kingdom We are called hither by his writs in order to give him faithful counsel such as may stand with his honor and this we must do without flattery We are also sent hither by the people in order to deliver their just grievances and this we must do without fear Let us not act like Cambyses s judges who when their approbation was demanded by the prince to some illegal measure said that Though there was a written law the Persian kings might follow their own will and pleasure This was base flattery fitter for our reproof than our imitation and as fear so flattery taketh away the judgment For my part I shall shun both and speak my mind with as much duty as any man to his majesty without neglecting the public But how can we express our affections while we retain our fears or speak of giving till we know whether we have any thing to give For if his majesty may be persuaded to take what he will what need we give That this hath been done appeareth by the billeting of soldiers a thing nowise advantageous to the king s service and a burden to the commonwealth by the imprisonment of gentlemen for refusing the loan who if they had done the contrary for fear had been as blamable as the projector of that oppressive measure To countenance these proceedings hath it not been preached in the pulpit or rather prated that All we have is the king s by divine right But when preachers forsake their own calling and turn ignorant statesmen we see how willing they are to exchange a good conscience for a bishopric He I must confess is no good subject who would not willingly and cheerfully lay down his life when that sacrifice may promote the interests of his sovereign and the good of the commonwealth But he is not a good subject he is a slave who will allow his goods to be taken from him against his will and his liberty against the laws of the kingdom By opposing these practices we shall but tread in the steps of our forefathers who still preferred the public before their private interest nay before their very lives It will in us be a wrong done to ourselves to our posterities to our consciences if we forego this claim and pretension Franklyn p two hundred forty three Rushworth vol i p four hundred ninety nine I read of a custom said Sir Robert Philips among the old Romans that once every year they held a solemn festival in which their slaves had liberty without exception to speak what they pleased in order to ease their afflicted minds and on the conclusion of the festival the slaves severally returned to their former servitudes This institution may with some distinction well set forth our present state and condition After the revolution of some time and the grievous sufferance of many violent oppressions we have now at last as those slaves obtained for a day some liberty of speech but shall not I trust be hereafter slaves for we are born free Yet what new illegal burdens our estates and persons have groaned under my heart yearns to think of my tongue falters to utter The grievances by which we are oppressed I draw under two heads acts of power against law and the judgments of lawyers against our liberty Having mentioned three illegal judgments passed within his memory that by which the Scots born after James s accession were admitted to all the privileges of English subjects semi colon inserted not in scan that by which the new impositions had been warranted and the late one by which arbitrary imprisonments were authorized he thus proceeded I can live though another who has no right be put to live along with me nay I can live though burdened with impositions beyond what at present I labor under but to have my liberty which is the soul of my life ravished from me to have my person pent up in a jail without relief by law and to be so adjudged O improvident ancestors O unwise forefathers to be so curious in providing for the quiet possession of our lands and the liberties of parliament and at the same time to neglect our personal liberty and let us lie in prison and that during pleasure without redress or remedy If this be law why do we talk of liberties why trouble ourselves with disputes about a constitution franchises property of goods and the like What may any man call his own if not the liberty of his person I am weary of treading these ways and therefore conclude to have a select committee in order to frame a petition to his majesty for redress of these grievances And this petition being read examined and approved may be delivered to the king of whose gracious answer we have no cause to doubt our desires being so reasonable our intentions so loyal and the manner so dutiful Neither need we fear that this is the critical parliament as has been insinuated or that this is the way to distraction but assure ourselves of a happy issue Then shall the king as he calls us his great council find us his true council and own us his good council Franklyn p two hundred forty five Parl Hist vol vii p three hundred sixty three Rushworth vol i p five hundred two The same topics were enforced by Sir Thomas Wentworth After mentioning projectors and ill ministers of state These said he have introduced a privy council ravishing at once the spheres of all ancient government destroying all liberty imprisoning us without bail or bond They have taken from us What shall I say Indeed what have they left us By tearing up the roots of all property they have taken from us every means of supplying the king and of ingratiating ourselves by voluntary proofs of our duty and attachment towards him To the making whole all these breaches I shall apply myself and to all these diseases shall propound a remedy By one and the same thing have the king and the people been hurt and by the same must they be cured We must vindicate what New things No our ancient legal and vital liberties by reenforcing the laws enacted by our ancestors by setting such a stamp upon them that no licentious spirit shall dare henceforth to invade them And shall we think this a way to break a parliament No our desires are modest and just I speak both for the interest of king and people If we enjoy not these rights it will be impossible for us to relieve him Let us never therefore doubt of a favorable reception from his goodness These sentiments were unanimously embraced by the whole house Even the court party pretended not to plead in defence of the late measures any thing but the necessity to which the king had been reduced by the obstinacy of the two former parliaments A vote therefore was passed without opposition against arbitrary imprisonments and forced loans And the spirit of liberty having obtained some contentment by this exertion the reiterated messages of the king who pressed for supply were attended to with more temper Five subsidies were voted him with which though much inferior to his wants he declared himself well satisfied and even tears of affection started in his eye when he was informed of this concession The duke s approbation too was mentioned by Secretary Coke but the conjunction of a subject with the sovereign was ill received by the house Though disgusted with the king the jealousy which they felt for his honor was more sensible than that which his unbounded confidence in the duke would allow even himself to entertain Franklyn p two hundred forty three Rushworth vol i p five hundred Franklyn p two hundred fifty one Rushworth vol i p five hundred thirteen Whitlocke p nine Rushworth vol i p five hundred twenty six Whitlocke p nine The supply though voted was not as yet passed into a law and the commons resolved to employ the interval in providing some barriers to their rights and liberties so lately violated They knew that their own vote declaring the illegality of the former measures had not of itself sufficient authority to secure the constitution against future invasion Some act to that purpose must receive the sanction of the whole legislature and they appointed a committee to prepare the model of so important a law By collecting into one effort all the dangerous and oppressive claims of his prerogative Charles had exposed them to the hazard of one assault and had further by presenting a nearer view of the consequences attending them roused the independent genius of the commons Forced loans benevolences taxes without consent of parliament arbitrary imprisonments the billeting of soldiers martial law these were the grievances complained of and against these an eternal remedy was to be provided The commons pretended not as they affirmed to any unusual powers or privileges they aimed only at securing those which had been transmitted them from their ancestors and their law they resolved to call a Petition of Right as implying that it contained a corroboration or explanation of the ancient constitution not any infringement of royal prerogative or acquisition of new liberties While the committee was employed in framing the petition of right the favorers of each party both in parliament and throughout the nation were engaged in disputes about this bill which in all likelihood was to form a memorable era in the English government That the statutes said the partisans of the commons which secure English liberty are not become obsolete appears hence that the English have ever been free and have ever been governed by law and a limited constitution Privileges in particular which are founded on the Great Charter must always remain in force because derived from a source of never failing authority regarded in all ages as the most sacred contract between king and people Such attention was paid to this charter by our generous ancestors that they got the confirmation of it reiterated thirty several times and even secured it by a rule which though vulgarly received seems in the execution impracticable They have established it as a maxim That even a statute which should be enacted in contradiction to any article of that charter cannot have force or validity But with regard to that important article which secures personal liberty so far from attempting at any time any legal infringement of it they have corroborated it by six statutes and put it out of all doubt and controversy If in practice it has often been violated abuses can never come in the place of rules nor can any rights or legal powers be derived from injury and injustice But the title of the subject to personal liberty not only is founded on ancient and therefore the most sacred laws it is confirmed by the whole analogy of the government and constitution A free monarchy in which every individual is a slave is a glaring contradiction and it is requisite where the laws assign privileges to the different orders of the state that it likewise secure the independence of the members If any difference could be made in this particular it were better to abandon even life or property to the arbitrary will of the prince nor would such immediate danger ensue from that concession to the laws and to the privileges of the people To bereave of his life a man not condemned by any legal trial is so egregious an exercise of tyranny that it must at once shock the natural humanity of princes and convey an alarm throughout the whole commonwealth To confiscate a man s fortune besides its being a most atrocious act of violence exposes the monarch so much to the imputation of avarice and rapacity that it will seldom be attempted in any civilized government But confinement though a less striking is no less severe a punishment nor is there any spirit so erect and independent as not to be broken by the long continuance of the silent and inglorious sufferings of a jail The power of imprisonment therefore being the most natural and potent engine of arbitrary government it is absolutely necessary to remove it from a government which is free and legal The partisans of the court reasoned after a different manner The true rule of government said they during any period is that to which the people from time immemorial have been accustomed and to which they naturally pay a prompt obedience A practice which has ever struck their senses and of which they have seen and heard innumerable precedents has an authority with them much superior to that which attends maxims derived from antiquated statutes and mouldy records In vain do the lawyers establish it as a principle that a statute can never be abrogated by opposite custom but requires to be expressly repealed by a contrary statute while they pretend to inculcate an axiom peculiar to English jurisprudence they violate the most established principles of human nature and even by necessary consequence reason in contradiction to law itself which they would represent as so sacred and inviolable A law to have any authority must be derived from a legislature which has right And whence do all legislatures derive their right but from long custom and established practice If a statute contrary to public good has at any time been rashly voted and assented to either from the violence of faction or the inexperience of senates and princes it cannot be more effectually abrogated by a train of contrary precedents which prove that by common consent it has been tacitly set aside as inconvenient and impracticable Such has been the case with all those statutes enacted during turbulent times in order to limit royal prerogative and cramp the sovereign in his protection of the public and his execution of the laws But above all branches of prerogative that which is most necessary to be preserved is the power of imprisonment Faction and discontent like diseases frequently arise in every political body and during these disorders it is by the salutary exercise alone of this discretionary power that rebellions and civil wars can be prevented To circumscribe this power is to destroy its nature entirely to abrogate it is impracticable and the attempt itself must prove dangerous if not pernicious to the public The supreme magistrate in critical and turbulent times will never agreeably either to prudence or duty allow the state to perish while there remains a remedy which how irregular soever it is still in his power to apply And if moved by a regard to public good he employs any exercise of power condemned by recent and express statute how greedily in such dangerous times will factious leaders seize this pretence of throwing on his government the imputation of tyranny and despotism Were the alternative quite necessary it were surely much better for human society to be deprived of liberty than to be destitute of government Impartial reasoners will confess that this subject is not on both sides without its difficulties Where a general and rigid law is enacted against arbitrary imprisonment it would appear that government cannot in times of sedition and faction be conducted but by temporary suspensions of the law and such an expedient was never thought of during the age of Charles period inserted The meetings of parliament were too precarious and their determinations might be too dilatory to serve in cases of urgent necessity Nor was it then conceived that the king did not possess of himself sufficient power for the security and protection of his people or that the authority of these popular assemblies was ever to become so absolute that the prince must always conform himself to it and could never have any occasion to guard against their practices as well as against those of his other subjects Though the house of lords was not insensible to the reasons urged in favor of the pretensions of the commons they deemed the arguments pleaded in favor of the crown still more cogent and convincing That assembly seems during this whole period to have acted in the main a reasonable and a moderate part and if their bias inclined a little too much as is natural to the side of monarchy they were far from entertaining any design of sacrificing to arbitrary will the liberties and privileges of the nation Ashley the king s serjeant having asserted in pleading before the peers that the king must sometimes govern by acts of state as well as by law this position gave such offence that he was immediately committed to prison and was not released but upon his recantation and submission Being however afraid lest the commons should go too far in their projected petition the peers proposed a plan of one more moderate which they recommended to the consideration of the other house It consisted merely in a general declaration that the Great Charter and the six statutes conceived to be explanations of it stand still in force to all intents and purposes that in consequence of the charter and the statutes and by the tenor of the ancient customs and laws of the realm every subject has a fundamental property in his goods and a fundamental liberty of his person that this property and liberty are as entire at present as during any former period of the English government that in all common cases the common law ought to be the standard of proceedings And in case that for the security of his majesty s person the general safety of his people or the peaceable government of the kingdom the king shall find just cause for reasons of state to imprison or restrain any man s person he was petitioned graciously to declare that within a convenient time he shall and will express the cause of the commitment or restraint either general or special and upon a cause so expressed will leave the prisoner immediately to be tried according to the common law of the land Whitlocke p ten State Trials vol vii p one hundred eighty seven Rushworth vol i p five hundred forty eight Archbishop Abbot was employed by the lords to recommend in a conference this plan of a petition to the house of commons The prelate as was no doubt foreseen from his known principles was not extremely urgent in his applications and the lower house was fully convinced that the general declarations signified nothing and that the latter clause left their liberties rather in a worse condition than before They proceeded therefore with great zeal in framing the model of a petition which should contain expressions more precise and more favorable to public freedom The king could easily see the consequence of these proceedings Though he had offered at the beginning of the session to give his consent to any law for the security of the rights and liberties of the people he had not expected that such inroads would be made on his prerogative In order therefore to divert the commons from their intention he sent a message wherein he acknowledged past errors and promised that hereafter there should be no just cause of complaint And he added That the affairs of the kingdom press him so that he could not continue the session above a week or two longer and if the house be not ready by that time to do what is fit for themselves it shall be their own fault On a subsequent occasion he asked them Why demand explanations if you doubt not the performance of the statutes according to their true meaning Explanations will hazard an encroachment upon the prerogative and it may well be said What need a new law to confirm an old if you repose confidence in the declarations which his majesty made to both houses The truth is the Great Charter and the old statutes were sufficiently clear in favor of personal liberty but as all kings of England had ever in cases of necessity or expediency been accustomed at intervals to elude them and as Charles in a complication of instances had lately violated them the commons judged it requisite to enact a new law which might not be eluded or violated by any interpretation construction or contrary precedent Nor was it sufficient they thought that the king promised to return into the way of his predecessors His predecessors in all times had enjoyed too much discretionary power and by his recent abuse of it the whole world had reason to see the necessity of entirely retrenching it The king still persevered in his endeavors to elude the petition He sent a letter to the house of lords in which he went so far as to make a particular declaration That neither he nor his privy council shall or will at any time hereafter commit or command to prison or otherwise restrain any man for not lending money or for any other cause which in his conscience joined up though no hyphen he thought not to concern the public good and the safety of king and people And he further declared That he never would be guilty of so base an action as to pretend any cause of whose truth he was not fully satisfied But this promise though enforced to the commons by the recommendation of the upper house made no more impression than all the former messages State Trials vol vii p one hundred ninety three State Trials vol vii p one hundred ninety six Rushworth vol i p five hundred fifty six State Trials vol vii p one hundred ninety eight Rushworth vol i p five hundred sixty Parl Hist vol viii p one hundred eleven Among the other evasions of the king we may reckon the proposal of the house of peers to subjoin to the intended petition of right the following clause We humbly present this petition to your majesty not only with a care of preserving our own liberties but with due regard to leave entire that sovereign power with which your majesty is intrusted for the protection safety and happiness of your people Less penetration than was possessed by the leaders of the house of commons could easily discover how captious this clause was and how much it was calculated to elude the whole force of the petition These obstacles therefore being surmounted the petition of right passed the commons and was sent to the upper house two The peers who were probably well pleased in secret that all their solicitations had been eluded by the commons quickly passed the petition without any material alteration and nothing but the royal assent was wanting to give it the force of a law The king accordingly came to the house of peers sent for the commons and being seated in his chair of state the petition was read to him Great was now the astonishment of all men when instead of the usual concise and clear form by which a bill is either confirmed or rejected Charles said in answer to the petition The king willeth that right be done according to the laws and customs of the realm and that the statutes be put into execution that his subjects may have no cause to complain of any wrong or oppression contrary to their just rights and liberties to the preservation whereof he holds himself in conscience as much obliged as of his own prerogative State Trials vol vii p one hundred ninety

five hundred It is surprising that Charles who had seen so many instances of the jealousy of the commons who had himself so much roused that jealousy by his frequent evasive messages during this session could imagine that they would rest satisfied with an answer so vague and undeterminate It was evident that the unusual form alone of the answer must excite their attention that the disappointment must inflame their anger and that therefore it was necessary as the petition seemed to bear hard on royal prerogative to come early to some fixed resolution either gracefully to comply with it or courageously to reject it It happened as might have been foreseen The commons returned in very ill humor Usually when in that disposition their zeal for religion and their enmity against the unfortunate Catholics ran extremely high But they had already in the beginning of the session presented their petition of religion and had received a satisfactory answer though they expected that the execution of the laws against Papists would for the future be no more exact and rigid than they had hitherto found it To give vent to their present indignation they fell with their utmost force on doctor Manwaring There is nothing which tends more to excuse if not to justify the extreme rigor of the commons towards Charles than his open encouragement and avowal of such general principles as were altogether incompatible with a limited government Manwaring had preached a sermon which the commons found upon inquiry to be printed by special command of the king and when this sermon was looked into it contained doctrines subversive of all civil liberty It taught that though property was commonly lodged in the subject yet whenever any exigency required supply all property was transferred to the sovereign that the consent of parliament was not necessary for the imposition of taxes and that the divine laws required compliance with every demand how irregular soever which the prince should make upon his subjects For these doctrines the commons impeached Manwaring The sentence pronounced upon him by the peers was that he should be imprisoned during the pleasure of the house be fined a thousand pounds to the king make submission and acknowledgment of his offence be suspended during three years be incapable of holding any ecclesiastical dignity or secular office and that his book be called in and burnt Parliament Hist vol viii p two hundred six Rushworth vol i p five hundred eighty five five hundred ninety four Parl Hist vol viii p one hundred sixty eight one hundred sixty nine one hundred seventy et cetera Welwood p forty four Rushworth vol i p sixty five Parl Hist vol viii p two hundred twelve It may be worthy of notice that no sooner was the session ended than this man so justly obnoxious to both houses received a pardon and was promoted to a living of considerable value Some years after he was raised to the see of saint Asaph If the republican spirit of the commons increased beyond all reasonable bounds the monarchical spirit of the court this latter carried to so high a pitch tended still further to augment the former And thus extremes were every where affected and the just medium was gradually deserted by all men From Manwaring the house of commons proceeded to censure the conduct of Buckingham whose name hitherto they had cautiously forborne to mention In vain did the king send them a message in which he told them that the session was drawing near to a conclusion and desired that they would not enter upon new business nor cast any aspersions on his government and ministry Though the court endeavored to explain and soften this message by a subsequent message as Charles was apt hastily to correct any hasty step which he had taken it served rather to inflame than appease the commons as if the method of their proceedings had here been prescribed to them It was foreseen that a great tempest was ready to burst on the duke and in order to divert it the king thought proper upon a joint application of the lords and commons v to endeavor giving them satisfaction with regard to the petition of right He came therefore to the house of peers and pronouncing the usual form of words Let it be law as is desired gave full sanction and authority to the petition The acclamations with which the house resounded and the universal joy diffused over the nation showed how much this petition had been the object of all men s vows and expectations v Rushworth vol i p six hundred thirty five Whitlocke p eleven Rushworth vol i p six hundred seven Rushworth

was almost equivalent to a revolution and by circumscribing in so many articles the royal prerogative gave additional security to the liberties of the subject Yet were the commons far from being satisfied with this important concession Their ill humor had been so much irritated by the king s frequent evasions and delays that it could not be presently appeased by an assent which he allowed to be so reluctantly extorted from him Perhaps too the popular leaders implacable and artful saw the opportunity favorable and turning against the king those very weapons with which he had furnished them resolved to pursue the victory The bill however for five subsidies which had been formerly voted immediately passed the house because the granting of that supply was in a manner tacitly contracted for upon the royal assent to the petition and had faith been here violated no further confidence could have subsisted between king and parliament Having made this concession the commons continued to carry their scrutiny into every part of government In some particulars their industry was laudable in some it may be liable to censure A little after writs were issued for summoning this parliament a commission had been granted to Sir Thomas Coventry lord keeper the earl of Marlborough treasurer the earl of Manchester president of the council the earl of Worcester privy seal the duke of Buckingham high admiral and all the considerable officers of the crown in the whole thirty three By this commission which from the number of persons named in it could be no secret the commissioners were empowered to meet and to concert among themselves the methods of levying money by impositions or otherwise Where form and circumstance as expressed in the commission must be dispensed with rather than the substance be lost or hazarded In other words this was a scheme for finding expedients which might raise the prerogative to the greatest height and render parliaments entirely useless The commons applied for cancelling the commission and were no doubt desirous that all the world should conclude the king s principles to be extremely arbitrary and should observe what little regard he was disposed to pay to the liberties and privileges of his people Rushworth vol i p six hundred fourteen Parl Hist vol viii p two hundred fourteen Journ thirteenth June sixteen twenty eight A commission had likewise been granted and some money remitted in order to raise a thousand German horse and transport them into England These were supposed to be levied in order to support the projected impositions or excises though the number seems insufficient for such a purpose The house took notice of this design in severe terms and no measure surely could be projected more generally odious to the whole nation It must however be confessed that the king was so far right that he had now at last fallen on the only effectual method for supporting his prerogative But at the same time he should have been sensible that till provided with a sufficient military force all his attempts in opposition to the rising spirit of the nation must in the end prove wholly fruitless and that the higher he screwed up the springs of government while he had so little real power to retain them in that forced situation with more fatal violence must they fly out when any accident occurred to restore them to their natural action The commons next resumed their censure of Buckingham s conduct and behavior against whom they were implacable They agreed to present a remonstrance to the king in which they recapitulated all national grievances and misfortunes and omitted no circumstance which could render the whole administration despicable and odious The compositions with Catholics they said amounted to no less than a toleration hateful to God full of dishonor and disprofit to his majesty and of extreme scandal and grief to his good people they took notice of the violations of liberty above mentioned against which the petition of right seems to have provided a sufficient remedy they mentioned the decay of trade the unsuccessful expeditions to Cadiz and the Isle of Rhe the encouragement given to Arminians the commission for transporting German horse that for levying illegal impositions and all these grievances they ascribed solely to the ill conduct of the duke of Buckingham This remonstrance was perhaps not the less provoking to Charles because joined to the extreme acrimony of the subject there were preserved in it as in most of the remonstrances of that age an affected civility and submission in the language And as it was the first return which he met with for his late beneficial concessions and for his sacrifices of prerogative the greatest by far ever made by an English sovereign nothing could be more the object of just and natural indignation Rushworth vol i p six hundred twelve Rushworth vol i p six hundred nineteen Parl Hist vol viii p two hundred nineteen two hundred twenty et cetera It was not without good grounds that the commons were so fierce and assuming Though they had already granted the king the supply of five subsidies they still retained a pledge in their hands which they thought insured them success in all their applications Tonnage and poundage had not yet been granted by parliament and the commons had artfully this session concealed their intention of invading that branch of revenue till the royal assent had been obtained to the petition of right which they justly deemed of such importance They then openly asserted that the levying of tonnage and poundage without consent of parliament was a palpable violation of the ancient liberties of the people and an open infringement of the petition of right so lately granted The king in order to prevent the finishing and presenting this remonstrance came suddenly to the parliament and ended this session by a prorogation Rushworth vol i p six hundred twenty eight Journ eighteenth twentieth June sixteen twenty eight Journ twenty sixth June sixteen twenty eight Being freed for some time from the embarrassment of this assembly Charles began to look towards foreign wars where all his efforts were equally unsuccessful as in his domestic government The earl of Denbigh brother in law to Buckingham was despatched to the relief of Rochelle now closely besieged by land and threatened with a blockade by sea but he returned without effecting any thing and having declined to attack the enemy s fleet he brought on the English arms the imputation either of cowardice or ill conduct In order to repair this dishonor the duke went to Portsmouth where he had prepared a considerable fleet and army on which all the subsidies given by parliament had been expended This supply had very much disappointed the king s expectations The same mutinous spirit which prevailed in the house of commons had diffused itself over the nation and the commissioners appointed for making the assessments had connived at all frauds which might diminish the supply and reduce the crown to still greater necessities This national discontent communicated to a desperate enthusiast soon broke out in an event which may be considered as remarkable There was one Felton of a good family but of an ardent melancholic temper who had served under the duke in the station of lieutenant His captain being killed in the retreat at the Isle of Rhe Felton had applied for the company and when disappointed he threw up his commission and retired in discontent from the army While private resentment was boiling in his sullen unsociable mind he heard the nation resound with complaints against the duke and he met with the remonstrance of the commons in which his enemy was represented as the cause of every national grievance and as the great enemy of the public Religious fanaticism further inflamed these vindictive reflections and he fancied that he should do Heaven acceptable service if at one blow he despatched this dangerous foe to religion and to his country Full of these dark views he secretly arrived at Portsmouth at the same time with the duke and watched for an opportunity of effecting his bloody purpose May s Hist of the Parliament p twelve Buckingham had been engaged in conversation with Soubize and other French gentlemen and a difference of sentiment having arisen the dispute though conducted with temper and decency had produced some of those vehement gesticulations and lively exertions of voice in which that nation more than the English are apt to indulge themselves The conversation being finished the duke drew towards the door and in that passage turning himself to speak to Sir Thomas Friar a colonel in the army he was on the sudden over Sir Thomas s shoulder struck upon the breast with a knife Without uttering other words than The villain has killed me in the same moment pulling out the knife he breathed his last No man had seen the blow nor the person who gave it but in the confusion every one made his own conjecture and all agreed that the murder had been committed by the French gentlemen whose angry tone of voice had been heard while their words had not been understood by the bystanders In the hurry of revenge they had instantly been put to death had they not been saved by some of more temper and judgment who though they had the same opinion of their guilt thought proper to reserve them for a judicial trial and examination Near the door there was found a hat in the inside of which was sewed a paper containing four or five lines of that remonstrance of the commons which declared Buckingham an enemy to the kingdom and under these lines was a short ejaculation or attempt towards a prayer It was easily concluded that this hat belonged to the assassin but the difficulty still remained who that person should be for the writing discovered not the same and whoever he was it was natural to believe that he had already fled far enough not to be found without a hat In this hurry a man without a hat was seen walking very composedly before the door One crying out Here is the fellow who killed the duke every body ran to ask Which is he The man very sedately answered I am he The more furious immediately rushed upon him with drawn swords others more deliberate defended and protected him he himself with open arms calmly and cheerfully exposed his breast to the swords of the most enraged being willing to fall a sudden sacrifice to their anger rather than be reserved for that public justice which he knew must be executed upon him He was now known to be that Felton who had served in the army Being carried into a private room it was thought proper so far to dissemble as to tell him that Buckingham was only grievously wounded but not without hopes of recovery Felton smiled and told them that the duke he knew full well had received a blow which had terminated all their hopes When asked at whose instigation he had performed the horrid deed he replied that they needed not to trouble themselves in that inquiry that no man living had credit enough with him to have disposed him to such an action that he had not even intrusted his purpose to any one that the resolution proceeded only from himself and the impulse of his own conscience and that his motives would appear if his hat were found for that believing he should perish in the attempt he had there taken care to explain them When the king was informed of this assassination he received the news in public with an unmoved and undisturbed countenance and the courtiers who studied his looks concluded that secretly he was not displeased to be rid of a minister so generally odious to the nation Clarendon vol i p twenty seven twenty Warwick p thirty four But Charles s command of himself proceeded entirely from the gravity and composure of his temper He was still as much as ever attached to his favorite and during his whole life he retained an affection for Buckingham s friends and a prejudice against his enemies He urged too that Felton should be put to the question in order to extort from him a discovery of his accomplices but the judges declared that though that practice had formerly been very usual it was altogether illegal so much reasoners with regard to law had they become from the jealous scruples of the house of commons Meanwhile the distress of Rochelle had risen to the utmost extremity That vast genius of Richelieu which made him form the greatest enterprises led him to attempt their execution by means equally great and extraordinary In order to deprive Rochelle of all succor he had dared to project the throwing across the harbor a mole of a mile s extent in that boisterous ocean and having executed his project he now held the town closely blockaded on all sides The inhabitants though pressed with the greatest rigors of famine still refused to submit being supported partly by the lectures of their zealous preachers partly by the daily hopes of relief from England After Buckingham s death the command of the fleet and army was conferred on the earl of Lindesey who arriving before Rochelle made some attempts to break through the mole and force his way into the harbor but by the delays of the English that work was now fully finished and fortified and the Rochellers finding their last hopes to fail them were reduced to surrender at discretion even in sight of the English admiral Of fifteen thousand persons shut up in the city four thousand alone survived the fatigues and famine which they had undergone Rushworth vol one p six hundred thirty six This was the first necessary step towards the prosperity of France Foreign enemies as well as domestic factions being deprived of this resource that kingdom began now to shine forth in its full splendor By a steady prosecution of wise plans both of war and policy it gradually gained an ascendant over the rival power of Spain and every order of the state and every sect were reduced to pay submission to the lawful authority of the sovereign The victory however over the Hugonots was at first pushed by the French king with great moderation A toleration was still continued to them the only avowed and open toleration which at that time was granted in any European kingdom The failure of an enterprise in which the English nation from religious sympathy so much interested themselves could not but diminish the king s authority in the parliament during the approaching session but the commons when assembled found many other causes of complaint Buckingham s conduct and character with some had afforded a reason with others a pretence for discontent against public measures but after his death there wanted not new reasons and new pretences for general dissatisfaction Manwaring s pardon and promotion were taken notice of Sibthorpe and Cosins two clergymen who for like reasons were no less obnoxious to the commons had met with like favor from the king Montague who had been censured for moderation towards the Catholics the greatest of crimes had been created bishop of Chichester They found likewise upon inquiry that all the copies of the petition of right which were dispersed had by the king s orders annexed to them the first answer which had given so little satisfaction to the commons an expedient by which Charles endeavored to persuade the people that he had nowise receded from his former claims and pretensions particularly with regard to the levying of tonnage and poundage Selden also complained in the house that one Savage contrary to the petition of right had been punished with the loss of his ears by a discretionary or arbitrary sentence of the star chamber so apt were they on their part to stretch the petition into such consequences as might deprive the crown of powers which from immemorial custom were supposed inherent in it But the great article on which the house of commons broke with the king and which finally created in Charles a disgust to all parliaments was their claim with regard to tonnage and poundage On this occasion therefore it is necessary to give an account of the controversy The duty of tonnage and poundage in more ancient times had been commonly a temporary grant of parliament but it had been conferred on Henry V and all the succeeding princes during life in order to enable them to maintain a naval force for the defence of the kingdom The necessity of levying this duty had been so apparent that each king had ever claimed it from the moment of his accession and the first parliament of each reign had usually by vote conferred on the prince what they found him already in possession of Agreeably to the inaccurate genius of the old constitution this abuse however considerable had never been perceived nor remedied though nothing could have been easier than for the parliament to have prevented it State Trials vol vii p two hundred sixteen Rushworth vol i p six hundred forty three State Trials vol vii p two hundred sixteen Parl Hist vol viii p two hundred forty six Parl Hist vol viii p three hundred thirty nine three hundred forty three By granting this duty to each prince during his own life and for a year after his demise to the successor all inconveniencies had been obviated and yet the duty had never for a moment been levied without proper authority But contrivances of that nature were not thought of during those rude ages and as so complicated and jealous a government as the English cannot subsist without many such refinements it is easy to see how favorable every inaccuracy must formerly have proved to royal authority which on all emergencies was obliged to supply by discretionary power the great deficiency of the laws The parliament did not grant the duty of tonnage and poundage to Henry VIII till the sixth of his reign yet this prince who had not then raised his power to its greatest height continued during that whole time to levy the imposition the parliament in their very grant blame the merchants who had neglected to make payment to the crown and though one expression of that bill may seem ambiguous they employ the plainest terms in calling tonnage and poundage the king s due even before that duty was conferred on him by parliamentary authority Four reigns and above a whole century had since elapsed and this revenue had still been levied before it was voted by parliament so long had the inaccuracy continued without being remarked or corrected During that short interval which passed between Charles s accession and his first parliament he had followed the example of his predecessors and no fault was found with his conduct in this particular But what was most remarkable in the proceedings of that house of commons and what proved beyond controversy that they had seriously formed a plan for reducing their prince to subjection was that instead of granting this supply during the king s lifetime as it had been enjoyed by all his immediate predecessors they voted it only for a year and after that should be elapsed reserved to themselves the power of renewing or refusing the same concession But the house of peers who saw that this duty was now become more necessary than ever to supply the growing necessities of the crown and who did not approve of this encroaching spirit in the commons rejected the bill and the dissolution of that parliament followed so soon after that no attempt seems to have been made for obtaining tonnage and poundage in any other form three six Henry VIII cap fourteen Journ fifth July sixteen twenty five See note C at the end of the volume Charles meanwhile continued still to levy this duty by his own authority and the nation was so accustomed to that exertion of royal power that no scruple was at first entertained of submitting to it But the succeeding parliament excited doubts in every one The commons took there some steps towards declaring it illegal to levy tonnage and poundage without consent of parliament and they openly showed their intention of employing this engine in order to extort from the crown concessions of the most important nature But Charles was not yet sufficiently tamed to compliance and the abrupt dissolution of that parliament as above related put an end for the time to their further pretensions The following interval between the second and third parliament was distinguished by so many exertions of prerogative that men had little leisure to attend to the affair of tonnage and poundage where the abuse of power in the crown might seem to be of a more disputable nature But after the commons during the precedent session had remedied all these grievances by means of their petition of right which they deemed so necessary they afterwards proceeded to take the matter into consideration and they showed the same intention as formerly of exacting in return for the grant of this revenue very large compliances on the part of the crown Their sudden profulgation prevented them from bringing their pretensions to a full conclusion When Charles opened this session he had foreseen that the same controversy would arise and he therefore took care very early among many mild and reconciling expressions to inform the commons That he had not taken these duties as appertaining to his hereditary prerogative but that it ever was and still is his meaning to enjoy them as a gift of his people and that if he had hitherto levied tonnage and poundage he pretended to justify himself only by the necessity of so doing not by any right which he assumed Rushworth vol i p six hundred forty four Parl Hist vol viii p two hundred fifty six three hundred forty six This concession which probably arose from the king s moderate temper now freed from the impulse of Buckingham s violent counsels might have satisfied the commons had they entertained no other view than that of ascertaining their own powers and privileges But they carried their pretensions much higher They insisted as a necessary preliminary that the king should once entirely desist from levying these duties after which they were to take it into consideration how far they would restore him to the possession of a revenue of which he had clearly divested himself But besides that this extreme rigor had never been exercised towards any of his predecessors and many obvious inconveniencies must follow from the intermission of the customs there were other reasons which deterred Charles from complying with so hard a condition It was probable that the commons might renew their former project of making this revenue only temporary and thereby reducing their prince to perpetual dependence they certainly would cut off the new impositions which Mary and Elizabeth but especially James had levied and which formed no despicable part of the public revenue and they openly declared that they had at present many important pretensions chiefly with regard to religion and if compliance were refused no supply must be expected from the commons It is easy to see in what an inextricable labyrinth Charles was now involved By his own concessions by the general principles of the English government and by the form of every bill which had granted this duty tonnage and poundage was derived entirely from the free gift of the people and consequently might be withdrawn at their pleasure If unreasonable in their refusal they still refused nothing but what was their own If public necessity required this supply it might be thought also to require the king s compliance with those conditions which were the price of obtaining it Though the motive for granting it had been the enabling of the king to guard the seas it did not follow that because he guarded the seas he was therefore entitled to this revenue without further formality since the people had still reserved to themselves the right of judging how far that service merited such a supply But Charles notwithstanding his public declaration was far from assenting to this conclusion in its full extent The plain consequence he saw of all these rigors and refinements and inferences was that he without any public necessity and without any fault of his own must of a sudden even from his accession become a magistrate of a very different nature from any of his predecessors and must fall into a total dependence on subjects over whom former kings especially those immediately preceding had exercised an authority almost unlimited Entangled in a chain of consequences which he could not easily break he was inclined to go higher and rather deny the first principle than admit of conclusions which to him appeared so absurd and unreasonable Agree to the ideas hitherto entertained both by natives and foreigners the monarch he esteemed the essence and soul of the English government and whatever other power pretended to annihilate or even abridge the royal authority must necessarily he thought either in its nature or exercise be deemed no better than a usurpation Willing to preserve the ancient harmony of the constitution he had ever intended to comply as far as he easily could with the ancient forms of administration but when these forms appeared to him by the inveterate obstinacy of the commons to have no other tendency than to disturb that harmony and to introduce a new constitution he concluded that in this violent situation what was subordinate must necessarily yield to what was principal and the privileges of the people for a time give place to royal prerogative From the rank of a monarch to be degraded into a slave of his insolent ungrateful subjects seemed of all indignities the greatest and nothing in his judgment could exceed the humiliation attending such a state but the meanness of tamely submitting to it without making some efforts to preserve the authority transmitted to him by his predecessors Though these were the king s reflections and resolutions before the parliament assembled he did not immediately break with them upon their delay in voting him this supply He thought that he could better justify any strong measure which he might afterwards be obliged to take if he allowed them to carry to the utmost extremities their attacks upon his government and prerogative He contented himself for the present with soliciting the house by messages and speeches But the commons instead of hearkening to his solicitations proceeded to carry their scrutiny into his management of religion which was the only grievance to which in their opinion they had not as yet by their petition of right applied a sufficient remedy Rushworth vol i p six hundred forty two Rushworth vol i p six hundred fifty one Whitlocke p twelve It was not possible that this century so fertile in religious sects and disputes could escape the controversy concerning fatalism and free will which being strongly interwoven both with philosophy and theology had in all ages thrown every school and every church into such inextricable doubt and perplexity The first reformers in England as in other European countries had embraced the most rigid tenets of predestination and absolute decrees and had composed upon that system all the articles of their religious creed But these principles having met with opposition from Arminius and his sectaries the controversy was soon brought into this island and began here to diffuse itself The Arminians finding more encouragement from the superstitious spirit of the church than from the fanaticism of the Puritans gradually incorporated themselves with the former and some of that sect by the indulgence of James and Charles had attained the highest preferments in the hierarchy But their success with the public had not been altogether answerable to that which they met with in the church and the court Throughout the nation they still lay under the reproach of innovation and heresy The commons now levelled against them their formidable censures and made them the objects of daily invective and declamation Their protectors were stigmatized their tenets canvassed their views represented as dangerous and pernicious To impartial spectators surely if any such had been at that time in England it must have given great entertainment to see a popular assembly inflamed with faction and enthusiasm pretend to discuss questions to which the greatest philosophers in the tranquillity of retreat had never hitherto been able to find any satisfactory solution Amidst that complication of disputes in which men were then involved we may observe that the appellation Puritan stood for three parties which though commonly united were yet actuated by very different views and motives There were the political Puritans who maintained the highest principles of civil liberty the Puritans in discipline who were averse to the ceremonies and Episcopal government of the church and the doctrinal Puritans who rigidly defended the speculative system of the first reformers In opposition to all these stood the court party the hierarchy and the Arminians only with this distinction that the latter sect being introduced a few years before did not as yet comprehend all those who were favorable to the church and to monarchy But as the controversies on every subject grew daily warmer men united themselves more intimately with their friends and separated themselves wider from their antagonists and the distinction gradually became quite uniform and regular This house of commons which like all the preceding during the reigns of James and Charles and even of Elizabeth was much governed by the Puritanical party thought that they could not better serve their cause than by branding and punishing the Arminian sect which introducing an innovation in the church were the least favored and least powerful of all their antagonists From this measure it was easily foreseen that besides gratifying the animosity of the doctrinal Puritans both the Puritans in discipline and those in politics would reap considerable advantages Laud Neile Montague and other bishops who were the chief supporters of Episcopal government and the most zealous partisans of the discipline and ceremonies of the church were all supposed to be tainted with Arminianism The same men and their disciples were the strenuous preachers of passive obedience and of entire submission to princes and if these could once be censured and be expelled the church and court it was concluded that the hierarchy would receive a mortal blow the ceremonies be less rigidly insisted on and the king deprived of his most faithful friends be obliged to abate those high claims of prerogative on which at present he insisted But Charles besides a view of the political consequences which must result from a compliance with such pretensions was strongly determined from principles of piety and conscience to oppose them Neither the dissipation incident to youth nor the pleasures attending a high fortune had been able to prevent this virtuous prince from embracing the most sincere sentiments of religion and that character which in that religious age should have been of infinite advantage to him proved in the end the chief cause of his ruin merely because the religion adopted by him was not of that precise mode and sect which began to prevail among his subjects His piety though remote from Popery had a tincture of superstition in it and being averse to the gloomy spirit of the Puritans was represented by them as tending towards the abominations of Antichrist Laud also had unfortunately acquired a great ascendant over him and as all those prelates obnoxious to the commons were regarded as his chief friends and most favored courtiers he was resolved not to disarm and dishonor himself by abandoning them to the resentment of his enemies Being totally unprovided with military force and finding a refractory independent spirit to prevail among the people the most solid basis of his authority he thought consisted in the support which he received from the hierarchy In the debates of the commons which are transmitted to us it is easy to discern so early some sparks of that enthusiastic fire which afterwards set the whole nation in combustion One Rouse made use of an allusion which though familiar seems to have been borrowed from the writings of Lord Bacon If a man meet a dog alone said he the dog is fearful though ever so fierce by nature but if the dog have his master with him he will set upon that man from whom he fled before This shows that lower natures being backed by higher increase in courage and strength and certainly man being backed with Omnipotency is a kind of omnipotent creature All things are possible to him that believes and where all things are possible there is a kind of omnipotency Wherefore let it be the unanimous consent and resolution of us all to make a vow and covenant henceforth to hold fast our God and our religion and then shall we henceforth expect with certainty happiness in this world Oliver Cromwell at that time a young man of no account in the nation is mentioned in these debates as complaining of one who he was told preached flat Popery It is amusing to observe the first words of this fanatical hypocrite correspond so exactly to his character The inquiries and debates concerning tonnage and poundage went hand in hand with these theological or metaphysical controversies The officers of the custom house were summoned before the commons to give an account by what authority they had seized the goods of merchants who had refused to pay these duties the barons of the exchequer were questioned concerning their decrees on that head One of the sheriffs of London was committed to the Tower for his activity in supporting the officers of the custom house the goods of Rolles a merchant and member of the house being seized for his refusal to pay the duties complaints were made of this violence as if it were a breach of privilege v Charles supported his officers in all these measures and the quarrel grew every day

pushed back into the chair and forcibly held in it by Hollis and Valentine till a short remonstrance was framed and was passed by acclamation rather than by vote Papists and Arminians were there declared capital enemies to the commonwealth Those who levied tonnage and poundage were branded with the same epithet And even the merchant who should voluntarily pay these duties were denominated betrayers of English liberty and public enemies The doom being locked the gentleman usher of the house of lords who was sent by the king could not get admittance till this remonstrance was finished By the king s order he took the mace from the table which ended their proceedings and a few days after the parliament was dissolved The discontents of the nation ran high on account of this violent rupture between the king and parliament These discontents Charles inflamed by his affectation of a severity which he had not power nor probably inclination to carry to extremities Sir Miles Hobart Sir Peter Heyman Selden Coriton Long Strode were committed to prison on account of the last tumult in the house which was called sedition The king s power of adjourning as well as proroguing the parliament was and is never questioned In the nineteenth of the late king the judges determined that the adjournment by the king kept the parliament in statu quo until the next sitting but that then no committees were to meet but if the adjournment be by the house then the committees and other matters do continue Parl Hist vol v p four hundred sixty six Rushworth vol i p six hundred sixty

sureties for their good behavior and to be fined the two former a thousand pounds apiece the latter five hundred This sentence procured by the influence of the crown served only to show the king s disregard to the privileges of parliament and to acquire an immense stock of popularity to the sufferers who had so bravely in opposition to arbitrary power defended the liberties of their native country The commons of England though an immense body and possessed of the greater part of national property were naturally somewhat defenceless because of their personal equality and their want of leaders but the king s severity if these prosecutions deserve the name here pointed out leaders to them whose resentment was inflamed and whose courage was nowise daunted by the hardships which they had undergone in so honorable a cause So much did these prisoners glory in their sufferings that though they were promised liberty on that condition they would not condescend even to present a petition to the king expressing their sorrow for having offended him They unanimously refused to find sureties for their good behavior and disdained to accept of deliverance on such easy terms Nay Hollis was so industrious to continue his meritorious distress that when one offered to bail him he would not yield to the rule of court and be himself bound with his friend Even Long who had actually found sureties in the chief justice s chamber declared in court that his sureties should no longer continue Yet because Sir John Elliot Happened to die while in custody a great clamor was raised

him with unmitigated rigor both in invading his prerogative and refusing him all supply resolved not to call any more till he should see greater indications of a compliant disposition in the nation Having lost his great favorite Buckingham he became his own minister and never afterwards reposed in any one such unlimited confidence As he chiefly follows his own genius and disposition his measures are henceforth less rash and hasty though the general tenor of his administration still wants somewhat of being entirely legal and perhaps more of being entirely prudent We shall endeavor to exhibit a just idea of the events which followed for some years so far as they regard foreign affairs the state of the court and the government of the nation The incidents are neither numerous nor illustrious but the knowledge of them is necessary for understanding the subsequent transactions which are so memorable Charles destitute of all supply was necessarily reduced to embrace a measure which ought to have been the result of reason and sound policy he made peace with the two crowns against which he had hitherto waged a war entered into without necessity and conducted without glory Notwithstanding the distracted and helpless condition of England no attempt was made either by France or Spain to invade their enemy nor did they entertain any further project than to defend themselves against the feeble and ill concerted expeditions of that kingdom Pleased that the jealousies and quarrels between king and parliament had disarmed so formidable a power they carefully avoided any enterprise which might rouse either the terror or anger of the English and dispose them to domestic union and submission The endeavors to regain the good will of the nation were carried so far by the king of Spain that he generously released and sent home all the English prisoners taken in the expedition against Cadiz The example was imitated by France after the retreat of the English from the Isle of Rhe When princes were in such dispositions and had so few pretensions on each other it could not be difficult to conclude a peace The treaty was first signed with France The situation of the king s affairs did not entitle him to demand any conditions for the Hugonots and they were abandoned to the will of their sovereign Peace was afterwards concluded with Spain where no conditions were made in favor of the palatine except that Spain promised in general to use their good offices for his restoration The influence of these two wars on domestic affairs and on the dispositions of king and people was of the utmost consequence but no alteration was made by them on the foreign interests of the kingdom Rushworth vol ii p twenty three twenty four Rushworth vol ii p seventy five Whitlocke p fourteen Nothing more happy can be imagined than the situation in which England then stood with regard to foreign affairs Europe was divided between the rival families of Bourbon and Austria whose opposite interests and still more their mutual jealousies secured the tranquillity of this island Their forces were so nearly counterpoised that no apprehensions were entertained of any event which could suddenly disturb the balance of power between them The Spanish monarch deemed the most powerful lay at greatest distance and the English by that means possessed the advantage of being engaged by political motives into a more intimate union and confederacy with the neighboring potentate The dispersed situation of the Spanish dominions rendered the naval power of England formidable to them and kept that empire in continual dependence France more vigorous and more compact was every day rising in policy and discipline and reached at last an equality of power with the house of Austria but her progress slow and gradual left it still in the power of England by a timely interposition to check her superiority And thus Charles could he have avoided all dissensions with his own subjects was in a situation to make himself be courted and respected by every power in Europe and what has scarcely ever since been attained by the princes of this island he could either be active with dignity or neutral with security A neutrality was embraced by the king and during the rest of his reign he seems to have little regarded foreign affairs except so far as he was engaged by honor and by friendship for his sister and the palatine to endeavor the procuring of some relief for that unhappy family He joined his good offices to those of France and mediated a peace between the kings of Sweden and Poland in hopes of engaging the former to embrace the protection of the oppressed Protestants in the empire This was the famed Gustavus whose heroic genius seconded by the wisest policy made him in a little time the most distinguished monarch of the age and rendered his country formerly unknown and neglected of great weight in the balance of Europe To encourage and assist him in his projected invasion of Germany Charles agreed to furnish him with six thousand men but that he might preserve the appearance of neutrality he made use of the marquis of Hamilton s name Rushworth vol i p forty six fifty three sixty two eighty three That nobleman entered into an engagement with Gustavus and enlisting these troops in England and Scotland at Charles s expense he landed them in the Elbe The decisive battle of Leipsic was fought soon after where the conduct of Tilly and the valor of the imperialists were overcome by the superior conduct of Gustavus and the superior valor of the Swedes What remained of this hero s life was one continued series of victory for which he was less beholden to fortune than to those personal endowments which he derived from nature and from industry That rapid progress of conquest which we so much admire in ancient history was here renewed in modern annals and without that cause to which in former ages it had ever been owing Military nations were not now engaged against an undisciplined and unwarlike people nor heroes set in opposition to cowards The veteran troops of Ferdinand conducted by the most celebrated generals of the age were foiled in every encounter and all Germany was overrun in an instant by the victorious Swede But by this extraordinary and unexpected success of his ally Charles failed of the purpose for which he framed the alliance Gustavus elated by prosperity began to form more extensive plans of ambition and in freeing Germany from the yoke of Ferdinand he intended to reduce it to subjection under his own He refused to restore the palatine to his principality except on conditions which would have kept him in total dependence And thus the negotiation was protracted till the battle of Lutzen where the Swedish monarch perished in the midst of a complete victory which he obtained over his enemies We have carried on these transactions a few years beyond the present period that we might not be obliged to return to them nor be henceforth interrupted in our account of Charles s court and kingdoms Franklyn vol i p four hundred fifteen When we consider Charles as presiding in his court as associating with his family it is difficult to imagine a character at once more respectable and more amiable A kind husband an indulgent father a gentle master a steadfast friend to all these eulogies his conduct in private life fully entitled him As a monarch too in the exterior qualities he excelled in the essential he was not defective His address and manner though perhaps inclining a little towards stateliness and formality in the main corresponded to his high rank and gave grace to that reserve and gravity which were natural to him The moderation and equity which shone forth in his temper seemed to secure him against rash and dangerous enterprises the good sense which he displayed in his discourse and conversation seemed to warrant his success in every reasonable undertaking Other endowments likewise he had attained which in a private gentleman would have been highly ornamental and which in a great monarch might have proved extremely useful to his people He was possessed of an excellent taste in all the fine arts and the love of painting was in some degree his favorite passion Learned beyond what is common in princes he was a good judge of writing in others and enjoyed himself no mean talent in composition In any other age or nation this monarch had been secure of a prosperous and a happy reign But the high idea of his own authority which he had imbibed made him incapable of giving way to the spirit of liberty which began to prevail among his subjects His politics were not supported by such vigor and foresight as might enable him to subdue their pretensions and maintain his prerogative at the high pitch to which it had been raised by his predecessors And above all the spirit of enthusiasm being universally diffused disappointed all the views of human prudence and disturbed the operation of every motive which usually influences society But the misfortunes arising from these causes were yet remote Charles now enjoyed himself in the full exercise of his authority in a social intercourse with his friends and courtiers and in a moderate use of those pleasures which he most affected After the death of Buckingham who had somewhat alienated Charles from the queen she is to be considered as his chief friend and favorite That rustic contempt of the fair sex which James affected and which banishing them from his court made it resemble more a fair or an exchange than the seat of a great prince was very wide of the disposition of this monarch But though full of complaisance to the whole sex Charles reserved all his passion for his consort to whom he attached himself with unshaken fidelity and confidence By her sense and spirit as well as by her beauty she justified the fondness of her husband though it is allowed that being somewhat of a passionate temper she precipitated him into hasty and imprudent measures Her religion likewise to which she was much addicted must be regarded as a great misfortune since it augmented the jealousy which prevailed against the court and engaged her to procure for the Catholics some indulgences which were generally distasteful to the nation In the former situation of the English government when the sovereign was in a great measure independent of his subjects the king chose his ministers either from personal favor or from an opinion of their abilities without any regard to their parliamentary interest or talents It has since been the maxim of princes wherever popular leaders encroach too much on royal authority to confer offices on them in expectation that they will afterwards become more careful not to diminish that power which has become their own These politics were now embraced by Charles a sure proof that a secret revolution had happened in the constitution and had necessitated the prince to adopt new maxims of government May p twenty one Sir Edw Walker p three hundred twenty eight But the views of the king were at this time so repugnant to those of the Puritans that the leaders whom he gained lost from that moment all interest with their party and were even pursued as traitors with implacable hatred and resentment This was the case with Sir Thomas Wentworth whom the king created first a baron then a viscount and afterwards earl of Strafford made him president of the council of York and deputy of Ireland and regarded him as his chief minister and counsellor By his eminent talents and abilities Strafford merited all the confidence which his master reposed in him his character was stately and austere more fitted to procure esteem than love his fidelity to the king was unshaken but as he now employed all his counsels to support the prerogative which he had formerly bent all his endeavors to diminish his virtue seems not to have been entirely pure but to have been susceptible of strong impressions from private interest and ambition Sir Dudley Digges was about the same time created master of the rolls Noy attorney general Littleton solicitor general All these had likewise been parliamentary leaders and were men eminent in their profession Whitlocke p thirteen May p twenty Illustration one six hundred forty seven strafford jpg EARL OF STRAFFORD In all ecclesiastical affairs and even in many civil Laud bishop of London had great influence over the king This man was virtuous if severity of manners alone and abstinence from pleasure could deserve that name He was learned if polemical knowledge could entitle him to that praise He was disinterested but with unceasing industry he studied to exalt the priestly and prelatical character which was his own His zeal was unrelenting in the cause of religion that is in imposing by rigorous measures his own tenets and pious ceremonies on the obstinate Puritans who had profanely dared to oppose him In prosecution of his holy purposes he overlooked every human consideration or in other words the heat and indiscretion of his temper made him neglect the views of prudence and rules of good manners He was in this respect happy that all his enemies were also imagined by him the declared enemies to loyalty and true piety and that every exercise of his anger by that means became in his eyes a merit and a virtue This was the man who acquired so great an ascendant over Charles and who led him by the facility of his temper into a conduct which proved so fatal to himself and to his kingdoms The humor of the nation ran at that time into the extreme opposite to superstition and it was with difficulty that the ancient ceremonies to which men had been accustomed and which had been sanctified by the practice of the first reformers could be retained in divine service yet was this the time which Laud chose for the introduction of new ceremonies and observances Besides that these were sure to displease as innovations there lay in the opinion of the public another very forcible objection against them Laud and the other prelates who embraced his measures were generally well instructed in sacred antiquity and had adopted many of those religious sentiments which prevailed during the fourth and fifth centuries when the Christian church as is well known was already sunk into those superstitions which were afterwards continued and augmented by the policy of Rome The revival therefore of the ideas and practices of that age could not fail of giving the English faith and liturgy some resemblance to the Catholic superstition which the kingdom in general and the Puritans in particular held in the greatest horror and detestation Men also were apt to think that without some secret purpose such insignificant observances would not be imposed with such unrelenting zeal on the refractory nation and that Laud s scheme was to lead back the English by gradual steps to the religion of their ancestors They considered not that the very insignificancy of these ceremonies recommended them to the superstitious prelate and made them appear the more peculiarly sacred and religious as they could serve to no other purpose Nor was the resemblance to the Romish ritual any objection but rather a merit with Laud and his brethren who bore a much greater kindness to the mother church as they called her than to the sectaries and Presbyterians and frequently recommended her as a true Christian church an appellation which they refused or at least scrupled to give to the others So openly were these tenets espoused that not only the discontented Puritans believed the church of England to be relapsing fast into Romish superstition the court of Rome itself entertained hopes of regaining its authority in this island and in order to forward Laud s supposed good intentions an offer was twice made him in private of a cardinal s hat which he declined accepting His answer was as he says himself That something dwelt within him which would not suffer his compliance till Rome were other than it is May p twenty five Rushworth vol ii p one hundred ninety Welwood p sixty one Rushworth vol iii p thirteen twenty seven Whitlocke p ninety seven A court lady daughter of the earl of Devonshire having turned Catholic was asked by Laud the reason of her conversion Tis chiefly said she because I hate to travel in a crowd The meaning of this expression being demanded she replied I perceive your grace and many others are making haste to Rome and therefore in order to prevent my being crowded I have gone before you It must be confessed that though Laud deserved not the appellation of Papist the genius of his religion was though in a less degree the same with that of the Romish the same profound respect was exacted to the sacerdotal character the same submission required to the creeds and decrees of synods and councils the same pomp and ceremony was affected in worship and the same superstitious regard to days postures meats and vestments No wonder therefore that this prelate was every where among the Puritans regarded with horror as the forerunner of Antichrist As a specimen of the new ceremonies to which Laud sacrificed his own quiet and that of the nation it may not be amiss to relate those which he was accused of employing in the consecration of saint Catharine s church and which were the object of such general scandal and offence On the bishop s approach to the west door of the church a loud voice cried Open open ye everlasting doors that the king of glory may enter in Immediately the doors of the church flew open and the bishop entered Falling upon his knees with eyes elevated and arms expanded he uttered these words This place is holy the ground is holy in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost I pronounce it holy Going towards the chancel he several times took up from the floor some of the dust and threw it in the air When he approached with his attendants near to the communion table he bowed frequently towards it and on their return they went round the church repeating as they marched along some of the psalms and then said a form of prayer which concluded with these words We consecrate this church and separate it unto thee as holy ground not to be profaned any more to common uses After this the bishop standing near the communion table solemnly pronounced many imprecations upon such as should afterwards pollute that holy place by musters of soldiers or keeping in it profane law courts or carrying burdens through it On the conclusion of every curse he bowed towards the east and cried Let all the people say Amen The imprecations being all so piously finished there were poured out a number of blessings upon such as had any hand in framing and building that sacred and beautiful edifice and on such as had given or should hereafter give to it any chalices plate ornaments or utensils At every benediction he in like manner bowed towards the east and cried Let all the people say Amen The sermon followed after which the bishop consecrated and administered the sacrament in the following manner As he approached the communion table he made many lowly reverences and coming up to that part of the table where the bread and wine lay he bowed seven times After the reading of many prayers he approached the sacramental elements and gently lifted up the corner of the napkin in which the bread was placed When he beheld the bread he suddenly let fall the napkin flew back a step or two bowed three several times towards the bread then he drew nigh again opened the napkin and bowed as before Next he laid his hand on the cup which had a cover upon it and was filled with wine He let go the cup fell back and bowed thrice towards it He approached again and lifting op the cover peeped into the cup Seeing the wine he let fall the cover started back and bowed as before Then he received the sacrament and gave it to others And many prayers being said the solemnity of the consecration ended The walls and floor and roof of the fabric were then supposed to be sufficiently holy Orders were given and rigorously insisted on that the communion table should be removed from the middle of the area where it hitherto stood in all churches except in cathedrals It was placed at the east end railed in and denominated an altar as the clergyman who officiated received commonly the appellation of priest It is not easy to imagine the discontents excited by this innovation and the suspicions which it gave rise to Rushworth vol ii p seventy six seventy seven Welwood p two hundred seventy five Franklyn p three hundred eighty six Rushworth vol ii p two hundred seven Whitlocke p twenty four The kneeling at the altar and the using of copes a species of embroidered vestment in administering the sacrament were also known to be great objects of scandal as being Popish practices but the opposition rather increased than abated the zeal of the prelate for the introduction of these habits and ceremonies All kinds of ornament especially pictures were necessary for supporting that mechanical devotion which was purposed to be raised in this model of religion but as these had been so much employed by the church of Rome and had given rise to so much superstition or what the Puritans called idolatry it was impossible to introduce them into English churches without exciting general murmurs and complaints But Laud possessed of present authority persisted in his purpose and made several attempts towards acquiring these ornaments Some of the pictures introduced by him were also found upon inquiry to be the very same that might be met with in the mass book The crucifix too that eternal consolation of all pious Catholics and terror to all sound Protestants was not forgotten on this occasion It was much remarked that Sheffield the recorder of Salisbury was tried in the star chamber for having broken contrary to the bishop of Salisbury s express injunctions a painted window of saint Edmond s church in that city He boasted that he had destroyed these monuments of idolatry but for this effort of his zeal he was fined five hundred pounds removed from his office condemned to make a public acknowledgment and be bound to his good behavior Not only such of the clergy as neglected to observe every ceremony were suspended and deprived by the high commission court oaths were by many of the bishops imposed or the churchwardens and they were sworn to inform against any one who acted contrary to the ecclesiastical canons Such a measure though practised during the reign of Elizabeth gave much offence as resembling too nearly the practice of the Romish inquisition To show the greater alienation from the churches reformed after the Presbyterian model Laud advised that the discipline and worship of the church should be imposed on the English regiments and trading companies abroad All foreigners of the Dutch and Walloon congregations were commanded to attend the established church and indulgence was granted to none after the children of the first denizens v Rushworth vol ii p two

orders to withdraw himself from the communion of the Hugonots Even men of sense were apt to blame this conduct not only because it gave offence in England but because in foreign countries it lost the crown the advantage of being considered as the head and support of the reformation On pretence of pacifying disputes orders were issued from the council forbidding on both sides all preaching and printing with regard to the controverted points of predestination and free will But it was complained of and probably with reason that the impartiality was altogether confined to the orders and that the execution of them was only meant against the Calvinists In return for Charles s indulgence towards the church Laud and his followers took care to magnify on every occasion the regal authority and to treat with the utmost disdain or detestation all Puritanical pretensions to a free and independent constitution But while these prelates were so liberal in raising the crown at the expense of public liberty they made no scruple of encroaching themselves on the royal rights the most incontestable in order to exalt the hierarchy and procure to their own order dominion and independence All the doctrines which the Romish church had borrowed from some of the fathers and which freed the spiritual from subordination to the civil power were now adopted by the church of England and interwoven with her political and religious tenets A divine and apostolical charter was insisted on preferably to a legal and parliamentary one State Papers collected by the earl of Clarendon p three hundred thirty eight Whitlocke p twenty two The sacerdotal character was magnified as sacred and indefeasible all right to spiritual authority or even to private judgment in spiritual subjects was refused to profane laymen ecclesiastical courts were held by the bishops in their own name without any notice taken of the king s authority and Charles though extremely jealous of every claim in popular assemblies seemed rather to encourage than repress those encroachments of his clergy Having felt many sensible inconveniencies from the independent spirit of parliaments he attached himself entirely to those who professed a devoted obedience to his crown and person nor did he foresee that the ecclesiastical power which he exalted not admitting of any precise boundary might in time become more dangerous to public peace and no less fatal to royal prerogative than the other So early as the coronation Laud was the person according to general opinion that introduced a novelty which though overlooked by Charles made a deep impression on many of the bystanders After the usual ceremonies these words were recited to the king Stand and hold fast from henceforth the place to which you have been heir by the succession of your forefathers being now delivered to you by the authority of Almighty God and by the hands of us and all the bishops and servants of God And as you see the clergy to come nearer the altar than others so remember that in all places convenient you give them greater honor that the Mediator of God and man may establish you on the kingly throne to be a mediator betwixt the clergy and the laity and that you may reign forever with Jesus Christ the King of kings and Lord of lords The principles which exalted prerogative were not entertained by the king merely as soft and agreeable to his royal ears they were also put in practice during the time that he ruled without parliaments Though frugal and regular in his expense he wanted money for the support of government and he levied it either by the revival of obsolete laws or by violations some more open some more disguised of the privileges of the nation Though humane and gentle in his temper he gave way to a few severities in the star chamber and high commission which seemed necessary in order to support the present mode of administration and repress the rising spirit of liberty throughout the kingdom Under these two heads may be reduced all the remarkable transactions of this reign during some years for in peaceable and prosperous times where a neutrality in foreign affairs is observed scarcely any thing is remarkable but what is in some degree blamed or blamable And lest the hope of relief or protection from parliament might encourage opposition Charles issued a proclamation in which he declared That whereas for several ill ends the calling again of a parliament is divulged though his majesty has shown by frequent meetings with his people his love to the use of parliaments yet the late abuse having for the present driven him unwillingly out of that course he will account it presumption for anyone to prescribe to him any time for the calling of that assembly Franklyn p one hundred fourteen Rushworth vol i p two hundred one Parl Hist vol viii p three hundred eighty nine Rush vol ii p three This was generally construed as a declaration that during this reign no more parliaments were intended to be summoned And every measure of the king s confirmed a suspicion so disagreeable to the generality of the people Tonnage and poundage continued to be levied by the royal authority alone The former additional impositions were still exacted Even new impositions were laid on several kinds of merchandise The custom house officers received orders from the council to enter into any house warehouse or cellar to search any trunk or chest and to break any bulk whatever in default of the payment of customs In order to exercise the militia and to keep them in good order each county by an edict of the council was assessed in a certain sum for maintaining a muster master appointed for that service Compositions were openly made with recusants and the Popish religion became a regular part of the revenue This was all the persecution which it underwent during the reign of Charles v A commission was granted for compounding with such as were possessed of crown lands upon defective titles and on this pretence some money was exacted from the people v There was a law of Edward II v that whoever was possessed of twenty pounds a year in land should be obliged when summoned to appear and to receive the order of knighthood Twenty pounds at that time partly by the change of denomination partly by that in the value of money were equivalent to two hundred in the seventeenth century and it seemed just that the king should not strictly insist on the letter of the law and oblige people of so small revenue to accept of that expensive honor Edward VI v and Queen Elizabeth v who had both of them made use of this expedient for raising money had summoned only those who were possessed of forty pounds a year and upwards to receive knighthood or compound for their neglect and

Commissioners were appointed for fixing the rates of composition and instructions were given to these commissioners not to accept of a less sum than would have been due by the party upon a tax of three subsidies and a half Nothing proves more plainly how ill disposed the people were to the measures of the crown than to observe that they loudly complained of an expedient founded on positive statute and warranted by such recent precedents The law was pretended to be obsolete though only one reign had intervened since the last execution of it Barnard lecturer of saint Sepulchre s London used this expression in his prayer before sermon Lord open the eyes of the queen s majesty that she may see Jesus Christ whom she has pierced with her infidelity superstition and idolatry He was questioned in the high commission court for this insult on the queen but upon his submission dismissed Leighton who had written libels against the king the queen the bishops and the whole administration was condemned by a very severe if not a cruel sentence but the execution of it was suspended for some time in expectation of his submission All the severities indeed of this reign were exercised against those who triumphed in their sufferings who courted persecution and braved authority and on that account their punishment may be deemed the more just but the less prudent To have neglected them entirely had it been consistent with order and public safety had been the wisest measure that could have been embraced as perhaps it had been the most severe punishment that could have been inflicted on these zealots In order to gratify the clergy with a magnificent fabric subscriptions were set on foot for repairing and rebuilding saint Paul s and the king by his countenance and example encouraged this laudable undertaking By order of the privy council saint Gregory s church was removed as an impediment to the project of extending and beautifying the cathedral Some houses and shops likewise were pulled down and compensation was made to the owners v Rush vol ii p seventy seventy one seventy two May p sixteen Rush vol ii p thirty two Kennets Complete Hist vol iii p sixty Whitlocke p fifteen Whitlocke p seventeen v Rush vol ii p eighty eight eighty nine ninety two hundred seven four hundred sixty two seven hundred eighteen As there was no immediate prospect of assembling a parliament such acts of power in the king became necessary and in no former age would the people have entertained any scruple with regard to them It must be remarked that the Puritans were extremely averse to the raising of this ornament to the capital It savored as they pretended of Popish superstition A stamp duty was imposed on cards a new tax which of itself was liable to no objection but appeared of dangerous consequence when considered as arbitrary and illegal Monopolies were revived an oppressive method of levying money being unlimited as well as destructive of industry The last parliament of James which abolished monopolies had left an equitable exception in favor of new inventions and on pretence of these and of erecting new companies and corporations was this grievance now renewed The manufacture of soap was given to a company who paid a sum for their patent Leather salt and many other commodities even down to linen rags were likewise put under restrictions It is affirmed by Clarendon that so little benefit was reaped from these projects that of two hundred thousand pounds thereby levied on the people scarcely one thousand five hundred came into the king s coffers Though we ought not to suspect the noble historian of exaggerations to the disadvantage of Charles s measures this fact it must be owned appears somewhat incredible The same author adds that the king s intention was to teach his subjects how unthrifty a thing it was to refuse reasonable supplies to the crown an imprudent project to offend a whole nation under the view of punishment and to hope by acts of violence to break their refractory spirits without being possessed of any force to prevent resistance The council of York had been first erected after a rebellion by a patent from Henry VIII without any authority of parliament and this exercise cf power like many others was indulged to that arbitrary monarch This council had long acted chiefly as a criminal court but besides some innovations introduced by James Charles thought proper some time after Wentworth was made president to extend its powers and to give it a large civil jurisdiction and that in some respects discretionary Rush vol ii p one hundred three Rush vol ii p one hundred thirty six one hundred forty two one hundred eighty nine two hundred fifty two Rush vol ii p one hundred fifty eight one hundred fifty nine et cetera Franklyn p four hundred twelve It is not improbable that the king s intention was only to prevent inconveniencies which arose from the bringing of every cause from the most distant parts of the kingdom into Westminster Hall but the consequence in the mean time of this measure was the putting of all the northern counties out of the protection of ordinary law and subjecting them to an authority somewhat arbitrary Some irregular acts of that council were this year complained of The court of star chamber extended its authority and it was matter of complaint that it encroached upon the jurisdiction of the other courts imposing heavy fines and inflicting severe punishment beyond the usual course of justice Sir David Foulis was fined five thousand pounds chiefly because he had dissuaded a friend from compounding with the commissioners of knighthood Rush vol ii p two hundred two two hundred three Rush vol ii p two hundred fifteen two hundred sixteen et cetera Prynne a barrister of Lincoln s Inn had written an enormous quarto of a thousand pages which he called Histrio Mastyx Its professed purpose was to decry stage plays comedies interludes music dancing but the author likewise took occasion to declaim against hunting public festivals Christmas keeping bonfires and may poles His zeal against all these levities he says was first moved by observing that plays sold better than the choicest sermons and that they were frequently printed on finer paper than the Bible itself Besides that the players were often Papists and desperately wicked the play houses he affirms are Satan s chapels the play haunters little better than incarnate devils and so many steps in a dance so many paces to hell The chief crime of Nero he represents to have been his frequenting and acting of plays and those who nobly conspired his death were principally moved to it as he affirms by their indignation at that enormity The rest of his thousand pages is of a like strain He had obtained a license from Archbishop Abbot s chaplain yet was he indicted in the star chamber as a libeller It was thought somewhat hard that general invectives against plays should be interpreted into satires against the king and queen merely because they frequented these amusements and because the queen sometimes acted a part in pastorals and interludes which were represented at court The author it must be owned had in plainer terms blamed the hierarchy the ceremonies the innovations in religious worship and the new superstitions introduced by Laud and this probably together with the obstinacy and petulance of his behavior before the star chamber was the reason why his sentence was so severe He was condemned to be put from the bar to stand on the pillory in two places Westminster and Cheapside to lose both his ears one in each place to pay five thousand pounds fine to the king and to be imprisoned during life This same Prynne was a great hero among the Puritans and it was chiefly with a view of mortifying that sect that though of an honorable profession he was condemned by the star chamber to so ignominious a punishment The thorough paced Puritans were distinguishable by the sourness and austerity of their manners and by their aversion to all pleasure and society To inspire them with better humor was certainly both for their own sake and that of the public a laudable intention in the court but whether pillories fines and prisons were proper expedients for that purpose may admit of some question Another expedient which the king tried in order to infuse cheerfulness into the national devotion was not much more successful He renewed his father s edict for allowing sports and recreations on Sunday to such as attended public worship and he ordered his proclamation for that purpose to be publicly read by the clergy after divine service Those who were Puritanically affected refused obedience and were punished by suspension or deprivation The differences between the sects were before sufficiently great nor was it necessary to widen them further by these inventions Some encouragement and protection which the king and the bishops gave to

employed a great number of pages to persuade men to affect the name of Puritan as if Christ had been a Puritan and so he saith in his index This year Charles made a journey to Scotland attended by the court in order to hold a parliament there and to pass through the ceremony of his coronation The nobility and gentry of both kingdoms rivalled each other in expressing all duty and respect to the king and in showing mutual friendship and regard to each other No one could have suspected from exterior appearances that such dreadful scenes were approaching One chief article of business for it deserves the name which the king transacted in this parliament was besides obtaining some supply to procure authority for ordering the habits of clergymen The act did not pass without opposition and difficulty The dreadful surplice was before men s eyes and they apprehended with some reason that under sanction of this law it would soon be introduced among them Though the king believed that his prerogative entitled him to a power in general of directing whatever belonged to the exterior government of the church this was deemed a matter of too great importance to be ordered without the sanction of a particular statute Immediately after the king s return to England he heard of Archbishop Abbot s death and without delay he conferred that dignity on his favorite Laud who by this accession of authority was now enabled to maintain ecclesiastical discipline with greater rigor and to aggravate the general discontent of the nation Laud obtained the bishopric of London for his friend Juxon and about a year after the death of Sir Richard Weston created earl of Portland had interest enough to engage the king to make that prelate high treasurer Juxon was a person of great integrity mildness and humanity and endued with a good understanding Yet did this last promotion give general offence His birth and character were deemed too obscure for a man raised to one of the highest offices of the crown And the clergy it was thought were already too much elated by former instances of the king s attachment to them and needed not this further encouragement to assume dominion over the laity The Puritans likewise were much dissatisfied with Juxon notwithstanding his eminent virtues because he was a lover of profane field sports and hunting Bushworth vol ii p one hundred eighty three Whitlocke p twenty three Clarendon vol i p ninety nine Clarendon vol i p ninety seven May p twenty three Ship money was now introduced The first writs of this kind had been directed to seaport towns only but ship money was at this time levied on the whole kingdom and each county was rated at a particular sum which was after wards assessed upon individuals The amount of the whole tax was very moderate little exceeding two hundred thousand pounds it was levied upon the people with equality the money was entirely expended on the navy to the great honor and advantage of the kingdom as England had no military force while all the other powers of Europe were strongly armed a fleet seemed absolutely necessary for her security and it was obvious that a navy must be built and equipped at leisure during peace nor could it possibly be fitted out on a sudden emergence when the danger became urgent yet all these considerations could not reconcile the people to the imposition It was entirely arbitrary by the same right any other tax might be imposed and men thought a powerful fleet though very desirable both for the credit and safety of the kingdom but an unequal recompense for their liberties which they apprehended were thus sacrificed to the obtaining of it England it must be owned was in this respect unhappy in its present situation that the king had entertained a very different idea of the constitution from that which began in general to prevail among his subjects He did not regard national privileges as so sacred and inviolable that nothing but the most extreme necessity could justify an infringement of them He considered himself as the supreme magistrate to whose care Heaven by his birthright had committed his people whose duty it was to provide for their security and happiness and who was vested with ample discretionary powers for that salutary purpose If the observance of ancient laws and customs was consistent with the present convenience of government he thought himself obliged to comply with that rule as the easiest the safest and what procured the most prompt and willing obedience But when a change of circumstances especially if derived from the obstinacy of the people required a new plan of administration national privileges he thought must yield to supreme power nor could any order of the state oppose any right to the will of the sovereign directed to the good of the public Rush vol ii p two hundred fifty seven two hundred fifty eight et cetera Rush vol iv p five hundred thirty five five hundred forty two That these principles of government were derived from the uniform tenor of the English laws it would be rash to affirm The fluctuating nature of the constitution the impatient humor of the people and the variety of events had no doubt in different ages produced exceptions and contradictions These observations alone may be established on both sides that the appearances were sufficiently strong in favor of the king to apologize for his following such maxims and that public liberty must be so precarious under this exorbitant prerogative as to render an opposition not only excusable but laudable in the people four Some laws had been enacted during the reign of Henry VII against depopulation or the converting of arable lands into pasture By a decree of the star chamber Sir Anthony Roper was fined four thousand pounds for an offence of that nature This severe sentence was intended to terrify others into composition and above thirty thousand pounds were levied by that expedient Like compositions or in default of them heavy fines were required for encroachments on the king s forests whose bounds by decrees deemed arbitrary were extended much beyond what was usual The bounds of one forest that of Rockingham were increased from six miles to sixty v The same refractory humor which made the people refuse to the king voluntary supplies disposed them with better reason to murmur against these irregular methods of taxation Morley was fined ten thousand pounds for reviling challenging and striking in the court of Whitehall Sir George Theobald one of the king s servants v This fine was thought exorbitant but whether it

set on the pillory at Westminster and in three other towns in England Robins who had been an accomplice in the guilt was condemned by a sentence equally severe Such events are rather to be considered as rare and detached incidents collected by the severe scrutiny of historians than as proofs of the prevailing genius of the king s administration which seems to have been more gentle and equitable than that of most of his predecessors there were on the whole only five or six such instances of rigor during the course of fifteen years which elapsed before the meeting of the long parliament And it is also certain that scandal against the great though seldom prosecuted at present is however in the eye of the law a great crime and subjects the offender to very heavy penalties There are other instances of the high respect paid to the nobility and to the great in that age when the powers of monarchy though disputed still maintained themselves in their pristine vigor Clarendon tells us a pleasant incident to this purpose a waterman belonging to a man of quality having a squabble with a citizen about his fare showed his badge the crest of his master which happened to be a swan and thence insisted on better treatment from the citizen But the other replied carelessly that he did not trouble his head about that goose For this offence he was summoned before the marshal s court was fined as having opprobriously defamed the nobleman s crest by calling the swan a goose and was in effect reduced to beggary Sir Richard Granville had thought himself ill used by the earl of Suffolk in a lawsuit and he was accused before the star chamber of having said of that nobleman that he was a base lord The evidence against him was somewhat lame yet for this slight offence insufficiently proved he was condemned to pay a fine of eight thousand pounds one half to the earl the other to the king Bush vol u p two hundred sixty nine Life of Clarendon vol i p seventy two Lord Lansdown p five

him in the same manner or words to that effect Sir George was summoned before the Star chamber and fined ten thousand pounds So fine a thing was it in those days to be a lord a natural reflection of Lord Lansdown s in relating this incident The people in vindicating their liberties from the authority of the crown threw off also the yoke of the nobility It is proper to remark that this last incident happened early in the reign of James The present practice of the star chamber was far from being an innovation though the present dispositions of the people made them repine more at this servitude Charles had imitated the example of Elizabeth and James and had issued proclamations forbidding the landed gentlemen and the nobility to live idly in London and ordering them to retire to their country seats For disobedience to this edict many were indicted by the attorney general and were fined in the star chamber This occasioned discontents and the sentences were complained of as illegal But if proclamations had authority of which nobody pretended to doubt must they not be put in execution In no instance I must confess does it more evidently appear what confused and uncertain ideas were during that age entertained concerning the English constitution Ray having exported fuller s earth contrary to the king s proclamation was besides the pillory condemned in the star chamber to a fine of two thousand pounds Like fines were levied on Terry Eman and others for disobeying a proclamation which forbade the exportation of gold v In order to account for the subsequent convulsions even these incidents are not to be overlooked as frivolous or contemptible Such severities were afterwards magnified into the greatest enormities There remains a proclamation of this year prohibiting hackney coaches from standing in the street v We are told that there were not above twenty coaches of that kind in London There are at present near eight hundred Lord Lansdown p five hundred fifteen This story is told differently in Hobart s Reports p one hundred twenty It there appears that Markham was fined only five hundred pounds and very deservedly for he gave the lie and

that England had ever known was equipped under the earl of Northumberland who had orders to attack the herring busses of the Dutch which fished in what were called the British seas The Dutch were content to pay thirty thousand pounds for a license during this year They openly denied however the claim of dominion in the seas beyond the friths bays and shores and it may be questioned whether the laws of nations warrant any further pretensions This year the king sent a squadron against Sallee and with the assistance of the emperor of Morocco destroyed that receptacle of pirates by whom the English commerce and even the English coasts had long been infested Burton a divine and Bastwick a physician were tried in the star chamber for seditious and schismatical libels and were condemned to the same punishment that had been inflicted on Prynne Prynne himself was tried for a new offence and together with another fine of five thousand pounds was condemned to lose what remained of his ears Besides that these writers had attacked with great severity and even an intemperate zeal the ceremonies rites and government of the church the very answers which they gave in to the court were so full of contumacy and of invectives against the prelates that no lawyer could be prevailed on to sign them The rigors however which they underwent being so unworthy men of their profession gave general offence and the patience or rather alacrity with which they suffered increased still further the indignation of the public Rush vol ii p three hundred eighty one three hundred eighty two et cetera State Trials vol v p sixty six State Trials vol v p eighty The severity of the star chamber which was generally ascribed to Laud s passionate disposition was perhaps in itself somewhat blamable but will naturally to us appear enormous who enjoy in the utmost latitude that liberty of the press which is esteemed so necessary in every monarchy confined by strict legal limitations But as these limitations were not regularly fixed during the age of Charles nor at any time before so was this liberty totally unknown and was generally deemed as well as religious toleration incompatible with all good government No age or nation among the moderns had ever set an example of such an indulgence and it seems unreasonable to judge of the measures embraced during one period by the maxims which prevail in another Burton in his book where he complained of innovations mentioned among others that a certain Wednesday had been appointed for a fast and that the fast was ordered to be celebrated without any sermons The intention as he pretended of that novelty was by the example of a fast without sermons to suppress all the Wednesday s lectures in London It is observable that the church of Rome and that of England being both of them lovers of form and ceremony and order are more friends to prayer than preaching while the Puritanical sectaries who find that the latter method of address being directed to a numerous audience present and visible is more inflaming and animating have always regarded it as the chief part of divine service Such circumstances though minute it may not be improper to transmit to posterity and those who are curious of tracing the history of the human mind may remark how far its several singularities coincide in different ages Certain zealots had erected themselves into a society for buying in of impropriations and transferring them to the church and great sums of money had been bequeathed to the society for these purposes But it was soon observed that the only use which they made of their funds was to establish lecturers in all the considerable churches men who without being subjected to Episcopal authority employed themselves entirely in preaching and spreading the fire of Puritanism Laud took care by a decree which was passed in the court of exchequer and which was much complained of to abolish this society and to stop their progress It was however still observed that throughout England the lecturers were all of them Puritanically affected and from them the clergymen who contented themselves with reading prayers and homilies to the people commonly received the reproachful appellation of dumb dogs State Trials vol v p seventy four Franklyn p eight hundred thirty nine Rush vol ii p one hundred fifty one hundred fifty one Whitlocke p fifteen History of the Life Sufferings of Laud p two hundred eleven two hundred twelve The Puritans restrained in England shipped themselves off for America and laid there the foundations of a government which possessed all the liberty both civil and religious of which they found themselves bereaved in their native country But their enemies unwilling that they should any where enjoy ease and contentment and dreading perhaps the dangerous consequences of so disaffected a colony prevailed on the king to issue a proclamation debarring these devotees access even into those inhospitable deserts Eight ships lying in the Thames and ready to sail were detained by order of the council and in these were embarked Sir Arthur Hazelrig John Hambden John Pym and Oliver Cromwell who had resolved forever to abandon their native country and fly to the other extremity of the globe where they might enjoy lectures and discourses of any length or form which pleased them The king had afterwards full leisure to repent this exercise of his authority The bishop of Norwich by rigorously insisting on uniformity had banished many industrious tradesmen from that city and chased them into Holland The Dutch began to be more intent on commerce than on orthodoxy and thought that the knowledge of useful arts and obedience to the laws formed a good citizen though attended with errors in subjects where it is not allowable for human nature to expect any positive truth or certainty Complaints about this time were made that the petition of right was in some instances violated and that upon a commitment by the king and council bail or releasement had been refused to Jennings Pargiter and Danvers Williams bishop of Lincoln a man of spirit and learning a popular prelate and who had been lord keeper was fined ten thousand pounds by the star chamber committed to the Tower during the king s pleasure and suspended from his office This severe sentence was founded on frivolous pretences and was more ascribed to Laud s vengeance than to any guilt of the bishop v Laud however had owed his first promotion to the good offices of that prelate with King James But so implacable was the haughty primate that he raised up a new prosecution against Williams on the strangest pretence imaginable Rush vol ii p four hundred nine four hundred eighteen Mather s History of New England book i Dugdale Bates Hutchinson s History of Massachusetts Bay vol i p forty two This last quoted author puts the fact beyond controversy And it is a curious fact as well with regard to the characters

enlightened Readers May p eighty two Rush vol ii p four hundred fourteen v Rush vol ii p four hundred sixteen et cetera In order to levy the fine above mentioned some officers had been sent to seize all the furniture and books of his episcopal palace of Lincoln and in rummaging the house they found in a corner some neglected letters which had been thrown by as useless These letters were written by one Osbaldistone a schoolmaster and were directed to Williams Mention was there made of a little great man and in another passage the same person was denominated a little urchin By inferences and constructions these epithets were applied to Laud and on no better foundation was Williams tried anew as having received scandalous letters and not discovering that private correspondence For this offence another fine of eight thousand pounds was levied on him Osbaldistone was likewise brought to trial and condemned to pay a fine of five thousand pounds and to have his ears nailed to the pillory before his own school He saved himself by flight and left a note in his study wherein he said that he was gone beyond Canterbury These prosecutions of Williams seem to have been the most iniquitous measure pursued by the court during the time that the use of parliaments was suspended Williams had been indebted for all his fortune to the favor of James but having quarrelled first with Buckingham then with Laud he threw himself into the country party and with great firmness and vigor opposed all the measures of the king A creature of the court to become its obstinate enemy a bishop to countenance Puritans these circumstances excited indignation and engaged the ministers in those severe measures Not to mention what some writers relate that before the sentence was pronounced against him Williams was offered a pardon upon his submission which he refused to make the court was apt to think that so refractory a spirit must by any expedient be broken and subdued In a former trial which Williams underwent for these were not the first there was mentioned in court a story which as it discovers the genius of parties may be worth relating Sir John Lambe urging him to prosecute the Puritans the prelate asked what sort of people these same Puritans were Sir John replied that to the world they seemed to be such as would not swear whore or be drunk out they would lie cozen and deceive that they would frequently hear two sermons a day and repeat them too and that some times they would fast all day long This character must be conceived to be satirical yet it may be allowed that that sect was more averse to such irregularities as proceed from the excess of gayety and pleasure than to those enormities which are the most destructive of society The former were opposite to the very genius and spirit of their religion the latter were only a transgression of its precepts and it was not difficult for a gloomy enthusiast to convince himself that a strict observance of the one would atone for any violation of the other Rush voL ii p eight hundred three et cetera Whittocke p twenty five Rush vol ii p four hundred sixteen In sixteen thirty two the treasurer Portland had insisted with the vintners that they should submit to a tax of a penny a quart upon all the wine which they retailed but they rejected the demand In order to punish them a decree suddenly without much inquiry or examination passed in the star chamber prohibiting them to sell or dress victuals in their houses Two years after they were questioned for the breach of this decree and in order to avoid punishment they agreed to lend the king six thousand pounds Being threatened during the subsequent years with fines and prosecutions they at last compounded the matter and submitted to pay half of that duty which was at first demanded of them It required little foresight to perceive that the king s right of issuing proclamations must if prosecuted draw on a power of taxation Rash vol ii p one hundred ninety seven Rush vol ii p forty five Lilburne was accused before the star chamber of publishing and dispersing seditious pamphlets He was ordered to be examined but refused to take the oath usual in that court that he would answer interrogatories even though they might lead him to accuse himself For this contempt as it was interpreted he was condemned to be whipped pilloried and imprisoned While he was whipped at the cart and stood on the pillory he harangued the populace and declaimed violently against the tyranny of bishops From his pockets also he scattered pamphlets said to be seditious because they attacked the hierarchy The star chamber which was sitting at that very time ordered him immediately to be gagged He ceased not however though both gagged and pilloried to stamp with his foot and gesticulate in order to show the people that if he had it in his power he would still harangue them This behavior gave fresh provocation to the star chamber and they condemned him to be imprisoned in a dungeon and to be loaded with irons It was found difficult to break the spirits of men who placed both their honor and their conscience in suffering The jealousy of the church appeared in another instance less tragical Archy the king s fool who by his office had the privilege of jesting on his master and the whole court happened unluckily to try his wit upon Laud who was too sacred a person to be played with News having arrived from Scotland of the first commotions excited by the liturgy Archy seeing the primate pass by called to him Who s fool now my lord For this offence Archy was ordered by sentence of the council to have his coat pulled over his head and to be dismissed the king s service Here is another instance of that rigorous subjection in which all men were held by Laud Some young gentlemen of Lincoln s Inn heated by their cups having drunk confusion to the archbishop were at his instigation cited before the star chamber They applied to the earl of Dorset for protection Who bears witness against you said Dorset One of the drawers they said Where did he stand when you were supposed to drink this health subjoined the earl He was at the door they replied going out of the room Tush cried he the drawer must be mistaken you drank confusion to the archbishop of Canterbury s enemies and the fellow was gone before you pronounced the last word This hint supplied the young gentlemen with a new method of defence and being advised by Dorset to behave with great humility and great submission to the primate the modesty of their carriage the ingenuity of their apology with the patronage of that noble lord saved them from any severer punishment than a reproof and admonition with which they were dismissed Rush vol ii p four hundred sixty five four hundred sixty six four hundred sixty seven Rush voL ii p four hundred seventy Welwood p two hundred seventy eight Rush vol iii p one hundred eighty This year John Hambden acquired by his spirit and courage universal popularity throughout the nation and has merited great renown with posterity for the bold stand which he made in defence of the laws and liberties of his country After the imposing of ship money Charles in order to discourage all opposition had proposed this question to the judges Whether in a case of necessity for the defence of the kingdom he might not impose this taxation and whether he were not sole judge of the necessity These guardians of law and liberty replied with great complaisance that in a case of necessity he might impose that taxation and that he was sole judge of the necessity Hambden had been rated at twenty shillings for an estate which he possessed in the county of Buckingham yet notwithstanding this declared opinion of the judges notwithstanding the great power and sometimes rigorous maxims of the crown notwithstanding the small prospect of relief from parliament he resolved rather than tamely submit to so illegal an imposition to stand a legal prosecution and expose himself to all the indignation of the court The case was argued during twelve days in the exchequer chamber before all the judges of England and the nation regarded with the utmost anxiety every circumstance of this celebrated trial The event was easily foreseen but the principles and reasonings and behavior of the parties engaged in the trial were much canvassed and inquired into and nothing could equal the favor paid to the one side except the hatred which attended the other Rush vol ii p three hundred fifty five Whitlocke p twenty four It was urged by Hambden s counsel and by his partisans in the nation that the plea of necessity was in vain introduced into a trial of law since it was the nature of necessity to abolish all law and by irresistible violence to dissolve all the weaker and more artificial ties of human society Not only the prince in cases of extreme distress is exempted from the ordinary rules of administration all orders of men are then levelled and any individual may consult the public safety by any expedient which his situation enables him to employ But to produce so violent an effect and so hazardous to every community an ordinary danger or difficulty is not sufficient much less a necessity which is merely fictitious and pretended Where the peril is urgent and extreme it will be palpable to every member of the society and though all ancient rules of government are in that case abrogated men will readily of themselves submit to that irregular authority which is exerted for their preservation But what is there in common between such suppositions and the present condition of the nation England enjoys a profound peace with al her neighbors and what is more all her neighbors are engaged in furious and bloody wars among themselves and by their mutual enmities further insure their tranquillity The very writs themselves which are issued for the levying of ship money contradict the supposition of necessity and pretend only that the seas are infested with pirates a slight and temporary inconvenience which may well await a legal supply from parliament The writs likewise allow several months for equipping the ships which proves a very calm and deliberate species of necessity and one that admits of delay much beyond the forty days requisite for summoning that assembly It is strange too that an extreme necessity which is always apparent and usually comes to a sudden crisis should now have continued without interruption for near four years and should have remained during so long a time invisible to the whole kingdom And as to the pretension that the king is sole judge of the necessity what is this but to subject all the privileges of the nation to his arbitrary will and pleasure To expect that the public will be convinced by such reasoning must aggravate the general indignation by adding to violence against men s persons and their property so cruel a mockery of their understanding In vain are precedents of ancient writs produced these writs when examined are only found to require the seaports sometimes at their own charge sometimes at the charge of the counties to send their ships for the defence of the nation Even the prerogative which empowered the crown to issue such writs is abolished and its exercise almost entirely discontinued from the time of Edward III and all the authority which remained or was afterwards exercised was to press ships into the public service to be paid for by the public State Trials vol v p two hundred forty five two hundred fifty five How wide are these precedents from a power of obliging the people at their own charge to build new ships to victual and pay them for the public nay to furnish money to the crown for that purpose What security either against the further extension of this claim or against diverting to other purposes the public money so levied The plea of necessity would warrant any other taxation as well as that of ship money wherever any difficulty shall occur the administration instead of endeavoring to elude or overcome it by gentle and prudent measures will instantly represent it as a reason for infringing all ancient laws and institutions and if such maxims and such practices prevail what has become of national liberty What authority is left to the Great Charter to the statutes and to the very petition of right which in the present reign had been so solemnly enacted by the concurrence of the whole legislature The defenceless condition of the kingdom while unprovided with a navy the inability of the king from his established revenues with the utmost care and frugality to equip and maintain one the impossibility of obtaining on reasonable terms any voluntary supply from parliament all these are reasons of state not topics of law If these reasons appear to the king so urgent as to dispense with the legal rules of government let him enforce his edicts by his court of star chamber the proper instrument of irregular and absolute power not prostitute the character of his judges by a decree which is not and cannot possibly be legal By this means the boundaries at least will be kept more distinct between ordinary law and extraordinary exertions of prerogative and men will know that the national constitution is only suspended during a present and difficult emergence but has not under gone a total and fundamental alteration Notwithstanding these reasons the prejudiced judges four excepted gave sentence in favor of the crown Hambden however obtained by the trial the end for which he had so generously sacrificed his safety and his quiet the people were roused from their lethargy and became sensible of the danger to which their liberties were exposed See State Trials article Ship Money which contains the speeches of four judges in favor of Hambden These national questions were canvassed in every company and the more they were examined the more evidently did it appear to many that liberty was totally subverted and an unusual and arbitrary authority exercised over the kingdom Slavish principles they said concur with illegal practices ecclesiastical tyranny gives aid to civil usurpation iniquitous taxes are supported by arbitrary punishments and all the privileges of the nation transmitted through so many ages secured by so many laws and purchased by the blood of so many heroes and patriots now lie prostrate at the feet of the monarch What though public peace and national industry increased the commerce and opulence of the kingdom This advantage was temporary and due alone not to any encouragement given by the crown but to the spirit of the English the remains of their ancient freedom What though the personal character of the king amidst all his misguided counsels might merit indulgence or even praise He was but one man and the privileges of the people the inheritance of millions were too valuable to be sacrificed to his prejudices and mistakes Such or more severe were the sentiments promoted by a great party in the nation no excuse on the king s part or alleviation how reasonable soever could be hearkened to or admitted and to redress these grievances a parliament was impatiently longed for or any other incident however calamitous that might secure the people against these oppressions which they felt or the greater ills which they apprehended from the combined encroachments of church and state CHAPTER LIII CHARLES I The grievances under which the English labored when considered in themselves without regard to the constitution scarcely deserve the name nor were they either burdensome on the people s properties or anywise shocking to the natural humanity of mankind Even the imposition of ship money independent of the consequences was a great and evident advantage to the public by the judicious use which the king made of the money levied by that expedient And though it was justly apprehended that such precedents if patiently submitted to would end in a total disuse of parliaments and in the establishment of arbitrary authority Charles dreaded no opposition from the people who are not commonly much affected with consequences and require some striking motive to engage them in a resistance of established government All ecclesiastical affairs were settled by law and uninterrupted precedent and the church was become a considerable barrier to the power both legal and illegal of the crown Peace too industry commerce opulence nay even justice and lenity of administration notwithstanding some very few exceptions all these were enjoyed by the people and every other blessing of government except liberty or rather the present exercise of liberty and its proper security It seemed probable therefore that affairs might long have continued on the same footing in England had it not been for the neighborhood of Scotland a country more turbulent and less disposed to submission and obedience It was thence the commotions first arose and is therefore time for us to return thither and to give an account of the state of affairs in that kingdom Clarendon p seventy four seventy five May p eighteen Warwick p sixty two Though the pacific and not unskilful government of James and the great authority which he had acquired had much allayed the feuds among the great families and had established law and order throughout the kingdom the Scottish nobility were still possessed of the chief power and influence over the people Their property was extensive their hereditary jurisdictions and the feudal tenures increased their authority and the attachment of the gentry to the heads of families established a kind of voluntary servitude under the chieftains Besides that long absence had much loosened the King s connections with the nobility who resided chiefly at their country seats they were in general at this time though from slight causes much disgusted with the court Charles from the natural piety or superstition of his temper was extremely attached to the ecclesiastics and as it is natural for men to persuade themselves that their interest coincides with their inclination he had established it as a fixed maxim of policy to increase the power and authority of that order The prelates he thought established regularity and discipline among the clergy the clergy inculcated obedience and loyalty among the people and as that rank of men had no separate authority and no dependence but on the crown the royal power it would seem might with the greater safety be intrusted in their hands Many of the prelates therefore were raised to the chief dignities of the state Spotswood archbishop of saint Andrews was created chancellor nine of the bishops were privy councillors the bishop of Ross aspired to the office of treasurer some of the prelates possessed places in the exchequer and it was even endeavored to revive the first institution of the college of justice and to share equally between the clergy and laity the whole judicial authority Rush vol ii p three hundred eighty six May p twenty nine Guthry s Memoirs p fourteen Burnet s Mem p twenty nine thirty These advantages possessed by the church and which the bishops did not always enjoy with suitable modesty disgusted the haughty nobility who deeming themselves much superior in rank and quality to this new order of men were displeased to find themselves inferior in power and influence Interest joined itself to ambition and begat a jealousy lest the episcopal sees which at the reformation had been pillaged by the nobles should again be enriched at the expense of that order By a most useful and beneficial law the impropriations had already been ravished from the great men competent salaries had been assigned to the impoverished clergy from the tithes of each parish and what remained the proprietor of the land was empowered to purchase at a low valuation The king likewise warranted by ancient law and practice had declared for a general resumption of all crown lands alienated by his predecessors and though he took no step towards the execution of this project the very pretension to such power had excited jealousy and discontent Notwithstanding the tender regard which Charles bore to the whole church he had been able in Scotland to acquire only the affection of the superior rank among the clergy The ministers in general equalled if not exceeded the nobility in their prejudices against the court against the prelates and against episcopal authority Though the establishment of the hierarchy might seem advantageous to the inferior clergy both as it erected dignities to which all of them might aspire and as it bestowed a lustre on the whole body and allured men of family into it these views had no influence on the Scottish ecclesiastics In the present disposition of men s minds there was another circumstance which drew consideration and counterbalanced power and riches the usual foundations of distinction among men and that was the fervor of piety and the rhetoric however barbarous of religious lectures and discourses Checked by the prelates in the license of preaching the clergy regarded episcopal jurisdiction both as a tyranny and a usurpation and maintained a parity among ecclesiastics to be a divine privilege which no human law could alter or infringe While such ideas prevailed the most moderate exercise of authority would have given disgust much more that extensive power which the king s indulgence encouraged the prelates to assume The jurisdiction of presbyteries synods and other democratical courts was in a manner abolished by the bishops and the general assembly itself had not been summoned for several years A new oath was arbitrarily imposed on intrants by which they swore to observe the articles of Perth and submit to the liturgy and canons And in a word the whole system of church government during a course of thirty years had been changed by means of the innovations introduced by James and Charles King s Declaration p seven Franklyn p six hundred eleven King s Declaration p six Burnet s Mem p twenty nine thirty May p twenty nine The people under the influence of the nobility and clergy could not fail to partake of the discontents which prevailed among these two orders and where real grounds of complaint were wanting they greedily laid hold of imaginary ones The same horror against Popery with which the English Puritans were possessed was observable among the populace in Scotland and among these as being more uncultivated and uncivilized seemed rather to be inflamed into a higher degree of ferocity The genius of religion which prevailed in the court and among the prelates was of an opposite nature and having some affinity to the Romish worship led them to mollify as much as possible these severe prejudices and to speak of the Catholics in more charitable language and with more reconciling expressions From this foundation a panic fear of Popery was easily raised and every new ceremony or ornament introduced into divine service was part of that great mystery of iniquity which from the encouragement of the king and the bishops was to overspread the nation The few innovations which James had made were considered as preparatives to this grand design and the further alterations attempted by Charles were represented as a plain declaration of his intentions Through the whole course of this reign nothing had more fatal influence in both kingdoms than this groundless apprehension which with so much industry was propagated and with so much credulity was embraced by all ranks of men Burnet s Mem p twenty nine thirty thirty one Amidst these dangerous complaints and terrors of religious innovation the civil and ecclesiastical liberties of the nation were imagined and with some reason not to be altogether free from invasion The establishment of the high commission by James without any authority of law seemed a considerable encroachment of the crown and erected the most dangerous and arbitrary of all courts by a method equally dangerous and arbitrary All the steps towards the settlement of Episcopacy had indeed been taken with consent of parliament the articles of Perth were confirmed in sixteen twenty one in sixteen thirty three the king had obtained a general ratification of every ecclesiastical establishment but these laws had less authority with the nation as they were known to have passed contrary to the sentiments even of those who voted for them and were in reality extorted by the authority and importunity of the sovereign The means however which both James and Charles had employed in order to influence the parliament were entirely regular and no reasonable pretence had been afforded for representing these laws as null or invalid But there prevailed among the greater part of the nation another principle of the most important and most dangerous nature and which if admitted destroyed entirely the validity of all such statutes The ecclesiastical authority was supposed totally independent of the civil and no act of parliament nothing but the consent of the church itself was represented as sufficient ground for the introduction of any change in religious worship or discipline And though James had obtained the vote of assemblies for receiving Episcopacy and his new rites it must be confessed that such irregularities had prevailed in constituting these ecclesiastical courts and such violence in conducting them that there were some grounds for denying the authority of all their acts Charles sensible that an extorted consent attended with such invidious circumstances would rather be prejudicial to his measures had wholly laid aside the use of assemblies and was resolved in conjunction with the bishops to govern the church by an authority to which he thought himself fully entitled and which he believed inherent in the crown The king s great aim was to complete the work so happily begun by his father to establish discipline upon a regular system of canons to introduce a liturgy into public worship and to render the ecclesiastical government of all his kingdoms regular and uniform Some views of policy might move him to this undertaking but his chief motives were derived from principles of zeal and conscience The canons for establishing ecclesiastical jurisdiction were promulgated in sixteen thirty five and were received by the nation though without much appearing opposition yet with great inward apprehension and discontent Men felt displeasure at seeing the royal authority highly exalted by them and represented as absolute and uncontrollable They saw these speculative principles reduced to practice and a whole body of ecclesiastical laws established without any previous consent either of church or state Clarendon vol i p one hundred six They dreaded lest by a parity of reason like arbitrary authority from like pretences and principles would be assumed in civil matters they remarked that the delicate boundaries which separate church and state were already passed and many civil ordinances established by the canons under color of ecclesiastical institutions and they were apt to deride the negligence with which these important edicts had been compiled when they found that the new liturgy or service book was every where under severe penalties enjoined by them though it had not yet been composed or published It was however soon expected and in the reception of it as the people are always most affected by what is external and exposed to the senses it was apprehended that the chief difficulty would consist The liturgy which the king from his own authority imposed on Scotland was copied from that of England but lest a servile imitation might shock the pride of his ancient kingdom a few alterations in order to save appearances were made in it and in that shape it was transmitted to the bishops at Edinburgh But the Scots had universally entertained a notion that though riches and worldly glory had been shared out to them with a sparing hand they could boast of spiritual treasures more abundant and more genuine than were enjoyed by any nation under heaven Even their southern neighbors they thought though separated from Rome still retained a great tincture of the primitive pollution and their liturgy was represented as a species of mass though with some less show and embroidery Great prejudices therefore were entertained against it even considered in itself much more when regarded as a preparative which was soon to introduce into Scotland all the abominations of Popery And as the very few alterations which distinguished the new liturgy from the English seemed to approach nearer to the doctrine of the real presence this circumstance was deemed an undoubted confirmation of every suspicion with which the people were possessed Clarendon vol i p one hundred five King s Decl p eighteen May p thirty two King s Decl p twenty Burnet s Mem p eight one Rush vol ii p three hundred ninety six May p thirty one Easter day was by proclamation appointed for the first reading of the service in Edinburgh but in order to judge more surely of men s dispositions the council delayed the matter till the twenty third of July and they even gave notice the Sunday before of their intention to commence the use of the new liturgy As no considerable symptoms of discontent appeared they thought that they might safely proceed in their purpose and accordingly in the cathedral church of saint Giles the dean of Edinburgh arrayed in his surplice began the service the bishop himself and many of the privy council being present But no sooner had the dean opened the book than a multitude of the meanest sort most of them women clapping their hands cursing and crying out A pope a pope Antichrist stone him raised such a tumult that it was impossible to proceed with the service The bishop mounting the pulpit in order to appease the populace had a stool thrown at him the council was insulted and it was with difficulty that the magistrates were able partly by authority partly by force to expel the rabble and to shut the doors against them The tumult however still continued without stones were thrown at the doors and windows and when the service was ended the bishop going home was attacked and narrowly escaped from the hands of the enraged multitude In the afternoon the privy seal because he carried the bishop in his coach was so pelted with stones and hooted at with execrations and pressed upon by the eager populace that if his servants with drawn swords had not kept them off the bishop s life had been exposed to the utmost danger Though it was violently suspected that the low populace who alone appeared had been instigated by some of higher condition yet no proof of it could be produced and every one spake with disapprobation of the licentiousness of the giddy multitude It was not thought safe however to hazard a new insult by any new attempt to read the liturgy and the people seemed for the time to be appeased and satisfied But it being known that the king still persevered in his intentions of imposing that mode of worship men fortified themselves still further in their prejudices against it and great multitudes resorted to Edinburgh in order to oppose the introduction of so hated a novelty King s Decl p twenty two Clarendon vol i p one hundred eight Rush vol ii p three hundred eighty seven King s Decl p twenty three

The bishop of Galloway was attacked in the streets and chased into the chamber where the privy council was sitting The council itself was besieged and violently attacked the town council met with the same fate and nothing could have saved the lives of all of them but their application to some popular lords who protected them and dispersed the multitude In this sedition the actors were of some better condition than in the former though nobody of rank seemed as yet to countenance them All men however began to unice and to encourage each other in opposition to the religious innovations introduced into the kingdom Petitions to the council were signed and presented by persons of the highest quality the women took part and as was usual with violence the clergy every where loudly declaimed against Popery and the liturgy which they represented as the same the pulpits resounded with vehement invectives against Antichrist and the populace who first opposed the service was often compared to Balaam s ass an animal in itself stupid and senseless but whose mouth had been opened by the Lord to the admiration of the whole world In short fanaticism mingling with faction private interest with the spirit of liberty symptoms appeared on all hands of the most dangerous insurrection and disorder King s Decl p thirty five thirty six et cetera Rush vol ii p four hundred four The primate a man of wisdom and prudence who was all along averse to the introduction of the liturgy represented to the king the state of the nation the earl of Traquaire the treasurer set out for London in order to lay the matter more fully before him every circumstance whether the condition of England or of Scotland were considered should have engaged him to desist from so hazardous an attempt yet was Charles inflexible In his whole conduct of this affair there appear no marks of the good sense with which he was endowed a lively instance of that species of character so frequently to be met with where there are found parts and judgment in every discourse and opinion in many actions indiscretion and imprudence Men s views of things are the result of their understanding alone their conduct is regulated by their understanding their temper and their passions To so violent a combination of a whole kingdom Charles had nothing to oppose but a proclamation in which he pardoned all past offences and exhorted the people to be more obedient for the future and to submit peaceably to the use of the liturgy This proclamation was instantly encountered with a public protestation presented by the earl of Hume and Lindesey and this was the first time that men of quality had appeared in any violent act of opposition But this proved a crisis The insurrection which had been advancing by a gradual and slow progress now blazed up at once No disorder however attended it On the contrary a new order immediately took place Four tables as they were called were formed in Edinburgh One consisted of nobility another of gentry a third of ministers a fourth of burgesses The table of gentry was divided into many subordinate tables according to their different counties In the hands of the four tables the whole authority of the kingdom was placed Orders were issued by them and every where obeyed with the utmost regularity And among the first acts of their government was the production of the Covenant This famous covenant consisted first of a renunciation of Popery formerly signed by James in his youth and composed of many invectives fitted to inflame the minds of men against their fellow creatures whom Heaven has enjoined them to cherish and to love There followed a bond of union by which the subscribers obliged themselves to resist religious innovations and to defend each other against all opposition whatsoever and all this for the greater glory of God and the greater honor and advantage of their king and country The people without distinction of rank or condition of age or sex flocked to the subscription of this covenant few in their judgment disapproved of it and still fewer durst openly condemn it The king s ministers and counsellors themselves were most of them seized by the general contagion And none but rebels to God and traitors to their country it was thought would withdraw themselves from so salutary and so pious a combination King s Decl p forty seven

the Low Countries with more determined fury than was now by the Scots the mild the humane Charles attended with his inoffensive liturgy The king began to apprehend the consequences He sent the marquis of Hamilton as commissioner with authority to treat with the Covenanters He required the covenant to be renounced and recalled and he thought that on his part he had made very satisfactory concessions when he offered to suspend the canons and the liturgy till in a fair and legal way they could be received and so to model the high commission that it should no longer give offence to his subjects Such general declarations could not well give content to any much less to those who carried so much higher their pretensions The Covenanters found themselves seconded by the zeal of the whole nation Above sixty thousand people were assembled in a tumultuous manner in Edinburgh and the neighborhood Charles possessed no regular forces in either of his kingdoms And the discontents in England though secret were believed so violent that the king it was thought would find it very difficult to employ in such a cause the power of that kingdom The more therefore the popular leaders in Scotland considered their situation the less apprehension did they entertain of royal power and the more rigorously did they insist on entire satisfaction In answer to Hamilton s demand of renouncing the covenant they plainly told him that they would sooner renounce their baptism And the clergy invited the commissioner himself to subscribe it by informing him with what peace and comfort it had filled the hearts of all God s people what resolutions and beginnings of reformation of manners were sensibly perceived in all parts of the nation above any measure they had ever before found or could have expected how great glory the Lord had received thereby and what confidence they had that God would make Scotland a blessed kingdom Hamilton returned to London made another fruitless journey with new concessions to Edinburgh returned again to London and was immediately sent back with still more satisfactory concessions The king was now willing entirely to abolish the canons the liturgy and the high commission court He was even resolved to limit extremely the power of the bishops and was content if on any terms he could retain that order in the church of Scotland And to insure all these gracious offers he gave Hamilton authority to summon first an assembly then a parliament where every national grievance might be redressed and remedied Rush vol ii p one hundred thirty seven et cetera King s Decl p

which yet came still short of the rising demands of the malecontents discovered his own weakness encouraged their insolence and gave no satisfaction The offer however of an assembly and a parliament in which they expected to be entirely masters was willingly embraced by the Covenanters Charles perceiving what advantage his enemies had reaped from their covenant resolved to have a covenant on his side and he ordered one to be drawn up for that purpose It consisted of the same violent renunciation of Popery above mentioned which though the king did not approve of it he thought it safest to adopt in order to remove all the suspicions entertained against him As the Covenanters in their bond of mutual defence against all opposition had been careful not to except the king Charles had formed a bond which was annexed to this renunciation and which expressed the duty and loyalty of the subscribers to his majesty But the Covenanters perceiving that this new covenant was only meant to weaken and divide them received it with the utmost scorn and detestation And without delay they proceeded to model the future assembly from which such great achievments were expected The genius of that religion which prevailed in Scotland and which every day was secretly gaining ground in England was far front inculcating deference and submission to the ecclesiastics merely as such or rather by nourishing in every individual the highest raptures and ecstasies of devotion it consecrated in a manner every individual and in his own eyes bestowed a character on him much superior to what forms and ceremonious institutions could alone confer The clergy of Scotland though such tumult was excited about religious worship and discipline were both poor and in small numbers nor are they in general to be considered at least in the beginning as the ringleaders of the sedition which was raised on their account On the contrary the laity apprehending from several instances which occurred a spirit of moderation in that order resolved to domineer entirely in the assembly which was summoned and to hurry on the ecclesiastics by the same furious zeal with which they were themselves transported King s Decl p one hundred forty et cetera Rush vol ii p seven hundred seventy two King s Decl p one hundred eighty eight one hundred eighty nine Rush voL ii p seven hundred sixty one It had been usual before the establishment of prelacy for each presbytery to send to the assembly besides two or three ministers one lay commissioner and as all the boroughs and universities sent likewise commissioners the lay members in that ecclesiastical court nearly equalled the ecclesiastics Not only this institution which James apprehensive of zeal in the laity had abolished was now revived by the Covenanters they also introduced an innovation which served still further to reduce the clergy to subjection By an edict of the tables whose authority was supreme an elder from each parish was ordered to attend the presbytery and to give his vote in the choice both of the commissioners and ministers who should be deputed to the assembly As it is not usual for the ministers who are put in the list of candidates to claim a vote all the elections by that means fell into the hands of the laity the most furious of all ranks were chosen and the more to overawe the clergy a new device was fallen upon of choosing to every commissioner four or five lay assessors who though they could have no vote might yet interpose with their advice and authority in the assembly The assembly met at Glasgow and besides a great concourse of the people all the nobility and gentry of any family or interest were present either as members assessors or spectators and it was apparent that the resolutions taken by the Covenanters could here meet with no manner of opposition A firm determination had been entered into of utterly abolishing episcopacy and as a preparative to it there was laid before the presbytery of Edinburgh and solemnly read in all the churches of the kingdom an accusation against the bishops as guilty all of them of heresy simony bribery perjury cheating incest adultery fornication common swearing drunkenness gaming breach of the Sabbath and every other crime that had occurred to the accusers The bishops sent a protest declining the authority of the assembly the commissioner too protested against the court as illegally constituted and elected and in his majesty s name dissolved it This measure was foreseen and little regarded The court still continued to sit and to finish their business A presbytery in Scotland is an inferior ecclesiastical court the same that was afterwards called a classis in England and is composed of the clergy of the neighboring parishes to the number commonly of between twelve and twenty King s Decl p one hundred ninety one hundred ninety one two hundred ninety Guthry p thirty nine et cetera King s Decl p two hundred eighteen Rush vol ii p seven hundred eighty seven May p forty four All the acts of assembly since the accession of James to the crown of England were upon pretty reasonable grounds declared null and invalid The acts of parliament which affected ecclesiastical affairs were supposed on that very account to have no manner of authority And thus episcopacy the high commission the articles of Perth the canons and the liturgy were abolished and declared unlawful and the whole fabric which Jamas and Charles in a long course of years had been rearing with so much care and policy fell at once to the ground The covenant likewise was ordered to be signed by every one under pain of excommunication The independency of the ecclesiastical upon the civil power was the old Presbyterian principle which had been zealously adopted at the reformation and which though James and Charles had obliged the church publicly to disclaim it had secretly been adhered to by all ranks of people It was commonly asked whether Christ or the king were superior and as the answer seemed obvious it was inferred that the assembly being Christ s council was superior in all spiritual matters to the parliament which was only the king s But as the Covenanters were sensible that this consequence though it seemed to them irrefragable would not be assented to by the king it became necessary to maintain their religious tenets by military force and not to trust entirely to supernatural assistance of which however they held themselves well assured They cast their eyes on all sides abroad and at home whence ever they could expect any aid or support After France and Holland had entered into a league against Spain and framed a treaty of partition by which they were to conquer and to divide between them the Low Country provinces England was invited to preserve a neutrality between the contending parties while the French and Dutch should attack the maritime towns of Flanders But the king replied to D Estrades the French ambassador who opened the proposal that he had a squadron ready and would cross the seas if necessary with an army of fifteen thousand men in order to prevent these projected conquests This answer which proves that Charles though he expressed his mind with an imprudent candor had at last acquired a just idea of national interest irritated Cardinal Richelieu and in revenge that politic and enterprising minister carefully fomented the first commotions in Scotland and secretly supplied the Covenanters with money and arms in order to encourage them in their opposition against their sovereign King s Decl p three hundred seventeen Mem D Estrades vol i But the chief resource of the Scottish malecontents was in themselves and in their own vigor and abilities No regular established commonwealth could take juster measures or execute them with greater promptitude than did this tumultuous combination inflamed with bigotry for religious trifles and faction without a reasonable object The whole kingdom was in a manner engaged and the men of greatest abilities soon acquired the ascendant which their family interest enabled them to maintain The earl of Argyle though he long seemed to temporize had at last embraced the covenant and he became the chief leader of that party a man equally supple and inflexible cautious and determined and entirely qualified to make a figure during a factious and turbulent period The earls of Rothes Cassils Montrose Lothian the lords Lindesey Louden Yester Balmerino distinguished themselves in that party Many Scotch officers had acquired reputation in the German wars particularly under Gustavus and these were invited over to assist their country in her present necessity The command was intrusted to Lesley a soldier of experience and abilities Forces were regularly enlisted and disciplined Arms were commissioned and imported from foreign countries A few castles which belonged to the king being unprovided with victuals ammunition and garrisons were soon seized And the whole country except a small part where the marquis of Huntley still adhered to the king being in the hands of the Covenanters was in a very little time put in a tolerable posture of defence The fortifications of Leith were begun and carried on with great rapidity Besides the inferior sort and those who labored for pay incredible numbers of volunteers even noblemen and gentlemen put their hand to the work and deemed the most abject employment to be dignified by the sanctity of the cause Women too of rank and condition forgetting the delicacy of their sex and the decorum of their character were intermingled with the lowest rabble and carried on their shoulders the rubbish requisite for completing the fortifications May p forty nine Guthry s Memoirs p forty six We must not omit another auxiliary of the Covenanters and no inconsiderable one a prophetess who was much followed and admired by all ranks of people Her name Michelson a woman full of whimseys partly hysterical partly religious and inflamed with a zealous concern for the ecclesiastical discipline of the Presbyterians She spoke at certain times only and had often interruptions of days and weeks but when she began to renew her ecstasies warning of the happy event was conveyed over the whole country thousands crowded about her house and every word which she uttered was received with veneration as the most sacred oracles The covenant was her perpetual theme The true genuine covenant she said was ratified in heaven the king s covenant was an invention of Satan when she spoke of Christ she usually gave him the name of the Covenanting Jesus Rollo a popular preacher and zealous Covenanter was her great favorite and paid her on his part no less veneration Being desired by the spectators to pray with her and speak to her he answered that he durst not and that it would be ill manners in him to speak while his master Christ was speaking in her King s Declaration at large p two hundred twenty seven Burnet s Memoirs of Hamilton Charles had agreed to reduce episcopal authority so much that it would no longer have been of any service to support the crown and this sacrifice of his own interests he was willing to make in order to attain public peace and tranquillity But he could not consent entirely to abolish an order which he thought as essential to the being of a Christian church as his Scottish subjects deemed it incompatible with that sacred institution This narrowness of mind if we would be impartial we must either blame or excuse equally on both sides and thereby anticipate by a little reflection that judgment which time by introducing new subjects of controversy will undoubtedly render quite familiar to posterity So great was Charles s aversion to violent and sanguinary measures and so strong his affection to his native kingdom that it is probable the contest in his breast would be nearly equal between these laudable passions and his attachment to the hierarchy The latter affection however prevailed for the time and made him hasten those military preparations which he had projected for subduing the refractory spirit of the Scottish nation By regular economy he had not only paid all the debts contracted during the Spanish and French wars but had amassed a sum of two hundred thousand pounds which he reserved for any sudden exigency The queen had great interest with the Catholics both from the sympathy of religion and from the favors and indulgences which she had been able to procure to them She now employed her credit and persuaded them that it was reasonable to give large contributions as a mark of their duty to the king during this urgent necessity A considerable supply was obtained by this means to the great scandal of the Puritans who were offended at seeing the king on such good terms with the Papists and repined that others should give what they themselves were disposed to refuse him Charles s fleet was formidable and well supplied Having put five thousand land forces on board he intrusted it to the marquis of Hamilton who had orders to sail to the Frith of Forth and to cause a diversion in the forces of the malecontents An army was levied of near twenty thousand foot and above three thousand horse and was put under the command of the earl of Arundel a nobleman of great family but celebrated neither for military nor political abilities The earl of Essex a man of strict honor and extremely popular especially among the soldiery was appointed lieutenant general the earl of Holland was general of the horse The king himself joined the army and he summoned all the peers of England to attend him The whole had the appearance of a splendid court rather than of a military armament and in this situation carrying more show than real force with it the camp arrived at Berwick The Scottish army was as numerous as that of the king but inferior in cavalry The officers had more reputation and experience and the soldiers though undisciplined and ill armed were animated as well by the national aversion to England and the dread of becoming a province to their old enemy as by an unsurmountable fervor of religion The pulpits had extremely assisted the officers in levying recruits and had thundered out anathemas against all those who went not out to assist the Lord against the mighty Yet so prudent were the leaders of the malecontents that they immediately sent submissive messages to the king and craved to be admitted to a treaty Rush vol iii p thirteen twenty nine Franklyn p seven hundred sixty seven Clarendon vol i p one hundred fifteen one hundred sixteen one hundred seventeen Burnet s Memoirs of Hamilton Charles knew that the force of the Covenanters was considerable their spirits high their zeal furious and that as they were not yet daunted by any ill success no reasonable terms could be expected from them With regard therefore to a treaty great difficulties occurred on both sides Should he submit to the pretensions of the malecontents besides that the prelacy must be sacrificed to their religious prejudices such a check would be given to royal authority which had very lately and with much difficulty been thoroughly established in Scotland that he must expect ever after to retain in that kingdom no more than the appearance of majesty The great men having proved by so sensible a trial the impotence of law and prerogative would return to their former licentiousness the preachers would retain their innate arrogance and the people unprotected by justice would recognize no other authority than that which they found to domineer over them England also it was much to be feared would imitate so bad an example and having already a strong propensity towards republican and Puritanical factions would expect by the same seditious practices to attain the same indulgence To advance so far without bringing the rebels to a total submission at least to reasonable concessions was to promise them in all future time an impunity for rebellion On the other hand Charles considered that Scotland was never before under any of his ancestors so united and so animated in its own defence yet had often been able to foil or elude the force of England combined heartily in one cause and inured by long practice to the use of arms How much greater difficulty should he find at present to subdue by violence a people inflamed with religious prejudices while he could only oppose to them a nation enervated by long peace and lukewarm in his service or what was more to be dreaded many of them engaged in the same party with the rebels Rush vol iii p nine hundred thirty six Should the war be only protracted beyond a campaign and who could expect to finish it in that period his treasures would fail him and for supply he must have recourse to an English parliament which by fatal experience he had ever found more ready to encroach on the prerogatives than to supply the necessities of the crown And what if he receive a defeat from the rebel army This misfortune was far from being impossible They were engaged in a national cause and strongly actuated by mistaken principles His army was retained entirely by pay and looked on the quarrel with the same indifference which naturally belongs to mercenary troops without possessing the discipline by which such troops are commonly distinguished And the consequences of a defeat while Scotland was enraged and England discontented were so dreadful that no motive should persuade him to hazard it It is evident that Charles had fallen into such a situation that whichever side he embraced his errors must be dangerous No wonder therefore he was in great perplexity But he did worse than embrace the worst side for properly speaking he embraced no side at all He concluded a sudden pacification in which it was stipulated that he should withdraw his fleet and army that within eight and forty hours the Scots should dismiss their forces that the king s forts should be restored to him his authority be acknowledged and a general assembly and a parliament be immediately summoned in order to compose all differences What were the reasons which engaged the king to admit such strange articles of peace it is in vain to inquire for there scarcely could be any The causes of that event may admit of a more easy explication Rush vol iii p nine hundred forty five The malecontents had been very industrious in representing to the English the grievances under which Scotland labored and the ill counsels which had been suggested to their sovereign Their liberties they said were invaded the prerogatives of the crown extended beyond all former precedent illegal courts erected the hierarchy exalted at the expense of national privileges and so many new superstitions introduced by the haughty tyrannical prelates as begat a just suspicion that a project was seriously formed for the restoration of Popery The king s conduct surely in Scotland had been in every thing except in establishing the ecclesiastical canons more legal than in England yet was there such a general resemblance in the complaints of both kingdoms that the English readily assented to all the representations of the Scottish malecontents and believed that nation to have been driven by oppression into the violent counsels which they had embraced So far therefore from being willing to second the king in subduing the free spirit of the Scots they rather pitied that unhappy people who had been pushed to those extremities and they thought that the example of such neighbors as well as their assistance might some time be advantageous to England and encourage her to recover by a vigorous effort her violated laws and liberties The gentry and nobility who without attachment to the court without command in the army attended in great numbers the English camp greedily seized and propagated and gave authority to these sentiments a retreat very little honorable which the earl of Holland with a considerable detachment of the English forces had made before a detachment of the Scottish caused all these humors to blaze up at once and the king whose character was not sufficiently vigorous or decisive and who was apt from facility to embrace hasty counsels suddenly assented to a measure which was recommended by all about him and which favored his natural propension towards the misguided subjects of his native kingdom Charles having so far advanced in pacific measures ought with a steady resolution to have prosecuted them and have submitted to every tolerable condition demanded by the assembly and parliament nor should he have recommenced hostilities but on account of such enormous and unexpected pretensions as would have justified his cause if possible to the whole English nation So far indeed he adopted this plan that he agreed not only to confirm his former concessions of abrogating the canons the liturgy the high commission and the articles of Perth but also to abolish the order itself of bishops for which he had so zealously contended But this concession was gained by the utmost violence which he could impose on his disposition and prejudices he even secretly retained an intention of seizing favorable opportunities in order to recover the ground which he had lost And one step farther he could not prevail with himself to advance The assembly when it met paid no deference to the king s prepossessions but gave full indulgence to their own They voted episcopacy to be unlawful in the church of Scotland he was willing to allow it contrary to the constitutions of that church They stigmatized the liturgy and canons as Popish he agreed simply to abolish them They denominated the high commission tyranny he was content to set it aside Clarendon vol i p one hundred twenty two one hundred twenty three May p forty six Rush vol iii p nine hundred forty six Burnet s Memoirs p one hundred fifty four Rush vol iii p nine hundred fifty one Rush vol iii p nine hundred fifty eight et cetera The parliament which sat after the assembly advanced pretensions which tended to diminish the civil power of the monarch and what probably affected Charles still more they were proceeding to ratify the acts of assembly when by the king s instructions Traquaire the commissioner prorogued them And on account of these claims which might have been foreseen was the war renewed with great advantages on the side of the Covenanters and disadvantages on that of the king No sooner had Charles concluded the pacification without conditions than the necessity of his affairs and his want of money obliged him to disband his army and as the soldiers had been held together solely by mercenary views it was not possible without great trouble and expense and loss of time again to assemble them The more prudent Covenanters had concluded that their pretensions being so contrary to the interests and still more to the inclinations of the king it was likely that they should again be obliged to support their cause by arms and they were therefore careful in dismissing their troops to preserve nothing but the appearance of a pacific disposition The officers had orders to be ready on the first summons the soldiers were warned not to think the nation secure from an English invasion and the religious zeal which animated all ranks of men made them immediately fly to their standards as soon as the trumpet was sounded by their spiritual and temporal leaders The credit which in their last expedition they had acquired by obliging their sovereign to depart from all his pretensions gave courage to every one in undertaking this new enterprise Rush vol iii p nine hundred fifty five Clarendon vol i p one hundred twenty five Rush vol iii p ten twenty three The king with great difficulty found means to draw together an army but soon discovered that all savings being gone and great debts contracted his revenue would be insufficient to support them An English parliament therefore formerly so unkind and intractable must now after above eleven years intermission after the king had tried many irregular methods of taxation after multiplied disgusts given to the Puritanical party be summoned to assemble amidst the must pressing necessities of the crown As the king resolved to try whether this house of commons would be more compliant than their predecessors and grant him supply on any reasonable terms the time appointed for the meeting of parliament was late and very near the time allotted for opening the campaign against the Scots After the past experience of their ill humor and of their encroaching disposition he thought that he could not in prudence trust them with a long session till he had seen some better proofs of their good intentions the urgency of the occasion and the little time allowed for debate were reasons which he reserved against the malecontents in the house and an incident had happened which he believed had now furnished him with still more cogent arguments The earl of Traquaire had intercepted a letter written to the king of France by the Scottish malecontents and had conveyed this letter to the king Charles partly repenting of the large concessions made to the Scots partly disgusted at their fresh insolence and pretensions seized this opportunity of breaking with them He had thrown into the Tower Lord Loudon commissioner from the Covenanters one of the persons who had signed the treasonable letter And he now laid the matter before the parliament whom he hoped to inflame by the resentment and alarm by the danger of this application to a foreign power Clarendon vol i p one hundred twenty nine Rush vol iii p nine hundred fifty six May p fifty six By the mouth of the lord keeper Finch he discovered his wants and informed them that he had been able to assemble his army and to subsist them not by any revenue which he possessed but by means of a large debt of above three hundred thousand pounds which he had contracted and for which he had given security upon the crown lands He represented that it was necessary to grant supplies for the immediate and urgent demands of his military armaments that the season was far advanced the time precious and none of it must be lost in deliberation that though his coffers were empty they had not been exhausted by unnecessary pomp or sumptuous buildings or any other kind of magnificence that whatever supplies had been levied on his subjects had been employed for their advantage and preservation and like vapors rising out of the earth and gathered into a cloud had fallen in sweet and refreshing showers on the same fields from which they had at first been exhaled that though he desired such immediate assistance as might prevent for the time a total disorder in the government he was far from any intention of precluding them from their right to inquire into the state of the kingdom and to offer his petitions for the redress of their grievances that as much as was possible of this season should afterwards be allowed them for that purpose that as he expected only such supply at present as the current service necessarily required it would be requisite to assemble them again next winter when they should have full leisure to conclude whatever business had this session been left imperfect and unfinished that the parliament of Ireland had twice put such trust in his good intentions as to grant him in the beginning of the session a large supply and had ever experienced good effects from the confidence reposed in him and that in every circumstance his people should find his conduct suitable to a just pious and gracious king and such as was calculated to promote an entire harmony between prince and parliament Rush vol iii p eleven fourteen However plausible these topics they made small impression on the house of commons By some illegal and several suspicious measures of the crown and by the courageous opposition which particular persons amidst dangers and hardships had made to them the minds of men throughout the nation had taken such a turn as to ascribe every honor to the refractory opposers of the king and the ministers These were the only patriots the only lovers of their country the only heroes and perhaps too the only true Christians A reasonable compliance with the court was slavish dependence a regard to the king servile flattery a confidence in his promises shameful prostitution This general cast of thought which has more or less prevailed in England during near a century and a half and which has been the cause of much good and much ill in public affairs never predominated more than during the reign of Charles The present house of commons being entirely composed of country gentlemen who came into parliament with all their native prejudices about them and whom the crown had no means of influencing could not fail to contain a majority of these stubborn patriots Affairs likewise by means of the Scottish insurrection and the general discontents in England were drawing so near to a crisis that the leaders of the house sagacious and penetrating began to foresee the consequences and to hope that the time so long wished for was now come when royal authority must fall into a total subordination under popular assemblies and when public liberty must acquire a full ascendant By reducing the crown to necessities they had hitherto found that the king had been pushed into violent counsels which had served extremely the purposes of his adversaries and by multiplying these necessities it was foreseen that his prerogative undermined on all sides must at last be overthrown and be no longer dangerous to the privileges of the people Whatever therefore tended to compose the differences between king and parliament and to preserve the government uniformly in its present channel was zealously opposed by these popular leaders and their past conduct and sufferings gave them credit sufficient to effect all their purposes The house of commons moved by these and many other obvious reasons instead of taking notice of the king s complaints against his Scottish subjects or his applications for supply entered immediately upon grievances and a speech which Pym made them on that subject was much more hearkened to than that which the lord keeper had delivered to them in the name of their sovereign The subject of Pym s harangue has been sufficiently explained above where we gave an account of all the grievances imaginary in the church more real in the state of which the nation at that time so loudly complained The house began with examining the behavior of the speaker the last day of the former parliament when he refused on account of the king s command to put the question and they declared it a breach of privilege They proceeded next to inquire into the imprisonment and prosecution of Sir John Elliot Hollis and Valentine the affair of ship money was canvassed and plentiful subject of inquiry was suggested on all hands Grievances were regularly classed under three heads those with regard to privileges of parliament to the property of the subject and to religion Clarendon vol i p one hundred thirty three Rush vol iii p eleven thirty one May p sixty Rush vol iii p eleven thirty six Rush vol iii p eleven forty seven The king seeing a large and inexhaustible field opened pressed them again for supply and finding his message ineffectual he came to the house of peers and desired their good offices with the commons The peers were sensible of the king s urgent necessities and thought that supply on this occasion ought both in reason and in decency to go before grievances They ventured to represent their sense of the matter to the commons but their intercession did harm The commons had always claimed as their peculiar province the granting of supplies and though the peers had here gone no further than offering advice the lower house immediately thought proper to vote so unprecedented an interposition to be a breach of privilege Charles in order to bring the matter of supply to some issue solicited the house by new messages and finding that ship money gave great alarm and disgust besides informing them that he never intended to make a constant revenue of it that all the money levied had been regularly with other great sums expended on equipping the navy he now went so far as to offer them a total abolition of that obnoxious claim by any law which the commons should think proper to present to him In return he only asked for his necessities a supply of twelve subsidies about six hundred thousand pounds and that payable in three years but at the same time he let them know that considering the situation of his affairs a delay would be equivalent to a denial The king though the majority was against him never had more friends in any house of commons and the debate was carried on for two days with great zeal and warmth on both sides Clarendon vol i p one hundred thirty four Clarendon vol one p one hundred thirty five Rush vol iii p eleven fifty four It was urged by the partisans of the court that the happiest occasion which the fondest wishes could suggest was now presented for removing all disgusts and jealousies between king and people and for reconciling their sovereign forever to the use of parliaments that if they on their part laid aside all enormous claims and pretensions and provided in a reasonable manner for the public necessities they needed entertain no suspicion of any insatiable ambition or illegal usurpation in the crown that though due regard had not always been paid during this reign to the rights of the people yet no invasion of them had been altogether deliberate and voluntary much less the result of wanton tyranny and injustice and still less of a formal design to subvert the constitution That to repose a reasonable confidence in the king and generously to supply his present wants which proceeded neither from prodigality nor misconduct would be the true means of gaining on his generous nature and extorting by a gentle violence such concessions as were requisite for the establishment of public liberty that he had promised not only on the word of a prince but also on that of a gentleman the expression which he had been pleased to use that after the supply was granted the parliament should still have liberty to continue their deliberations could it be suspected that any man any prince much less such a one whose word was as yet sacred and inviolate would for so small a motive forfeit his honor and with it all future trust and confidence by breaking a promise so public and so solemn that even if the parliament should be deceived in reposing this confidence in him they neither lost any thing nor incurred any danger since it was evidently necessary for the security of public peace to supply him with money in order to suppress the Scottish rebellion that he had so far suited his first demands to their prejudices that he only asked a supply for a few months and was willing after so short a trust from them to fall again into dependence and to trust them for his further support and subsistence that if he now seemed to desire something further he also made them in return a considerable offer and was willing for the future to depend on them for a revenue which was quite necessary for public honor and security that the nature of the English constitution supposed a mutual confidence between king and parliament and if they should refuse it on their part especially with circumstances of such outrage and indignity what could be expected but a total dissolution of government and violent factions followed by the most dangerous convulsions and intestine disorders In opposition to these arguments it was urged by the malecontent party that the court had discovered on their part but few symptoms of that mutual confidence to which they now so kindly invited the commons that eleven years intermission of parliaments the longest that was to be found in the English annals was a sufficient indication of the jealousy entertained against the people or rather of designs formed for the suppression of all their liberties and privileges that the ministers might well plead necessity nor could any thing indeed be a stronger proof of some invincible necessity than their embracing a measure for which they had conceived so violent an aversion as the assembling of an English parliament that this necessity however was purely ministerial not national and if the same grievances ecclesiastical and civil under which this nation itself labored had pushed the Scots to extremities was it requisite that the English should forge their own chains by imposing chains on their unhappy neighbors that the ancient practice of parliament was to give grievances the precedency of supply and this order so carefully observed by their ancestors was founded on a jealousy inherent in the constitution and was never interpreted as any peculiar diffidence of the present sovereign that a practice which had been upheld during times the most favorable to liberty could not in common prudence be departed from where such undeniable reasons for suspicion had been afforded that it was ridiculous to plead the advanced season and the urgent occasion for supply when it plainly appeared that in order to afford a pretence for this topic and to seduce the commons great political contrivance had been employed that the writs for elections were issued early in the winter and if the meeting of parliament had not purposely been delayed till so near the commencement of military operations there had been leisure sufficient to have redressed all national grievances and to have proceeded afterwards to an examination of the king s occasion for supply that the intention of so gross an artifice was to engage the commons under pretence of necessity to violate the regular order of parliament and a precedent of that kind being once established no inquiry into public measures would afterwards be permitted that scarcely any argument more unfavorable could be pleaded for supply than an offer to abolish ship money a taxation the most illegal and the most dangerous that had ever in any reign been imposed upon the nation and that by bargaining for the remission of that duty the commons would in a manner ratify the authority by which it had been levied at least give encouragement for advancing new pretensions of a like nature in hopes of resigning them on like advantageous conditions These reasons joined to so many occasions of ill humor seemed to sway with the greater number but to make the matter worse Sir Harry Vane the secretary told the commons without any authority from the king that nothing less than twelve subsidies would be accepted as a compensation for the abolition of ship money This assertion proceeding from the indiscretion if we are not rather to call it the treachery of Vane displeased the house by showing a stiffness and rigidity in the king which in a claim so ill grounded was deemed inexcusable We are informed likewise that some men who were thought to understand the state of the nation affirmed in the house that the amount of twelve subsidies was a greater sum than could be found in all England such were the happy ignorance and inexperience of those times with regard to taxes Clarendon vol i p one hundred thirty eight Clarendon vol i p one hundred thirty six The king was in great doubt and perplexity He saw that his friends in the house were outnumbered by his enemies and that the same counsels were still prevalent which had ever bred such opposition and disturbance Instead of hoping that any supply would be granted him to carry on war against the Scots whom the majority of the house regarded as their best friends and firmest allies he expected every day that they would present him an address for making peace with those rebels And if the house met again a vote he was informed would certainly pass to blast his revenue of ship money and thereby renew all the opposition which with so much difficulty he had surmounted in levying that taxation Where great evils lie on all sides it is difficult to follow the best counsel nor is it any wonder that the king whose capacity was not equal to situations of such extreme delicacy should hastily have formed and executed the resolution of dissolving this parliament a measure however of which he soon after repented and which the subsequent events more than any convincing reason inclined every one to condemn The last parliament which ended with such rigor and violence had yet at first covered their intentions with greater appearance of moderation than this parliament had hitherto assumed An abrupt and violent dissolution naturally excites discontents among the people who usually put entire confidence in their representatives and expect from them the redress of all grievances As if there were not already sufficient grounds of complaint the king persevered still in those counsels which from experience he might have been sensible were so dangerous and unpopular Bellasis and Sir John Hotham were summoned before the council and refusing to give any account of their conduct in parliament were committed to prison All the petitions and complaints which had been sent to the committee of religion were demanded from Crew chairman of that committee and on his refusal to deliver them he was sent to the Tower The studies and even the pockets of the earl of Warwick and Lord Broke before the expiration of privilege were searched in expectation of finding treasonable papers These acts of authority were interpreted with some appearance of reason to be invasions on the right of national assemblies But the king after the first provocation which he met with never sufficiently respected the privileges of parliament and by his example he further confirmed their resolution when they should acquire power to pay like disregard to the prerogatives of the crown Rush vol iii p eleven sixty seven May p sixty one Though the parliament was dissolved the convocation was still allowed to sit a practice of which since the reformation there were but few instances and which was for that reason supposed by many to be irregular Besides granting to the king a supply from the spirituality and framing many canons the convocation jealous of like innovations with those which had taken place in Scotland imposed an oath on the clergy and the graduates in the universities by which every one swore to maintain the established government of the church by archbishops bishops deans chapters et cetera These steps in the present discontented humor of the nation were commonly deemed illegal because not ratified by consent of parliament in whom all authority was now supposed to be centred And nothing besides could afford more subject of ridicule than an oath which contained an et caetera in the midst of it The people who generally abhorred the convocation as much as they revered the parliament could scarcely be restrained from insulting and abusing this assembly and the king was obliged to give them guards in order to protect them An attack too was made during the night upon Laud in his palace of Lambeth by above five hundred persons and he found it necessary to fortify himself for his defence A multitude consisting of two thousand secretaries entered saint Paul s where the high commission then sat tore down the benches and cried out No bishop no high commission v All these instances of discontent were presages of some great revolution had the court possessed sufficient skill to discern the danger or sufficient power to provide against it In this disposition of men s minds it was in vain that the king issued a declaration in order to convince his people of the necessity which he lay under of dissolving the last parliament v There was one in fifteen eighty six see History of Archbishop Laud p eighty The authority of the convocation was indeed in most respects independent of the parliament and there was no reason which required the one to be dissolved upon the dissolution of the other Whitlocke p thirty three Whitlocke p thirty three Dugdale p sixty two Clarendon vol i p one hundred forty three v Dugdale p sixty five V Rush vol iii p eleven sixty five The chief topic on which he insisted was that the commons imitated the bad example of all then predecessors of late years in making continual encroachments on his authority in censuring his whole administration and conduct in discussing every circumstance of public government and in their indirect bargaining and contracting with their king for supply as if nothing ought to be given him but what he should purchase either by quitting somewhat of his royal prerogative or by diminishing and lessening his standing revenue These practices he said were contrary to the maxims of their ancestors and these practices were totally incompatible with monarchy five The king disappointed of parliamentary subsidies was obliged to have recourse to other expedients in order to supply his urgent necessities The ecclesiastical subsidies served him in some stead and it seemed but just that the clergy should contribute to a war which was in a great measure of their own raising He borrowed money from his ministers and courtiers and so much was he beloved among them that above three hundred thousand pounds were subscribed in a few days though nothing surely could be more disagreeable to a prince full of dignity than to be a burden on his friends instead of being a support to them Some attempts were made towards forcing a loan from the citizens but still repelled by the spirit of liberty which was now become unconquerable A loan of forty thousand pounds was extorted from the Spanish merchants who had bullion in the Tower exposed to the attempts of the king Coat and conduct money for the soldiery was levied on the counties an ancient practice but supposed to be abolished by the petition of right All the pepper was bought from the East India Company upon trust and sold at a great discount for ready money v A scheme was proposed for coining two or three hundred thousand pounds of base money v such were the extremities to which Charles was reduced The fresh difficulties which amidst the present distresses were every day raised with regard to the payment of ship money obliged him to exert continual acts of authority augmented the discontents of the people and increased his indigence and necessities v See note E at

to march his army consisting of nineteen thousand foot and two thousand horse The earl of Northumberland was appointed general the earl of Strafford who was called over from Ireland lieutenant general Lord Conway general of the horse A small fleet was thought sufficient to serve the purposes of this expedition So great are the effects of zeal and unanimity that the Scottish army though somewhat superior were sooner ready than the king s and they marched to the borders of England To engage them to proceed besides their general knowledge of the secret discontents of that kingdom Lord Saville had forged a letter in the name of six noblemen the most considerable of England by which the Scots were invited to assist their neighbors in procuring a redress of grievances Notwithstanding these warlike preparations and hostile attempts the Covenanters still preserved the most pathetic and most submissive language and entered England they said with no other view than to obtain access to the king s presence and lay their humble petition at his royal feet At Newburn upon Tyne they were opposed by a detachment of four thousand five hundred men under Conway who seemed resolute to dispute with them the passage of the river The Scots first entreated them with great civility not to stop them in their march to their gracious sovereign and then attacked them with great bravery killed several and chased the rest from their ground Such a panic seized the whole English army that the forces at Newcastle fled immediately to Durham and not yet thinking themselves safe they deserted that town end retreated into Yorkshire The Scots took possession of Newcastle and though sufficiently elated with their victory they preserved exact discipline and persevered in their resolution of paying for every thing in order still to maintain the appearance of an amicable correspondence with England They also despatched messengers to the king who was arrived at York and they took care after the advantage which they had obtained to redouble their expressions of loyalty duty and submission to his person and they even made apologies full of sorrow and contrition for their late victory Rush vol iii p twelve seventy nine Nalson vol ii p four hundred twenty seven Clarendon vol i p one hundred forty three Rush vol iii p twelve fifty five Charles was in a very distressed condition The nation was universally and highly discontented The army was discouraged and began likewise to be discontented both from the contagion of general disgust and as an excuse for their misbehavior which they were desirous of representing rather as want of will than of courage to fight The treasury too was quite exhausted and every expedient for supply had been tried to the uttermost No event had happened but what might have been foreseen as necessary at least as very probable yet such was the king s situation that no provision could be made nor was even any resolution taken against such an exigency In order to prevent the advance of the Scots upon him the king agreed to a treaty and named sixteen English noblemen who met with eleven Scottish commissioners at Rippon The earls of Hertford Bedford Salisbury Warwick Essex Holland Bristol and Berkshire the lords Kimbolton Wharton Dunsmore Paget Broke Saville Paulet and Howard of Escric were chosen by the king all of them popular men and consequently supposed nowise averse to the Scottish invasion or unacceptable to that nation An address arrived from the city of London petitioning for a parliament the great point to which all men s projects at this time tended Twelve noblemen presented a petition to the same purpose But the king contented himself with summoning a great council of the peers at York a measure which had formerly been taken in cases of sudden emergency but which at present could serve to little purpose Perhaps the king who dreaded above all things the house of commons and who expected no supply from them on any reasonable terms thought that in his present distresses he might be enabled to levy supplies by the authority of the peers alone But the employing so long the plea of a necessity which appeared distant and doubtful rendered it impossible for him to avail himself of a necessity which was now at last become real urgent and inevitable Clarendon vol i p one hundred fifty five Rush vol iii p twelve sixty three Clarendon vol i p one hundred forty six Rush vol iii p twelve sixty May p sixty six Warwick p one hundred fifty one By Northumberland s sickness the command of the army had devolved on Strafford This nobleman possessed more vigor of mind than the king or any of the council He advised Charles rather to put all to hazard than submit to unworthy terms as were likely to be imposed upon him The loss sustained at Newburn he said was inconsiderable and though a panic had for the time seized the army that event was nothing strange among new levied troops and the Scots being in the same condition would no doubt be liable in their turn to a like accident His opinion therefore was that the king should push forward and attack the Scots and bring the affair to a quick decision and if he were ever so unsuccessful nothing worse could befall him than what from his inactivity he would certainly be exposed to To show how easy it would be to execute this project he ordered an assault to be made on some quarters of the Scots and he gained an advantage over them No cessation of arms had as yet been agreed to during the treaty at Rippon yet great clamor prevailed on account of this act of hostility And when it was known that the officer who conducted the attack was a Papist a violent outcry was raised against the king for employing that hated sect in the murder of his Protestant subjects It may be worthy of remark that several mutinies had arisen among the English troops when marching to join the army and some officers had been murdered merely on suspicion of their being Papists The petition of right had abolished all martial law and by an inconvenience which naturally attended the plan as yet new and unformed of regular and rigid liberty it was found absolutely impossible for the generals to govern the army by all the authority which the king could legally confer upon them The lawyers had declared that martial law could not be exercised except in the very presence of an enemy and because it had been found necessary to execute a mutineer the generals thought it advisable for their own safety to apply for a pardon from the crown This weakness however was carefully concealed from the army and Lord Conway said that if any lawyer were so imprudent as to discover the secret to the soldiers it would be necessary instantly to refute it and to hang the lawyer himself by sentence of a court martial Nalson vol ii p five Clarendon vol i p one hundred fifty nine Rush vol iii eleven ninety eleven ninety one eleven ninety two et cetera May p sixty four Rush vol iii p eleven ninety nine An army new levied undisciplined frightened seditious ill paid and governed by no proper authority was very unfit for withstanding a victorious and high spirited enemy and retaining in subjection a discontented and zealous nation Charles in despair of being able to stem the torrent at last determined to yield to it and as he foresaw that the great council of the peers would advise him to call a parliament he told them in his first speech that he had already taken this resolution He informed them likewise that the queen in a letter which she had written to him had very earnestly recommended that measure This good prince who was extremely attached to his consort and who passionately wished to render her popular in the nation forgot not amidst all his distress the interests of his domestic tenderness In order to subsist both armies for the king was obliged in order to save the northern counties to pay his enemies Charles wrote to the city desiring a loan of two hundred thousand pounds And the peers at York whose authority was now much greater than that of their sovereign joined in the same request so low was this prince already fallen in the eyes of his own subjects As many difficulties occurred in the negotiation with the Scots it was proposed to transfer the treaty from Rippon to London a proposal willingly embraced by that nation who were now sure of treating with advantage in a place where the king they foresaw would be in a manner a prisoner in the midst of his implacable enemies and their determined friends Clarendon vol one p one hundred fifty four Bush vol iii p twelve seventy five Rush vol iii p twelve seventy nine Rush vol iii p eighteen oh five CHAPTER LIV CHARLES I The causes of disgust which for above thirty years had daily been multiplying in England were now come to full maturity and threatened the kingdom with some great revolution or convulsion The uncertain and undefined limits of prerogative and privilege had been eagerly disputed during that whole period and in every controversy between prince and people the question however doubtful had always been decided by each party in favor of its own pretensions Too lightly perhaps moved by the appearance of necessity the king had even assumed powers incompatible with the principles of limited government and had rendered it impossible for his most zealous partisans entirely to justify his conduct except by topics so unpopular that they were more fitted in the present disposition of men s minds to inflame than appease the general discontent Those great supports of public authority law and religion had likewise by the unbounded compliance of judges and prelates lost much of their influence over the people or rather had in a great measure gone over to the side of faction and authorized the spirit of opposition and rebellion The nobility also whom the king had no means of retaining by offices and preferments suitable to their rank had been seized with the general discontent and unwarily threw themselves into the scale which already began too much to preponderate Sensible of some encroachments which had been made by royal authority men entertained no jealousy of the commons whose enterprises for the acquisition of power had ever been covered with the appearance of public good and had hitherto gone no further than some disappointed efforts and endeavors The progress of the Scottish malecontents reduced the crown to an entire dependence for supply their union with the popular party in England brought great accession of authority to the latter the near prospect of success roused all latent murmurs and pretensions which had hitherto been held in such violent constraint and the torrent of general inclination and opinion ran so strongly against the court that the king was in no situation to refuse any reasonable demands of the popular leaders either for defining or limiting the powers of his prerogative Even many exorbitant claims in his present situation would probably be made and must necessarily be complied with The triumph of the malecontents over the church was not yet so immediate or certain Though the political and religious Puritans mutually lent assistance to each other there were many who joined the former yet declined all connection with the latter The hierarchy had been established in England ever since the reformation the Romish church in all ages had carefully maintained that form of ecclesiastical government the ancient fathers too bore testimony to episcopal jurisdiction and though parity may seem at first to have had place among Christian pastors the period during which it prevailed was so short that few undisputed traces of it remained in history The bishops and their more zealous partisans inferred thence the divine indefeasible right of prelacy others regarded that institution as venerable and useful and if the love of novelty led some to adopt the new rites and discipline of the Puritans the reverence to antiquity retained many in their attachment to the liturgy and government of the church It behoved therefore the zealous innovators in parliament to proceed with some caution and reserve By promoting all measures which reduced the powers of the crown they hoped to disarm the king whom they justly regarded from principle inclination and policy to be the determined patron of the hierarchy By declaiming against the supposed encroachments and tyranny of the prelates they endeavored to carry the nation from a hatred of their persons to an opposition against their office and character And when men were enlisted in party it would not be difficult they thought to lead them by degrees into many measures for which they formerly entertained the greatest aversion Though the new sectaries composed not at first the majority of the nation they were inflamed as is usual among innovators with extreme zeal for their opinions Their unsurmountable passion disguised to themselves as well as to others under the appearance of holy fervors was well qualified to make proselytes and to seize the minds of the ignorant multitude And one furious enthusiast was able by his active industry to surmount the indolent efforts of many sober and reasonable antagonists When the nation therefore was so generally discontented and little suspicion was entertained of any design to subvert the church and monarchy no wonder that almost all elections ran in favor of those who by their high pretensions to piety and patriotism had encouraged the national prejudices It is a usual compliment to regard the king s inclination in the choice of a speaker and Charles had intended to advance Gardiner recorder of London to that important trust but so little interest did the crown at that time possess in the nation that Gardiner was disappointed of his election not only in London but in every other place where it was attempted and the king was obliged to make the choice of speaker fail on Lenthal a lawyer of some character but not sufficiently qualified for so high and difficult an office Clarendon vol i p one hundred sixty nine The eager expectations of men with regard to a parliament summoned at so critical a juncture and during such general discontents a parliament which from the situation of public affairs could not be abruptly dissolved and which was to execute every thing left unfinished by former parliaments these motives so important and interesting engaged the attendance of all the members and the house of commons was never observed to be from the beginning so full and numerous Without any interval therefore they entered upon business and by unanimous consent they immediately struck a blow which may in a manner be regarded as decisive The earl of Strafford was considered as chief minister both on account of the credit which he possessed with his master and of his own great and uncommon vigor and capacity By a concurrence of accidents this man labored under the severe hatred of all the three nations which composed the British monarchy The Scots whose authority now ran extremely high looked on him as the capital enemy of their country and one whose counsels and influence they had most reason to apprehend He had engaged the parliament of Ireland to advance large subsidies in order to support a war against them he had levied an army of nine thousand men with which he had menaced all their western coast he had obliged the Scots who lived under his government to renounce the Covenant their national idol he had in Ireland proclaimed the Scottish Covenanters rebels and traitors even before the king had issued any such declaration against them in England and he had ever dissuaded his master against the late treaty and suspension of arms which he regarded as dangerous and dishonorable So avowed and violent were the Scots in their resentment of all these measures that they had refused to send commissioners to treat at York as was at first proposed because they said the lieutenant of Ireland their capital enemy being general of the king s forces had there the chief command and authority Strafford first as deputy then as lord lieutenant had governed Ireland during eight years with great vigilance activity and prudence but with very little popularity In a nation so averse to the English government and religion these very virtues were sufficient to draw on him the public hatred The manners too and character of this great man though to all full of courtesy and to his friends full of affection were at bottom haughty rigid and severe His authority and influence during the time of his government had been unlimited but no sooner did adversity seize him than the concealed aversion of the nation blazed up at once and the Irish parliament used every expedient to aggravate the charge against him The universal discontent which prevailed in England against the court was all pointed towards the earl of Strafford though without any particular reason but because he was the minister of state whom the king most favored and most trusted His extraction was honorable his paternal fortune considerable yet envy attended his sudden and great elevation And his former associates in popular counsels finding that he owed his advancement to the desertion of their cause represented him as the great apostate of the commonwealth whom it behoved them to sacrifice as a victim to public justice Strafford sensible of the load of popular prejudices under which he labored would gladly have declined attendance in parliament and he begged the king s permission to withdraw himself to his government of Ireland at least to remain at the head of the army in Yorkshire where many opportunities he hoped would offer by reason of his distance to elude the attacks of his enemies But Charles who had entire confidence in the earl s capacity thought that his counsels would be extremely useful during the critical session which approached And when Strafford still insisted on the danger of his appearing amidst so many enraged enemies the king little apprehensive that his own authority was so suddenly to expire promised him protection and assured him that not a hair of his head should be touched by the parliament No sooner was Strafford s arrival known than a concerted attack was made upon him in the house of commons Pym in a long studied discourse divided into many heads after his manner enumerated all the grievances under which the nation labored and from a complication of such oppressions inferred that a deliberate plan had been formed of changing entirely the frame of government and subverting the ancient laws and liberties of the kingdom Could any thing he said increase our indignation against so enormous and criminal a project it would be to find that during the reign of the best of princes the constitution had been endangered by the worst of ministers and that the virtues of the king had been seduced by wicked and pernicious counsel We must inquire added he from what fountain these waters of bitterness flow and though doubtless many evil counsellors will be found to have contributed their endeavors yet there is one who challenges the infamous preeminence and who by his courage enterprise and capacity is entitled to the first place among these betrayers of their country He is the earl of Strafford lieutenant of Ireland and president of the council of York who in both places and in all other provinces where he has been intrusted with authority has raised ample monuments of tyranny and will appear from a survey of his actions to be the chief promoter of every arbitrary counsel Some instances of imperious expressions as well as actions were given by Pym who afterwards entered into a more personal attack of that minister and endeavored to expose his whole character and manners The austere genius of Strafford occupied in the pursuits of ambition had not rendered his breast altogether inaccessible to the tender passions or secured him from the dominion of the fair and in that sullen age when the irregularities of pleasure were more reproachful than the most odious crimes these weaknesses were thought worthy of being mentioned together with his treasons before so great an assembly And upon the whole the orator concluded that it belonged to the house to provide a remedy proportionable to the disease and to prevent the further mischiefs justly to be apprehended from the influence which this man had acquired over the measures and counsels of their sovereign Whitlocke p thirty six Whitlocke p thirty six Clarendon vol i p one hundred seventy two Sir John Clotworthy an Irish gentleman Sir John Hotham of Yorkshire and many others entered into the same topics and after several hours spent in bitter invective when the doors were locked in order to prevent all discovery of their purpose it was moved in consequence of the resolution secretly taken that Strafford should immediately be impeached of high treason This motion was received with universal approbation nor was there in all the debate one person who offered to stop the torrent by any testimony in favor of the earls conduct Lord Falkland alone though known to be his enemy modestly desired the house to consider whether it would not better suit the gravity of their proceedings first to digest by a committee many of those particulars which had been mentioned before they sent up an accusation against him It was ingeniously answered by Pym that such a delay might probably blast all their hopes and put it out of their power to proceed any further in the prosecution that when Strafford should learn that so many of his enormities were discovered his conscience would dictate his condemnation and so great was his power and credit he would immediately procure the dissolution of the parliament or attempt some other desperate measure for his own preservation that the commons were only accusers not judges and it was the province of the peers to determine whether such a complication of enormous crimes in one person did not amount to the highest crime known by the law Without further debate the impeachment was voted Pym was chosen to carry it up to the lords most of the house accompanied him on so agreeable an errand and Strafford who had just entered the house of peers and who little expected so speedy a prosecution was immediately upon this general charge ordered into custody with several symptoms of violent prejudice in his judges as well as in his prosecutors Clarendon vol i p one hundred seventy four In the inquiry concerning grievances and in the censure of past measures Laud could not long escape the severe scrutiny of the commons who were led too in their accusation of that prelate as well by their prejudices against his whole order as by the extreme antipathy which his intemperate zeal had drawn upon him After a deliberation which scarcely lasted half an hour an impeachment of high treason was voted against this subject the first both in rank and in favor throughout the kingdom Though this incident considering the example of Stratford s impeachment and the present disposition of the nation and parliament needed be no surprise to him yet was he betrayed into some passion when the accusation was presented The commons themselves he said though his accusers did not believe him guilty of the crimes with which they charged him an indiscretion which next day upon more mature deliberation he desired leave to retract but so little favorable were the peers that they refused him this advantage or indulgence Laud also was immediately upon this general charge sequestered from parliament and committed to custody The capital article insisted on against these two great men was the design which the commons supposed to have been formed of subverting the laws and constitution of England and introducing arbitrary and unlimited authority into the kingdom Of all the king s ministers no one was so obnoxious in this respect as the lord keeper Finch He it was who being speaker in the king s third parliament had left the chair and refused to put the question when ordered by the house The extrajudicial opinion of the judges in the case of ship money had been procured by his intrigues persuasions and even menaces In all unpopular and illegal measures he was ever most active and he was even believed to have declared publicly that while he was keeper an order of council should always with him be equivalent to a law To appease the rising displeasure of the commons he desired to be heard at their bar He prostrated himself with all humility before them but this submission availed him nothing An impeachment was resolved on and in order to escape their fury he thought proper secretly to withdraw and retire into Holland As he was not esteemed equal to Stratford or even to Laud either in capacity or in fidelity to his master it was generally believed that his escape had been connived at by the popular leaders His impeachment however in his absence was carried up to the house of peers Clarendon vol i p one hundred seventy seven Whitlocke p thirty eight Rush vol iii p thirteen sixty five Clarendon vol i p one hundred seventy seven Whitlocke p thirty eight Rush vol i p one hundred twenty nine Sir Francis Windebank the secretary was a creature of Laud s a sufficient reason for his being extremely obnoxious to the commons He was secretly suspected too of the crime of Popery and it was known that from complaisance to the queen and indeed in compliance with the king s maxims of government he had granted many indulgences to Catholics and had signed warrants for the pardon of priests and their delivery from confinement Grimstone a popular member called him in the house the very pander and broker to the whore of Babylon Finding that the scrutiny of the commons was pointing towards him and being sensible that England was no longer a place of safety for men of his character he suddenly made his escape into France Thus in a few weeks this house of commons not opposed or rather seconded by the peers had produced such a revolution in the government that the two most powerful and most favored ministers of the king were thrown into the Tower and daily expected to be tried for their life two other ministers had by flight alone saved themselves from a like fate all the king s servants saw that no protection could be given them by their master a new jurisdiction was erected in the nation and before that tribunal all those trembled who had before exulted most in their credit and authority Rush vol v p one hundred twenty two Clarendon vol i p one hundred seventy eight Whitlocke p thirty seven What rendered the power of the commons more formidable was the extreme prudence with which it was conducted Not content with the authority which they had acquired by attacking these great ministers they were resolved to render the most considerable bodies of the nation obnoxious to them Though the idol of the people they determined to fortify themselves likewise with terrors and to overawe those who might still be inclined to support the falling ruins of monarchy During the late military operations several powers had been exercised by the lieutenants and deputy lieutenants of counties and these powers though necessary for the defence of the nation and even warranted by all former precedent yet not being authorized by statute were now voted to be illegal and the persons who had assumed them declared delinquents This term was newly come into vogue and expressed a degree and species of guilt not exactly known or ascertained In consequence of that determination many of the nobility and prime gentry of the nation while only exerting as they justly thought the legal powers of magistracy unexpectedly found themselves involved in the crime of delinquency And the commons reaped this multiplied advantage by their vote they disarmed the crown they established the maxims of rigid law and liberty and they spread the terror of their own authority The writs for ship money had been directed to the sheriffs who were required and even obliged under severe penalties to assess the sums upon individuals and to levy them by their authority yet were all the sheriffs and all those who had been employed in that illegal service voted by a very rigorous sentence to be delinquents The king by the maxims of law could do no wrong his ministers and servants of whatever degree in case cf any violation of the constitution were alone culpable All the farmers and officers of the customs who had been employed during so many years in levying tonnage and poundage and the new impositions were likewise declared criminals and were afterwards glad to compound for a pardon by paying a fine of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds Every discretionary or arbitrary sentence of the star chamber and high commission courts which from their very constitution were arbitrary underwent a severe scrutiny and all those who had concurred in such sentences were voted to be liable to the penalties of law No minister of the king no member of the council but found himself exposed by this decision The judges who had given their vote against Hambden in the trial of ship money were accused before the peers and obliged to find surety for their appearance Berkeley a judge of the king s bench was seized by order of the house even when sitting in his tribunal and all men saw with astonishment the irresistible authority of their jurisdiction The sanction of the lords and commons as well as that of the king was declared necessary for the confirmation of ecclesiastical canons v And this judgment it must be confessed however reasonable at least useful it would have been difficult to justify by any precedent v Clarendon vol i p one hundred seventy six Clarendon vol i p one hundred seventy six Clarendon vol i p one hundred seventy seven Whitlocke p thirty nine v Nalson vol i p six hundred seventy three v An act of parliament twenty fifth Henry VIII cap nineteen allowed the convocation with the king s consent to make canons By the famous act of submission to that prince the clergy bound themselves to enact no canons without the king s consent The parliament was never mentioned nor thought of Such pretensions as the commons advanced at present would in any former age have been deemed strange usurpations But the present was no time for question or dispute That decision which abolished all legislative power except that of parliament was requisite for completing the new plan of liberty and rendering it quite uniform and systematical Almost all the bench of bishops and the most considerable of the inferior clergy who had voted in the late convocation found themselves exposed by these new principles to the imputation of delinquency The most unpopular of all Charles s measures and the least justifiable was the revival of monopolies so solemnly abolished after reiterated endeavors by a recent act of parliament Sensible of this unhappy measure the king had of himself recalled during the time of his first expedition against Scotland many of these oppressive patents and the rest were now annulled by authority of parliament and every one who was concerned in them declared delinquents The commons carried so far their detestation of this odious measure that they assumed a power which had formerly been seldom practised and they expelled all their members who were monopolists or projectors an artifice by which besides increasing their own privileges they weakened still further the very small party which the king secretly retained in the house Mildmay a notorious monopolist yet having associated himself with the ruling party was still allowed to keep his seat In all questions indeed of elections no steady rule of decision was observed and nothing further was regarded than the affections and attachments of the parties Men s passions were too much heated to be shocked with any instance of injustice which served ends so popular as those which were pursued by this house of commons Clarendon vol i p two hundred six Whitlocke p thirty seven Rush vol v p two hundred thirty five three hundred fifty nine Nalson vol i p eight hundred

James Clarendon vol i p one hundred seventy six The whole sovereign power being thus in a manner transferred to the commons and the government without any seeming violence or disorder being changed in a moment from a monarchy almost absolute to a pure democracy the popular leaders seemed willing for some time to suspend their active vigor and to consolidate their authority ere they proceeded to any violent exercise of it Every day produced some new harangue on past grievances The detestation of former usurpations was further enlivened the jealousy of liberty roused and agreeably to the spirit of free government no less indignation was excited by the view of a violated constitution than by the ravages of the most enormous tyranny This was the time when genius and capacity of all kinds freed from the restraint of authority and nourished by unbounded hopes and projects began to exert themselves and be distinguished by the public Then was celebrated the sagacity of Pym more fitted for use than ornament matured not chilled by his advanced age and long experience then was displayed the mighty ambition of Hambden taught disguise not moderation from former constraint supported by courage conducted by prudence embellished by modesty but whether founded in a love of power or zeal for liberty is still from his untimely end left doubtful and uncertain then too were known the dark ardent and dangerous character of saint John the impetuous spirit of Hollis violent and sincere open and entire in his enmities and in his friendships the enthusiastic genius of young Vane extravagant in the ends which he pursued sagacious and profound in the means which he employed incited by the appearances of religion negligent of the duties of morality So little apology would be received for past measures so contagious the general spirit of discontent that even men of the most moderate tempers and the most attached to the church and monarchy exerted themselves with the utmost vigor in the redress of grievances and in prosecuting the authors of them The lively and animated Digby displayed his eloquence on this occasion the firm and undaunted Capel the modest and candid Palmer In this list too of patriot royalists are found the virtuous names of Hyde and Falkland Though in their ultimate views and intentions these men differed widely from the former in their present actions and discourses an entire concurrence and unanimity was observed By the daily harangues and invectives against illegal usurpations not only the house of commons inflamed themselves with the highest animosity against the court the nation caught new fire from the popular leaders and seemed now to have made the first discovery of the many supposed disorders in the government While the law in several instances seemed to be violated they went no further than some secret and calm murmurs but mounted up into rage and fury as soon as the constitution was thought to be restored to its former integrity and vigor The capital especially being the seat of parliament was highly animated with the spirit of mutiny and disaffection Tumults were daily raised seditious assemblies encouraged and every man neglecting his own business was wholly intent on the defence of liberty and religion By stronger contagion the popular affections were communicated from breast to breast in this place of general rendezvous and society The harangues of members now first published and dispersed kept alive the discontents against the king s administration The pulpits delivered over to Puritanical preachers and lecturers whom the commons arbitrarily settled in all the considerable churches resounded with faction and fanaticism Vengeance was fully taken for the long silence and constraint in which by the authority of Laud and the high commission these preachers had been retained The press freed from all fear or reserve swarmed with productions dangerous by their seditious zeal and calumny more than by any art or eloquence of composition Noise and fury cant and hypocrisy formed the sole rhetoric which during this tumult of various prejudices and passions could be heard or attended to The sentence which had been executed against Prynne Bastwic and Burton now suffered a revisal from parliament These libellers far from being tamed by the rigorous punishments which they had undergone showed still a disposition of repeating their offence and the ministers were afraid lest new satires should issue from their prisons and still further inflame the prevailing discontents By an order therefore of council they had been carried to remote prisons Bastwic to Scilly Prynne to Jersey Burton to Guernsey all access to them was denied and the use of books and of pen ink and paper was refused them The sentence for these additional punishments was immediately reversed in an arbitrary manner by the commons even the first sentence upon examination was declared illegal and the judges who passed it were ordered to make reparation to the sufferers Nalson vol i p seven hundred eighty three May p seventy nine When the prisoners landed in England they were received and entertained with the highest demonstrations of affection were attended by a mighty confluence of company their charges were borne with great magnificence and liberal presents bestowed on them On their approach to any town all the inhabitants crowded to receive them and welcomed their reception with shouts and acclamations Their train still increased as they drew nigh to London Some miles from the city the zealots of their party met them in great multitudes and attended their triumphant entrance boughs were carried in this tumultuous procession the roads were strewed with flowers and amidst the highest exultations of joy were intermingled loud and virulent invectives against the prelates who had so cruelly persecuted such godly personages The more ignoble these men were the more sensible was the insult upon royal authority and the more dangerous was the spirit of disaffection and mutiny which it discovered among the people Lilburne Leighton and every one that had been punished for seditious libels during the preceding administration now recovered their liberty and were decreed damages from the judges and ministers of justice Not only the present disposition of the nation insured impunity to all libellers a new method of framing and dispersing libels was invented by the leaders of popular discontent Petitions to parliament were drawn craving redress against particular grievances and when a sufficient number of subscriptions was procured the petitions were presented to the commons and immediately published These petitions became secret bonds of association among the subscribers and seemed to give undoubted sanction and authority to the complaints which they contained It is pretended by historians favorable to the royal cause and is even asserted by the king himself in a declaration that a most disingenuous or rather criminal practice prevailed in conducting many of these addresses A petition was first framed moderate reasonable such as men of character willingly subscribed The names were afterwards torn off and affixed to another petition which served better the purposes of the popular faction We may judge of the wild fury which prevailed throughout the nation when so scandalous an imposture which affected such numbers of people could be openly practised without drawing infamy and ruin upon the managers Clarendon vol i p one hundred ninety nine two hundred et cetera Nalson vol i p five hundred seventy May p eighty Rushworth vol v p two hundred twenty eight Nalson vol i p eight hundred Dugdale Clarendon vol i p two hundred three Husb colonel p five hundred thirty six So many grievances were offered both by the members and by petitions without doors that the house was divided into above forty committees charged each of them with the examination of some particular violation of law and liberty which had been complained of Besides the general committees of religion trade privileges laws many subdivisions of these were framed and a strict scrutiny was every where carried on It is to be remarked that before the beginning of this century when the commons assumed less influence and authority complaints of grievances were usually presented to the house by any members who had had particular opportunity of observing them These general committees which were a kind of inquisitorial courts had not then been established and we find that the king in a former declaration complains loudly of this innovation so little favorable to royal authority But never was so much multiplied as at present the use of these committees and the commons though themselves the greatest innovators employed the usual artifice of complaining against innovations and pretending to recover the ancient and established government Published on dissolving the third parliament See Parl Hist vol viii p three hundred forty seven From the reports of their committees the house daily passed votes which mortified and astonished the court and inflamed and animated the nation Ship money was declared illegal and arbitrary the sentence against Hambden cancelled the court of York abolished compositions for knighthood stigmatized the enlargement of the forests condemned patents for monopolies annulled and every late measure of administration treated with reproach and obloquy To day a sentence of the star chamber was exclaimed against to morrow a decree of the high commission Every discretionary act of council was represented as arbitrary and tyrannical and the general inference was still inculcated that a formed design had been laid to subvert the laws and constitution of the kingdom From necessity the king remained entirely passive during all these violent operations The few servants who continued faithful to him were seized with astonishment at the rapid progress made by the commons in power and popularity and were glad by their inactive and inoffensive behavior to compound for impunity The torrent rising to so dreadful and unexpected a height despair seized all those who from interest or habit were most attached to monarchy And as for those who maintained their duty to the king merely from their regard to the constitution they seemed by their concurrence to swell that inundation which began already to deluge every thing You have taken the whole machine of government in pieces said Charles in a discourse to the parliament a practice frequent with skilful artists when they desire to clear the wheels from any rust which may have grown upon them The engine continued he may again be restored to its former use and motions provided it be put up entire so as not a pin of it be wanting But this was far from the intention of the commons The machine they thought with some reason was encumbered with many wheels and springs which retarded and crossed its operations and destroyed its utility Happy had they proceeded with moderation and been contented in their present plenitude of power to remove such parts only as might justly be deemed superfluous and incongruous In order to maintain that high authority which they had acquired the commons besides confounding and overawing their opponents judged it requisite to inspire courage into their friends and adherents particularly into the Scots and the religious Puritans to whose assistance and good offices they were already so much beholden No sooner were the Scots masters of the northern counties than they laid aside their first professions which they had not indeed means to support of paying for every thing and in order to prevent the destructive expedient of plunder and free quarters the country consented to give them a regular contribution of eight hundred and fifty pounds a day in full of their subsistence Rush vol iii p twelve ninety five The parliament that they might relieve the northern counties from so grievous a burden agreed to remit pay to the Scottish as well as to the English army and because subsidies would be levied too slowly for so urgent an occasion money was borrowed from the citizens upon the security of particular members Two subsidies a very small sum were at first voted and as the intention of this supply was to indemnify the members who by their private had supported public credit this pretence was immediately laid hold of and the money was ordered to be paid not into the treasury but to commissioners appointed by parliament a practice which as it diminished the authority of the crown was willingly embraced and was afterwards continued by the commons with regard to every branch of revenue which they granted to the king The invasion of the Scots had evidently been the cause of assembling the parliament the presence of their army reduced the king to that total subjection in which he was now held the commons for this reason openly professed their intention of retaining these invaders till all their own enemies should be suppressed and all their purposes effected We cannot yet spare the Scots said Strode plainly in the house the sons of Zeruiah are still too strong for us an allusion to a passage of Scripture according to the mode of that age Eighty thousand pounds a month were requisite for the subsistence of the two armies a sum much greater than the subject had ever been accustomed in any former period to pay to the public And though several subsidies together with a poll tax were from time to time voted to answer the charge the commons still took care to be in debt in order to render the continuance of the session the more necessary It appears that a subsidy was now fallen to fifty thousand pounds Dugdale p seventy one The Scots being such useful allies to the malecontent party in England no wonder they were courted with the most unlimited complaisance and the most important services The king having in his first speech called them rebels observed that he had given great offence to the parliament and he was immediately obliged to soften and even retract the expression The Scottish commissioners of whom the most considerable were the earl of Rothes and Lord Loudon found every advantage in conducting their treaty yet made no haste in bringing it to an issue They were lodged in the city and kept an intimate correspondence as well with the magistrates who were extremely disaffected as with the popular leaders in both houses saint Antholine s church was assigned them for their devotions and their chaplains here began openly to practise the Presbyterian form of worship which except in foreign languages had never hitherto been allowed any indulgence or toleration So violent was the general propensity towards this new religion that multitudes of all ranks crowded to the church Those who were so happy as to find access early in the morning kept their places the whole day those who were excluded clung to the doors or windows in hopes of catching at least some distant murmur or broken phrases of the holy rhetoric All the eloquence of parliament now well refined from pedantry animated with the spirit of liberty and employed in the most important interests was not attended to with such insatiable avidity as were these lectures delivered with ridiculous cant and a provincial accent full of barbarism and of ignorance The most effectual expedient for paying court to the zealous Scots was to promote the Presbyterian discipline and worship throughout England and to this innovation the popular leaders among the commons as well as their more devoted partisans were of themselves sufficiently inclined The Puritanical party whose progress though secret had hitherto been gradual in the kingdom taking advantage of the present disorders began openly to profess their tenets and to make furious attacks on the established religion The prevalence of that sect in the parliament discovered itself from the beginning by insensible but decisive symptoms Marshall and Burgess two Puritanical clergymen were chosen to preach before them and entertained them with discourses seven hours in length It being the custom of the house always to take the sacrament before they enter upon business they ordered as a necessary preliminary that the communion table should be removed from the east end of saint Margaret s into the middle of the area The name of the spiritual lords was commonly left out in acts of parliament and the laws ran in the name of king lords and commons The clerk of the upper house in reading bills turned his back on the bench of bishops nor was his insolence ever taken notice of Clarendon vol i p one hundred eighty nine Nalson vol i p five hundred thirty five hundred thirty three Nalson voL i p five hundred thirty seven On a day appointed for a solemn fast and humiliation all the orders of temporal peers contrary to former practice in going to church took place of the spiritual and Lord Spencer remarked that the humiliation that day seemed confined alone to the prelates Every meeting of the commons produced some vehement harangue against the usurpations of the bishops against the high commission against the late convocation against the new canons So disgusted were all lovers of civil liberty at the doctrines promoted by the clergy that these invectives were received without control and no distinction at first appeared between such as desired only to repress the exorbitancies of the hierarchy and such as pretended totally to annihilate episcopal jurisdiction Encouraged by these favorable appearances petitions against the church were framed in different parts of the kingdom The epithet of the ignorant and vicious priesthood was commonly applied to all churchmen addicted to the established discipline and worship though the episcopal clergy in England during that age seem to have been as they are at present sufficiently learned and exemplary An address against episcopacy was presented by twelve clergymen to the committee of religion and pretended to be signed by many hundreds of the Puritanical persuasion But what made most noise was the city petition for a total alteration of church government a petition to which fifteen thousand subscriptions were annexed and which was presented by Alderman Pennington the city member It is remarkable that among the many ecclesiastical abuses there complained of an allowance given by the licensers of books to publish a translation of Ovid s Art of Love is not forgotten by these rustic censors Notwithstanding the favorable disposition of the people the leaders in the house resolved to proceed with caution They introduced a bill for prohibiting all clergymen the exercise of any civil office As a consequence the bishops were to be deprived of their seats in the house of peers a measure not unacceptable to the zealous friends of liberty who observed with regret the devoted attachment of that order to the will of the monarch But when this bill was presented to the peers it was rejected by a great majority the first check which the commons had received in their popular career and a prognostic of what they might afterwards expect from the upper house whose inclinations and interests could never be totally separated from the throne Clarendon vol i p two hundred three Whitlocke p thirty seven Nalson vol i p six hundred sixty six Rush vol v p one hundred seventy one Clarendon vol i p two hundred thirty seven But to show how little they were discouraged the Puritans immediately brought in another bill for the total abolition of episcopacy though they thought proper to let that bill sleep at present in expectation of a more favorable opportunity of reviving it Among other acts of regal executive power which the commons were every day assuming they issued orders for demolishing all images altars crucifixes The zealous Sir Robert Harley to whom the execution of these orders was committed removed all crosses even out of streets and markets and from his abhorrence of that superstitious figure would not any where allow one piece of wood or stone to lie over another at right angles The bishop of Ely and other clergymen were attacked on account of innovations Cozens who had long been obnoxious was exposed to new censures This clergyman who was dean of Peterborough was extremely zealous for ecclesiastical ceremonies and so far from permitting the communicants to break the sacramental bread with their fingers a privilege on which the Puritans strenuously insisted he would not so much as allow it to be cut with an ordinary household instrument A consecrated knife must perform that sacred office and must never afterwards be profaned by any vulgar service Cozens likewise was accused of having said The king has no more authority in ecclesiastical matters than the boy who rubs my horse s heels v The expression was violent but it is certain that all those high churchmen who were so industrious in reducing the laity to submission were extremely fond of their own privileges and independency and were desirous of exempting the mitre from all subjection to the crown Clarendon vol i p two hundred thirty seven Whitlocke p forty five Rush vol v p three hundred fifty one Rush vol v p two hundred three v Parl Hist vol vii p two hundred eighty two Rush vol v p two hundred nine A committee was elected by the lower house as a court of inquisition upon the clergy and was commonly denominated the committee of scandalous ministers The politicians among the commons were apprised of the great importance of the pulpit for guiding the people the bigots were enraged against the prelatical clergy and both of them knew that no established government could be overthrown by strictly observing the principles of justice equity or clemency The proceedings therefore of this famous committee which continued for several years were cruel and arbitrary and made great havoc both on the church and the universities They began with harassing imprisoning and molesting the clergy and ended with sequestrating and ejecting them In order to join contumely to cruelty they gave the sufferers the epithet of scandalous and endeavored to render them as odious as they were miserable The greatest vices however which they could reproach to a great part of them were bowing at the name of Jesus placing the communion table in the east reading the king s orders for sports on Sunday and other practices which the established government both in church and state had strictly enjoined them It may be worth observing that all historians who lived near that age or what perhaps is more decisive all authors who have casually made mention of those public transactions still represent the civil disorders and convulsions as proceeding from religious controversy and consider the political disputes about power and liberty as entirely subordinate to the other It is true had the king been able to support government and at the same time to abstain from all invasion of national privileges it seems not probable that the Puritans ever could have acquired such authority as to overturn the whole constitution yet so entire was the subjection into which Charles was now fallen that had not the wound been poisoned by the infusion of theological hatred it must have admitted of an easy remedy Disuse of parliaments imprisonments and prosecution of members ship money an arbitrary administration these were loudly complained of but the grievances which tended chiefly to inflame the parliament and nation especially the latter were the surplice the rails placed about the altar the bows exacted on approaching it the liturgy the breach of the Sabbath embroidered copes lawn sleeves the use of the ring in marriage and of the cross in baptism On account of these were the popular leaders content to throw the government into such violent convulsions and to the disgrace of that age and of this island it must be acknowledged that the disorders in Scotland entirely and those in England mostly proceeded from so mean and contemptible an origin Clarendon vol i p one hundred ninety nine Whitlocke p one hundred twenty two May p eighty one Lord Clarendon vol i p two hundred thirty three says that the parliamentary party were not agreed about the entire abolition of episcopacy they were only the root and branch men as they were called who insisted on that measure But those who were willing to retain bishops insisted on reducing their authority to a low ebb as well as on abolishing the ceremonies of worship and vestments of the clergy The controversy therefore between the parties was almost wholly theological and that of the most frivolous and ridiculous kind Some persons partial to the patriots of this age have ventured to put them in a balance with the most illustrious characters of antiquity and mentioned the names of Pym Hambden Vane as a just parallel to those of Cato Brutus Cassius Profound capacity indeed undaunted courage extensive enterprise in these particulars perhaps the Roman do not much surpass the English worthies but what a difference when the discourse conduct conversation and private as well as public behavior of both are inspected Compare only one circumstance and consider its consequences The leisure of those noble ancients was totally employed in the study of Grecian eloquence and philosophy in the cultivation of polite letters and civilized society the whole discourse and language of the moderns were polluted with mysterious jargon and full of the lowest and most vulgar hypocrisy The laws as they stood at present protected the church but they exposed the Catholics to the utmost rage of the Puritans and these unhappy religionists so obnoxious to the prevailing sect could not hope to remain long unmolested The voluntary contribution which they had made in order to assist the king in his war against the Scottish Covenanters was inquired into and represented as the greatest enormity By an address from the commons all officers of that religion were removed from the army and application was made to the king for seizing two thirds of the lands of recusants a proportion to which by law he was entitled but which he had always allowed them to possess upon easy compositions The execution of the severe and bloody laws against priests was insisted on and one Goodman a Jesuit who was found in prison was condemned to a capital punishment Charles however agreeably to his usual principles scrupled to sign the warrant for his execution and the commons expressed great resentment on the occasion There remains a singular petition of Goodman begging to be hanged rather than prove a source of contention between the king and his people Rush vol v p one hundred sixty Rush vol v p one hundred fifty eight

was overlooked amidst affairs of greater consequence than that such unrelenting hatred would be softened by any consideration of his courage and generosity For some years Con a Scotchman afterwards Rosetti an Italian had openly resided at London and frequented the court as vested with a commission from the pope The queen s zeal and her authority with her husband had been the cause of this imprudence so offensive to the nation But the spirit of bigotry now rose too high to permit any longer such indulgences Hayward a justice of peace having been wounded when employed in the exercise of his office by one James a Catholic madman this enormity was ascribed to the Popery not to the frenzy of the assassin and great alarms seized the nation and parliament A universal conspiracy of the Papists was supposed to have taken place and every man for some days imagined that he had a sword at his throat Though some persons of family and distinction were still attached to the Catholic superstition it is certain that the numbers of that sect did not amount to the fortieth part of the nation and the frequent panics to which men during this period were so subject on account of the Catholics were less the effects of fear than of extreme rage and aversion entertained against them It is now known from the Clarendon papers that the king had also an authorized agent who resided at Rome His name was Bret and his chief business was to negotiate with the pope concerning indulgences to the Catholics and to engage the Catholics in return to be good and loyal subjects But this whole matter though very innocent was most carefully kept secret The king says that he believed Bret to be as much his as any Papist could be See p three hundred forty eight three hundred fifty four Bush vol v p three hundred one Clarendon vol i p two hundred forty nine Rush vol v p fifty seven The queen mother of France having been forced into banishment by some court intrigues had retired into England and expected shelter amidst her present distresses in the dominions of her daughter and son in law But though she behaved in the most inoffensive manner she was insulted by the populace on account of her religion and was even threatened with worse treatment The earl of Holland lieutenant of Middlesex had ordered a hundred musketeers to guard her but finding that they had imbibed the same prejudices with the rest of their countrymen and were unwillingly employed in such a service he laid the case before the house of peers for the king s authority was now entirely annihilated He represented the indignity of the action that so great a princess mother to the king of France and to the queens of Spain and England should be affronted by the multitude He observed the indelible reproach which would fall upon the nation if that unfortunate queen should suffer any violence from the misguided zeal of the people He urged the sacred rights of hospitality due to every one much more to a person in distress of so high a rank with whom the nation was so nearly connected The peers thought proper to communicate the matter to the commons whose authority over the people was absolute The commons agreed to the necessity of protecting the queen mother but at the same time prayed that she might be desired to depart the kingdom for the quieting those jealousies in the hearts of his majesty s well affected subjects occasioned by some ill instruments about that queen s person by the flowing of priests and Papists to her house and by the use and practice of the idolatry of the mass and exercise of other superstitious services of the Romish church to the great scandal of true religion Charles in the former part of his reign had endeavored to overcome the intractable and encroaching spirit of the commons by a perseverance in his own measures by a stately dignity of behavior and by maintaining at their utmost height and even perhaps stretching beyond former precedent the rights of his prerogative Finding by experience how unsuccessful those measures had proved and observing the low condition to which he was now reduced he resolved to alter his whole conduct and to regain the confidence of his people by pliableness by concessions and by a total conformity to their inclinations and prejudices It may safely be averred that this new extreme into which the king for want of proper counsel or support was fallen became no less dangerous to the constitution and pernicious to public peace than the other in which he had so long and so unfortunately persevered The pretensions with regard to tonnage and poundage were revived and with certain assurance of success by the commons Rush vol v p two hundred sixty seven It appears not that the commons though now entirely masters abolished the new impositions of James against which they had formerly so loudly complained a certain proof that the rates of customs settled by that prince were in most instances just and proportioned to the new price of commodities They seem rather to have been low See Journ tenth Aug sixteen twenty five The levying of these duties as formerly without consent of parliament and even increasing them at pleasure was such an incongruity in a free constitution where the people by their fundamental privileges cannot be taxed but by their own consent as could no longer be endured by these jealous patrons of liberty In the preamble therefore to the bill by which the commons granted these duties to the king they took care in the strongest and most positive terms to assert their own right of bestowing this gift and to divest the crown of all independent title of assuming it And that they might increase or rather finally fix the entire dependence and subjection of the king they voted these duties only for two months and afterwards from time to time renewed their grant for very short periods Charles in order to show that he entertained no intention ever again to separate himself from his parliament passed this important bill without any scruple or hesitation It was an instruction given by the house to the committee which framed one of these bills to take care that the rates upon exportation may be as light as possible and upon importation as heavy as trade will bear a proof that the nature of commerce began now to be understood Journ first June sixteen forty one Clarendon vol i p two hundred eight With regard to the bill for triennial parliaments he made a little difficulty By an old statute passed during the reign of Edward III it had been enacted that parliaments should be held once every year or more frequently if necessary but as no provision had been made in case of failure and no precise method pointed out for execution this statute had been considered merely as a general declaration and was dispensed with at pleasure The defect was supplied by those vigilant patriots who now assumed the reins of government It was enacted that if the chancellor who was first bound under severe penalties failed to issue writs by the third of September in every third year any twelve or more of the peers should be empowered to exert this authority in default of the peers that the sheriffs mayors bailiffs et cetera should summon the voters and in their default that the voters themselves should meet and proceed to the election of members in the same manner as if writs had been regularly issued from the crown Nor could the parliament after it was assembled be adjourned prorogued or dissolved without their own consent during the space of fifty days By this bill some of the noblest and most valuable prerogatives of the crown were retrenched but at the same time nothing could be more necessary than such a statute for completing a regular plan of law and liberty A great reluctance to assemble parliaments must be expected in the king where these assemblies as of late establish it as a maxim to carry their scrutiny into every part of government During long intermissions of parliament grievances and abuses as was found by recent experience would naturally creep in and it would even become necessary for the king and council to exert a great discretionary authority and by acts of state to supply in every emergence the legislative power whose meeting was so uncertain and precarious Charles finding that nothing less would satisfy his parliament and people at last gave his assent to this bill which produced so great an innovation in the constitution Solemn thanks were presented him by both houses Great rejoicings were expressed both in the city and throughout the nation And mighty professions were every where made of gratitude and mutual returns of supply and confidence This concession of the king it must be owned was not entirely voluntary it was of a nature too important to be voluntary The sole inference which his partisans were entitled to draw from the submissions so frankly made to present necessity was that he had certainly adopted a new plan of government and for the future was resolved by every indulgence to acquire the confidence and affections of his people Charles thought that what concessions were made to the public were of little consequence if no gratifications were bestowed on individuals who had acquired the direction of public counsels and determinations A change of ministers as well as of measures was therefore resolved on In one day several new privy counsellors were sworn the earls of Hertford Bedford Essex Bristol the lords Say Saville Kimbolton within a few days after was admitted the earl of Warwick All these noblemen were of the popular party and some of them afterwards when matters were pushed to extremities by the commons proved the greatest support of monarchy Clarendon vol i p two hundred nine Whitlocke p thirty nine Rush vol v p one hundred eighty nine Clarendon vol i p one hundred ninety five Juxon bishop of London who had never desired the treasurer s staff now earnestly solicited for leave to resign it and retire to the care of that turbulent diocese committed to him The king gave his consent and it is remarkable that during all the severe inquiries carried on against the conduct of ministers and prelates the mild and prudent virtues of this man who bore both these invidious characters remained unmolested It was intended that Bedford a popular man of great authority as well as wisdom and moderation should succeed Juxon but that nobleman unfortunately both for king and people died about this very time By some promotions place was made for saint John who was created solicitor general Hollis was to be made secretary of state in the room of Windebank who had fled Pym chancellor of the exchequer in the room of Lord Cottington who had resigned Lord Say master of the wards in the room of the same nobleman the earl of Essex governor and Hambden tutor to the prince Warwick p ninety five Clarendon vol i p two hundred ten two hundred eleven What retarded the execution of these projected changes was the difficulty of satisfying all those who from their activity and authority in parliament had pretensions for offices and who still had it in their power to embarrass and distress the public measures Their associates too in popularity whom the king intended to distinguish by his favor were unwilling to undergo the reproach of having driven a separate bargain and of sacrificing to their own ambitious views the cause of the nation And as they were sensible that they must owe their preferment entirely to their weight and consideration in parliament they were most of them resolved still to adhere to that assembly and both to promote its authority and to preserve their own credit in it On all occasions they had no other advice to give the king than to allow himself to be directed by his great council or in other words to resign himself passively to their guidance and government And Charles found that instead of acquiring friends by the honors and offices which he should bestow he should only arm his enemies with more power to hurt him The end on which the king was most intent in changing ministers was to save the life of the earl of Strafford and to mollify by these indulgences the rage of his most furious prosecutors But so high was that nobleman s reputation for experience and capacity that all the new counsellors and intended ministers plainly saw that if he escaped their vengeance he must return into favor and authority and they regarded his death as the only security which they could have both for the establishment of their present power and for success in their future enterprises His impeachment therefore was pushed on with the utmost vigor and after long and solemn preparations was brought to a final issue Immediately after Strafford was sequestered from parliament and confined in the Tower a committee of thirteen was chosen by the lower house and intrusted with the office of preparing a charge against him These joined to a small committee of lords were vested with authority to examine all witnesses to call for every paper and to use any means of scrutiny with regard to any part of the earl s behavior and conduct After so general and unbounded an inquisition exercised by such powerful and implacable enemies a man must have been very cautious or very innocent not to afford during the whole course of his life some matter of accusation against him This committee by direction from both houses took an oath of secrecy a practice very unusual and which gave them the appearance of conspirators more than ministers of justice But the intention of this strictness was to render it more difficult for the earl to elude their search or prepare for his justification Application was made to the king that he would allow this committee to examine privy counsellors with regard to opinions delivered at the board a concession which Charles unwarily made and which thenceforth banished all mutual confidence from the deliberations of council where every man is supposed to have entire freedom without fear of future punishment or inquiry of proposing any expedient questioning any opinion or supporting any argument Sir George Ratcliffe the earl s intimate friend and confidant was accused of high treason sent for from Ireland and committed to close custody As no charge ever appeared or was prosecuted against him it is impossible to give a more charitable interpretation to this measure than that the commons thereby intended to deprive Strafford in his present distress of the assistance of his best friend who was most enabled by his testimony to justify the innocence of his patron s conduct and behavior Clarendon vol i p one hundred ninety two Whitlocke p thirty seven Clarendon vol i p one hundred ninety three Clarendon vol i p two hundred fourteen When intelligence arrived in Ireland of the plans laid for Stafford s ruin the Irish house of commons though they had very lately bestowed ample praises on his administration entered into all the violent counsels against him and prepared a representation of the miserable state into which by his misconduct they supposed the kingdom to be fallen They sent over a committee to London to assist in the prosecution of their unfortunate governor and by intimations from this committee who entered into close confederacy with the popular leaders in England was every measure of the Irish parliament governed and directed Impeachments which were never prosecuted were carried up against Sir Richard Bolton the chancellor Sir Gerard Louther chief justice and Bramhall bishop of Derry This step which was an exact counterpart to the proceedings in England served also the same purposes it deprived the king of the ministers whom he most trusted it discouraged and terrified all the other ministers and it prevented those persons who were best acquainted with Strafford s counsels from giving evidence in his favor before the English parliament The bishops being forbidden by the ancient canons to assist in trials for life and being unwilling by any opposition to irritate the commons who were already much prejudiced against them thought proper of themselves to withdraw The commons also voted that the new created peers ought to have no voice in this trial because the accusation being agreed to while they were commoners their consent to it was implied with that of all the commons of England Notwithstanding this decision which was meant only to deprive Strafford of so many friends Lord Seymour and some others still continued to keep their seat nor was their right to it any further questioned To bestow the greater solemnity on this important trial scaffolds were erected in Westminster Hall where both houses sat the one as accusers the other as judges Besides the chair of state a close gallery was prepared for the king and queen who attended during the whole trial Rush vol v p two hundred fourteen Clarendon vol i p two hundred sixteen Clarendon vol i p two hundred sixteen Whitlocke p forty Rush vol iv p eleven May p ninety An accusation carried on by the united effort of three kingdoms against one man unprotected by power unassisted by counsel discountenanced by authority was likely to prove a very unequal contest yet such were the capacity genius presence of mind displayed by this magnanimous statesman that while argument and reason and law had any place he obtained an undisputed victory And he perished at last overwhelmed and still unsubdued by the open violence of his fierce and unrelenting antagonists The articles of impeachment against Strafford are twenty eight in number and regard his conduct as president of the council of York as deputy or lieutenant of Ireland and as counsellor or commander in England But though four months were employed by the managers in framing the accusation and all Strafford s answers were extemporary it appears from comparison not only that he was free from the crime of treason of which there is not the least appearance but that his conduct making allowance for human infirmities exposed to such severe scrutiny was innocent and even laudable The powers of the northern council while he was president had been extended by the king s instructions beyond what formerly had been practised but that court being at first instituted by a stretch of royal prerogative it had been usual for the prince to vary his instructions and the largest authority committed to it was altogether as legal as the most moderate and most limited Nor was it reasonable to conclude that Strafford had used any art to procure those extensive powers since he never once sat as president or exercised one act of jurisdiction after he was invested with the authority so much complained of In the government of Ireland his administration had been equally promotive of his master s interest and that of the subjects committed to his care A large debt he had paid off he had left a considerable sum in the exchequer the revenue which never before answered the charges of government was now raised to be equal to them A small standing army formerly kept in no order was augmented and was governed by exact discipline and a great force was there raised and paid for the support of the king s authority against the Scottish covenanters Bush vol iv p one hundred forty five Bush vol v p one hundred twenty two hundred forty seven Warwick p one hundred fifteen Industry and all the arts of peace were introduced among that rude people the shipping of the kingdom augmented a hundred fold the customs tripled upon the same rates the exports double in value to the imports manufactures particularly that of linen introduced and promoted agriculture by means of the English and Scottish plantations gradually advancing the Protestant religion encouraged without the persecution or discontent of the Catholics Nelson vol ii p forty five Rush vol iv p one hundred twenty four Warwick p one hundred fifteen The springs of authority he had enforced without overstraining them Discretionary acts of jurisdiction indeed he had often exerted by holding courts martial billetting soldiers deciding causes upon paper petitions before the council issuing proclamations and punishing their infraction But discretionary authority during that age was usually exercised even in England In Ireland it was still more requisite among a rude people not yet thoroughly subdued averse to the religion and manners of their conquerors ready on all occasions to relapse into rebellion and disorder While the managers of the commons demanded every moment that the deputy s conduct should be examined by the line of rigid law and severe principles he appealed still to the practice of all former deputies and to the uncontrollable necessity of his situation So great was his art of managing elections and balancing parties that he had engaged the Irish parliament to vote whatever was necessary both for the payment of former debts and for support of the new levied army nor had he ever been reduced to the illegal expedients practised in England for the supply of public necessities No imputation of rapacity could justly lie against his administration Some instances of imperious expressions and even actions may be met with The case of Lord Mountnorris of all those which were collected with so much industry is the most flagrant and the least excusable It had been reported at the table of Lord Chancellor Loftus that Annesley one of the deputy s attendants in moving a stool had sorely hurt his master s foot who was at that time afflicted with the gout Perhaps said Mountnorris who was present at table it was done in revenge of that public affront which my lord deputy formerly put upon him but he has a brother who would not have taken such a revenge This casual and seemingly innocent at least ambiguous expression was reported to Stafford who on pretence that such a suggestion might prompt Annesley to avenge himself in another manner ordered Mountnorris who was an officer to be tried by a court martial for mutiny and sedition against his general The court which consisted of the chief officers of the army found the crime to be capital and condemned that nobleman to lose his head In vain did Strafford plead in his own defence against this article of impeachment that the sentence of Mountnorris was the deed and that too unanimous of the court not the act of the deputy that he spake not to a member of the court nor voted in the cause but sat uncovered as a party and then immediately withdrew to leave them to their freedom that sensible of the iniquity of the sentence he procured his majesty s free pardon to Mountnorris and that he did not even keep that nobleman a moment in suspense with regard to his fate but instantly told him that he himself would sooner lose his right hand than execute such a sentence nor was his lordship s life in any danger In vain did Strafford s friends add as a further apology that Mountnorris was a man of an infamous character who paid court by the lowest adulation to all deputies while present and blackened their character by the vilest calumnies when recalled and that Strafford expecting like treatment had used this expedient for no other purpose than to subdue the petulant spirit of the man These excuses alleviate the guilt but there still remains enough to prove that the mind of the deputy though great and firm had been not a little debauched by the riot of absolute power and uncontrolled authority When Strafford was called over to England he found every thing falling into such confusion by the open rebellion of the Scots and the secret discontents of the English that if he had counselled or executed any violent measure he might perhaps have been able to apologize for his conduct from the great law of necessity which admits not while the necessity is extreme of any scruple ceremony or delay But in fact no illegal advice or action was proved against him and the whole amount of his guilt during this period was some peevish or at most imperious expressions which amidst such desperate extremities and during a bad state of health had unhappily fallen from him Rush vol iv p one hundred eighty seven Rush vol iv p five hundred fifty nine If Strafford s apology was in the main so satisfactory when he pleaded to each particular article of the charge his victory was still more decisive when he brought the whole together and repelled the imputation of treason the crime which the commons would infer from the full view of his conduct and behavior Of all species of guilt the law of England had with the most scrupulous exactness defined that of treason because on that side it was found most necessary to protect the subject against the violence of the king and of his ministers In the famous statute of Edward III all the kinds of treason are enumerated and every other crime besides such as are there expressly mentioned is carefully excluded from that appellation But with regard to this guilt an endeavor to subvert the fundamental laws the statute of treasons is totally silent and arbitrarily to introduce it into the fatal catalogue is itself a subversion of all law and under color of defending liberty reverses a statute the best calculated for the security of liberty that had ever been enacted by an English parliament As this species of treason discovered by the commons is entirely new and unknown to the laws so is the species of proof by which they pretend to fix that guilt upon the prisoner They have invented a kind of accumulative or constructive evidence by which many actions either totally innocent in themselves or criminal in a much inferior degree shall when united amount to treason and subject the person to the highest penalties inflicted by the law A hasty and unguarded word a rash and passionate action assisted by the malevolent fancy of the accuser and tortured by doubtful constructions is transmuted into the deepest guilt and the lives and fortunes of the whole nation no longer protected by justice are subjected to arbitrary will and pleasure Where has this species of guilt lain so long concealed said Strafford in conclusion Where has this fire been so long buried during so many centuries that no smoke should appear till it burst out at once to consume me and my children Better it were to live under no law at all and by the maxims of cautious prudence to conform ourselves the best we can to the arbitrary will of a master than fancy we have a law on which we can rely and find at last that this law shall inflict a punishment precedent to the promulgation and try us by maxims unheard of till the very moment of the prosecution If I sail on the Thames and split my vessel on an anchor in case there be no buoy to give warning the party shall pay me damages but if the anchor be marked out then is the striking on it at my own peril Where is the mark set upon this crime where the token by which I should discover it It has lain concealed under water and no human prudence no human innocence could save me from the destruction with which I am at present threatened It is now full two hundred and forty years since treasons were defined and so long has it been since any man was touched to this extent upon this crime before myself We have lived my lords happily to ourselves at home we have lived gloriously abroad to the world let us be content with what our fathers have left us let not our ambition carry us to be more learned than they were in these killing and destructive arts Great wisdom it will be in your lordships and just providence for yourselves for your posterities for the whole kingdom to cast from you into the fire these bloody and mysterious volumes of arbitrary and constructive treasons as the primitive Christians did their books of curious arts and betake yourselves to the plain letter of the statute which tells you where the crime is and points out to you the path by which you may avoid it Let us not to our own destruction awake those sleeping lions by rattling up a company of old records which have lain for so many ages by the wall forgotten and neglected To all my afflictions add not this my lords the most severe of any that I for my other sins not for my treasons be the means of introducing a precedent so pernicious to the laws and liberties of my native country However these gentlemen at the bar say they speak for the commonwealth and they believe so yet under favor it is I who in this particular speak for the commonwealth Precedents like those which are endeavored to be established against me must draw along such inconveniencies and miseries that in a few years the kingdom will be in the condition expressed in a statute of Henry IV and no man shall know by what rule to govern his words and actions Impose not my lords difficulties insurmountable upon ministers of state nor disable them from serving with cheerfulness their king and country If you examine them and under such severe penalties by every grain by every little weight the scrutiny will be intolerable The public affairs of the kingdom must be left waste and no wise man who has any honor or fortune to lose will ever engage himself in such dreadful such unknown perils My lords I have now troubled your lordships a great deal longer than I should have done Were it not for the interest of these pledges which a saint in heaven left me I should be loath Here he pointed to his children and his weeping stopped him What I forfeit for myself it is nothing but I confess that my indiscretion should forfeit for them it wounds me very deeply You will be pleased to pardon my infirmity something I should have said but I see I shall not be able and therefore I shall leave it And now my lords I thank God I have been by his blessing sufficiently instructed in the extreme vanity of all temporary enjoyments compared to the importance of our eternal duration And so my lords even so with all humility and with all tranquillity of mind I submit clearly and freely to your judgments and whether that righteous doom shall be to life or death I shall repose myself full of gratitude and confidence in the arms of the great Author of my existence Certainly says Whitlocke with his usual candor never any man acted such a part on such a theatre with more wisdom constancy and eloquence with greater reason judgment and temper and with a better grace in all his words and actions than did this great and excellent person and he moved the hearts of all his auditors some few excepted to remorse and pity It is remarkable that the historian who expresses himself in these terms was himself chairman of that committee which conducted the impeachment against this unfortunate statesman The accusation and defence lasted eighteen days The managers divided the several articles among them and attacked the prisoner with all the weight of authority with all the vehemence of rhetoric with all the accuracy of long preparation Strafford was obliged to speak with deference and reserve towards his most inveterate enemies the commons the Scottish nation and the Irish parliament He took only a very short time on each article to recollect himself yet he alone without assistance mixing modesty and humility with firmness and vigor made such a defence that the commons saw it impossible by a legal prosecution ever to obtain a sentence against him Rush vol iv p fifty nine et cetera Page forty one But the death of Stafford was too important a stroke of party to be left unattempted by any expedient however extraordinary Besides the great genius and authority of that minister he had threatened some of the popular leaders with an impeachment and had he not himself been suddenly prevented by the impeachment of the commons he had that very day it was thought charged Pym Hambden and others with treason for having invited the Scots to invade England A bill of attainder was therefore brought into the lower house immediately after finishing these pleadings and preparatory to it a new proof of the earl s guilt was produced in order to remove such scruples as might be entertained with regard to a method of proceeding so unusual and irregular Sir Henry Vane secretary had taken some notes of a debate in council after the dissolution of the last parliament and being at a distance he had sent the keys of his cabinet as was pretended to his son Sir Henry in order to search for some papers which were necessary for completing a marriage settlement Young Vane falling upon this paper of notes deemed the matter of the utmost importance and immediately communicated it to Pym who now produced the paper before the house of commons The question before the council was Offensive or defensive war with the Scots The king proposes this difficulty But how can I undertake offensive war if I have no more money The answer ascribed to Strafford was in these words Borrow of the city a hundred thousand pounds go on vigorously to levy ship money Your majesty having tried the affections of your people you are absolved and loose from all rules of government and may do what power will admit Your majesty having tried all ways shall be acquitted before God and man And you have an army in Ireland which you may employ to reduce this kingdom to obedience for I am confident the Scots cannot hold out five months There followed some counsels of Laud and Cottington equally violent with regard to the king s being absolved from all rules of government Clarendon vol i p two hundred twenty three two hundred twenty nine two hundred thirty et cetera Whitlocke p forty one May p ninety three This paper with all the circumstances of its discovery and communication was pretended to be equivalent to two witnesses and to be an unanswerable proof of those pernicious counsels of Strafford which tended to the subversion of the laws and constitution It was replied by Strafford and his friends that old Vane was his most inveterate and declared enemy and if the secretary himself as was by far most probable had willingly delivered to his son this paper of notes to be communicated to Pym this implied such a breach of oaths and of trust as rendered him totally unworthy of all credit that the secretary s deposition was at first exceedingly dubious upon two examinations he could not remember any such words even the third time his testimony was not positive but imported only that Strafford had spoken such or suchlike words and words may be very like in sound and differ much in sense nor ought the lives of men to depend upon grammatical criticisms of any expressions much less of those which had been delivered by the speaker without premeditation and committed by the hearer for any time however short to the uncertain record of memory that in the present case changing this kingdom into that kingdom a very slight alteration the earl s discourse could regard nothing but Scotland and implies no advice unworthy of an English counsellor that even retaining the expression this kingdom the words may fairly be understood of Scotland which alone was the kingdom that the debate regarded and which alone had thrown off allegiance and could be reduced to obedience that it could be proved as well by the evidence of all the king s ministers as by the known disposition of the forces that the intention never was to land the Irish army in England but in Scotland that of six other counsellors present Laud and Windebank could give no evidence Northumberland Hamilton Cottington and Juxon could recollect no such expression and the advice was too remarkable to be easily forgotten that it was nowise probable such a desperate counsel would be openly delivered at the board and before Northumberland a person of that high rank and whose attachments to the court were so much weaker than his connections with the country That though Northumberland and he alone had recollected some such expression as that of being absolved from rules of government yet in such desperate extremities as those into which the king and kingdom were then fallen a maxim of that nature allowing it to be delivered by Strafford may be defended upon principles the most favorable to law and liberty and that nothing could be more iniquitous than to extract an accusation of treason from an opinion simply proposed at the council table where all freedom of debate ought to be permitted and where it was not unusual for the members in order to draw forth the sentiments of others to propose counsels very remote from their own secret advice and judgment The evidence of Secretary Vane though exposed to such unsurmountable objections was the real cause of Strafford unhappy fate and made the bill of attainder pass the commons with no greater opposition than that of fifty nine dissenting votes But there remained two other branches of the legislature the king and the lords whose assent was requisite and these if left to their free judgment it was easily foreseen would reject the bill without scruple or deliberation To overcome this difficulty the popular leaders employed expedients for which they were beholden partly to their own industry partly to the indiscretion of their adversaries Next Sunday after the bill passed the commons the Puritanical pulpits resounded with declamations concerning the necessity of executing justice upon great delinquents The populace took the alarm About six thousand men armed with swords and cudgels flocked from the city and surrounded the houses of parliament The names of the fifty nine commoners who had voted against the bill of attainder were posted up under the title of Straffordians and betrayers of their country These were exposed to all the insults of the ungovernable multitude When any of the lords passed the cry for justice against Strafford resounded in their ears and such as were suspected of friendship to that obnoxious minister were sure to meet with menaces not unaccompanied with symptoms of the most desperate resolutions in the furious populace Complaints in the house of commons being made against these violences as the most flagrant breach of privilege the ruling members by their affected coolness and indifference showed plainly that the popular tumults were not disagreeable to them v But a new discovery made about this time served to throw every thing into still greater flame and combustion Rush vol iv p five hundred sixty Whitlocke p forty three Whitlocke p forty three Clarendon vol i p two hundred thirty two two hundred fifty six Rush vol v p two hundred forty eight twelve seventy nine v Whitlocke ut supra Some principal officers Piercy Jermyn O Neale Goring Wilmot Pollard Ashburnham partly attached to the court partly disgusted with the parliament had formed a plan of engaging into the king s service the English army whom they observed to be displeased at some marks of preference given by the commons to the Scots For this purpose they entered into an association took an oath of secrecy and kept a close correspondence with some of the king s servants The form of a petition to the king and parliament was concerted and it was intended to get this petition subscribed by the army The petitioners there represent the great and unexampled concessions made by the king for the security of public peace and liberty the endless demands of certain insatiable and turbulent spirits whom nothing less will content than a total subversion of the ancient constitution the frequent tumults which these factious malecontents had excited and which endangered the liberty of parliament To prevent these mischiefs the army offered to come up and guard that assembly So shall the nation as they express themselves in the conclusion not only be vindicated from preceding innovations but be secured from the future which are threatened and which are likely to produce more dangerous effects than the former The draught of this petition being conveyed to the king he was prevailed on somewhat imprudently to countersign it himself as a mark of his approbation But as several difficulties occurred the project was laid aside two months before any public discovery was made of it It was Goring who betrayed the secret to the popular leaders The alarm may easily be imagined which this intelligence conveyed Petitions from the military to the civil power are always looked on as disguised or rather undisguised commands and are of a nature widely different from petitions presented by any other rank of men Pym opened the matter in the house On the first intimation of a discovery Piercy concealed himself and Jermyn withdrew beyond sea This further confirmed the suspicion of a dangerous conspiracy Goring delivered his evidence before the house Piercy wrote a letter to his brother Northumberland confessing most of the particulars Both their testimonies agree with regard to the oath of secrecy and as this circumstance had been denied by Pollard Ashburnham and Wilmot in all their examinations it was regarded as a new proof of some desperate resolutions which had been taken Clarendon vol i p two hundred forty seven Whitlocke p forty three Rush vol v p two hundred forty Rush vol v p two hundred fifty five To convey more quickly the terror and indignation at this plot the commons voted that a protestation should be signed by all the members It was sent up to the lords and signed by all of them except Southampton and Robarts Orders were given by the commons alone without other authority that it should be subscribed by the whole nation The protestation was in itself very inoffensive even insignificant and contained nothing but general declarations that the subscribers would defend their religion and liberties But it tended to increase the popular panic and intimated what was more expressly declared in the preamble that these blessings were now exposed to the utmost peril Alarms were every day given of new conspiracies In Lancashire great multitudes of Papists were assembling secret meetings were held by them in caves and under ground in Surrey they had entered into a plot to blow up the river with gunpowder in order to drown the city provisions of arms were making beyond sea sometimes France sometimes Denmark was forming designs against the kingdom and the populace who are always terrified with present and enraged with distant dangers were still further animated in their demands of justice against the unfortunate Strafford The king came to the house of lords and though he expressed his resolution for which he offered them any security never again to employ Strafford in any branch of public business he professed himself totally dissatisfied with regard to the circumstance of treason and on that account declared his difficulty in giving his assent to the bill of attainder The commons took fire and voted it a breach of privilege for the king to take notice of any bill depending before the houses Charles did not perceive that his attachment to Strafford was the chief motive for the bill and that the greater proofs he gave of anxious concern for this minister the more inevitable did he render his destruction About eighty peers had constantly attended Strafford s trial but such apprehensions were entertained on account of the popular tumults that only forty five were present when the bill of attainder was brought into the house Yet of these nineteen had the courage to vote against it v a certain proof that if entire freedom had been allowed the bill had been rejected by a great majority Clarendon vol i p two hundred fifty two Rush vol v p two hundred forty one Warwick p one hundred eighty Dugdale p sixty nine Franklyn p nine hundred one Sir Edward Walker p three hundred forty nine Rush vol v p two hundred thirty nine v Whitlocke p forty three In carrying up the bill to the lords saint John the solicitor general advanced two topics well suited to the fury of the times that though the testimony against Strafford were not clear yet in this way of bill private satisfaction to each man s conscience was sufficient even should no evidence at all be produced and that the earl had no title to plead law because he had broken the law It is true added he we give law to hares and deer for they are beasts of chase but it was never accounted either cruel or unfair to destroy foxes or wolves wherever they can be found for they are beasts of prey After popular violence had prevailed over the lords the same battery was next applied to force the king s assent The populace flocked about Whitehall and accompanied their demand of justice with the loudest clamors and most open menaces Rumors of conspiracies against the parliament were anew spread abroad invasions and insurrections talked of and the whole nation was raised into such a ferment as threatened some great and imminent convulsion On whichever side the king cast his eyes he saw no resource or security All his servants consulting their own safety rather than their master s honor declined interposing with their advice between him and his parliament The queen terrified with the appearance of so mighty a danger and bearing formerly no good will to Strafford was in tears and pressed him to satisfy his people in this demand which it was hoped would finally content them Juxon alone whose courage was not inferior to his other virtues ventured to advise him if in his conscience he did not approve of the bill by no means to assent to it Strafford hearing of Charles s irresolution and anxiety took a very extraordinary step he wrote a letter in which he entreated the king for the sake of public peace to put an end to his unfortunate however innocent life and to quiet the tumultuous people by granting them the request for which they were so importunate Clarendon vol i p two hundred thirty two Clarendon vol i p two hundred fifty seven Warwick p one hundred sixty Clarendon vol i p two hundred fifty eight Rush vol v p two hundred fifty one In this added he my consent will more acquit you to God than all the world can do besides To a willing man there is no injury And as by God s grace I forgive all the world with a calmness and meekness of infinite contentment to my dislodging soul so sir to you I can resign the life of this world with all imaginable cheerfulness in the just acknowledgment of your exceeding favors Perhaps Strafford hoped that this unusual instance of generosity would engage the king still more strenuously to protect him perhaps he gave his life for lost and finding himself in the hands of his enemies and observing that Balfour the lieutenant of the Tower was devoted to the popular party he absolutely despaired of ever escaping the multiplied dangers with which he was every way environed We might ascribe this step to a noble effort of disinterestedness not unworthy the great mind of Strafford if the measure which he advised had not been in the event as pernicious to his master as it was immediately fatal to himself six Whitlocke p forty four Franklyn p eight hundred ninety six See note F at the end of the volume After the most violent anxiety and doubt Charles at last granted a commission to four noblemen to give the royal assent in his name to the bill flattering himself probably in this extremity of distress that as neither his will consented to the deed nor was his hand immediately engaged in it he was the more free from all the guilt which attended it These commissioners he empowered at the same time to give his assent to the bill which rendered the parliament perpetual The commons from policy rather than necessity had embraced the expedient of paying the two armies by borrowing money from the city and these loans they had repaid afterwards by taxes levied upon the people The citizens either of themselves or by suggestion began to start difficulties with regard to a further loan which was demanded We make no scruple of trusting the parliament said they were we certain that the parliament were to continue till our repayment But in the present precarious situation of affairs what security can be given us for our money In pretence of obviating this objection a bill was suddenly brought into the house and passed with great unanimity and rapidity that the parliament should not be dissolved prorogued or adjourned without their own consent It was hurried in like manner through the house of peers and was instantly carried to the king for his assent Charles in the agony of grief shame and remorse for Strafford s doom perceived not that this other bill was of still more fatal consequence to his authority and rendered the power of his enemies perpetual as it was already uncontrollable In comparison of the bill of attainder by which he deemed himself an accomplice in his friend s murder this concession made no figure in his eyes seven a circumstance which if it lessen our idea of his resolution or penetration serves to prove the integrity of his heart and the goodness of his disposition It is indeed certain that strong compunction for his consent to Strafford s execution attended this unfortunate prince during the remainder of his life and even at his own fatal end the memory of this guilt with great sorrow and remorse recurred upon him All men were so sensible of the extreme violence which was done him that he suffered the less both in character and interest from this unhappy measure and though he abandoned his best friend yet was he still able to preserve in some degree the attachment of all his adherents Secretary Carleton was sent by the king to inform Strafford of the final resolution which necessity had extorted from him The earl seemed surprised and starting up exclaimed in the words of Scripture Put not your trust in princes nor in the sons of men for in them there is no salvation He was soon able however to collect his courage and he prepared himself to suffer the fatal sentence Only three days interval was allowed him The king who made a new effort in his behalf and sent by the hands of the young prince a letter addressed to the peers in which he entreated them to confer with the commons about a mitigation of Strafford s sentence and begged at least for some delay was refused in both requests Strafford in passing from his apartment to Tower Hill where the scaffold was erected stopped under Laud s windows with whom he had long lived in intimate friendship and entreated the assistance of his prayers in those awful moments which were approaching The aged primate dissolved in tears and having pronounced with a broken voice a tender blessing on his departing friend sunk into the arms of his attendants v Stafford still superior to his fate moved on with an elated countenance and with an air even of greater dignity than what usually attended him Clarendon vol i p two hundred sixty one two hundred sixty two Rush vol v p two hundred sixty four See note G at the end of the volume Whitlocke p forty four Rush vol v p two hundred sixty five v Nalson vol ii p one hundred ninety eight He wanted that consolation which commonly supports those who perish by the stroke of injustice and oppression he was not buoyed up by glory nor by the affectionate compassion of the spectators yet his mind erect and undaunted found resources within itself and maintained its unbroken resolution amidst the terrors of death and the triumphant exultations of his misguided enemies His discourse on the scaffold was full of decency and courage He feared he said that the omen was bad for the intended reformation of the state that it commenced with the shedding of innocent blood Having bid a last adieu to his brother and friends who attended him and having sent a blessing to his nearer relations who were absent And now said he I have nigh done One stroke will make my wife a widow my dear children fatherless deprive my poor servants of their indulgent master and separate me from my affectionate brother and all my friends But let God be to you and them all in all Going to disrobe and prepare himself for the block I thank God said he that I am nowise afraid of death nor am daunted with any terrors but do as cheerfully lay down my head at this time as ever I did when going to repose With one blow was a period put to his life by the executioner Thus perished in the forty ninth year of his age the earl of Strafford one of the most eminent personages that has appeared in England Though his death was loudly demanded as a satisfaction to justice and an atonement for the many violations of the constitution it may safely be affirmed that the sentence by which he fell was an enormity greater than the worst of those which his implacable enemies prosecuted with so much cruel industry The people in their rage had totally mistaken the proper object of their resentment All the necessities or more properly speaking the difficulties by which the king had been induced to use violent expedients for raising supply were the result of measures previous to Strafford s favor and if they arose from ill conduct he at least was entirely innocent Even those violent expedients themselves which occasioned the complaint that the constitution was subverted had been all of them conducted so far as appeared without his counsel or assistance And whatever his private advice might be this salutary maxim he failed not often and publicly to inculcate in the king s presence that if any inevitable necessity ever obliged the sovereign to violate the laws this license ought to be practised with extreme reserve and as soon as possible a just atonement be made to the constitution for any injury which it might sustain from such dangerous precedents The first parliament after the restoration reversed the bill of attainder and even a few weeks after Strafford s execution this very parliament remitted to his children the more severe consequences of his sentence as if conscious of the violence with which the prosecution had been conducted Rush vol v p two hundred sixty seven That Strafford was secretly no enemy to arbitrary counsels appears from some of his letters and despatches particularly vol ii p sixty where he seems to wish that a standing army were established Rush vol iv p five hundred sixty seven five hundred sixty eight five hundred sixty nine five hundred seventy In vain did Charles expect as a return for so many instances of unbounded compliance that the parliament would at last show him some indulgence and would cordially fall into that unanimity to which at the expense of his own power and of his friend s life he so earnestly courted them All his concessions were poisoned by their suspicion of his want of cordiality and the supposed attempt to engage the army against them served with many as a confirmation of this jealousy It was natural for the king to seek some resource while all the world seemed to desert him or combine against him and this probably was the utmost of that embryo scheme which was formed with regard to the army But the popular leaders still insisted that a desperate plot was laid to bring up the forces immediately and offer violence to the parliament a design of which Piercy s evidence acquits the king and which the near neighborhood of the Scottish army seems to render absolutely impracticable By means however of these suspicions was the same implacable spirit still kept alive and the commons without giving the king any satisfaction in the settlement of his revenue proceeded to carry their inroads with great vigor into his now defenceless prerogative The project of bringing up the army to London according to Piercy was proposed to the king but he rejected it as foolish because the Scots who were in arms and lying in their neighborhood must be at London as soon as the English army This reason is so solid and convincing that it leaves no room to doubt of the veracity of Piercy s evidence and consequently acquits the king of this terrible plot of bringing up the army which made such a noise at the time and was a pretence for so many violences Clarendon vol i p two hundred sixty six The two ruling passions of this parliament were zeal for liberty and an aversion to the church and to both of these nothing could appear more exceptionable than the court of high commission whose institution rendered it entirely arbitrary and assigned to it the defence of the ecclesiastical establishment The star chamber also was a court which exerted high discretionary powers and had no precise rule or limit either with regard to the causes which came under its jurisdiction or the decisions which it formed A bill unanimously passed the houses to abolish these two courts and in them to annihilate the principal and most dangerous articles of the king s prerogative By the same bill the jurisdiction of the council was regulated and its authority abridged Charles hesitated before he gave his assent But finding that he had gone too far to retreat and that he possessed no resource in case of a rupture he at last affixed the royal sanction to this excellent bill But to show the parliament that he was sufficiently apprised of the importance of his grant he observed to them that this statute altered in a great measure the fundamental laws ecclesiastical and civil which many of his predecessors had established Clarendon vol i p two hundred eighty three two hundred eighty four Whitlocke p forty seven Rush vol iii p thirteen eighty three thirteen eighty four Rush vol v p thirty By removing the star chamber the king s power of binding the people by his proclamations was indirectly abolished and that important branch of prerogative the strong symbol of arbitrary power and unintelligible in a limited constitution being at last removed left the system of government more consistent and uniform The star chamber alone was accustomed to punish infractions of the king s edicts but as no courts of judicature now remained except those in Westminster Hall which take cognizance only of common and statute law the king may thenceforth issue proclamations but no man is bound to obey them It must however be confessed that the experiment here made by the parliament was not a little rash and adventurous No government at that time appeared in the world nor is perhaps to be found in the records of any history which subsisted without the mixture of some arbitrary authority committed to some magistrate and it might reasonably beforehand appear doubtful whether human society could ever reach that state of perfection as to support itself with no other control than the general and rigid maxims of law and equity But the parliament justly thought that the king was too eminent a magistrate to be trusted with discretionary power which he might so easily turn to the destruction of liberty And in the event it has hitherto been found that though some sensible inconveniencies arise from the maxim of adhering strictly to law yet the advantages overbalance them and should render the English grateful to the memory of their ancestors who after repeated contests at last established that noble though dangerous principle At the request of the parliament Charles instead of the patents during pleasure gave all the judges patents during their good behavior a circumstance of the greatest moment towards securing their independency and barring the entrance of arbitrary power into the ordinary courts of judicature The marshal s court which took cognizance of offensive words and was not thought sufficiently limited by law was also for that reason abolished The stannary courts which exercised jurisdiction over the miners being liable to a like objection underwent a like fate The abolition of the council of the north and the council of Wales followed from the same principles The authority of the clerk of the market who had a general inspection over the weights and measures throughout the kingdom was transferred to the mayors sheriffs and ordinary magistrates May p one hundred seven Nalson vol i p seven hundred seventy eight In short if we take a survey of the transactions of this memorable parliament during the first period of its operations we shall find that excepting Strafford s attainder which was a complication of cruel iniquity their merits in other respects so much outweigh their mistakes as to entitle them to praise from all lovers of liberty Not only were former abuses remedied and grievances redressed great provision for the future was made by law against the return of like complaints And if the means by which they obtained such advantages savor often of artifice sometimes of violence it is to be considered that revolutions of government cannot be effected by the mere force of argument and reasoning and that factions being once excited men can neither so firmly regulate the tempers of others nor their own as to insure themselves against all exorbitances The parliament now came to a pause The king had promised his Scottish subjects that he would this summer pay them a visit in order to settle their government and though the English parliament was very importunate with him that he should lay aside that journey they could not prevail with him so much as to delay it As he must necessarily in his journey have passed through the troops of both nations the commons seem to have entertained great jealousy on that account and to have now hurried on as much as they formerly delayed the disbanding of the armies The arrears therefore of the Scots were fully paid them and those of the English in part The Scots returned home and the English were separated into their several counties and dismissed After this the parliament adjourned to the twentieth of October and a committee of both houses a thing unprecedented was appointed to sit during the recess with very ample powers Pym was elected chairman of the committee of the lower house Further attempts were made by the parliament while it sat and even by the commons alone for assuming sovereign executive powers and publishing their ordinances as they called them instead of laws The committee too on their part was ready to imitate the example A small committee of both houses was appointed to attend the king into Scotland in order as was pretended to see that the articles of pacification were executed but really to be spies upon him and extend still further the ideas of parliamentary authority as well as eclipse the majesty of the king The earl of Bedford Lord Howard Sir Philip Stapleton Sir William Armyne Fiennes and Hambden were the persons chosen Rush vol v p three hundred eighty seven Rush vol v p three hundred seventy six Endeavors were used before Charles s departure to have a protector of the kingdom appointed with a power to pass laws without having recourse to the king so little regard was now paid to royal authority or to the established constitution of the kingdom Amidst the great variety of affairs which occurred during this busy period we have almost overlooked the marriage of the princess Mary with William prince of Orange The king concluded not this alliance without communicating his intentions to the parliament who received the proposal with satisfaction This was the commencement of the connections with the family of Orange connections which were afterwards attended with the most important consequences both to the kingdom and to the house of Stuart Whitlocke p thirty eight CHAPTER LV CHARLES I THE Scots who began these fatal commotions thought that they had finished a very perilous undertaking much to their profit and reputation Besides the large pay voted them for lying in good quarters during a twelvemonth the English parliament had conferred on them a present of three hundred thousand pounds for their brotherly assistance In the articles of pacification they were declared to have ever been good subjects and their military expeditions were approved of as enterprises calculated and intended for his majesty s honor and advantage To carry further the triumph over their sovereign these terms so ignominious to him were ordered by a vote of parliament to be read in all churches upon a day of thanksgiving appointed for the national pacification all their claims for the restriction of prerogative were agreed to be ratified and what they more valued than all these advantages they had a near prospect of spreading the Presbyterian discipline in England and Ireland from the seeds which they had scattered of their religious principles Never did refined Athens so exult in diffusing the sciences and liberal arts over a savage world never did generous Rome so please herself in the view of law and order established by her victorious arms as the Scots now rejoiced in communicating their barbarous zeal and theological fervor to the neighboring nations Nalson vol i p seven hundred forty seven May p one hundred four Rush vol v p three hundred sixty five Clarendon vol ii p two hundred ninety three Charles despoiled in England of a considerable part of his authority and dreading still further encroachments upon him arrived in Scotland with an intention of abdicating almost entirely the small share of power which there remained to him and of giving full satisfaction if possible to his restless subjects in that kingdom The lords of articles were an ancient institution in the Scottish parliament They were constituted after this manner The temporal lords chose eight bishops the bishops elected eight temporal lords these sixteen named eight commissioners of counties and eight burgesses and without the previous consent of the thirty two who were denominated lords of articles no motion could be made in parliament As the bishops were entirely devoted to the court it is evident that all the lords of articles by necessary consequence depended on the king s nomination and the prince besides one negative after the bills had passed through parliament possessed indirectly another before their introduction a prerogative of much greater consequence than the former The bench of bishops being now abolished the parliament laid hold of the opportunity and totally set aside the lords of articles and till this important point was obtained the nation properly speaking could not be said to enjoy any regular freedom It is remarkable that notwithstanding this institution to which there is no parallel in England the royal authority was always deemed much lower in Scotland than in the former kingdom Bacon represents it as one advantage to be expected from the union that the too extensive prerogative of England would be abridged by the example of Scotland and the too narrow prerogative of Scotland be enlarged from the imitation of England The English were at that time a civilized people and obedient to the laws but among the Scots it was of little consequence how the laws were framed or by whom voted while the exorbitant aristocracy had it so much in their power to prevent their regular execution The peers and commons formed only one house in the Scottish parliament and as it had been the practice of James continued by Charles to grace English gentlemen with Scottish titles all the determinations of parliament it was to be feared would in time depend upon the prince by means of these votes of foreigners who had no interest or property in the nation It was therefore a law deserving approbation that no man should be created a Scotch peer who possessed not ten thousand marks above five hundred pounds of annual rent in the kingdom A law for triennial parliaments was likewise passed and it was ordained that the last act of every parliament should be to appoint the time and place for holding the parliament next ensuing Burnet Mem Burnet Mem Burnet Mem The king was deprived of that power formerly exercised of issuing proclamations which enjoined obedience under the penalty of treason a prerogative which invested him with the whole legislative authority even in matters of the highest importance So far was laudable but the most fatal blow given to royal authority and what in a manner dethroned the prince was the article that no member of the privy council in whose hands during the king s absence the whole administration lay no officer of state none of the judges should be appointed but by advice and approbation of parliament Charles even agreed to deprive of their seats four judges who had adhered to his interests and their place was supplied by others more agreeable to the ruling party Several of the Covenanters were also sworn of the privy council And all the ministers of state counsellors and judges were by law to hold their places during life or good behavior The king while in Scotland conformed himself entirely to the established church and assisted with great gravity at the long prayers and longer sermons with which the Presbyterians endeavored to regale him He bestowed pensions and preferments on Henderson Gillespy and other popular preachers and practised every art to soften if not to gain his greatest enemies The earl of Argyle was created a marquis Lord Loudon an earl Lesley was dignified with the title of earl of Leven His friends he was obliged for the present to neglect and overlook some of them were disgusted and his enemies were not reconciled but ascribed all his caresses and favors to artifice and necessity Burnet Mem Burnet Mem Clarendon vol ii p three hundred nine Argyle and Hamilton being seized with an apprehension real or pretended that the earl of Crawfurd and others meant to assassinate them left the parliament suddenly and retired into the country but upon invitation and assurances returned in a few days This event which had neither cause nor effect that was visible nor purpose nor consequence was commonly denominated the incident But though the incident had no effect In Scotland what was not expected it was attended with consequences in England The English parliament which was now assembled being willing to awaken the people s tenderness by exciting their fears immediately took the alarm as if the malignants so they called the king s party had had laid a plot at once to murder them and all the godly in both kingdoms They applied therefore to Essex whom the king had left general in the south of England and he ordered a guard to attend them But while the king was employed in pacifying the commotions in Scotland and was preparing to return to England in order to apply himself to the same salutary work in that kingdom he received intelligence of a dangerous rebellion broken but in Ireland with circumstances of the utmost horror bloodshed and devastation On every side this unfortunate prince was pursued with murmurs discontent faction and civil wars and the fire from all quarters even by the most independent accidents at once blazed up about him The great plan of James in the administration of Ireland continued by Charles was by justice and peace to reconcile that turbulent people to the authority of laws and introducing art and industry among them to cure them of that sloth and barbarism to which they had ever been subject In order to serve both these purposes and at the same time secure the dominion of Ireland to the English crown great colonies of British had been carried over and being intermixed with the Irish had every where introduced a new face of things into that country During a peace of near forty years the inveterate quarrels between the nations seemed in a great measure to be obliterated and though much of the landed property forfeited by rebellion had been conferred on the new planters a more than equal return had been made by their instructing the natives in tillage building manufactures and all the civilized arts of life This had been the course of things during the successive administrations of Chichester Grandison Falkland and above all of Strafford Under the government of this latter nobleman the pacific plans now come to great maturity and forwarded by his vigor and industry seemed to have operated with full success and to have bestowed at last on that savage country the face of a European settlement Whitlocke p forty Dugdale p seventy two Burnet s Memoirs of the House of Hamilton p one hundred eighty four one hundred eighty five Clarendon vol ii p two hundred ninety nine Sir John Temple s Irish Rebellion p twelve After Strafford fell a victim to popular rage the humors excited in Ireland by that great event could not suddenly be composed but continued to produce the greatest innovations in the government The British Protestants transplanted into Ireland having every moment before their eyes all the horrors of Popery had naturally been carried into the opposite extreme and had universally adopted the highest principles and practices of the Puritans Monarchy as well as the hierarchy was become odious to them and every method of limiting the authority of the crown and detaching themselves from the king of England was greedily adopted and pursued They considered not that as they scarcely formed the sixth part of the people and were secretly obnoxious to the ancient inhabitants their only method of supporting themselves was by maintaining royal authority and preserving a great dependence on their mother country The English commons likewise in their furious persecution of Strafford had overlooked the most obvious consequences and while they imputed to him as a crime every discretionary act of authority they despoiled all succeeding governors of that power by which alone the Irish could be retained in subjection And so strong was the current for popular government in all the three kingdoms that the most established maxims of policy were every where abandoned in order to gratify this ruling passion Charles unable to resist had been obliged to yield to the Irish as to the Scottish and English parliaments and found too that their encroachments still rose in proportion to his concessions Those subsidies which themselves had voted they reduced by a subsequent vote to a fourth part the court of high commission was determined to be a grievance martial law abolished the jurisdiction of the council annihilated proclamations and acts of state declared of no authority every order or institution which depended on monarchy was invaded and the prince was despoiled of all his prerogative without the least pretext of any violence or illegality in his administration The standing army of Ireland was usually about three thousand men but in order to assist the king in suppressing the Scottish Covenanters Strafford had raised eight thousand more and had incorporated with them a thousand men drawn from the old army a necessary expedient for bestowing older and discipline on the new levied soldiers The private men in this army were all Catholics but the officers both commission and non commission were Protestants and could entirely be depended on by Charles The English commons entertained the greatest apprehensions on account of this army and never ceased soliciting the king till he agreed to break it Nor they consent to any proposal for augmenting the standing army to five thousand men a number which the king deemed necessary for retaining Ireland in obedience Charles thinking it dangerous that eight thousand men accustomed to idleness and trained to the use of arms should be dispersed among a nation so turbulent and unsettled agreed with the Spanish ambassador to have them transported into Flanders and enlisted in his master s service The English commons pretending apprehensions lest regular bodies of troops disciplined in the Low Countries should prove still more dangerous showed some aversion to this expedient and the king reduced his allowance to four thousand men But when the Spaniards had hired ships for transporting these troops and the men were ready to embark the commons willing to show their power and not displeased with an opportunity of curbing and affronting the king prohibited every one from furnishing vessels for that service And thus the project formed by Charles of freeing the country from these men was unfortunately disappointed The old Irish remarked all these false steps of the English and resolved to take advantage of them Though their animosity against that nation for want of an occasion to exert itself seemed to be extinguished it was only composed into a temporary and deceitful tranquillity Their interests both with regard to property and religion secretly stimulated them to a revolt No individual of any sept according to the ancient customs had the property of any particular estate but as the whole sept had a title to a whole territory they ignorantly preferred this barbarous community before the more secure and narrower possessions assigned them by the English An indulgence amounting almost to a toleration had been given to the Catholic religion but so long as the churches and the ecclesiastical revenues were kept from the priests and they were obliged to endure the neighborhood of profane heretics being themselves discontented they continually endeavored to retard any cordial reconciliation between the English and the Irish nations Clarendon vol i p two hundred eighty one Rush vol v p three hundred eighty one Dugdale p seventy eight May book ii p three Temple p fourteen There was a gentleman called Roger More who though of a narrow fortune was descended from an ancient Irish family and was much celebrated among his countrymen for valor and capacity This man first formed the project of expelling the English and asserting the independency of his native country Nalson vol iii p five hundred forty three He secretly went from chieftain to chieftain and roused up every latent principle of discontent He maintained a close correspondence with Lord Maguire and Sir Phelim O Neale the most powerful of the old Irish By conversation by letters by his emissaries he represented to his countrymen the motives of a revolt He observed to them that by the rebellion of the Scots and factions of the English the king s authority in Britain was reduced to so low a condition that he never could exert himself with any vigor in maintaining the English dominion over Ireland that the Catholics in the Irish house of commons assisted by the Protestants had so diminished the royal prerogative and the power of the lieutenant as would much facilitate the conducting to its desired effect any conspiracy or combination which could be formed that the Scots having so successfully thrown off dependence on the crown of England and assumed the government into their own hands had set an example to the Irish who had so much greater oppressions to complain of that the English planters who had expelled them their possessions suppressed their religion and bereaved them of their liberties were but a handful in comparison of the natives that they lived in the most supine security interspersed with their numerous enemies trusting to the protection of a small army which was itself scattered in inconsiderable divisions through out the whole kingdom that a great body of men disciplined by the government were now thrown loose and were ready for any daring or desperate enterprise that though the Catholics had hitherto enjoyed in some tolerable measure the exercise of their religion from the moderation of their indulgent prince they must henceforth expect that the government will be conducted by other maxims and other principles that the Puritanical parliament having at length subdued their sovereign would no doubt as soon as they had consolidated their authority extend their ambitious enterprises to Ireland and make the Catholics in that kingdom feel the same furious persecution to which their brethren in England were at present exposed and that a revolt in the Irish tending only to vindicate their native liberty against the violence of foreign invaders could never at any time be deemed rebellion much less during the present confusions when their prince was in a manner a prisoner and obedience must be paid not to him but to those who had traitorously usurped his lawful authority By these considerations More engaged all the heads of the native Irish into the conspiracy The English of the pale as they were called or the old English planters being all Catholics it was hoped would afterwards join the party which restored their religion to its ancient splendor and authority The intention was that Sir Phelim O Neale and the other conspirators should begin an insurrection on one day throughout the provinces and should attack all the English settlements and that on the same day Lord Maguire and Roger More should surprise the Castle of Dublin The commencement of the revolt was fixed on the approach of winter that there might be more difficulty in transporting forces from England Succors to themselves and supplies of arms they expected from France in consequence of a promise made them by Cardinal Richelieu And many Irish officers who served in the Spanish troops had engaged to join them as soon as they saw an insurrection entered upon by their Catholic brethren News which every day arrived from England of the fury expressed by the commons against all Papists struck fresh terror into the Irish nation and both stimulated the conspirators to execute their fatal purpose and gave them assured hopes of the concurrence of all their country men Such propensity to a revolt was discovered in all the Irish that it was deemed unnecessary as it was dangerous to intrust the secret to many hands and the appointed day drew nigh nor had any discovery been yet made to the government The king indeed had received information from his ambassadors that something was in agitation among the Irish in foreign parts but though he gave warning to the administration in Ireland the intelligence was entirely neglected Temple p seventy two seventy three seventy eight Dugdale p seventy three Dugdale p seventy

whom the king had appointed lieutenant remained in London The two justices Sir William Parsons and Sir John Borlace were men of small abilities and by an inconvenience common to all factious times owed their advancement to nothing but their zeal for the party by whom every thing was now governed Tranquil from their ignorance and inexperience these men indulged themselves in the most profound repose on the very brink of destruction But they were awakened from their security on the very day before that which was appointed for the commencement of hostilities The Castle of Dublin by which the capital was commanded contained arms for ten thousand men with thirty five pieces of cannon and a proportionable quantity of ammunition yet was this important place guarded and that too without any care by no greater force than fifty men Maguire and More were already in town with a numerous band of their partisans others were expected that night and next morning they were to enter upon what they esteemed the easiest of all enterprises the surprisal of the castle O Conolly an Irishman but a Protestant betrayed the conspiracy to Parsons The justices and council fled immediately for safety into the castle and reenforced the guards The alarm was conveyed to the city and all the Protestants prepared for defence More escaped Maguire was taken and Mahone one of the conspirators being likewise seized first discovered to the justices the project of a general insurrection and redoubled the apprehensions which already were universally diffused throughout Dublin But though O Conolly s discovery saved the castle from a surprise the confession extorted from Mahone came too late to prevent the intended insurrection O Neale and his Confederates had already taken arms in Ulster The Irish every where intermingled with the English needed but a hint from their leaders and priests to begin hostilities against a people whom they hated on account of their religion and envied for their riches and prosperity Rush vol v p three hundred ninety nine Nalson vol ii p five hundred twenty May book ii p six Temple p seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty Rush vol v p four hundred Ten ple p thirty nine

mutual protection remained at home in hopes of defending their property and fell thus separately into the hands of their enemies After rapacity had fully exerted itself cruelty and the most barbarous that ever in any nation was known or heard of began its operations A universal massacre commenced of the English now defenceless and passively resigned to their inhuman foes No age no sex no condition was spared The wife weeping for her butchered husband and embracing her helpless children was pierced with them and perished by the same stroke The old the young the vigorous the infirm underwent a like fate and were confounded in one common ruin In vain did flight save from the first assault destruction was every where let loose and met the hunted victims at every turn In vain was recourse had to relations to companions to friends all connections were dissolved and death was dealt by that hand from which protection was implored and expected Without provocation without opposition the astonished English living in profound peace and full security were massacred by their nearest neighbors with whom they had long upheld a continued intercourse of kindness and good offices But death was the lightest punishment inflicted by those rebels All the tortures which wanton cruelty could devise all the lingering pains of body the anguish of mind the agonies of despair could not satiate revenge excited without injury and cruelty derived from no cause To enter into particulars would shock the least delicate humanity Such enormities though attested by undoubted evidence appear almost incredible Depraved nature even perverted religion encouraged by the utmost license reach not to such a pitch of ferocity unless the pity inherent in human breasts be destroyed by that contagion of example which transports men beyond all the usual motives of conduct and behavior The weaker sex themselves naturally tender to their own sufferings and compassionate to those of others here emulated

avarice of the Irish was not a sufficient restraint to their cruelty Such was their frenzy that the cattle which they had seized and by rapine made their own yet because they bore the name of English were wantonly slaughtered or when covered with wounds turned loose into the woods or deserts The stately buildings or commodious habitations of the planters as if upbraiding the sloth and ignorance of the natives were consumed with fire or laid level with the ground And where the miserable owners shut up in their houses and preparing for defence perished in the flames together with their wives and children a double triumph was afforded to their insulting foes If any where a number assembled together and assuming courage from despair were resolved to sweeten death by revenge on their assassins they were disarmed by capitulations and promises of safety confirmed by the most solemn oaths But no sooner had they surrendered than the rebels with perfidy equal to their cruelty made them share the fate of their unhappy countrymen Others more ingenious still in their barbarity tempted their prisoners by the fond love of life to imbrue their hands in the blood of friends brothers parents and having thus rendered them accomplices in guilt gave them that death which they sought to shun by deserving it Amidst all these enormities the sacred name of religion resounded on every side not to stop the hands of these murderers but to enforce their blows and to steel their hearts against every movement of human or social sympathy The English as heretics abhorred of God and detestable to all holy men were marked out by the priests for slaughter and of all actions to rid the world of these declared enemies to Catholic faith and piety was represented as the most meritorious v Nature which in that rude people was sufficiently inclined to atrocious deeds was further stimulated by precept and national prejudices empoisoned by those aversions more deadly and incurable which arose from an enraged superstition While death finished the sufferings of each victim the bigoted assassins with joy and exultation still echoed in his expiring ears that these agonies were but the commencement of

Irish in Ulster signalized their rebellion an event memorable in the annals of human kind and worthy to be held in perpetual detestation and abhorrence The generous nature of More was shocked at the recital of such enormous cruelties He flew to O Neale s camp but found that his authority which was sufficient to excite the Irish to an insurrection was too feeble to restrain their inhumanity Soon after he abandoned a cause polluted by so many crimes and he retired into Flanders Sir Phelim recommended by the greatness of his family and perhaps too by the unrestrained brutality of his nature though without any courage or capacity acquired the entire ascendent over the northern rebels The English colonies were totally annihilated in the open country of Ulster the Scots at first met with more favorable treatment In order to engage them to a passive neutrality the Irish pretended to distinguish between the British nations and claiming friendship and consanguinity with the Scots extended not over them the fury of their massacres Many of them found an opportunity to fly the country others retired into places of security and prepared themselves for defence and by this means the Scottish planters most of them at least escaped with their lives From Ulster the flames of rebellion diffused themselves in an instant over the other three provinces of Ireland In all places death and slaughter were not uncommon though the Irish in these other provinces pretended to act with moderation and humanity But cruel and barbarous was their humanity Not content with expelling the English their houses with despoiling them of their goodly manors with wasting their cultivated fields they stripped them of their very clothes and turned them out naked and defenceless to all the severities of the season The heavens themselves as if conspiring against that unhappy people were armed with cold and tempest unusual to the climate and executed what the merciless sword had left unfinished The roads were covered with crowds of naked English hastening towards Dublin and the other cities which yet remained in the hands of their countrymen The feeble age of children the tender sex of women

abandoning him in this uttermost distress reserved himself to the hopes of avenging that death which all his efforts could not prevent nor delay The astonishing greatness of the calamity deprived the sufferers of any relief from the view of companions in affliction With silent tears or lamentable cries they hurried on through the hostile territories and found every heart which was not steeled by native barbarity guarded by the more implacable furies of mistaken piety and religion The saving of Dublin preserved in Ireland the remains of the English name The gates of that city though timorously opened received the wretched supplicants and presented to the view a scene of human misery beyond what any eye had ever before beheld Compassion seized the amazed inhabitants aggravated with the fear of like calamities while they observed the numerous foes without and within which every where environed them and reflected on the weak resources by which they were themselves supported The more vigorous of the unhappy fugitives to the number of three thousand were enlisted into three regiments the rest were distributed into the houses and all care was taken by diet and warmth to recruit their feeble and torpid limbs Diseases of unknown name and species derived from these multiplied distresses seized many of them and put a speedy period to their lives others having now leisure to reflect on their mighty loss of friends and fortune cursed that being which they had saved Abandoning themselves to despair refusing all succor they expired without other consolation than that of receiving among their countrymen the honors of a grave which to their slaughtered companions had been denied by the inhuman barbarians Temple p eighty eight Temple p sixty two Temple p forty three sixty two By some computations those who perished by all these cruelties are supposed to be a hundred and fifty or two hundred thousand by the most moderate and probably the most reasonable account they are made to amount to forty thousand if this estimation itself be not as is usual in such cases somewhat exaggerated The justices ordered to Dublin all the bodies of the army which were not surrounded by the rebels and they assembled a force of one thousand five hundred veterans They soon enlisted and armed from the magazines above four thousand men more They despatched a body of six hundred men to throw relief into Tredah besieged by the Irish But these troops attacked by the enemy were seized with a panic and were most of them put to the sword Their arms falling into the hands of the Irish supplied them with what they most wanted The justices willing to foment the rebel lion in a view of profiting by the multiplied forfeitures henceforth thought of nothing more than providing for their own present security and that of the capital The earl of Ormond their general remonstrated against such timid not to say base and interested counsels but was obliged to submit to authority The English of the pale who probably were not at first in the secret pretended to blame the insurrection and to detest the barbarity with which it was accompanied By their protestations and declarations they engaged the justices to supply them with arms which they promised to employ in defence of the government But in a little time the interests of religion were found more prevalent over them than regard and duty to their mother country They chose Lord Gormanstone their leader and joining the old Irish rivalled them in every act of violence towards the English Protestants Besides many smaller bodies dispersed over the kingdom the principal army of the rebels amounted to twenty thousand men and threatened Dublin with an immediate siege Both the English and Irish rebels conspired in one imposture with which they seduced many of their deluded countrymen they pretended authority from the king and queen but chiefly from the latter for their insurrection and they affirmed that the cause of their taking arms was to vindicate royal prerogative now invaded by the Puritanical parliament v Sir Phelim O Neale having found a royal patent in Lord Caulfield s house whom he had murdered

north of Ireland He immediately communicated his intelligence to the Scottish parliament He expected that the mighty zeal expressed by the Scots for the Protestant religion would immediately engage them to fly to its defence where it was so violently invaded he hoped that their horror against Popery a religion which now appeared in its most horrible aspect would second all his exhortations he had observed with what alacrity they had twice run to arms and assembled troops in opposition to the rights of their sovereign he saw with how much greater facility they could now collect forces which had been very lately disbanded and which had been so long inured to military discipline The cries of their affrighted and distressed brethren in Ireland he promised himself would powerfully incite them to send over succors which could arrive so quickly and aid them with such promptitude in this uttermost distress But the zeal of the Scots as is usual among religious sects was very feeble when not stimulated either by faction or by interest They now considered themselves entirely as a republic and made no account of the authority of their prince which they had utterly annihilated Conceiving hopes from the present distresses of Ireland they resolved to make an advantageous bargain for the succors with which they should supply their neighboring nation And they cast their eye towards the English parliament with whom they were already so closely connected and who could alone fulfil any articles which might be agreed on Except despatching a small body to support the Scottish colonies in Ulster they would therefore go no further at present than sending commissioners to London in order to treat with that power to whom the sovereign authority was now in reality transferred Rush vol v p four hundred seven The king too sensible of his utter inability to subdue the Irish rebels found himself obliged in this exigency to have recourse to the English parliament and depend on their assistance for supply After communicating to them the intelligence which he had received he informed them that the insurrection was not in his opinion the result of any rash enterprise but of a formed conspiracy against the crown of England To their care and wisdom therefore he said he committed the conduct and prosecution of the war which in a cause so important to national and religious interests must of necessity be immediately entered upon and vigorously pursued Clarendon vol ii p three hundred one The English parliament was now assembled and discovered in every vote the same dispositions in which they had separated The exalting of their own authority the diminishing of the king s were still the objects pursued by the majority Every attempt which had been made to gain the popular leaders and by offices to attach them to the crown had failed of success either for want of skill in conducting it or by reason of the slender preferments which it was then in the king s power to confer The ambitious and enterprising patriots disdained to accept in detail of a precarious power while they deemed it so easy by one bold and vigorous assault to possess themselves forever of the entire sovereignty Sensible that the measures which they had hitherto pursued rendered them extremely obnoxious to the king were many of them in themselves exceptionable some of them strictly speaking illegal they resolved to seek their own security as well as greatness by enlarging popular authority in England The great necessities to which the king was reduced the violent prejudices which generally throughout the nation prevailed against him his facility in making the most important concessions the example of the Scots whose encroachments had totally subverted monarchy all these circumstances further instigated the commons in their invasion of royal prerogative And the danger to which the constitution seemed to have been so lately exposed persuaded many that it never could be sufficiently secured but by the entire abolition of that authority which had invaded it But this project it had not been in the power scarcely in the intention of the popular leaders to execute had it not been for the passion which seized the nation for Presbyterian discipline and for the wild enthusiasm which at that time accompanied it The license which the parliament had bestowed on this spirit by checking ecclesiastical authority the countenance and encouragement with which they had honored it had already diffused its influence to a wonderful degree and all orders of men had drunk deep of the intoxicating poison In every discourse or conversation this mode of religion entered in all business it had a share every elegant pleasure or amusement it utterly annihilated many vices or corruptions of mind it promoted even diseases and bodily distempers were not totally exempted from it and it became requisite we are told for all physicians to be expert in the spiritual profession and by theological considerations to allay those religious terrors with which their patients were so generally haunted Learning itself which tends so much to enlarge the mind and humanize the temper rather served on this occasion to exalt that epidemical frenzy which prevailed Rude as yet and imperfect it supplied the dismal fanaticism with a variety of views founded it on some coherency of system enriched it with different figures of elocution advantages with which a people totally ignorant and barbarous had been happily unacquainted From policy at first and inclination now from necessity the king attached himself extremely to the hierarchy for like reasons his enemies were determined by one and the same effort to overpower the church and monarchy While the commons were in this disposition the Irish rebellion was the event which tended most to promote the views in which all their measures terminated A horror against the Papists however innocent they had constantly encouraged a terror from the conspiracies of that sect however improbable they had at all times endeavored to excite Here was broken out a rebellion dreadful and unexpected accompanied with circumstances the most detestable of which there ever was any record and what was the peculiar guilt of the Irish Catholics it was no difficult matter in the present disposition of men s minds to attribute to that whole sect who were already so much the object of general abhorrence Accustomed in all invectives to join the prelatical party with the Papists the people immediately supposed this insurrection to be the result of their united counsels And when they heard that the Irish rebels pleaded the king s commission for all their acts of violence bigotry ever credulous and malignant assented without scruple to that gross imposture and loaded the unhappy prince with the whole enormity of a contrivance so barbarous and inhuman eight See note H at the end of the volume By the difficulties and distresses of the crown the commons who possessed alone the power of supply had aggrandized themselves and it seemed a peculiar happiness that the Irish rebellion had succeeded at so critical a juncture to the pacification of Scotland That expression of the king s by which he committed to them the care of Ireland they immediately laid hold of and interpreted in the most unlimited sense They had on other occasions been gradually encroaching on the executive power of the crown which forms its principal and most natural branch of authority but with regard to Ireland they at once assumed it fully and entirely as if delivered over to them by a regular gift or assignment And to this usurpation the king was obliged passively to submit both because of his inability to resist and lest he should still more expose himself to the reproach of favoring the progress of that odious rebellion The project of introducing further innovations in England being once formed by the leaders among the commons it became a necessary consequence that their operations with regard to Ireland should all of them be considered as subordinate to the former on whose success when once undertaken their own grandeur security and even being must entirely depend While they pretended the utmost zeal against the Irish insurrection they took no steps towards its suppression but such as likewise tended to give them the superiority in those commotions which they foresaw must so soon be excited in England Clarendon vol ii p four hundred thirty five Sir Ed Walker p six The extreme contempt entertained for the natives in Ireland made the popular leaders believe that it would be easy at any time to suppress their rebellion and recover that kingdom nor were they willing to lose by too hasty success the advantage which that rebellion would afford them in their projected encroachments on the prerogative By assuming the total management of the war they acquired the courtship and dependence of every one who had any connection with Ireland or who was desirous of enlisting in these military enterprises they levied money under pretence of the Irish expedition but reserved it for purposes which concerned them more nearly they took arms from the king s magazines but still kept them with a secret intention of employing them against himself whatever law they deemed necessary for aggrandizing themselves was voted under color of enabling them to recover Ireland and if Charles withheld the royal assent his refusal was imputed to those pernicious counsels which had at first excited the Popish rebellion and which still threatened total destruction to the Protestant interest throughout all his dominions And though no forces were for a long time sent over to Ireland and very little money remitted during the extreme distress of that kingdom so strong was the people s attachment to the commons that the fault was never imputed to those pious zealots whose votes breathed nothing but death and destruction to the Irish rebels Nalson vol ii p three hundred eighteen Clarendon vol iv p five hundred ninety To make the attack on royal authority by regular approaches it was thought proper to frame a general remonstrance of the state of the nation and accordingly the committee which at the first meeting of parliament had been chosen for that purpose and which had hitherto made no progress in their work received fresh injunctions to finish that undertaking The committee brought into the house that remonstrance which has become so memorable and which was soon afterwards attended with such important consequences It was not addressed to the king but was openly declared to be an appeal to the people The harshness of the matter was equalled by the severity of the language It consists of many gross falsehoods intermingled with some evident truths malignant insinuations are joined to open invectives loud complaints of the past accompanied with jealous prognostications of the future Whatever unfortunate whatever invidious whatever suspicious measure had been embraced by the king from the commencement of his reign is insisted on and aggravated with merciless rhetoric the unsuccessful expeditions to Cadiz and the Isle of Rhe are mentioned the sending of ships to France for the suppression of the Hugonots the forced loans the illegal confinement of men for not obeying illegal commands the violent dissolution of four parliaments the arbitrary government which always succeeded the questioning fining and imprisoning of members for their conduct in the house the levying of taxes without consent of the commons the introducing of superstitious innovations into the church without authority of law in short every thing which either with or without reason had given offence during the course of fifteen years from the accession of the king to the calling of the present parliament And though all these grievances had been already redressed and even laws enacted for future security against their return the praise of these advantages was ascribed not to the king but to the parliament who had extorted his consent to such salutary statutes Their own merits too they asserted towards the king were no less eminent than towards the people Though they had seized his whole revenue rendered it totally precarious and made even their temporary supplies be paid to their own commissioners who were independent of him they pretended that they had liberally supported him in his necessities By an insult still more egregious the very giving of money to the Scots for levying war against their sovereign they represented as an instance of their duty towards him And all their grievances they said which amounted to no less than a total subversion of the constitution proceeded entirely from the formed combination of a Popish faction who had ever swayed the king s counsels who had endeavored by an uninterrupted effort to introduce their superstition into England and Scotland and who had now at last excited an open and bloody rebellion in Ireland This remonstrance so full of acrimony and violence was a plain signal for some further attacks intended on royal prerogative and a declaration that the concessions already made however important were not to be regarded as satisfactory What pretensions would be advanced how unprecedented how unlimited were easily imagined and nothing less was foreseen whatever ancient names might be preserved than an abolition almost total of the monarchical government of England The opposition therefore which the remonstrance met with in the house of commons was great For above fourteen hours the debate was warmly managed and from the weariness of the king s party which probably consisted chiefly of the elderly people and men of cool spirits the vote was at last carried by a small majority of eleven Some time after the remonstrance was ordered to be printed and published without being carried up to the house of peers for their assent and concurrence Rush vol v p four hundred thirty eight Nalson vol ii p six hundred ninety four Whitlocke p forty nine Dugdale p seventy one Nalson vol ii p six hundred sixty eight When this remonstrance was dispersed it excited every where the same violent controversy which attended it when introduced into the house of commons This parliament said the partisans of that assembly have at length profited by the fatal example of their predecessors and are resolved that the fabric which they have generously undertaken to wear for the protection of liberty shall not be left to future ages insecure and imperfect At the time when the petition of right that requisite vindication of a violated constitution was extorted from the unwilling prince who but imagined that liberty was at last secured and that the laws would thenceforth maintain themselves in opposition to arbitrary authority But what was the event A right was indeed acquired to the people or rather their ancient right was more exactly defined but as the power of invading it still remained in the prince no sooner did an opportunity offer than he totally disregarded all laws and preceding engagements and made his will and pleasure the sole rule of government Those lofty ideas of monarchical authority which he has derived from his early education which are united in his mind with the irresistible illusions of self love which are corroborated by his mistaken principles of religion it is in vain to hope that in his more advanced age he will sincerely renounce from any subsequent reflection or experience Such conversions if ever they happen are extremely rare but to expect that they will be derived from necessity from the jealousy and resentment of antagonists from blame from reproach from opposition must be the result of the fondest and most blind credulity These violences however necessary are sure to irritate a prince against limitations so cruelly imposed upon him and each concession which he is constrained to make is regarded as a temporary tribute paid to faction and sedition and is secretly attended with a resolution of seizing every favorable opportunity to retract it Nor should we imagine that opportunities of that kind will not offer in the course of human affairs Governments especially those of a mixed kind are in continual fluctuation the humors of the people change perpetually from one extreme to another and no resolution can be more wise as well as more just than that of employing the present advantages against the king who had formerly pushed much less tempting ones to the utmost extremities against his people and his parliament It is to be feared that if the religious rage which has seized the multitude be allowed to evaporate they will quickly return to the ancient ecclesiastical establishment and with it embrace those principles of slavery which it inculcates with such zeal on its submissive proselytes Those patriots who are now the public idols may then become the objects of general detestation and equal shouts of joy attend their ignominious execution with those which second their present advantages and triumphs Nor ought the apprehension of such an event to be regarded in them as a selfish consideration in their safety is involved the security of the laws The patrons of the constitution cannot suffer without a fatal blow to the constitution and it is but justice in the public to protect at any hazard those who have so generously exposed themselves to the utmost hazard for the public interest What though monarchy the ancient government of England be impaired during these contests in many of its former prerogatives the laws will flourish the more by its decay and it is happy allowing that matters are really carried beyond the bounds of moderation that the current at least runs towards liberty and that the error is on that side which is safest for the general interests of mankind and society The best arguments of the royalists against a further attack on the prerogative were founded more on opposite ideas which they had formed of the past events of this reign than on opposite principles of government Some invasions they said and those too of moment had undoubtedly been made on national privileges but were we to look for the cause of these violences we should never find it to consist in the wanton tyranny and injustice of the prince not even in his ambition or immoderate appetite for authority The hostilities with Spain in which the king on his accession found himself engaged however imprudent and unnecessary had proceeded from the advice and even importunity of the parliament who deserted him immediately after they had embarked him in those warlike measures A young prince jealous of honor was naturally afraid of being foiled in his first enterprise and had not as yet attained such maturity of counsel as to perceive that his greatest honor lay in preserving the laws inviolate and gaining the full confidence of his people The rigor of the subsequent parliaments had been extreme with regard to many articles particularly tonnage and poundage and had reduced the king to an absolute necessity if he would preserve entire the royal prerogative of levying those duties by his own authority and of breaking through the forms in order to maintain the spirit of the constitution Having once made so perilous a step he was naturally induced to continue and to consult the public interest by imposing ship money and other moderate though irregular burdens and taxations A sure proof that he had formed no system for enslaving his people is that the chief object of his government has been to raise a naval not a military force a project useful honorable nay indispensably requisite and in spite of his great necessities brought almost to a happy conclusion It is now full time to free him from all these necessities and to apply cordials and lenitives after those severities which have already had their full course against him Never was sovereign blessed with more moderation of temper with more justice more humanity more honor or a more gentle disposition What pity that such a prince should so long have been harassed with rigors suspicions calumnies complaints encroachments and been forced from that path in which the rectitude of his principles would have inclined him to have constantly trod If some few instances are found of violations made on the petition of right which he himself had granted there is an easier and more natural way for preventing the return of like inconveniencies than by a total abolition of royal authority Let the revenue be settled suitably to the ancient dignity and splendor of the crown let the public necessities be fully supplied let the remaining articles of prerogative be left untouched and the king as he has already lost the power will lay aside the will of invading the constitution From what quarter can jealousies now arise What further security can be desired or expected The king s preceding concessions so far from being insufficient for public security have rather erred on the other extreme and by depriving him of all power of self defence are the real cause why the commons are emboldened to raise pretensions hitherto unheard of in the kingdom and to subvert the whole system of the constitution But would they be content with moderate advantages is it not evident that besides other important concessions the present parliament may be continued till the government be accustomed to the new track and every part be restored to full harmony and concord By the triennial act a perpetual succession of parliaments is established as everlasting guardians to the laws while the king possesses no independent power or military force by which he can be supported in his invasion of them No danger remains but what is inseparable from all free constitutions and what forms the very essence of their freedom the danger of a change in the people s disposition and of general disgust contracted against popular privileges To prevent such an evil no expedient is more proper than to contain ourselves within the bounds of moderation and to consider that all extremes naturally and infallibly beget each other In the same manner as the past usurpations of the crown however excusable on account of the necessity or provocations whence they arose have excited an immeasurable appetite for liberty let us beware lest our encroachments by introducing anarchy make the people seek shelter under the peaceable and despotic rule of a monarch Authority as well as liberty is requisite to government and is even requisite to the support of liberty itself by maintaining the laws which can alone regulate and protect it What madness while every thing is so happily settled under ancient forms and institutions now more exactly poised and adjusted to try the hazardous experiment of a new constitution and renounce the mature wisdom of our ancestors for the crude whimseys of turbulent innovators Besides the certain and inconceivable mischiefs of civil war are not the perils apparent which the delicate frame of liberty must inevitably sustain amidst the furious shock of arms Whichever side prevails she can scarcely hope to remain inviolate and may suffer no less or rather greater injuries from the boundless pretensions of forces engaged in her cause than from the invasion of enraged troops enlisted on the side of monarchy The king upon his return from Scotland was received in London with the shouts and acclamations of the people and with every demonstration of regard and affection Sir Richard Gournay lord mayor a man of moderation and authority had promoted these favorable dispositions and had engaged the populace who so lately insulted the king and who so soon after made furious war upon him to give him these marks of their dutiful attachment But all the pleasure which Charles reaped from this joyous reception was soon damped by the remonstrance of the commons which was presented him together with a petition of a like strain The bad counsels which he followed are there complained of his concurrence in the Irish rebellion plainly insinuated the scheme laid for the introduction of Popery and superstition inveighed against and as a remedy for all these evils he is desired to intrust every office and command to persons in whom his parliament should have cause to confide Rush vol v p four hundred twenty nine Bush vol v p four hundred thirty seven Nalson vol ii p six hundred ninety two By this phrase which is so often repeated in all the memorials and addresses of that time the commons meant themselves and their adherents As soon as the remonstrance of the commons was published the king dispersed an answer to it In this contest he lay under great disadvantages Not only the ears of the people were extremely prejudiced against him the best topics upon which he could justify at least apologize for his former conduct were such as it was not safe or prudent for him at this time to employ So high was the national idolatry towards parliaments that to blame the past conduct of these assemblies would have been very ill received by the generality of the people So loud were the complaints against regal usurpations that had the king asserted the prerogative of supplying by his own authority the deficiencies in government arising from the obstinacy of the commons he would have increased the clamors with which the whole nation already resounded Charles therefore contented himself with observing in general that even during that period so much complained of the people enjoyed a great measure of happiness not only comparatively in respect of their neighbors but even in respect of those times which were justly accounted the most fortunate He made warm protestations of sincerity in the reformed religion he promised indulgence to tender consciences with regard to the ceremonies of the church he mentioned his great concessions to national liberty he blamed the infamous libels every where dispersed against his person and the national religion he complained of the general reproaches thrown out in the remonstrance with regard to ill counsels though he had protected no minister from parliamentary justice retained no unpopular servant and conferred offices on no one who enjoyed not a high character and estimation in the public If notwithstanding this he adds any malignant party shall take heart and be willing to sacrifice the peace and happiness of their country to their own sinister ends and ambition under whatever pretence of religion and conscience if they shall endeavor to lessen my reputation and interest and to weaken my lawful power and authority if they shall attempt by discountenancing the present laws to loosen the bands of government that all disorder and confusion may break in upon us I doubt not but God in his good time will discover them to me and that the wisdom and courage of my high court of parliament will join with me in their suppression and punishment Nothing shows more evidently the hard situation in which Charles was placed than to observe that he was obliged to confine himself within the limits of civility towards subjects who had transgressed all bounds of regard and even of good manners in the treatment of their sovereign The first instance of those parliamentary encroachments which Charles was now to look for was the bill for pressing soldiers to the service of Ireland This bill quickly passed the lower house In the preamble the king s power of pressing a power exercised during all former times was declared illegal and contrary to the liberty of the subject By a necessary consequence the prerogative which the crown had ever assumed of obliging men to accept of any branch of public service was abolished and annihilated a prerogative it must be owned not very compatible with a limited monarchy In order to elude this law the king offered to raise ten thousand volunteers for the Irish service but the commons were afraid lest such an army should be too much at his devotion Charles still unwilling to submit to so considerable a diminution of power came to the house of peers and offered to pass the law without the preamble by which means he said that ill timed question with regard to the prerogative would for the present be avoided and the pretensions of each party be left entire Both houses took fire at this measure which from a similar instance while the bill of attainder against Strafford was in dependence Charles might foresee would be received with resentment The lords as well as commons passed a vote declaring it to be a high breach of privilege for the king to take notice of any bill which was in agitation in either of the houses or to express his sentiments with regard to it before it be presented to him for his assent in a parliamentary manner The king was obliged to compose all matters by an apology Nalson vol ii p seven hundred forty eight Rush vol v p four hundred fifty seven four hundred fifty eight et cetera Clarendon vol ii p three hundred twenty seven Nalson vol ii p seven hundred thirty eight seven hundred fifty seven hundred fifty one et cetera The general question we may observe with regard to privileges of parliament has always been and still continues one of of the greatest mysteries in the English constitution and in some respects notwithstanding the accurate genius of that government these privileges are at present as undetermined as were formerly the prerogatives of the crown Such privileges as are founded on long precedent cannot be controverted but though it were certain that former kings had not in any instance taken notice of bills lying before the houses which yet appears to have been very common it follows not merely from their never exerting such a power that they had renounced it or never were possessed of it Such privileges also as are essential to all free assemblies which deliberate they may be allowed to assume whatever precedents may prevail but though the king s interposition by an offer or advice does in some degree overawe or restrain liberty it may be doubted whether it imposes such evident violence as to entitle the parliament without any other authority or concession to claim the privilege of excluding it But this was the favorable time for extending privileges and had none more exorbitant or unreasonable been challenged few bad consequences had followed The establishment of this rule it is certain contributes to the order and regularity as well as freedom of parliamentary proceedings The interposition of peers in the election of commoners was likewise about this time declared a breach of privilege and continues ever since to be condemned by votes of the commons and universally practised throughout the nation

none	none	Besides numberless vexations and persecutions which the clergy underwent from the arbitrary power of the lower house the peers while the king was in Scotland having passed an order for the observance of the laws with regard to public worship the commons assumed such authority that by a vote alone of their house they suspended those laws though enacted by the whole legislature and they particularly forbade bowing at the name of Jesus a practice which gave them the highest scandal and which was one of their capital objections against the established religion They complained of the king s filling five vacant sees and considered it as an insult upon them that he should complete and strengthen an order which they intended soon entirely to abolish They had accused thirteen bishops of high treason for enacting canons without consent of parliament though from the foundation of the monarchy no other method had ever been practised and they now insisted that the peers upon this general accusation should sequester those bishops from their seats in parliament and commit them to prison Rush vol v p three hundred eighty five three hundred eighty six Nalson vol ii p four hundred eighty two Nalson vol ii p five hundred eleven Rush vol v p three hundred fifty nine Their bill for taking away the bishops votes had last winter been rejected by the peers but they again introduced the same bill though no prorogation had intervened and they endeavored by some minute alterations to elude that rule of parliament which opposed them And when they sent up this bill to the lords they made a demand the most absurd in the world that the bishops being all of them parties should be refused a vote with regard to that question After the resolution was once formed by the commons of invading the established government of church and state it could not be expected that their proceedings in such a violent attempt would thenceforth be altogether regular and equitable but it must be confessed that in their attack on the hierarchy they still more openly passed all bounds of moderation as supposing no doubt that the sacredness of the cause would sufficiently atone for employing means the most irregular and unprecedented

coming to burn the city and that the king himself was at their head Next morning Charles sent to the mayor and ordered him to call a common council immediately About ten o clock he himself attended only by three or four lords went to Guildhall He told the common council that he was sorry to hear of the apprehensions entertained of him that he was come to them without any guard in order to show how much he relied on their affections and that he had accused certain men of high treason against whom he would proceed in a legal way and therefore presumed that they would not meet with protection in the city After many other gracious expressions he told one of the sheriffs who of the two was thought the least inclined to his service that he would dine with him He departed the hall without receiving the applause which he expected In passing through the streets he heard the cry Privilege of parliament privilege of parliament resounding from all quarters One of the populace more insolent than the rest drew nigh to his coach and called out with a loud voice To your tents O Israel the words employed by the mutinous Israelites when they abandoned Rehoboam their rash and ill counselled sovereign When the house of commons met they affected the greatest dismay and adjourning themselves for some days ordered a committee to sit in Merchant Tailors Hall in the city The committee made an exact inquiry into all circumstances attending the king s entry into the house every passionate speech every menacing gesture of any even the meanest of his attendants was recorded and aggravated An intention of offering violence to the parliament of seizing the accused members in the very house and of murdering all who should make resistance was inferred And that unparalleled breach of privilege so it was called was still ascribed to the counsel of Papists and their adherents This expression which then recurred every moment in speeches and memorials and which at present is so apt to excite laughter in the reader begat at that time the deepest and most real consternation throughout the kingdom A letter was pretended to be intercepted and was communicated to the committee who pretended to lay great stress upon it One Catholic there congratulates another on the accusation of the members and represents that incident as a branch of the same pious contrivance which had excited the Irish insurrection and by which the profane heretics would soon be exterminated in England Rush vol v p four hundred seventy nine Clarendon vol ii p three hundred one Nalson vol ii p eight hundred thirty

for some time When the people by these affected panics were wrought up to a sufficient degree of rage and terror it was thought proper that the accused members should with a triumphant and military procession take their seats in the house The river was covered with boats and other vessels laden with small pieces of ordnance and prepared for fight Skippon whom the parliament had appointed by their own authority major general of the city militia conducted the members at the head of this tumultuary army to Westminster Hall And when the populace by land and by water passed Whitehall they still asked with insulting shouts What has become of the king and his cavaliers And whither are they fled Nalson vol ii p eight hundred thirty three Whitlocke p fifty two Dugdale p eighty two Clarendon vol ii p three hundred eighty The king apprehensive of danger from the enraged multitude had retired to Hampton Court deserted by all the world and overwhelmed with grief shame and remorse for the fatal measures into which he had been hurried His distressed situation he could no longer ascribe to the rigors of destiny or the malignity of enemies his own precipitancy and indiscretion must bear the blame of whatever disasters should henceforth befall him The most faithful of his adherents between sorrow and indignation were confounded with reflections on what had happened and what was likely to follow Seeing every prospect blasted faction triumphant the discontented populace inflamed to a degree of fury they utterly despaired of success in a cause to whose ruin friends and enemies seemed equally to conspire The prudence of the king in his conduct of this affair nobody pretended to justify The legality of his proceedings met with many and just apologies though generally offered to unwilling ears No maxim of law it was said is more established or more universally allowed than that privilege of parliament extends not to treason felony or breach of peace nor has either house during former ages ever pretended in any of those cases to interpose in behalf of its members Though some inconveniencies should result from the observance of this maxim that would not be sufficient without other authority to abolish a principle established by uninterrupted precedent and founded on the tacit consent of the whole legislature But what are the inconveniencies so much dreaded The king on pretence of treason may seize any members of the opposite faction and for a time gain to his partisans the majority of voices But if he seize only a few will he not lose more friends by such a gross artifice than he confines enemies If he seize a great number is not this expedient force open and barefaced And what remedy at all times against such force but to oppose to it a force which is superior Even allowing that the king intended to employ violence not authority for seizing the members though at that time and ever afterwards he positively asserted the contrary yet will his conduct admit of excuse That the hall where the parliament assembles is an inviolable sanctuary was never yet pretended And if the commons complain of the affront offered them by an attempt to arrest their members in their very presence the blame must lie entirely on themselves who had formerly refused compliance with the king s message when he peaceably demanded these members The sovereign is the great executor of the laws and his presence was here legally employed both in order to prevent opposition and to protect the house against those insults which their disobedience had so well merited Charles knew to how little purpose he should urge these reasons against the present fury of the commons He proposed therefore by a message that they would agree upon a legal method by which he might carry on his prosecution against the members lest further misunderstandings happen with regard to privilege They desired him to lay the grounds of accusation before the house and pretended that they must first judge whether it were proper to give up their members to a legal trial The king then informed them that he would waive for the present all prosecution by successive messages he afterwards offered a pardon to the members offered to concur in any law that should acquit or secure them offered any reparation to the house for the beach of privilege of which he acknowledged they had reason to complain They were resolved to accept of no satisfaction unless he would discover his advisers in that illegal measure a condition to which they knew that without rendering himself forever vile and contemptible he could not possibly submit Meanwhile they continued to thunder against the violation of parliamentary privileges and by their violent outcries to inflame the whole nation The secret reason of their displeasure however obvious they carefully concealed In the king s accusation of the members they plainly saw his judgment of late parliamentary proceedings and every adherent of the ruling faction dreaded the same fate should royal authority be reestablished in its ancient lustre By the most unhappy conduct Charles while he extremely augmented in his opponents the will had also increased the ability of hurting him Dugdale p eighty four Rush vol v p four hundred eighty four four hundred eighty eight four hundred ninety two et cetera The more to excite the people whose dispositions were already very seditious the expedient of petitioning was renewed A petition from the county of Buckingham was presented to the house by six thousand subscribers who promised to live and die in defence of the privileges of parliament The city of London the county of Essex that of Hertford Surrey Berks imitated the example A petition from the apprentices was graciously received Nay one was encouraged from the porters whose numbers amounted as they said to fifteen thousand The address of that great body contained the same articles with all the others the privileges of parliament the danger of religion the rebellion of Ireland the decay of trade The porters further desired that justice might be done upon offenders as the atrociousness of their crimes had deserved And they added That if such remedies were any longer suspended they should be forced to extremities not fit to be named and make good the saying that Necessity has no law Another petition was presented by several poor people or beggars in the name of many thousands more in which the petitioners proposed as a remedy for the public miseries That those noble worthies of the house of peers who concur with the happy votes of the commons may separate themselves from the rest and sit and vote as one entire body The commons gave thanks for this petition v Rush vol v p four hundred eighty seven Rush vol v p four hundred sixty two Dugdale p eighty seven Clarendon vol ii p four hundred twelve v Clarendon vol li p four hundred thirteen The very women were seized with the same rage A brewer s wife followed by many thousands of her sex brought a petition to the house in which the petitioners expressed their terror of the Papists and prelates and their dread of like massacres rapes and outrages with those which had been committed upon their sex in Ireland They had been necessitated they said to imitate the example of the women of Tekoah and they claimed equal right with the men of declaring by petition their sense of the public cause because Christ had purchased them at as dear a rate and in the free enjoyment of Christ consists equally the happiness of both sexes Pym came to the door of the house and having told the female zealots that their petition was thankfully accepted and was presented in a seasonable time he begged that their prayers for the success of the commons might follow their petition Such low arts of popularity were affected and by such illiberal cant were the unhappy people incited to civil discord and convulsions In the mean time not only all petitions which favored the church or monarchy from whatever hand they came were discouraged but the petitioners were sent for imprisoned and prosecuted as delinquents and this unequal conduct was openly avowed and justified Whoever desire a change it was said must express their sentiments for how otherwise shall they be known But those who favor the established government in church or state should not petition because they already enjoy what they wish for The king had possessed a great party in the lower house as appeared in the vote for the remonstrance and this party had every new cause of disgust been carefully avoided would soon have become the majority from the odium attending the violent measures embraced by the popular leaders A great majority he always possessed in the house of peers even after the bishops were confined or chased away and this majority could not have been overcome but by outrages which in the end would have drawn disgrace and ruin on those who incited them By the present fury of the people as by an inundation were all these obstacles swept away and every rampart of royal authority laid level with the ground The victory was pursued with impetuosity by the sagacious commons who knew the importance of a favorable moment in all popular commotions The terror of their authority they extended over the whole nation and all opposition and even all blame vented in private conversation were treated as the most atrocious crimes by these severe inquisitors Scarcely was it permitted to find fault with the conduct of any particular member if he made a figure in the house and reflections thrown out on Pym were at this time treated as breaches of privilege The populace without doors were ready to execute from the least hint the will of their leaders nor was it safe for any member to approach either house who pretended to control or oppose the general torrent After so undisguised a manner was this violence conducted that Hollis in a speech to the peers desired to know the names of such members as should vote contrary to the sentiments of the commons and Pym said in the lower house that the people must not be restrained in the expressions of their just desires Clarendon vol ii p four hundred forty nine King s Declaration of twelfth of August sixteen forty two King s Declaration of twelfth August sixteen forty two By the flight or terror or despondency of the king s party an undisputed majority remained everywhere to their opponents and the bills sent up by the commons which had hitherto stopped with the peers and would certainly have been rejected now passed and were presented for the royal assent These were the pressing bill with its preamble and the bill against the votes of the bishops in parliament The king s authority was at that time reduced to the lowest ebb The queen too being secretly threatened with an impeachment and finding no resource in her husband s protection was preparing to retire into Holland The rage of the people was on account of her religion as well as her spirit and activity universally levelled against her Usage the most contumelious she had hitherto borne with silent indignation The commons in their fury against priests had seized her very confessor nor would they release him upon her repeated applications Even a visit of the prince to his mother had been openly complained of and remonstrances against it had been presented to her Apprehensive of attacks still more violent she was desirous of facilitating her escape and she prevailed with the king to pass these bills in hopes of appeasing for a time the rage of the multitude These new concessions however important the king immediately found to have no other effect than had all the preceding ones they were made the foundation of demands still more exorbitant From the facility of his disposition from the weakness of his situation the commons believed that he could now refuse them nothing And they regarded the least moment of relaxation in their invasion of royal authority as highly impolitic during the uninterrupted torrent of their successes The very moment they were informed of these last acquisitions they affronted the queen by opening some intercepted letters written to her by Lord Digby they carried up an impeachment against Herbert attorney general for obeying his master s commands in accusing their members And they prosecuted with fresh vigor their plan of the militia on which they rested all future hopes of an uncontrolled authority Nalson vol ii p five hundred twelve Clarendon vol ii p four hundred twenty eight Rush vol v p four hundred eighty nine Clarendon vol ii p three hundred eighty five The commons were sensible that monarchical government which during so many ages had been established in England would soon regain some degree of its former dignity after the present tempest was overblown nor would all their new invented limitations be able totally to suppress an authority to which the nation had ever been accustomed The sword alone to which all human ordinances must submit could guard their acquired power and fully insure to them personal safety against the rising indignation of their sovereign This point therefore became the chief object of their aims A large magazine of arms being placed in the town of Hull they despatched thither Sir John Hotham a gentleman of considerable fortune in the neighborhood and of an ancient family and they gave him the authority of governor They sent orders to Goring governor of Portsmouth to obey no commands but such as he should receive from the parliament Not content with having obliged the king to displace Lunsford whom he had appointed governor of the Tower they never ceased soliciting him till he had also displaced Sir John Biron a man of unexceptionable character and had bestowed that command on Sir John Conyers in whom alone they said they could repose confidence After making a fruitless attempt in which the peers refused their concurrence to give public warning that the people should put themselves in a posture of defence against the enterprises of Papists and other ill affected persons they now resolved by a bold and decisive stroke to seize at once the whole power of the sword and to confer it entirely on their own creatures and adherents Rush voL v p four hundred fifty nine Nalson vol ii p eight hundred fifty The severe votes passed in the beginning of this parliament against lieutenants and their deputies for exercising powers assumed by all their predecessors had totally disarmed the crown and had not left in any magistrate military authority sufficient for the defence and security of the nation To remedy this inconvenience now appeared necessary A bill was introduced and passed the two houses which restored to lieutenants and deputies the same powers of which the votes of the commons had bereaved them but at the same time the names of all the lieutenants were inserted in the bill and these consisted entirely of men in whom the parliament could confide And for their conduct they were accountable by the express terms of the bill not to the king but to the parliament The policy pursued by the commons and which had hitherto succeeded to admiration was to astonish the king by the boldness of their enterprises to intermingle no sweetness with their severity to employ expressions no less violent than their pretensions and to make him sensible in what little estimation they held both his person and his dignity To a bill so destructive of royal authority they prefixed with an insolence seemingly wanton a preamble equally dishonorable to the personal character of the king These are the words Whereas there has been of late a most dangerous and desperate design upon the house of commons which we have just cause to believe an effect of the bloody counsels of Papists and other ill affected persons who have already raised a rebellion in the kingdom of Ireland And whereas by reason of many discoveries we cannot but fear they will proceed not only to stir up the like rebellions and insurrections in this kingdom of England but also to back them with forces from abroad et cetera Here Charles first ventured to put a stop to his concessions and that not by a refusal but a delay When this demand was made a demand which if granted the commons justly regarded as the last they should ever have occasion to make he was at Dover attending the queen and the princess of Orange in their embarkation He replied that he had not now leisure to consider a matter of so great importance and must therefore respite his answer till his return The parliament instantly despatched another message to him with solicitations still more importunate They expressed their great grief on account of his majesty s answer to their just and necessary petition They represented that any delay during dangers and distractions so great and pressing was not less unsatisfactory and destructive than an absolute denial They insisted that it was their duty to see put in execution a measure so necessary for public safety And they affirmed that the people in many counties had applied to them for that purpose and in some places were of themselves and by their own authority providing against those urgent dangers with which they were threatened Rush vol v p five hundred nineteen Rush vol v p five hundred twenty one Rush vol v p five hundred twenty one Even after this insolence the king durst not venture upon a flat denial Besides excepting to the preamble which such dishonor upon him and protesting the innocence of his intentions when he entered the house of commons he only desired that the military authority if it were defective should first be conferred upon the crown and he promised to bestow commissions but such as should be revocable at pleasure on the same persons whom the parliament had named in the bill By a former message he had expressed his wishes that they would lay before him in one view all the concessions which they deemed requisite for the settlement of the nation They pretended that they were exposed to perils so dreadful and imminent that they had not leisure for such a work The expedient proposed by the king seemed a sufficient remedy during this emergence and yet maintained the prerogatives of the crown entire and unbroken But the intentions of the commons were wide of this purpose and their panics could be cured by one remedy alone They instantly replied that the dangers and distempers of the nation were such as could endure no longer delay and unless the king speedily complied with their demands they should be constrained for the safety of prince and people to dispose of the militia by the authority of both houses and were resolved to do it accordingly They asserted that those parts of the kingdom which had from their own authority put themselves in a posture of defence during these prevailing fears and jealousies had acted suitably to the declarations and directions of both houses and conformably to the laws of the kingdom And while they thus menaced the king with their power they invited him to fix his residence at London where they knew he would be entirely at mercy Rush vol v p five hundred twenty one Rush vol v p five hundred sixteen

vol v p seven hundred twenty two May book ii p fifty four Rush vol v p seven hundred twenty eight Warwick p one hundred eighty nine CHAPTER LVI CHARLES I When two names so sacred in the English constitution as those of king and parliament were placed in opposition no wonder the people were divided in their choice and were agitated with the most violent animosities and factions The nobility and more considerable gentry dreading a total confusion of rank from the fury of the populace enlisted themselves in defence of the monarch from whom they received and to whom they communicated their lustre Animated with the spirit of loyalty derived from their ancestors they adhered to the ancient principles of the constitution and valued themselves on exerting the maxims as well as inheriting the possessions of the old English families And while they passed their time mostly at their country seats they were surprised to hear of opinions prevailing with which they had ever been unacquainted and which implied not a limitation but an abolition almost total of monarchical authority The city of London on the other hand and most of the great corporations took part with the parliament and adopted with zeal those democratical principles on which the pretensions of that assembly were founded The government of cities which even under absolute monarchies is commonly republican inclined them to this party the small hereditary influence which can be retained over the industrious inhabitants of towns the natural independence of citizens and the force of popular currents over those more numerous associations of mankind all these causes gave their authority to the new principles propagated throughout the nation Many families too which had lately been enriched by commerce saw with indignation that notwithstanding their opulence they could not raise themselves to a level with the ancient gentry they therefore adhered to a power by whose success they hoped to acquire rank and consideration And the new splendor and glory of the Dutch commonwealth where liberty so happily supported industry made the commercial part af the nation desire to see a like form of government established in England Clarendon vol iii p four The genius of the two religions so closely at this time interwoven with politics corresponded exactly to these divisions The Presbyterian religion was new republican and suited to the genius of the populace the other had an air of greater show and ornament was established on ancient authority and bore an affinity to the kingly and aristocratical parts of the constitution The devotees of Presbytery became of course zealous partisans of the parliament the friends of the Episcopal church valued themselves on defending the rights of monarchy Some men also there were of liberal education who being either careless or ignorant of those disputes bandied about by the clergy of both sides aspired to nothing but an easy enjoyment of life amidst the jovial entertainment and social intercourse of their companions All these flocked to the king s standard where they breathed a freer air and were exempted from that rigid preciseness and melancholy austerity which reigned among the parliamentary party Never was a quarrel more unreal than seemed at first than between the contending parties almost every advantage lay against the royal cause The king s revenue had been seized from the beginning by the parliament who issued out to him from time to time small sums for his present subsistence and as soon as he withdrew to York they totally stopped all payments London and all the seaports except Newcastle being in their hands the customs yielded them a certain and considerable supply of money and all contributions loans and impositions were more easily raised from the cities which possessed the ready money and where men lived under their inspection than they could be levied by the king in those open countries which after some time declared for him The seamen naturally followed the disposition of the sea ports to which they belonged and the earl of Northumberland lord admiral having embraced the party of the parliament had appointed at their desire the earl of Warwick to be his lieutenant who at once established his authority in the fleet and kept the entire dominion of the sea in the hands of that assembly All the magazines of arms and amunition were from the first seized by the parliament and their fleet intercepted the greater part of those which were sent by the queen from Holland The king was obliged in order to arm his followers to borrow the weapons of the train bands under promise of restoring them as soon as peace should be settled in the kingdom The veneration for parliaments was at this time extreme throughout the nation The custom of reviling those assemblies for corruption as it had no pretence so was it unknown during all former ages Few or no instances of their encroaching ambition or selfish claims had hitherto been observed Men considered the house of commons in no other light than as the representatives of the nation whose interest was the same with that of the public who were the eternal guardians of law and liberty and whom no motive but the necessary defence of the people could ever engage in an opposition to the crown The torrent therefore of general affection ran to the parliament What is the great advantage of popularity the privilege of affixing epithets fell of course to that party The king s adherents were the wicked and the malignant their adversaries were the godly and the well affected And as the force of the cities was more united than that of the country and at once gave shelter and protection to the parliamentary party who could easily suppress the royalists in their neighborhood almost the whole kingdom at the commencement of the war seemed to be in the hands of the parliament Walker p three hundred thirty six Warwick p three hundred eighteen What alone gave the king some compensation for all the advantages possessed by his adversaries was the nature and qualities of his adherents More bravery and activity were hoped for from the generous spirit of the nobles and gentry than from the base disposition of the multitude And as the men of estates at their own expense levied and armed their tenants besides an attachment to their masters greater force and courage were to be expected in these rustic troops than in the vicious and enervated populace of cities The neighboring states of Europe being engaged in violent wars little interested themselves in these civil commotions and this island enjoyed the singular advantage for such it surely was of fighting out its own quarrels without the interposition of foreigners France from policy had fomented the first disorders in Scotland had sent over arms to the Irish rebels and continued to give countenance to the English parliament Spain from bigotry furnished the Irish with some supplies of money and arms The prince of Orange closely allied to the crown encouraged English officers who served in the Low Countries to enlist in the king s army the Scottish officers who had been formed in Germany and in the late commotions chiefly took part with the parliament The contempt entertained by the parliament for the king s party was so great that it was the chief cause of pushing matters to such extremities against him and many believed that he never would attempt resistance but must soon yield to the pretensions however enormous of the two houses Even after his standard was erected men could not be brought to apprehend the danger of a civil war nor was it imagined that he would have the imprudence to enrage his implacable enemies and render his own condition more desperate by opposing a force which was so much superior The low condition in which he appeared at Nottingham confirmed all these hopes His artillery though far from numerous had been left at York for want of horses to transport it Besides the trained bands of the county raised by Sir John Digby the sheriff he had not gotten together above three hundred infantry His cavalry in which consisted his chief strength exceeded not eight hundred and were very ill provided with arms The forces of the parliament lay at Northampton within a few days march of him and consisted of above six thousand men well armed and well appointed Had these troops advanced upon him they must soon have dissipated the small force which he had assembled By pursuing him in his retreat they had so discredited his cause and discouraged his adherents as to have forever prevented his collecting an army able to make head against them But the earl of Essex the parliamentary general had not yet received any orders from his masters Clarendon vol iii p one two What rendered them so backward after such precipitate steps as they had formerly taken is not easily explained It is probable that in the extreme distress of his party consisted the present safety of the king The parliament hoped that the royalists sensible of their feeble condition and convinced of their slender resources would disperse of themselves and leave their adversaries a victory so much the more complete and secure as it would be gained without the appearance of force and without bloodshed Perhaps too when it became necessary to make the concluding step and offer barefaced violence to their sovereign their scruples and apprehensions though not sufficient to overcome their resolutions were able to retard the execution of them Sir Jacob Astley whom the king had appointed major general of his intended army told him that he could not give him assurance but he might be taken out of his bed if the rebels should make a brisk attempt to that purpose All the king s attendants were full of well grounded apprehensions Some of the lords having desired that a message might be sent to the parliament with overtures to a treaty Charles who well knew that an accommodation in his present condition meant nothing but a total submission hastily broke up the council lest this proposal should be further insisted on But next day the earl of Southampton whom no one could suspect of base or timid sentiments having offered the same advice in council it was hearkened to with more coolness and deliberation He urged that though such a step would probably increase the insolence of the parliament this was so far from being an objection that such dispositions must necessarily turn to the advantage of the royal cause that if they refused to treat which was more probable the very sound of peace was so popular that nothing could more disgust the nation than such haughty severity that if they admitted of a treaty their proposals considering their present situation would be so exorbitant as to open the eyes of their most partial adherents and turn the general favor to the king s party and that at worst time might be gained by this expedient and a delay of the imminent danger with which the king was at present threatened Charles on assembling the council had declared against all advances towards an accommodation and had said that having now nothing left him but his honor this last possession he was resolved steadily to preserve and rather to perish than yield any further to the pretensions of his enemies but by the unanimous desire of the counsellors he was prevailed on to embrace Southampton s advice That nobleman therefore with Sir John Colepeper and Sir William Uvedale was despatched to London with offers of a treaty Clarendon vol iii p eighteen Clarendon vol iii p seven Clarendon vol iii p seven Rush vol v p seven hundred eighty four The manner in which they were received gave little hopes of success Southampton was not allowed by the peers to take his seat but was ordered to deliver his message to the usher and immediately to depart the city the commons showed little better disposition towards Colepeper and Uvedale Both houses replied that they could admit of no treaty with the king till he took down his standard and recalled his proclamations in which the parliament supposed themselves to be declared traitors The king by a second message denied any such intention against the two houses but offered to recall these proclamations provided the parliament agreed to recall theirs in which his adherents were declared traitors They desired him in return to dismiss his forces to reside with his parliament and to give up delinquents to their justice that is abandon himself and his friends to the mercy of his enemies Both parties flattered themselves that by these messages and replies they had gained the ends which they proposed The king believed that the people were made sufficiently sensible of the parliament s insolence and aversion to peace the parliament intended by this vigor in their resolutions to support the vigor of their military operations The courage of the parliament was increased besides their great superiority of force by two recent events which had happened in their favor Goring was governor of Portsmouth the best fortified town in the kingdom and by its situation of great importance This man seemed to have rendered himself an implacable enemy to the king by betraying probably magnifying the secret cabals of the army and the parliament thought that his fidelity to them might on that account be entirely depended on But the same levity of mind still attended him and the same disregard to engagements and professions He took underhand his measures with the court and declared against the parliament But though he had been sufficiently supplied with money and long before knew his danger so small was his foresight that he had left the place entirely destitute of provisions and in a few days he was obliged to surrender to the parliamentary forces Clarendon vol iii p ten Rush vol v p seven hundred eighty six Dugdale p one hundred two Whitlocke p fifty nine Rush vol v p six hundred eighty three Whitlocke p sixty Clarendon vol iii p nineteen The marquis of Hertford was a nobleman of the greatest quality and character in the kingdom and equally with the king descended by a female from Henry VII During the reign of James he had attempted without having obtained the consent of that monarch to marry Arabella Stuart a lady nearly related to the crown and upon discovery of his intentions had been obliged for some time to fly the kingdom Ever after he was looked on with an evil eye at court from which in a great measure he withdrew and living in an independent manner he addicted himself entirely to literary occupations and amusements In proportion as the king declined in popularity Hertford s character flourished with the people and when this parliament assembled no nobleman possessed more general favor and authority By his sagacity he soon perceived that the commons not content with correcting the abuses of government were carried by the natural current of power and popularity into the opposite extreme and were committing violations no less dangerous than the former upon the English constitution Immediately he devoted himself to the support of the king s falling authority and was prevailed with to be governor to the young prince and reside at court to which in the eyes of all men he gave by his presence a new lustre and authority So high was his character for mildness and humanity that he still preserved by means of these popular virtues the public favor and every one was sensible of the true motive of his change Notwithstanding his habits of ease and study he now exerted himself in raising an army for the king and being named general of the western counties where his interest chiefly lay he began to assemble forces in Somersetshire By the assistance of Lord Seymour Lord Paulet John Digby son of the earl of Bristol Sir Francis Hawley and others he had drawn together some appearance of an army when the parliament apprehensive of the danger sent the earl of Bedford with a considerable force against him On his approach Hertford was obliged to retire into Sherborne Castle and finding that place untenable he himself passed over into Wales leaving Sir Ralph Hopton Sir John Berkeley Digby and other officers with their horse consisting of about a hundred and twenty to march into Cornwall in hopes of finding that county better prepared for their reception Clarendon vol vi p two three et cetera All the dispersed bodies of the parliamentary army were now ordered to march to Northampton and the earl of Essex who had joined them found the whole amount to fifteen thousand men The king though his camp had been gradually reenforced from all quarters was sensible that he had no army which could cope with so formidable a force and he thought it prudent by slow marches to retire to Derby thence to Shrewsbury in order to countenance the levies which his friends were making in those parts At Wellington a day s march from Shrewsbury he made a rendezvous of all his forces and caused his military orders to be read at the head of every regiment That he might bind himself by reciprocal ties he solemnly made the following declaration before his whole army I do promise in the presence of Almighty God and as I hope for his blessing and protection that I will to the utmost of my power defend and maintain the true reformed Protestant religion established in the church of England and by the grace of God in the same will live and die I desire that the laws may ever be the measure of my government and that the liberty and property of the subject may be preserved by them with the same care as my own just rights And if it please God by his blessing on this army raised for my necessary defence to preserve me from the present rebellion I do solemnly and faithfully promise in the sight of God to maintain the just privileges and freedom of parliament and to govern to the utmost of my power by the known statutes and customs of the kingdom and particularly to observe inviolably the laws to which I have given my consent this parliament Meanwhile if this emergence and the great necessity to which I am driven beget any violation of law I hope it shall be imputed by God and man to the authors of this war not to me who have so earnestly labored to preserve the peace of the kingdom When I willingly fail in these particulars I shall expect no aid or relief from man nor any protection from above but in this resolution I hope for the cheerful assistance of all good men and am confident of the blessing of Heaven Whitlocke p sixty Clarendon vol iii p fifteen seventeen Dugdale p one hundred four Though the concurrence of the church undoubtedly increased the king s adherents it may safely be affirmed that the high monarchical doctrines so much inculcated by the clergy had never done him any real service The bulk of that generous train of nobility and gentry who now attended the king in his distresses breathed the spirit of liberty as well as of loyalty and in the hopes alone of his submitting to a legal and limited government were they willing in his defence to sacrifice their lives and fortunes While the king s army lay at Shrewsbury and he was employing himself in collecting money which he received though in no great quantities by voluntary contributions and by the plate of the universities which was sent him the news arrived of an action the first which had happened in these wars and where he was successful On the appearance of commotions in England the princes Rupert and Maurice sons of the unfortunate palatine had offered their service to the king and the former at that time commanded a body of horse which had been sent to Worcester in order to watch the motions of Essex who was marching towards that city No sooner had the prince arrived than he saw some cavalry of the enemy approaching the gates Without delay he briskly attacked them as they were defiling from a lane and forming themselves Colonel Sandys who led them and who fought with valor being mortally wounded fell from his horse The whole party was routed and was pursued above a mile The prince hearing of Essex s approach retired to the main body This rencounter though in itself of small importance mightily raised the reputation of the royalists and acquired to Prince Rupert the character of promptitude and courage qualities which he eminently displayed during the whole course of the war The king on mustering his army found it amount to ten thousand men The earl of Lindesey who in his youth had sought experience of military service in the Low Countries was general Prince Rupert commanded the horse Sir Jacob Astley the foot Sir Arthur Aston the dragoons Sir John Heydon the artillery Lord Bernard Stuart was at the head of a troop of guards The estates and revenue of this single troop according to Lord Clarendon s computation were at least equal to those of all the members who at the commencement of war voted in both houses Their servants under the command of Sir William Killigrew made another troop and always marched with their masters Clarendon vol iii p twenty five May book iii p ten He was then Lord Willoughby Clarendon vol iii p forty one Warwick p two hundred thirty one With this army the king left Shrewsbury resolving to give battle as soon as possible to the army of the parliament which he heard was continually augmenting by supplies from London In order to bring on an action he directed his march towards the capital which he knew the enemy would not abandon to him Essex had now received his instructions The import of them was to present a most humble petition to the king and to rescue him and the royal family from those desperate malignants who had seized their persons Two days after the departure of the royalists from Shrewsbury he left Worcester Though it be commonly easy in civil wars to get intelligence the armies were within six miles of each other ere either of the generals was acquainted with the approach of his enemy Shrewsbury and Worcester the places from which they set out are not above twenty miles distant yet had the two armies marched ten days in this mutual ignorance so much had military skill during a long peace decayed in England Whitlocke p fifty nine Clarendon vol iii p twenty seven twenty eight et cetera Clarendon vol iii p forty four The royal army lay near Banbury that of the parliament at Keinton in the county of Warwick Prince Rupert sent intelligence of the enemy s approach Though the day was far advanced the king resolved upon the attack Essex drew up his men to receive him Sir Faithful Fortescue who had levied a troop for the Irish wars had been obliged to serve in the parliamentary army and was now posted on the left wing commanded by Ramsay a Scotchman No sooner did the king s army approach than Fortescue ordering his troop to discharge their pistols in the ground put himself under the command of Prince Rupert Partly from this incident partly from the furious shock made upon them by the prince that whole wing of cavalry immediately fled and were pursued for two miles The right wing of the parliament s army had no better success Chased from their ground by Wilmot and Sir Arthur Aston they also took to flight The king s body of reserve commanded by Sir John Biron judging like raw soldiers that all was over and impatient to have some share in the action heedlessly followed the chase which their left wing had precipitately led them Sir William Balfour who commanded Essex s reserve perceived the advantage he wheeled about upon the king s infantry now quite unfurnished of horse and he made great havoc among them Lindesey the general was mortally wounded and taken prisoner His son endeavoring his rescue fell likewise into the enemy s hands Sir Edmund Verney who carried the king s standard was killed and the standard taken but it was afterwards recovered In this situation Prince Rupert on his return found affairs Every thing bore the appearance of a defeat instead of a victory with which he had hastily flattered himself Some advised the king to leave the field but that prince rejected such pusillanimous counsel The two armies faced each other for some time and neither of them retained courage sufficient for a new attack All night they lay under arms and next morning found themselves in sight of each other General as well as soldier on both sides seemed averse to renew the battle Essex first drew off and retired to Warwick The king returned to his former quarters Five thousand men are said to have been found dead on the field of battle and the loss of the two armies as far as we can judge by the opposite accounts was nearly equal Such was the event of this first battle fought at Keinton or Edge Hill Some of Essex s horse who had been driven off the field in the beginning of the action flying to a great distance carried news of a total defeat and struck a mighty terror into the city and parliament After a few days a more just account arrived and then the parliament pretended to a complete victory The king also on his part was not wanting to display his advantages though except the taking of Banbury a few days after he had few marks of victory to boast of He continued his march and took possession of Oxford the only town in his dominions which was altogether at his devotion Clarendon vol iii p forty four et cetera May book iii p sixteen et cetera Whitlocke p sixty one Clarendon vol iii p fifty nine After the royal army was recruited and refreshed as the weather still continued favorable it was again put in motion A party of horse approached to Reading of which Martin was appointed governor by the parliament Both governor and garrison were seized with a panic and fled with precipitation to London The king hoping that every thing would yield before him advanced with his whole army to Reading The parliament who instead of their fond expectations that Charles would never be able to collect an army had now the prospect of a civil war bloody and of uncertain event were further alarmed at the near approach of the royal army while their own forces lay at a distance They voted an address for a treaty The king s nearer approach to Colebroke quickened their advances for peace Northumberland and Pembroke with three commoners presented the address of both houses in which they besought his majesty to appoint some convenient place where he might reside till committees could attend him with proposals The king named Windsor and desired that their garrison might be removed and his own troops admitted into that castle Meanwhile Essex advancing by hasty marches had arrived at London But neither the presence of his army nor the precarious hopes of a treaty retarded the king s approaches Charles attacked at Brentford two regiments quartered there and after a sharp action beat them from that village and took about five hundred prisoners The parliament had sent orders to forbear all hostilities and had expected the same from the king though no stipulations to that purpose had been mentioned by their commissioners Loud complaints were raised against this attack as if it had been the most apparent perfidy and breach of treaty Inflamed with resentment as well as anxious for its own safety the city marched its trained bands in excellent order and joined the army under Essex The parliamentary army now amounted to above twenty four thousand men and was much superior to that of the king After both armies had faced each other for some time Charles drew off and retired to Reading thence to Oxford While the principal armies on both sides were kept in inaction by the winter season the king and parliament were employed in real preparations for war and in seeming advances towards peace By means of contributions or assessments levied by the horse Charles maintained his cavalry by loans and voluntary presents sent him from all parts of the kingdom he supported his infantry but the supplies were still very unequal to the necessities under which he labored Whitlocke p sixty two Clarendon vol iii p seventy three Whitlocke p sixty two Clarendon vol iii p seventy five Whitlocke p sixty two Clarendon vol iii p eighty seven The parliament had much greater resources for money and had by consequence every military preparation in much greater order and abundance Besides an imposition levied in London amounting to the five and twentieth part of every one s substance they established on that city a weekly assessment of ten thousand pounds and another of twenty three thousand five hundred and eighteen on the rest of the kingdom And as their authority was at present established in most counties they levied these taxes with regularity though they amounted to sums much greater than the nation had formerly paid to the public The king and parliament sent reciprocally their demands and a treaty commenced but without any cessation of hostilities as had at first been proposed The earl of Northumberland and four members of the lower house came to Oxford as commissioners In this treaty the king perpetually insisted on the reestablishment of the crown in its legal powers and on the restoration of his constitutional prerogative the parliament still required new concessions and a further abridgment of regal authority as a more effectual remedy to their fears and jealousies Finding the king supported by more forces and a greater party than they had ever looked for they seemingly abated somewhat of those extravagant conditions which they had formerly claimed but their demands were still too high for an equal treaty Besides other articles to which a complete victory alone could entitle them they required the king in express terms utterly to abolish Episcopacy a demand which before they had only insinuated and they required that all other ecclesiastical controversies should be determined by their assembly of divines that is in the manner the most repugnant to the inclinations of the king and all his partisans They insisted that he should submit to the punishment of his most faithful adherents And they desired him to acquiesce in their settlement of the militia and to confer on their adherents the entire power of the sword In answer to the king s proposal that his magazines towns forts and ships should be restored to him the parliament required that they should be put into such hands as they

treason by levying war against their sovereign it is evident that their fears and jealousies must on that account have multiplied extremely and have rendered their personal safety which they interwove with the safety of the nation still more incompatible with the authority of the monarch Though the gentleness and lenity of the king s temper might have insured them against schemes of future vengeance they preferred as is no doubt natural an independent security accompanied too with sovereign power to the station of subjects and that not entirely guarded from all apprehensions of danger twelve The conferences went no further than the first demand on each side The parliament finding that there was no likelihood of coming to any agreement suddenly recalled their commissioners A military enterprise which they had concerted early in the spring was immediately undertaken Reading the garrison of the king s which lay nearest to London was esteemed a place of considerable strength in that age when the art of attacking towns was not well understood in Europe and was totally unknown in England The earl of Essex sat down before this place with an army of eighteen thousand men and carried on the siege by regular approaches Sir Arthur Aston the governor being wounded Colonel Fielding succeeded to the command In a little time the town was found to be no longer in a condition of defence and though the king approached with an intention of obliging Essex to raise the siege the disposition of the parliamentary army was so strong as rendered the design impracticable Fielding therefore was contented to yield the town on condition that he should bring off all the garrison with the honors of war and deliver up deserters This last article was thought so ignominious and so prejudicial to the king s interests that the governor was tried by a council of war and condemned to lose his life for consenting to it His sentence was afterwards remitted by the king See note L at

necessaries from London even many superfluities and luxuries were sent them by the care of the zealous citizens yet the hardships which they suffered from the siege during so early a season had weakened them to such a degree that they were no longer fit for any new enterprise And the two armies for some time encamped in the neighborhood of each other without attempting on either side any action of moment Besides the military operations between the principal armies which lay in the centre of England each county each town each family almost was divided within itself and the most violent convulsions shook the whole kingdom Throughout the winter continual efforts had every where been made by each party to surmount its antagonist and the English roused from the lethargy of peace with eager though unskilful hands employed against their fellow citizens their long neglected weapons The furious zeal for liberty and Presbyterian discipline which had hitherto run uncontrolled throughout the nation now at last excited an equal ardor for monarchy and Episcopacy when the intention of abolishing these ancient modes of government was openly avowed by the parliament Conventions for neutrality though in several counties they had been entered into and confirmed by the most solemn oaths yet being voted illegal by the two houses were immediately broken and the fire of discord was spread into every quarter The altercation of discourse the controversies of the pen but above all the declamations of the pulpit indisposed the minds of men towards each other and propagated the blind rage of party Fierce however and inflamed as were the dispositions of the English by a war both civil and religious that great destroyer of humanity all the events of this period are less distinguished by atrocious deeds either of treachery or cruelty than were ever any intestine discords which had so long a continuance a circumstance which will be found to reflect great praise on the

the earl of Northampton and Sir John Gell the former who commanded the king s forces was killed while he fought with great valor and his forces discouraged by his death though they had obtained the advantage in the action retreated into the town of Stafford Sir William Waller began to distinguish himself among the generals of the parliament Active and indefatigable in his operations rapid and enterprising he was fitted by his genius to the nature of the war which being managed by raw troops conducted by unexperienced commanders afforded success to every bold and sudden undertaking After taking Winchester and Chichester he advanced towards Gloucester which was in a manner blockaded by Lord Herbert who had levied considerable forces in Wales for the royal party While he attacked the Welsh on one side a sally from Gloucester made impression on the other Herbert was defeated five hundred of his men killed on the spot a thousand taken prisoners and he himself escaped with some difficulty to Oxford Hereford esteemed a strong town defended by a considerable garrison was surrendered to Waller from the cowardice of Colonel Price the governor Tewkesbury underwent the same fate

Lord Broke was a zealous Puritan and had formerly said that he hoped to see with his eyes the ruin of all the cathedrals of England It was a superstitious remark of the royalists that he was killed on

Cornwall were much inclined to the king s service While Sir Richard Duller and Sir Alexander Carew lay at Launceston and employed themselves in executing the parliament s ordinance for the militia a meeting of the county was assembled at Truro and after Hopton produced his commission from the earl of Hertford the king s general it was agreed to execute the laws and to expel these invaders of the county The train bands were accordingly levied Launceston taken and all Cornwall reduced to peace and to obedience under the king It had been usual for the royal party on the commencement of these disorders to claim on all occasions the strict execution of the laws which they knew were favorable to them and the parliament rather than have recourse to the plea of necessity and avow the

reduced to great extremities and it became prudent in the king if not absolutely necessary to embrace some expedient which might secure them for a time from the ruin and misery with which they were threatened Accordingly the king gave orders to Ormond and the justices to conclude for a year a cessation of arms with the council of Kilkenny by whom the Irish were governed and to leave both sides in possession of their present advantages The parliament whose business it was to find fault with every measure adopted by the opposite party and who would not lose so fair an opportunity of reproaching the king with his favor to the Irish Papists exclaimed loudly against this cessation Among other reasons they insisted upon the divine vengeance which England might justly dread for

eighty eight CHAPTER LVII CHARLES I The king had hitherto during the course of the war obtained many advantages over the parliament and had raised himself from that low condition into which he had at first fallen to be nearly upon an equal footing with his adversaries Yorkshire and all the northern counties were reduced by the marquis of Newcastle and excepting Hull the parliament was master of no garrison in these quarters In the west Plymouth alone having been in vain besieged by Prince Maurice resisted the king s authority and had it not been for the disappointment in the enterprise of Gloucester the royal garrisons had reached without interruption from one end of the kingdom to the other and had occupied a greater extent of ground than those of the parliament Many of the royalists flattered themselves that the same vigorous spirit which had elevated them to the present height of power would still favor their progress and obtain them a final victory over their enemies but those who judged more soundly observed that besides the accession of the whole Scottish nation to the side of the parliament the very principle on which the royal successes had been founded was every day acquired more and more by the opposite party The king s troops full of gentry and nobility had exerted a valor superior to their enemies and had hitherto been successful in almost every rencounter but in proportion as the whole nation became warlike by the continuance of civil discords this advantage was more equally shared and superior numbers it was expected must at length obtain the victory The king s troops also ill paid and destitute of every necessary could not possibly be retained in equal discipline with the parliamentary forces to whom all supplies were furnished from unexhausted stores and treasures Rush vol vi p five hundred sixty The severity of manners so much affected by these zealous religionists assisted their military institutions and the rigid inflexibility of character by which the austere reformers of church and state were distinguished enabled the parliamentary chiefs to restrain their soldiers within stricter rules and more exact order And while the king s officers indulged themselves even in greater licenses than those to which during times of peace they had been accustomed they were apt both to neglect their military duty and to set a pernicious example of disorder to the soldiers under their command At the commencement of the civil war all Englishmen who served abroad were invited over and treated with extraordinary respect and most of them being descended of good families and by reason of their absence unacquainted with the new principles which depressed the dignity of the crown had enlisted under the royal standard But it is observable that though the military profession requires great genius and long experience in the principal commanders all its subordinate duties may be discharged by ordinary talents and from superficial practice Citizens and country gentlemen soon became excellent officers and the generals of greatest fame and capacity happened all of them to spring up on the side of the parliament The courtiers and great nobility in the other party checked the growth of any extraordinary genius among the subordinate officers and every man there as in a regular established government was confined to the station in which his birth had placed him The king that he might make preparations during winter for the ensuing campaign summoned to Oxford all the members of either house who adhered to his interests and endeavored to avail himself of the name of parliament so passionately cherished by the English nation The house of peers was pretty full and beside the nobility employed in different parts of the kingdom it contained twice as many members as commonly voted at Westminster The house of commons consisted of about one hundred and forty which amounted not to above half of the other house of commons Rush vol vi p five hundred fifty nine Rush vol vi p five hundred sixty six five hundred seventy four five hundred seventy five So extremely light had government hitherto lain upon the people that the very name of excise was unknown to them and among the other evils arising from these domestic wars was the introduction of that impost into England The parliament at Westminster having voted an excise on beer wine and other commodities those at Oxford imitated the example and conferred that revenue on the king And in order to enable him the better to recruit his army they granted him the sum of one hundred thousand pounds to be levied by way of loan upon the subject The king circulated privy seals countersigned by the speakers of both houses requiring the loan of particular sums from such persons as lived within his quarters Neither party had as yet got above the pedantry of reproaching their antagonists with these illegal measures The Westminster parliament passed a whimsical ordinance commanding all the inhabitants of London and the neighborhood to retrench a meal a week and to pay the value of it for the support of the public cause It is easily imagined that provided the money were paid they troubled themselves but little about the execution of their ordinance Rush vol vi p five hundred ninety Dugdale p one hundred nineteen Rush vol vi p seven hundred forty eight Such was the king s situation that in order to restore peace to the nation he had no occasion to demand any other terms than the restoring of the laws and constitution the replacing him in the same rights which had ever been enjoyed by his predecessors and the reestablishing on its ancient basis the whole frame of government civil as well as ecclesiastical And that he might facilitate an end seemingly so desirable he offered to employ means equally popular a universal act of oblivion and a toleration or indulgence to tender consciences Nothing therefore could contribute more to his interests than every discourse of peace and every discussion of the conditions upon which that blessing could be obtained For this reason he solicited a treaty on all occasions and desired a conference and mutual examination of pretensions even when he entertained no hopes that any conclusion could possibly result from it For like reasons the parliament prudently avoided as much as possible all advances towards negotiation and were cautious not to expose too easily to censure those high terms which their apprehensions or their ambition made them previously demand of the king Though their partisans were blinded with the thickest veil of religious prejudices they dreaded to bring their pretensions to the test or lay them open before the whole nation In opposition to the sacred authority of the laws to the venerable precedents of many ages the popular leaders were ashamed to plead nothing but fears and jealousies which were not avowed by the constitution and for which neither the personal character of Charles so full of virtue nor his situation so deprived of all independent authority seemed to afford any reasonable foundation Grievances which had been fully redressed powers either legal or illegal which had been entirely renounced it seemed unpopular and invidious and ungrateful any further to insist on The king that he might abate the universal veneration paid to the name of parliament had issued a declaration in which he set forth all the tumults by which himself and his partisans in both houses had been driven from London and he thence inferred that the assembly at Westminster was no longer a free parliament and till its liberty were restored was entitled to no authority As this declaration was an obstacle to all treaty some contrivance seemed requisite in order to elude it A letter was written in the foregoing spring to the earl of Essex and subscribed by the prince the duke of York and forty three noblemen They there exhort him to be an instrument of restoring peace and to promote that happy end with those by whom he was employed Essex though much disgusted with the parliament though apprehensive of the extremities to which they were driving though desirous of any reasonable accommodation yet was still more resolute to preserve an honorable fidelity to the trust reposed in him He replied that as the paper sent him neither contained any address to the two houses of parliament nor any acknowledgment of their authority he could not communicate it to them Like proposals had been reiterated by the king during the ensuing campaign and still met with a like answer from Essex Clarendon vol iii p four hundred forty two Rush vol vi p five hundred sixty six Whitlocke p seventy seven Clarendon vol iii p four hundred forty four Rush vol vi p five hundred sixty nine five hundred seventy Whitlocke p ninety four In order to make a new trial for a treaty the king this spring sent another letter directed to the lords and commons of parliament assembled at Westminster but as he also mentioned in the letter the lords and commons of parliament assembled at Oxford and declared that his scope and intention was to make provision that all the members of both houses might securely meet in a full and free assembly the parliament perceiving the conclusion implied refused all treaty upon such terms And the king who knew what small hopes there were of accommodation would not abandon the pretensions which he had assumed nor acknowledge the two houses more expressly for a free parliament This winter the famous Pym died a man as much hated by one party as respected by the other At London he was considered as the victim to national liberty who had abridged his life by incessant labors for the interests of his country at Oxford he was believed to have been struck with an uncommon disease and to have been consumed with vermin as a mark of divine vengeance for his multiplied crimes and treasons He had been so little studious of improving his private fortune in those civil wars of which he had been one principal author that the parliament thought themselves obliged from gratitude to pay the debts which he had contracted We now return to the military operations which during the winter were carried on with vigor in several places notwithstanding the severity of the season The forces brought from Ireland were landed at Mostyne in North Wales and being put under the command of Lord Biron they besieged and took the Castles of Hawarden Beeston Acton and Deddington House No place in Cheshire or the neighborhood now adhered to the parliament except Nantwich and to this town Biron laid siege during the depth of winter Sir Thomas Fairfax alarmed at so considerable a progress of the royalists assembled an army of four thousand men in Yorkshire and having joined Sir William Brereton was approaching to the camp of the enemy Biron and his soldiers elated with successes obtained in Ireland had entertained the most profound contempt for the parliamentary forces a disposition which if confined to the army may be regarded as a good presage of victory but if it extend to the general is the most probable forerunner of a defeat Fairfax suddenly attacked the camp of the royalists The swelling of the river by a thaw divided one part of the army from the other That part exposed to Fairfax being beaten from their post retired into the church of Acton and were all taken prisoners the other retreated with precipitation v Clarendon vol iii p four hundred forty nine Whitlocke p seventy nine Whitlocke p sixty six Journ thirteenth of February sixteen forty five Rush vol vi p two hundred ninety nine v Rush vol vi p three hundred one And thus was dissipated or rendered useless that body of forces which had been drawn from Ireland and the parliamentary party revived in those north west counties of England The invasion from Scotland was attended with consequences of much greater importance The Scots having summoned in vain the town of Newcastle which was fortified by the vigilance of Sir Thomas Glenham passed the Tyne and faced the marquis of Newcastle who lay at Durham with an army of fourteen thousand men After some military operations in which that nobleman reduced the enemy to difficulties for forage and provisions he received intelligence of a great disaster which had befallen his forces in Yorkshire Colonel Bellasis whom he had left with a considerable body of troops was totally routed at Selby by Sir Thomas Fairfax who had returned from Cheshire with his victorious forces Afraid of being enclosed between two armies Newcastle retreated and Leven having joined Lord Fairfax they sat down before York to which the army of the royalists had retired But as the parliamentary and Scottish forces were not numerous enough to invest so large a town divided by a river they contented themselves with incommoding it by a loose blockade and affairs remained for some time in suspense between these opposite armies During this winter and spring other parts of the kingdom had also been infested with war Hopton having assembled an army of fourteen thousand men endeavored to break into Sussex Kent and the southern association which seemed well disposed to receive him Waller fell upon him at Cherington and gave him a defeat of considerable importance In another quarter siege being laid to Newark by the parliamentary forces Prince Rupert prepared himself for relieving a town of such consequence which alone preserved the communication open between the king s southern and northern quarters With a small force but that animated by his active courage he broke through the enemy relieved the town and totally dissipated that army of the parliament Rush vol vi p six hundred fifteen Rush vol vi p six hundred eighteen Rush vol vi p six hundred twenty Rush vol vi p eight hundred six But though fortune seemed to have divided her favors between the parties the king found himself in the main a considerable loser by this winter campaign and he prognosticated a still worse event from the ensuing summer The preparations of the parliament were great and much exceeded the slender resources of which he was possessed In the eastern association they levied fourteen thousand men under the earl of Manchester seconded by Cromwell An army of ten thousand men under Essex another of nearly the same force under Waller were assembled in the neighborhood of London The former was destined to oppose the king the latter was appointed to march into the west where Prince Maurice with a small army which went continually to decay was spending his time in vain before Lyme an inconsiderable town upon the sea coast The utmost efforts of the king could not raise above ten thousand men at Oxford and on their sword chiefly during the campaign were these to depend for subsistence The queen terrified with the dangers which every way environed her and afraid of being enclosed in Oxford in the middle of the kingdom fled to Exeter where she hoped to be delivered unmolested of the child with which she was now pregnant and whence she had the means of an easy escape into France if pressed by the forces of the enemy She knew the implacable hatred which the parliament on account of her religion and her credit with the king had all along borne her Last summer the commons had sent up to the peers an impeachment of high treason against her because in his utmost distresses she had assisted her husband with arms and ammunition which she had bought in Holland And had she fallen into their hands neither her sex she knew nor high station could protect her against insults at least if not danger from those haughty republicans who so little affected to conduct themselves by the maxims of gallantry and politeness Rush vol vi p six hundred twenty one Rush vol vi p three hundred twenty one From the beginning of these dissensions the parliament it is remarkable had in all things assumed an extreme ascendant over their sovereign and had displayed a violence and arrogated an authority which on his side would not have been compatible either with his temper or his situation While he spoke perpetually of pardoning all rebels they talked of nothing but the punishment of delinquents and malignants while he offered a toleration and indulgence to tender consciences they threatened the utter extirpation of prelacy to his professions of lenity they opposed declarations of rigor and the more the ancient tenor of the laws inculcated a respectful subordination to the crown the more careful were they by their lofty pretensions to cover that defect under which they labored Their great advantages in the north seemed to second their ambition and finally to promise them success in their unwarrantable enterprises Manchester having taken Lincoln had united his army to that of Leven and Fairfax and York was now closely besieged by their combined forces That town though vigorously defended by Newcastle was reduced to extremity and the parliamentary generals after enduring great losses and fatigues flattered themselves that all their labors would at last be crowned by this important conquest On a sudden they were alarmed by the approach of Prince Rupert This gallant commander having vigorously exerted himself in Lancashire and Cheshire had collected a considerable army and joining Sir Charles Lucas who commanded Newcastle s horse hastened to the relief of York with an army of twenty thousand men The Scottish and parliamentary generals raised the siege and drawing up on Marston Moor purposed to give battle to the royalists Prince Rupert approached the town by another quarter and interposing the River Ouse between him and the enemy safely joined his forces to those of Newcastle The marquis endeavored to persuade him that having so successfully effected his purpose he ought to be content with the present advantages and leave the enemy now much diminished by their losses and discouraged by their ill success to dissolve by those mutual dissensions which had begun to take place among them The prince whose martial disposition was not sufficiently tempered with prudence nor softened by complaisance pretending positive orders from the king without deigning to consult with Newcastle whose merits and services deserved better treatment immediately issued orders for battle and led out the army to Marston Moor This action was obstinately disputed between the most numerous armies that were engaged during the course of these wars nor were the forces on each side much different in number Fifty thousand British troops were led to mutual slaughter and the victory seemed long undecided between them Prince

8222_274379_000011_000002	train-clean-360	The parliament no doubt continued he had done wisely on the commencement of the war in engaging several of its members in the most dangerous parts of it and thereby satisfying the nation that they intended to share all hazards with the meanest of the people

8222_274379_000012_000000	train-clean-360	In opposition to this reasoning of the Independents many of the Presbyterians showed the inconvenience and danger of the projected alteration 
none	none	Whitlocke in particular a man of honor who loved his country though in every change of government he always adhered to the ruling power said that besides the ingratitude of discarding and that by fraud and artifice so many noble persons to whom the parliament had hitherto owed its chief support they would find it extremely difficult to supply the place of men now formed by experience to command and authority that the rank alone possessed by such as were members of either house prevented envy retained the army in obedience and gave weight to military orders that greater confidence might safely be reposed in men of family and fortune than in mere adventurers who would be apt to entertain separate views from those which were embraced by the persons who employed them that no maxim of policy was more undisputed than the necessity of preserving an inseparable connection between the civil and military powers and of retaining the latter in strict subordination to the former that the Greeks and Romans the wisest and most passionate lovers of liberty had ever intrusted to their senators the command of armies and had maintained an unconquerable jealousy of all mercenary forces and that such men alone whose interests were involved in those of the public and who possessed a vote in the civil deliberations would sufficiently respect the authority of parliament and never could be tempted to turn the sword against those by whom it was committed to them Whitlocke p one hundred fourteen one hundred fifteen Rush vol vii p six 
8222_274379_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Notwithstanding these reasonings a committee was chosen to frame what was called the self denying ordinance by which the members of both houses were excluded from all civil and military employments except a few offices which were specified

order to satisfy his own party who were impatient for peace he agreed to send the duke of Richmond and earl of Southampton with an answer to the proposals of the parliament and at the same time to desire a treaty upon their mutual demands and pretensions It now became necessary for him to retract his former declaration that the two houses at Westminster were not a free parliament and accordingly he was induced though with great reluctance to give them in his answer the appellation of the parliament of England But it appeared afterwards by a letter which he wrote to the queen and of which a copy was taken at Naseby that he secretly entered an explanatory protest in his council book and he pretended that though he had called them the parliament he had not thereby acknowledged them for such This subtlety which has been frequently objected to Charles is the most noted of those very few instances from which the enemies of this prince have endeavored to load him with the imputation of insincerity and have inferred that the parliament could repose no confidence in his professions and declarations not even in his laws and statutes There is however it must be confessed a

Cabinet opened Rush vol i p nine hundred forty three The time and place of treaty being settled sixteen commissioners from the king met at Uxbridge with twelve authorized by the parliament attended by the Scottish commissioners It was agreed that the Scottish and parliamentary commissioners should give in their demands with regard to three important articles religion the militia and Ireland and that these should be successively discussed in conference with the king s commissioners It was soon found impracticable to come to any agreement with regard to any of these articles In the summer of sixteen forty three while the negotiations were carried on with Scotland the parliament had summoned an assembly at Westminster consisting of one hundred and twenty one divines and thirty laymen celebrated in their party for piety and learning By their advice alterations were made in the thirty nine articles or in the metaphysical doctrines of the church and what was of greater importance the liturgy was entirely abolished and in its stead a new directory for worship was established by which suitably to the spirit of the Puritans the utmost liberty both in praying and preaching was indulged to the public teachers By the solemn league and covenant episcopacy was abjured as destructive of all true piety and a national engagement attended with every circumstance that could render a promise sacred and obligatory was entered into with the Scots never to suffer its readmission All these measures showed little spirit of accommodation in the parliament and the king s commissioners were not surprised to find the establishment of presbytery and the directory positively demanded together with the subscription of the covenant both by the king and kingdom Whitlocke p one hundred twenty one Dugdale p seven hundred fifty eight Such love of contradiction prevailed in the parliament that they had converted Christmas which with the churchmen was a great festival into a solemn fast and humiliation in order as they said that it might call to remembrance our sins and the sins of our forefathers who pretending to celebrate the memory of Christ have turned this feast into an extreme forgetfulness of him by giving liberty to carnal and sensual delights Rush vol vi p eight hundred seventeen It is remarkable that as the parliament abolished all holydays and severely prohibited all amusement on the Sabbath and even burned by the hands of the hangman the king s Book of Sports the nation found that there was no time left for relaxation or diversion Upon application therefore of the servants and apprentices the parliament appointed the second Tuesday of every month for play and recreation Rush vol vii p four hundred sixty Whitlocke p two hundred forty seven But these institutions they found great difficulty to execute and the people were resolved to be merry when they themselves pleased not when the parliament should prescribe it to them The keeping of Christmas holydays was long a great mark of malignancy and very severely censured by the commons Whitlocke p two hundred eighty six Even minced pies which custom had made a Christmas dish among the churchmen was regarded during that season as a profane and superstitious viand by the sectaries though at other times it agreed very well with their stomachs In the parliamentary ordinance too for the observance of the Sabbath they inserted a clause for the taking down of maypoles which they called a heathenish vanity Since we are upon this subject it may not be amiss to mention that besides setting apart Sunday for the ordinances as they called them the godly had regular meetings on the Thursdays for resolving cases of conscience and conferring about their progress in grace What they were chiefly anxious about was the fixing the precise moment of their conversion or new birth and whoever could not ascertain so difficult a point of calculation could not pretend to any title to saintship The profane scholars at Oxford after the parliament became masters of that town gave to the house in which the zealots assembled the denomination of Sernple Shop the zealots in their turn

king s affairs declined in England some events happened in Scotland which seemed to promise him a more prosperous issue of the quarrel Before the commencement of these civil disorders the earl of Montrose a young nobleman of a distinguished family returning from his travels had been introduced to the king and had made an offer of his services but by the insinuations of the marquis afterwards duke of Hamilton who possessed much of Charles s confidence he had not been received with that distinction to which he thought himself justly entitled Nalson Intr p sixty three Disgusted with this treatment he had forwarded all the violence of the Covenanters and agreeably to the natural ardor of his genius he had employed himself during the first Scottish insurrection with great zeal as well as success in levying and conducting their armies Being commissioned by the Tables to wait upon the king while the royal army lay at Berwick he was so gained by the civilities and caresses of that monarch that he thenceforth devoted himself entirely though secretly to his service and entered into a close correspondence with him In the second insurrection a great military command was intrusted to him by the Covenanters and he was the first that passed the Tweed at the head of their troops in the invasion of England He found means however soon after to convey a letter to the king and by the infidelity of some about that prince Hamilton as was suspected a copy of this letter was sent to Leven the Scottish general Being accused of treachery and a correspondence with the enemy Montrose openly avowed the letter and asked the generals if they dared to call their sovereign an enemy and by this bold and magnanimous behavior he escaped the danger of an immediate prosecution As he was now fully known to be of the royal party he no longer concealed his principles and he endeavored to draw those who had entertained like sentiments into a bond of association for his master s service Though thrown into prison for this enterprise and detained some time he was not discouraged but still continued by his countenance and protection to infuse spirit into the distressed royalists Among other persons of distinction who united themselves to him was Lord Napier of Merchiston son of the famous inventor of the logarithms the person to whom the title of a great man is more justly due than to any other whom his country ever produced There was in Scotland another party who professing equal attachment to the king s service pretended only to differ with Montrose about the means of attaining the same end and of that party Duke Hamilton was the leader This nobleman had cause to be extremely devoted to the king not only by reason of the connection of blood which united him to the royal family but on account of the great confidence and favor with which he had ever been honored by his master Being accused by Lord Rae not without some appearance of probability of a conspiracy against the king Charles was so far from harboring suspicion against him that the very first time Hamilton came to court he received him into his bed chamber and passed alone the night with him But such was the duke s unhappy fate or conduct that he escaped not the imputation of treachery to his friend and sovereign and though he at last sacrificed his life in the king s service his integrity and sincerity have not been thought by historians entirely free from blemish Perhaps and this is the more probable opinion the subtleties and refinements of his conduct and his temporizing maxims though accompanied with good intentions have been the chief cause of a suspicion which has never yet been either fully proved or refuted It is not improper to take notice of a mistake committed by Clarendon much to the disadvantage of this gallant nobleman that he offered the king when his majesty was in Scotland to assassinate Argyle All the time the king was in Scotland Montrose was confined in prison Rush vol vi p nine hundred eighty Nalson vol ii p six hundred eighty three As much as the bold and vivid spirit of Montrose prompted him to enterprising measures as much was the cautious temper of Hamilton inclined to such as were moderate and dilatory While the former foretold that the Scottish Covenanters were secretly forming a union with the English parliament and inculcated the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous undertaking the latter still insisted that every such attempt would precipitate them into measures to which otherwise they were not perhaps inclined After the Scottish convention was summoned without the king s authority the former exclaimed that their intentions were now visible and that if some unexpected blow were not struck to dissipate them they would arm the whole nation against the king the latter maintained the possibility of outvoting the disaffected party and securing by peaceful means the allegiance of the kingdom Unhappily for the royal cause Hamilton s representations met with more credit from the king and queen than those of Montrose and the Covenanters were allowed without interruption to proceed in all their hostile measures Montrose then hastened to Oxford where his invectives against Hamilton s treachery concurring with the general prepossession and supported by the unfortunate event of his counsels were entertained with universal probation Influenced by the clamor of his party more than his own suspicions Charles as soon as Hamilton appeared sent him prisoner to Pendennis Castle in Cornwall His brother Laneric who was also put under confinement found means to make his escape and to fly into Scotland The king s ears were now open to Montrose s counsels who proposed none but the boldest and most daring agreeably to the desperate state of the royal cause in Scotland Though the whole nation was subjected by the Covenanters though great armies were kept on foot by them and every place guarded by a vigilant administration he undertook by his own credit and that of the few friends who remained to the king to raise such commotions as would soon oblige the malecontents to recall those forces which had so sensibly thrown the balance in favor of the parliament Not discouraged with the defeat at Marston Moor which rendered it impossible for him to draw any succor from England he was content to stipulate with the earl of Antrim a nobleman of Ireland for some supply of men from that country And he himself changing his disguises and passing through many dangers arrived in Scotland where he lay concealed in the borders of the Highlands and secretly prepared the minds of his partisans for attempting some great enterprise Clarendon vol iii p three hundred eighty three hundred

landed though not exceeding eleven hundred foot very ill armed than Montrose declared himself and entered upon that scene of action which has rendered his name so celebrated About eight hundred of the men of Athole flocked to his standard Five hundred men more who had been levied by the Covenanters were persuaded to embrace the royal cause and with this combined force he hastened to attack Lord Elcho who lay at Perth with an army of six thousand men assembled upon the first news of the Irish invasion Montrose inferior in number totally unprovided with horse ill supplied with arms and ammunition had nothing to depend on but the courage which he himself by his own example and the rapidity of his enterprises should inspire into his raw soldiers Having received the fire of the enemy which was answered chiefly by a volley of stones he rushed amidst them with his sword drawn threw them into confusion pushed his advantage and obtained a complete victory with the slaughter of two thousand of the Covenanters This victory though it augmented the renown of Montrose increased not his power or numbers The far greater part of the kingdom was extremely attached to the covenant and such as bore an affection to the royal cause were terrified by the established authority of the opposite party Dreading the superior power of Argyle who having joined his vassals to a force levied by the public was approaching with a considerable army Montrose hastened northwards in order to rouse again the marquis of Huntley and the Gordons who having before hastily taken arms had been instantly suppressed by the Covenanters He was joined on his march by the earl of Airly with his two younger sons Sir Thomas and Sir David Ogilvy the eldest was at that time a prisoner with the enemy He attacked at Aberdeen the Lord Burley who commanded a force of two thousand five hundred men After a sharp combat by his undaunted courage which in his situation was true policy and was also not unaccompanied with military skill he put the enemy to flight and in the pursuit did great execution upon them first of September sixteen forty four Rush vol vi p nine hundred eighty three Wishart cap

Huntley jealous of Montrose s glory rendered him averse to join an army where he himself must be so much eclipsed by the superior merit of the general Argyle reenforced by the earl of Lothian was behind him with a great army the militia of the northern counties Murray Ross Caithness to the number of five thousand men opposed him in front and guarded the banks of the Spey a deep and rapid river In order to elude these numerous armies he turned aside into the hills and saved his weak but active troops in Badenoch After some marches and countermarches Argyle came up with him at Faivy Castle This nobleman s character though celebrated for political courage and conduct was very low for military prowess and after some skirmishes in which he was worsted he here allowed Montrose to escape him By quick marches through these inaccessible mountains that general freed himself from the superior forces of the Covenanters Such was the situation of Montrose that very good or very ill fortune was equally destructive to him and diminished his army After every victory his soldiers greedy of spoil but deeming the smallest acquisition to be unexhausted riches deserted in great numbers and went home to secure the treasures which they had acquired Tired too and spent with hasty and long marches in the depth of winter through snowy mountains unprovided with every necessary they fell off and left their general almost alone with the Irish who having no place to which they could retire still adhered to him in every fortune With these and some reenforcements of the Atholemen and Macdonalds whom he had recalled Montrose fell suddenly upon Argyle s country and let loose upon it all the rage of war carrying off the cattle burning the houses and putting the inhabitants to the sword This severity by which Montrose sullied his victories was the result of private animosity against the chieftain as much as of zeal for the public cause Argyle collecting three thousand men marched in quest of the enemy who had retired with their plunder and he lay at Innerlochy supposing himself still at a considerable distance from them The earl of Seaforth at the head of the garrison of Inverness who were veteran soldiers joined to five thousand new levied troops of the northern counties pressed the royalists on the other side and threatened them with inevitable destruction By a quick and unexpected march Montrose hastened to Innerlochy and presented himself in order of battle before the surprised but not affrightened Covenanters Argyle alone seized with a panic deserted his army who still maintained their ground and gave battle to the royalists After a vigorous resistance they were defeated and pursued with great slaughter And the power of the Campbells that is Argyle s name being thus broken the Highlanders who were in general well affected to the royal cause began to join Montrose s camp in great numbers Seaforth s army dispersed of itself at the very terror of his name And Lord Gordon eldest son of Huntley having escaped from his uncle Argyle who had hitherto detained him now joined Montrose with no contemptible number of his followers attended by his brother the earl of Aboine The council at Edinburgh alarmed at Montrose s progress began to think of a more regular plan of defence against an enemy whose repeated victories had rendered him extremely formidable They sent for Baillie an officer of reputation from England and joining him in command with Urrey who had again enlisted himself among the king s enemies they sent them to the field with a considerable army against the royalists Montrose with a detachment of eight hundred men had attacked Dundee a town extremely zealous for the covenant and having carried it by assault had delivered it up to be plundered by his soldiers when Baillie and Urrey with their whole force were unexpectedly upon him His conduct and presence of mind in this emergence appeared conspicuous Instantly he called off his soldiers from plunder put them in order secured his retreat by the most skilful measures and having marched sixty miles in the face of an enemy much superior without stopping or allowing his soldiers the least sleep or refreshment he at last secured himself in the mountains Rush vol vi p nine hundred eighty five Wishart cap eight Rush vol vii p two hundred twenty eight Wishart cap nine Baillie and Urrey now divided their troops in order the better to conduct the war against an enemy who surprised them as much by the rapidity of his marches as by the boldness of his enterprises Urrey at the head of four thousand men met him at Alderne near Inverness and encouraged by the superiority of number for the Covenanters were double the royalists attacked him in the post which he had chosen Montrose having placed his right wing in strong ground drew the best of his forces to the other and left no main body between them a defect which he artfully concealed by showing a few men through the trees and bushes with which that ground was covered That Urrey might have no leisure to perceive the stratagem he instantly led his left wing to the charge and making a furious impression upon the Covenanters drove them off the field and gained a complete victory In this battle the valor of young Napier son to the lord of that name shone out with signal lustre Baillie now advanced in order to revenge Urrey s discomfiture but at Alford he met himself with a like fate Montrose weak in cavalry here lined his troops of horse with infantry and after putting the enemy s horse to rout fell with united force upon their foot who were entirely cut in pieces though with the loss of the gallant Lord Gordon on the part of the royalists And having thus prevailed in so many battles which his vigor ever rendered as decisive as they were successful he summoned together all his friends and partisans and prepared himself for marching into the southern provinces in order to put a final period to the power of the Covenanters and dissipate the parliament which with great pomp and solemnity they had summoned to meet at saint Johnstone s While the fire was thus kindled in the north of the island it blazed out with no less fury in the south the parliamentary and royal armies as soon as the season would permit prepared to take the field in hopes of bringing their important quarrel to a quick decision The passing of the self denying ordinance had been protracted by so many debates and intrigues that the spring was far advanced before it received the sanction of both houses and it was thought dangerous by many to introduce so near the time of action such great innovations into the army Had not the punctilious principles of Essex engaged him amidst all the disgusts which he received to pay implicit obedience to the parliament this alteration had not been effected without some fatal accident since notwithstanding his prompt resignation of the command a mutiny was

Fairfax or more properly speaking Cromwell under his name introduced at last the new model into the army and threw the troops into a different shape From the same men new regiments and new companies were formed different officers appointed and the whole military force put into such hands as the Independents could rely on Besides members of parliament who were excluded many officers unwilling to serve under the new generals threw up their commissions and unwarily facilitated the project of putting the army entirely into the hands of that faction Though the discipline of the former parliamentary army was not contemptible a more exact plan was introduced and rigorously executed by these new commanders Valor indeed was very generally diffused over the one party as well as the other during this period discipline also was attained by the forces of the parliament but the perfection of the military art in concerting the general plans of action and the operations of the field seems still on both sides to have been in a great measure wanting Historians at least perhaps from their own ignorance and inexperience have not remarked any thing but a headlong impetuous conduct each party hurrying to a battle where valor and fortune chiefly determined the success The great ornament of history during these reigns are the civil not the military transactions Never surely was a more singular army assembled than that which was now set on foot by the parliament To the greater number of the regiments chaplains were not appointed the officers assumed the spiritual duty and united it with their military functions During the intervals of action they occupied themselves in sermons prayers exhortations and the same emulation there attended them which in the field is so necessary to support the honor of that profession Rapturous ecstasies supplied the place of study and reflection and while the zealous devotees poured out their thoughts in unpremeditated harangues they mistook that eloquence which to their own surprise as well as that of others flowed in upon them for divine illuminations and for illapses of the Holy Spirit Wherever they were quartered they excluded the minister from his pulpit and usurping his place conveyed their sentiments to the audience with all the authority which followed their power their valor and their military exploits united to their appearing zeal and fervor The private soldiers seized with the same spirit employed their vacant hours in prayer in perusing the Holy Scriptures in ghostly conferences where they compared the progress of their in grace and mutually stimulated each other to further advances in the great work of their salvation When they were marching to battle the whole field resounded as well with psalms and spiritual songs adapted to the occasion as with the instruments of military music and every man endeavored to drown the sense of present danger in the prospect of that crown of glory which was set before him In so holy a cause wounds were esteemed meritorious death martyrdom and the hurry and dangers of action instead of banishing their pious visions rather served to impress their minds more strongly with them The royalists were desirous of throwing a ridicule on this fanaticism of the parliamentary armies without being sensible how much reason they had to apprehend its dangerous consequences The forces assembled by the king at Oxford in the west and in other places were equal if not superior in number to their adversaries but actuated by a very different spirit That license which had been introduced by want of pay had risen to a great height among them and rendered them more formidable to their friends than to their enemies Prince Rupert negligent of the people fond of the soldiery had indulged the troops in unwarrantable liberties Wilmot a man of dissolute manners had promoted the same spirit of disorder and the licentious Goring Gerrard Sir Richard Granville now carried it to a great pitch of enormity In the west especially where Goring commanded universal spoil and havoc were committed and the whole country was laid waste by the rapine of the army All distinction of parties being in a manner dropped the most devoted friends of the church and monarchy wished there for such success to the parliamentary forces as might put an end to these oppressions The country people despoiled of their substance flocked together in several places armed with clubs and staves and though they professed an enmity to the soldiers of both parties their hatred was in most places levelled chiefly against the royalists from whom they had met with the worst treatment Many thousands of these tumultuary peasants were assembled in different parts of England who destroyed all such straggling soldiers as they met with and much infested the armies Dugdale p seven Rush vol vi p two hundred eighty one Rush vol vii p fifty two sixty one sixty two Whitlocke p one

Scottish army was employed in taking Pomfret and other towns in Yorkshire part of it besieged Carlisle valiantly defended by Sir Thomas Glenham Chester where Biron commanded had long been blockaded by Sir William Brereton and was reduced to great difficulties The king being joined by the princes Rupert and Maurice lay at Oxford with a considerable army about fifteen thousand men Fairfax and Cromwell were posted at Windsor with the new modelled army about twenty two thousand men Taunton in the county of Somerset defended by Blake suffered a long siege from Sir Richard Granville who commanded an army of about eight thousand men and though the defence had been obstinate the garrison was now reduced to the last extremity Goring commanded in the west an army of nearly the same number On opening the campaign the king formed the project of relieving Chester Fairfax that of relieving Taunton The king was first in motion When he advanced to Draiton in Shropshire Biron met him and brought intelligence that his approach had raised the siege and that the parliamentary army had withdrawn Fairfax having reached Salisbury in his road westward received orders from the committee of both kingdoms appointed for the management of the war to return and lay siege to Oxford now exposed by the king s absence He obeyed after sending Colonel Weldon to the west with a detachment of four thousand men On Weldon s approach Granville who imagined that Fairfax with his whole army was upon him raised the siege and allowed this pertinacious town now half taken and half burned to receive relief but the royalists being reenforced with three thousand horse under Goring again advanced to Taunton and shut up Weldon with his small army in that ruinous place The king having effected his purpose with regard to Chester returned southwards and in his way sat down before Leicester a garrison of the parliaments Having made a breach in the wall he stormed the town on all sides and after a furious assault the soldiers entered sword in hand and committed all those disorders to which their natural violence especially when inflamed by resistance is so much addicted Rush vol vii p

This success which struck a great terror into the parliamentary army determined Fairfax to leave Oxford which he was beginning to approach and he marched towards the king with an intention of offering him battle The king was advancing towards Oxford in order to raise the siege which he apprehended was now begun and both armies ere they were aware had advanced within six miles of each other A council of war was called by the king in order to deliberate concerning the measures which he should now pursue On the one hand it seemed more prudent to delay the combat because Gerrard who lay in Wales with three thousand men might be enabled in a little time to join the army and Goring it was hoped would soon be master of Taunton and having put the west in full security would then unite his forces to those of the king and give him an incontestable superiority over the enemy On the other hand Prince Rupert whose boiling ardor still pushed him on to battle excited the impatient humor of the nobility and gentry of which the army was full and urged the many difficulties under which the royalists labored and from which nothing but a victory could relieve them the resolution was taken to give battle to Fairfax and the royal army immediately advanced upon him At Naseby was fought with forces nearly equal this decisive and well disputed action between the king and parliament The main body of the royalists was commanded by the king himself the right wing by Prince Rupert the left by Sir Marmaduke Langdale Fairfax seconded by Skippon placed himself in the main body of the opposite army Cromwell in the right wing Ireton Cromwell s son in law in the left The charge was begun with his usual celerity and usual success by Prince Rupert Though Ireton made stout resistance and even after he was run through the thigh with a pike still maintained the combat till he was taken prisoner yet was that whole wing broken and pursued with precipitate fury by Rupert he was even so inconsiderate as to lose time in summoning and attacking the artillery of the enemy which had been left with a good guard of infantry The king led on his main body and displayed in this action all the conduct of a prudent general and all the valor of a stout soldier Whitlocke p one hundred forty six Fairfax and Skippon encountered him and well supported that reputation which they had acquired

broken and pressed upon by the king till Fairfax with great presence of mind brought up the reserve and renewed the combat Meanwhile Cromwell having led on his troops to the attack of Langdale overbore the force of the royalists and by his prudence improved that advantage which he had gained by his valor Having pursued the enemy about a quarter of a mile and detached some troops to prevent their rallying he turned back upon the king s infantry and threw them into the utmost confusion One regiment alone preserved its order unbroken though twice desperately assailed by Fairfax and that general excited by so steady a resistance ordered Doyley the captain of his life guard to give them a third charge in front while he himself attacked them in the rear The regiment was broken Fairfax with his own hands killed an ensign and having seized the colors gave them to a soldier to keep for him The soldier afterwards boasting that he had won this trophy was reproved by Doyley who had seen the action Let him retain that honor said Fairfax I have to day acquired enough beside Prince Rupert sensible too late of his error left the fruitless attack on the enemy s artillery and joined the king whose infantry was now totally discomfited Charles exhorted this body of cavalry not to despair and cried aloud to them One charge more and we recover the day But the disadvantages under which they labored were too evident and they could by no means be induced to renew the combat Charles was obliged to quit the field and leave the victory to the enemy Rush vol vii p forty three Whitlocke p

The slain on the side of the parliament exceeded those on the side of the king they lost a thousand men he not above eight hundred But Fairfax made five hundred officers prisoners and four thousand private men took all the king s artillery and ammunition and totally dissipated his infantry so that scarce any victory could be more complete than that which he obtained Among the other spoils was seized the king s cabinet with the copies of his letters to the queen which the parliament afterwards ordered to be published They chose no doubt such of them as they thought would reflect dishonor on him yet upon the whole the letters are written with delicacy and tenderness and give an advantageous idea both of the king s genius and morals A mighty fondness it is true and attachment he expresses to his consort and often professes that he never would embrace any measures which she disapproved but such declarations of civility and confidence are not always to be taken in a full literal sense And so legitimate an affection avowed by the laws of God and man may perhaps be excusable towards a woman of beauty and spirit even though she was a Papist Clarendon vol iv p six hundred fifty eight Hearne has published the following extract from a manuscript work of Sir Simon D Ewes who was no mean man in the parliamentary party On Thursday the thirtieth and last day of this instant June sixteen twenty five I went to Whitehall purposely to see the queen which I did fully all the time she sat at dinner I perceived her to be a most absolute delicate lady after I had exactly surveyed all the features of her face much enlivened by her radiant and sparkling black eyes Besides her deportment among her women was so sweet and humble and her speech and looks to her other servants so mild and gracious as I could not abstain from divers deep fetched sighs to consider that she wanted the knowledge of the true religion See Preface to the Chronicle of Dunstable p sixty four The Athenians having intercepted a letter written by their enemy Philip of Macedon to his wife Olympia so far from being moved by a curiosity of prying into the secrets of that relation immediately sent the letter to the queen unopened Philip was not their sovereign nor were they inflamed with that violent animosity against him which attends all civil commotions After the battle the king retreated with that body of horse which remained entire first to Hereford then to Abergavenny and remained some time in Wales from the vain hope of raising a body of infantry in those harassed and exhausted quarters Fairfax having first retaken Leicester which was surrendered upon articles began to deliberate concerning his future enterprises A letter was brought him written by Goring to the king and unfortunately intrusted to a spy of Fairfax s Goring there informed the king that in three weeks he hoped to be master of Taunton after which he would join his majesty with all the forces in the west and entreated him in the mean while to avoid coming to any general action This letter which had it been safely delivered had probably prevented the battle of Naseby served now to direct the operations of Fairfax After leaving a body of three thousand men to Pointz and Rossiter with orders to attend the king s motions he marched immediately to the west with a view of saving Taunton and suppressing the only considerable force which now remained to the royalists In the beginning of the campaign Charles apprehensive of the event had sent the prince of Wales then fifteen years of age to the west with the title of General and had given orders if he were pressed by the enemy that he should make his escape into a foreign country and save one part of the royal family from the violence of the parliament Prince Rupert had thrown himself into Bristol with an intention of defending that important city Goring commanded the army before Taunton On Fairfax s approach the siege of Taunton was raised and the royalists retired to Lamport an open town in the county of Somerset Fairfax attacked them in that post beat them from it killed about three hundred men and took one thousand four hundred prisoners After this advantage he sat down before Bridgewater a town esteemed strong and of great consequence in that country When he had entered the outer town by storm Windham the Governor who had retired into the inner immediately capitulated and delivered up the place to Fairfax The garrison to the number of two thousand six hundred men were made prisoners of war Fairfax having next taken Bath and Sherborne resolved to lay siege to Bristol and made great preparations for an enterprise which from the strength of the garrison and the reputation of Prince Rupert the governor was deemed of the last importance But so precarious in most men is this quality of military courage a poorer defence was not made by any town during the whole war and the general expectations were here extremely disappointed No sooner had the parliamentary forces entered the lines by storm than the prince capitulated and surrendered the city to Fairfax A few days before he had written a letter to the king in which he undertook to defend the place for four months if no mutiny obliged him to surrender it Rush vol vii p forty nine Rush vol vii p fifty five Rush vol vii p eighty three Charles who was forming schemes and collecting forces for the relief of Bristol was astonished at so unexpected an event which was little less fatal to his cause than the defeat at Naseby Full of indignation he instantly recalled all Prince Rupert s commissions and sent him a pass to go beyond sea The king s affairs now went fast to ruin in all quarters The Scots having made themselves masters of Carlisle after an obstinate siege marched southwards and laid siege to Hereford but were obliged to raise it on the king s approach and this was the last glimpse of success which attended his arms Having marched to the relief of Chester which was anew besieged by the parliamentary forces under Colonel Jones Pointz attacked his rear and forced him to give battle While the fight was continued with great obstinacy and victory seemed to incline to the royalists Jones fell upon them from the other side and put them to rout with the loss of six hundred slain and one thousand prisoners The king with the remains of his broken army fled to Newark and thence escaped to Oxford where he shut himself up during the winter season Clarendon vol vi p six hundred ninety Walker p one hundred thirty seven Clarendon vol iv p six hundred ninety five Rush vii p one hundred seventeen The news which he received from every quarter were no less fatal than those events which passed where he himself was present Fairfax and Cromwell after the surrender of Bristol having divided their forces the former marched westwards in order to complete the conquest of Devonshire and Cornwall the latter attacked the king s garrisons which lay to the east of Bristol The Devizes were surrendered to Cromwell Berkeley Castle was taken by storm Winchester capitulated Basing House was entered sword in hand and all these middle counties of England were in a little time reduced to obedience under the parliament The same rapid and uninterrupted success attended Fairfax The parliamentary forces elated by past victories governed by the most rigid discipline met with no equal opposition from troops dismayed by repeated defeats and corrupted by licentious manners After beating up the quarters of the royalists at Bovey Tracy Fairfax sat down before Dartmouth and in a few days entered it by storm Poudram Castle being taken by him and Exeter blockaded on all sides Hopton a man of merit who now commanded the royalists having advanced to the relief of that town with an army of eight thousand men met with the parliamentary army at Torrington where he was defeated all his foot dispersed and he himself with his horse obliged to retire into Cornwall Fairfax followed him and vigorously pursued the victory Having enclosed the royalists at Truro he forced the whole army consisting of five thousand men chiefly cavalry to surrender upon terms The soldiers delivering up their horses and arms were allowed to disband and received twenty shillings apiece to carry them to their respective abodes Such of the officers as desired it had passes to retire beyond sea the others having promised never more to bear arms paid compositions to the parliament and procured their pardon And thus Fairfax after taking Exeter which completed the conquest of the west marched with his victorious army to the centre of the kingdom and fixed his camp at Newbury The prince of Wales in pursuance of the king s orders retired to Scilly thence to Jersey whence he went to Paris where he joined the queen who had fled thither from Exeter at the time the earl of Essex conducted the parliamentary army to the west In the other parts of England Hereford was taken by surprise Chester surrendered Lord Digby who had attempted with one thousand two hundred horse to break into Scotland and join Montrose was defeated at Sherburne in Yorkshire by Colonel Copley his whole force was dispersed and he himself was obliged to fly first to the Isle of Man thence to Ireland News too arrived that Montrose himself after some more successes was at last routed and this only remaining hope of the royal party finally extinguished When Montrose descended into the southern counties the Covenanters assembling their whole force met him with a numerous army and gave him battle but without success at Kilsyth This was the most complete victory that Montrose ever obtained These compositions were different according to the demerits of the person but by a vote of the house they could not be under two years rent of the delinquent s estate Journ eleventh of August sixteen forty eight Whitlocke p one hundred sixty Rush vol vii p one hundred eight fifteenth August sixteen forty five The royalists put to sword six thousand of their enemies and left the Covenanters no remains of any army in Scotland The whole kingdom was shaken with these repeated successes of Montrose and many noblemen who secretly favored the royal cause now declared openly for it when they saw a force able to support them The marquis of Douglas the earls of Annandale and Hartfield the lords Fleming Seton Maderty Carnegy with many others flocked to the royal standard Edinburgh opened its gates and gave liberty to all the prisoners there detained by the Covenanters Among the rest was Lord Ogilvy son of Airly whose family had contributed extremely to the victory gained at Kilsyth David Lesly was detached from the army in England and marched to the relief of his distressed party in Scotland Montrose advanced still farther to the south allured by vain hopes both of rousing to arms the earls of Hume Traquaire and Roxborough who had promised to join him and of obtaining from England some supply of cavalry in which he was deficient By the negligence of his scouts Lesly at Philipbaugh in the Forest surprised his army much diminished in numbers from the desertion of the Highlanders who had retired to the hills according to custom in order to secure their plunder After a sharp conflict where Montrose exerted great valor his forces were routed by Lesly s cavalry and he himself was obliged to fly with his broken forces into the mountains where he again prepared himself for new battles and new enterprises The Covenanters used the victory with rigor Their prisoners Sir Robert Spotiswood secretary of state and son to the late primate Sir Philip Nisbet Sir William Hollo Colonel Nathaniel Gordon Andrew Guthry son of the bishop of Murray William Murray son of the earl of Tullibardine were condemned and executed The sole crime imputed to the secretary was his delivering to Montrose the king s commission to be captain general of Scotland Lord Ogilvy who was again taken prisoner would have undergone the same fate had not his sister found means to procure his escape by changing clothes with him For this instance of courage and dexterity she met with harsh usage The clergy solicited the parliament that more royalists might be executed but could not obtain their request Rush vol vii p two hundred thirty two hundred thirty one Wishart cap thirteen thirteenth Sept sixteen forty five Rush vol vii p two hundred thirty one Guthry s Memoirs Rush vol vii p two hundred thirty two After all these repeated disasters which every where befell the royal party there remained only one body of troops on which fortune could exercise her rigor Lord Astley with a small army of three thousand men chiefly cavalry marching to Oxford in order to join the king was met at Stowe by Colonel Morgan and entirely defeated himself being taken prisoner You have done your work said Astley to the parliamentary officers and may now go to play unless you choose to fall out among yourselves The condition of the king during this whole winter was to the last degree disastrous and melancholy As the dread of ills is commonly more oppressive than their real presence perhaps in no period of his life was he more justly the object of compassion His vigor of mind which though it sometimes failed him in acting never deserted him in his sufferings was what alone supported him and he was determined as he wrote to Lord Digby if he could not live as a king to die like a gentleman nor should any of his friends he said ever have reason to blush for the prince whom they had so unfortunately served The murmurs of discontented officers on the one hand harassed their unhappy sovereign while they overrated those services and sufferings which they now saw must forever go unrewarded The affectionate duty on the other hand of his more generous friends who respected his misfortunes and his virtues as much as his dignity wrung his heart with a new sorrow when he reflected that such disinterested attachment would so soon be exposed to the rigor of his implacable enemies Repeated attempts which he made for a peaceful and equitable accommodation with the parliament served to no purpose but to convince them that the victory was entirely in their hands They deigned not to make the least reply to several of his messages in which he desired a passport for commissioners Rush vol vii p one hundred forty one It was the same Astley who before he charged at the battle of Edgehill made this short prayer O Lord thou knowest how busy I must be

with the blood spilt during the war they told him that they were preparing bills for him and his passing them would be the best pledge of his inclination towards peace in other words he must yield at discretion He desired a personal treaty and offered to come to London upon receiving a safe conduct for himself and his attendants they absolutely refused him admittance and issued orders for the guarding that is the seizing of his person in case he should attempt to visit them Rush vol vii p two hundred seventeen two hundred nineteen Clarendon vol iv p seven hundred forty one Rush vol vii p two hundred forty nine Clarendon vol iv p seven hundred forty one A new incident which happened in Ireland served to inflame the minds of men and to increase those calumnies with which his enemies had so much loaded him and which he ever regarded as the most grievous part of his misfortunes After the cessation with the Irish rebels the king was desirous of concluding a final peace with them and obtaining their assistance in England and he gave authority to Ormond lord lieutenant to promise them an abrogation of all the penal laws enacted against Catholics together with the suspension of Poinings s statute with regard to some particular bills which should be agreed on Lord Herbert created earl of Glamorgan though his patent had not yet passed the seals having occasion for his private affairs to go to Ireland the king considered that this nobleman being a Catholic and allied to the best Irish families might be of service he also foresaw that further concessions with regard to religion might probably be demanded by the bigoted Irish and that as these concessions however necessary would give great scandal to the Protestant zealots in his three kingdoms if would be requisite both to conceal them during some time and to preserve Ormond s character by giving private orders to Glamorgan to conclude and sign these articles But as he had a better opinion of Glamorgan s zeal and affection for his service than of his capacity he enjoined him to communicate all his measures to Ormond and though the final conclusion of the treaty must be executed only in Glamorgan s own name he was required to be directed in the steps towards it by the opinion of the lord lieutenant Glamorgan bigoted to his religion and passionate for the king s service but guided in these pursuits by no manner of judgment or discretion secretly of himself without any communication with Ormond concluded a peace with the council of Kilkenny and agreed in the king s name that the Irish should enjoy all the churches of which they had ever been in possession since the commencement of their insurrection on condition that they should assist the king in England with a body of ten thousand men This transaction was discovered by accident The titular archbishop of Tuam being killed by a sally of the garrison of Sligo the articles of the treaty were found among his baggage and were immediately published every where and copies of them sent over to the English parliament The lord lieutenant and Lord Digby foreseeing the clamor which would be raised against the king committed Glamorgan to prison charged him with treason for his temerity and maintained that he had acted altogether without any authority from his master The English parliament however neglected not so favorable an opportunity of reviving the old clamor with regard to the king s favor of Popery and accused him of delivering over in a manner the whole kingdom of Ireland to that hated sect The king told them that the earl of Glamorgan having made an offer to raise forces in the kingdom of Ireland and to conduct them into England for his majesty s service had a commission to that purpose and to that purpose only and that he had no commission at all to treat of any thing else without the privity and direction of the lord lieutenant much less to capitulate any thing concerning religion or any property belonging either to church or laity Though this declaration seems agreeable to truth it gave no satisfaction to the parliament and some historians even at present when the ancient bigotry is somewhat abated are desirous of representing this very innocent transaction in which the king was engaged by the most violent necessity as a stain on the memory of that unfortunate prince sixteen Rush vol vii p two hundred thirty nine Birch p one hundred nineteen See note P at the end of the volume Having lost all hope of prevailing over the rigor of the parliament either by arms or by treaty the only resource which remained to the king was derived from the intestine dissensions which ran very high among his enemies Presbyterians and Independents even before their victory was fully completed fell into contests about the division of the spoil and their religious as well as civil disputes agitated the whole kingdom The parliament though they had early abolished Episcopal authority had not during so long a time substituted any other spiritual government in its place and their committees of religion had hitherto assumed the whole ecclesiastical jurisdiction but they now established by an ordinance the Presbyterian model in all its forms of congregational classical provincial and national assemblies All the inhabitants of each parish were ordered to meet and choose elders on whom together with the minister was bestowed the entire direction of all spiritual concerns within the congregation A number of neighboring parishes commonly between twelve and twenty formed a classis and the court which governed this division was composed of all the ministers together with two three or four elders chosen from each parish The provincial assembly retained an inspection over several neighboring classes and was composed entirely of clergymen the national assembly was constituted in the same manner and its authority extended over the whole kingdom It is probable that the tyranny exercised by the Scottish clergy had given warning not to allow laymen a place in the provincial or national assemblies lest the nobility and more considerable gentry soliciting a seat in these great ecclesiastical courts should bestow a consideration upon them and render them in the eyes of the multitude a rival to the parliament In the inferior courts the mixture of the laity might serve rather to temper the usual zeal of the clergy But though the Presbyterians by the establishment of parity among the ecclesiastics were so far gratified they were denied satisfaction in several other points on which they were extremely intent The assembly of divines had voted Presbytery to be of divine right the parliament refused their assent to that decision Selden Whitlocke and other political reasoners assisted by the Independents had prevailed in this important deliberation They thought that had the bigoted religionists been able to get their heavenly charter recognized the presbyters would soon become more dangerous to the magistrate than had ever been the prelatical clergy These latter white they claimed to themselves a divine right admitted of a like origin to civil authority the former challenging to their own order a celestial pedigree derived the legislative power from a source no more dignified than the voluntary association of the people Rush vol vii p two hundred twenty four Whitlocke p one hundred six Rush vol vii p two hundred sixty two hundred sixty one Under color of keeping the sacraments from profanation the clergy of all Christian sects had assumed what they call the power of the keys or the right of fulminating excommunication The example of Scotland was a sufficient lesson for the parliament to use precaution in guarding against so severe a tyranny They determined by a general ordinance all the cases in which excommunication could be used They allowed of appeals to parliament from all ecclesiastical courts And they appointed commissioners in every province to judge of such cases as fell not within their general ordinance So much civil authority intermixed with the ecclesiastical gave disgust to all the zealots But nothing was attended with more universal scandal than the propensity of many in the parliament towards a toleration of the Protestant sectaries The Presbyterians exclaimed that this indulgence made the church of Christ resemble Noah s ark and rendered it a receptacle for all unclean beasts They insisted that the least of Christ s truths was superior to all political considerations They maintained the eternal obligation imposed by the covenant to extirpate heresy and schism And they menaced all their opponents with the same rigid persecution under which they themselves had groaned when held in subjection by the hierarchy Rush vol vii p two hundred ten Rush vol vii p three hundred eight So great prudence and reserve in such material points does great honor to the parliament and proves that notwithstanding the prevalency of bigotry and fanaticism there were many members who had more enlarged views and paid regard to the civil interests of society These men uniting themselves to the enthusiasts whose genius is naturally averse to clerical usurpations exercised so jealous an authority over the assembly of divines that they allowed them nothing but the liberty of tendering advice and would not intrust them even with the power of electing their own chairman or his substitute or of supplying the vacancies of their own members While these disputes were canvassed by theologians who engaged in their spiritual contests every order of the state the king though he entertained hopes of reaping advantage from those divisions was much at a loss which side it would be most for his interest to comply with The Presbyterians were by their principles the least averse to regal authority but were rigidly bent on the extirpation of prelacy the Independents were resolute to lay the foundation of a republican government but as they pretended not to erect themselves into a national church it might be hoped that if gratified with am toleration they would admit the reestablishment of the hierarchy So great attachment had the king to episcopal jurisdiction that he was ever inclined to put it in balance even with his own power and kingly office But whatever advantage he might hope to reap from the divisions in the parliamentary party he was apprehensive lest it should come too late to save him from the destruction with which he was instantly threatened Fairfax was approaching with a powerful and victorious army and was taking the proper measures for laying siege to Oxford which must infallibly fall into his hands To be taken captive and led in triumph by his insolent enemies was what Charles justly abhorred and every insult if not violence was to be dreaded from that enthusiastic soldiery who hated his person and despised his dignity In this desperate extremity he embraced a measure which in any other situation might lie under the imputation of imprudence and indiscretion Montreville the French minister interested for the king more by the natural sentiments of humanity than any instructions from his court which seemed rather to favor the parliament had solicited the Scottish generals and commissioners to give protection to their distressed sovereign and having received many general professions and promises he had always transmitted these perhaps with some exaggeration to the king From his suggestions Charles began to entertain thoughts of leaving Oxford and flying to the Scottish army which at that time lay before Newark He considered that the Scottish nation had been fully gratified in all their demands and having already in their own country annihilated both episcopacy and regal authority had no further concessions to exact from him In all disputes which had passed about settling the terms of peace the Scots he heard had still adhered to the milder side and had endeavored to soften the rigor of the English parliament Great disgusts also on other accounts had taken place between the nations and the Scots found that in proportion as their assistance became less necessary less value was put upon them The progress of the Independents gave them great alarm and they were scandalized to hear their beloved covenant spoken of every day with less regard and reverence The refusal of a divine right to presbytery and the infringing of ecclesiastical discipline from political considerations were to them the subject of much offence and the king hoped that in their present disposition the plight of their native prince flying to them in this extremity of distress would rouse every spark of generosity in their bosom and procure him their favor and protection Clarendon vol iv p seven hundred fifty vol v p sixteen That he might the better conceal his intentions orders were given at every gate in Oxford for allowing three persons to pass and in the night the king accompanied by none but doctor Hudson and mister Ashburnham went out at that gate which leads to London He rode before a portmanteau and called himself Ashburnham s servant He passed through Henley saint Albans and came so near to London as Harrow on the Hill He once entertained thoughts of entering into that city and of throwing himself on the mercy of the parliament But at last after passing through many cross roads he arrived at the Scottish camp before Newark The parliament hearing of his escape from Oxford issued rigorous orders and threatened with instant death whoever should harbor or conceal him The Scottish generals and commissioners affected great surprise on the appearance of the king and though they paid him all the exterior respect due to his dignity they instantly set a guard upon him under color of protection and made him in reality a prisoner They informed the English parliament of this unexpected incident and assured them that they had entered into no private treaty with the king They applied to him for orders to Bellasis governor of Newark to surrender that town now reduced to extremity and the orders were instantly obeyed And hearing that the parliament laid claim to the entire disposal of the king s person and that the English army was making some motion towards them they thought proper to retire northwards and to fix their camp at Newcastle Rush vol vii p two hundred sixty seven Whitlocke p two hundred eight Rush vol vii p two hundred seventy one Clarendon vol v p twenty three This measure was very grateful to the king and he began to entertain hopes of protection from the Scots He was particularly attentive to the behavior of their preachers on whom all depended It was the mode of that age to make the pulpit the scene of news and on every great event the whole Scripture was ransacked by the clergy for passages applicable to the present occasion The first minister who preached before the king chose these words for his text And behold all the men of Israel came to the king and said unto him Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away and have brought the king and his household and all David s men with him over Jordan And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel Because the king is near of kin to us wherefore then be ye angry for this matter Have we eaten at all of the king s cost or hath he given us any gift And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said We have ten parts in the king and we have also more right in David than ye why then did ye despise us that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel But the king soon found that the happiness chiefly of the allusion had tempted the preacher to employ this text and that the covenanting zealots were nowise pacified towards him Another preacher after reproaching him to his face with his misgovernment ordered this psalm to be sung Why dost thou tyrant boast thyself Thy wicked deeds to praise The king stood up and called for that psalm which begins with these words Have mercy Lord on me I pray For men would me devour The good natured audience in pity to fallen majesty showed for once greater deference to the king than to the minister and sung the psalm which the former had called for Charles had very little reason to be pleased with his situation He not only found himself a prisoner very strictly guarded all his friends were kept at a distance and no intercourse either by letters or conversation was allowed him with any one on whom he could depend or who was suspected of any attachment towards him The Scottish generals would enter into no confidence with him and still treated him with distant ceremony and feigned respect And every proposal which they made him tended further to his abasement and to his ruin two Sam chap xix ver four hundred fourteen thousand two hundred forty three See Clarendon vol v p twenty three twenty four Whitlocke p two hundred thirty four Clarendon vol v p thirty They required him to issue orders to Oxford and to all his other garrisons commanding their surrender to the parliament and the king sensible that their resistance was to very little purpose willingly complied The terms given to most of them were honorable and Fairfax as far as it lay in his power was very exact in observing them Far from allowing violence he would not even permit insults or triumph over the unfortunate royalists and by his generous humanity so cruel a civil war was ended in appearance very calmly between the parties Ormond having received like orders delivered Dublin and other forts into the hands of the parliamentary officers Montrose also after having experienced still more variety of good and bad fortune threw down his arms and retired out of the kingdom The marquis of Worcester a man past eighty four was the last in England that submitted to the authority of the parliament He defended Raglan Castle to extremity and opened not its gates till the middle of August Four years a few days excepted were now elapsed since the king first erected his standard at Nottingham so long had the British nations by civil and religious quarrels been occupied in shedding their own blood and laying waste their native country The parliament and the Scots laid their proposals before the king They were such as a captive entirely at mercy could expect from the most inexorable victor Yet were they little worse than what were insisted on before the battle of Naseby The power of the sword instead of ten which the king now offered was demanded for twenty years together with a right to levy whatever money the parliament should think proper for the support of their armies The other conditions were in the main the same with those which had formerly been offered to the king Charles said that proposals which introduced such important innovations in the constitution demanded time for deliberation the commissioners replied that he must give his answer in ten days He desired to reason about the meaning and import of some terms they informed him that they had no power of debate and peremptorily required his consent or refusal He requested a personal treaty with the parliament They threatened that if he delayed compliance the parliament would by their own authority settle the nation Rush vol vi p two hundred ninety three Rush vol vi p three hundred nine Rush vol vii p three hundred nineteen What the parliament was most intent upon was not their treaty with the king to whom they paid little regard but that with the Scots Two important points remained to be settled with that nation their delivery of the king and the estimation of their arrears The Scots might pretend that as Charles was king of Scotland as well as of England they were entitled to an equal vote in the disposal of his person and that in such a case where the titles are equal and the subject indivisible the preference was due to the present possessor The English maintained that the king being in England was comprehended within the jurisdiction of that kingdom and could not be disposed of by any foreign nation a delicate question this and what surely could not be decided by precedent since such a situation is not any where to be found in history Rush vol vii p three hundred thirty nine As the Scots concurred with the English in imposing such severe conditions on the king that notwithstanding his unfortunate situation he still refused to accept of them it is certain that they did not desire his freedom nor could they ever intend to join lenity and rigor together in so inconsistent a manner Before the settlement of terms the administration must be possessed entirely by the parliaments of both kingdoms and how incompatible that scheme with the liberty of the king is easily imagined To carry him a prisoner into Scotland where few forces could be supported to guard him was a measure so full of inconvenience and danger that even if the English had consented to it it must have appeared to the Scots themselves altogether uneligible and how could such a plan be supported in opposition to England possessed of such numerous and victorious armies which were at that time at least seemed to be in entire union with the parliament The only expedient it is obvious which the Scots could embrace if they scrupled wholly to abandon the king was immediately to return fully and cordially to their allegiance and uniting themselves with the royalists in both kingdoms endeavor by force of arms to reduce the English parliament to more moderate conditions but besides that this measure was full of extreme hazard what was it but instantly to combine with their old enemies against their old friends and in a fit of romantic generosity overturn what with so much expense of blood and treasure they had during the course of so many years been so carefully erecting But though all these reflections occurred to the Scottish commissioners they resolved to prolong the dispute and to keep the king as a pledge for those arrears which they claimed from England and which they were not likely in the present disposition of that nation to obtain by any other expedient The sum by their account amounted to near two millions for they had received little regular pay since they had entered England And though the contributions which they had levied as well as the price of their living at free quarters must be deducted yet still the sum which they insisted on was very considerable After many discussions it was at last agreed that in lieu of all demands they should accept of four hundred thousand pounds one half to be paid instantly another in two subsequent payments Rush vol vii p three hundred twenty six Parl Hist vol xv p two hundred thirty six Great pains were taken by the Scots and the English complied with their pretended delicacy to make this estimation and payment of arrears appear a quite different transaction from that for the delivery of the king s person but common sense requires that they should be regarded as one and the same The English it is evident had they not been previously assured of receiving the king would never have parted with so considerable a sum and while they weakened themselves by the same measure have strengthened a people with whom they must afterwards have so material an interest to discuss Thus the Scottish nation underwent and still undergo for such grievous stains are not easily wiped off the reproach of selling their king and betraying their prince for money In vain did they maintain that this money was on account of former services undoubtedly their due that in their present situation no other measure without the utmost indiscretion or even their apparent ruin could be embraced and that though they delivered their king into the hands of his open enemies they were themselves as much his open enemies as those to whom they surrendered him and their common hatred against him had long united the two parties in strict alliance with each other They were still answered that they made use of this scandalous expedient for obtaining their wages and that after taking arms without any provocation against their sovereign who had ever loved and cherished them they had deservedly fallen into a situation from which they could not extricate themselves without either infamy or imprudence The infamy of this bargain had such an influence on the Scottish parliament that they once voted that the king should be protected and his liberty insisted on But the general assembly interposed and pronounced that as he had refused to take the covenant which was pressed on him it became not the godly to concern themselves about his fortunes After this declaration it behoved the parliament to retract their vote Intelligence concerning the final resolution of the Scottish nation to surrender him was brought to the king and he happened at that very time to be playing at chess Such command of temper did he possess that he continued his game without interruption and none of the bystanders could perceive that the letter which he perused had brought him news of any consequence The English commissioners who some days after came to take him under their custody were admitted to kiss his hands and he received them with the same grace and cheerfulness as if they had travelled on no other errand than to pay court to him The old earl of Pembroke in particular who was one of them he congratulated on his strength and vigor that he was still able during such a season to perform so long a journey in company with so many young people The king being delivered over by the Scots to the English commissioners was conducted under a guard to Holdenby in the county of Northampton On his journey the whole country flocked to behold him moved partly by curiosity partly by compassion and affection If any still retained rancor against him in his present condition they passed in silence while his well wishers more generous than prudent accompanied his march with tears with acclamations and with prayers for his safety That ancient superstition likewise of desiring the king s touch in scrofulous distempers seemed to acquire fresh credit among the people from the general tenderness which began to prevail for this virtuous and unhappy monarch Parl Hist vol xv p two hundred forty three two hundred forty four Burnet s Memoirs of the Hamiltons Ludlow Herbert The commissioners rendered his confinement at Holdenby very rigorous dismissing his ancient servants debarring him from visits and cutting off all communication with his friends or family The parliament though earnestly applied to by the king refused to allow his chaplains to attend him because they had not taken the covenant The king refused to assist at the service exercised according to the directory because he had not as yet given his consent to that mode of worship Such religious zeal prevailed on both sides and such was the unhappy and distracted condition to which it had reduced king and people During the time that the king remained in the Scottish army at Newcastle died the earl of Essex the discarded but still powerful and popular general of the parliament His death in this conjuncture was a public misfortune Fully sensible of the excesses to which affairs had been carried and of the worse consequences which were still to be apprehended he had resolved to conciliate a peace and to remedy as far as possible all those ills to which from mistake rather than any bad intentions he had himself so much contributed The Presbyterian or the moderate party among the commons found themselves considerably weakened by his death and the small remains of authority which still adhered to the house of peers were in a manner wholly extinguished Clarendon voL T p thirty nine Warwick p two hundred ninety eight Clarendon vol v p forty eight CHAPTER LIX CHARLES I The dominion of the parliament was of short duration No sooner had they subdued their sovereign than their own servants rose against them and tumbled them from their slippery throne The sacred boundaries of the laws being once violated nothing remained to confine the wild projects of zeal and ambition and every successive revolution became a precedent for that which followed it In proportion as the terror of the king s power diminished the division between Independent and Presbyterian became every day more apparent and the neuters found it at last requisite to seek shelter in one or the other faction Many new writs were issued for elections in the room of members who had died or were disqualified by adhering to the king yet still the Presbyterians retained the superiority among the commons and all the peers except Lord Say were esteemed of that party The Independents to whom the inferior sectaries adhered predominated in the army and the troops of the new model were universally infected with that enthusiastic spirit To their assistance did the Independent party among the commons chiefly trust in their projects for acquiring the ascendant over their antagonists Soon after the retreat of the Scots the Presbyterians seeing every thing reduced to obedience began to talk of diminishing the army and on pretence of easing the public burdens they levelled a deadly blow at the opposite faction They purposed to embark a strong detachment under Skippon and Massey for the service of Ireland they openly declared their intention of making a great reduction of the remainder It was even imagined that another new model of the army was projected in order to regain to the Presbyterians that superiority which they had so imprudently lost by the former Fourteen thousand men were only intended to be kept up six thousand horse six thousand foot and two thousand dragoons Bates Rush vol vii p five hundred sixty four The army had small inclination to the service of Ireland a country barbarous uncultivated and laid waste by massacres and civil commotions they had less inclination to disband and to renounce that pay which having earned it through fatigues and dangers they now purposed to enjoy in ease and tranquillity And most of the officers having risen from the dregs of the people had no other prospect if deprived of their commission than that of returning to languish in their native poverty and obscurity These motives of interest acquired additional influence and became more dangerous to the parliament from the religious spirit by which the army was universally actuated Among the generality of men educated in regular civilized societies the sentiments of shame duty honor have considerable authority and serve to counterbalance and direct the motives derived from private advantage but by the predominancy of enthusiasm among the parliamentary forces these salutary principles lost their credit and were regarded as mere human inventions yea moral institutions fitter for heathens than for Christians The saint resigned over to superior guidance was at full liberty to gratify all his appetites disguised under the appearance of pious zeal And besides the strange corruptions engendered by this spirit it eluded and loosened all the ties of morality and gave entire scope and even sanction to the selfishness and ambition which naturally adhere to the human mind The military confessors were further encouraged in disobedience to superiors by that spiritual pride to which a mistaken piety is so subject They were not they said mere janizaries mercenary troops enlisted for hire and to be disposed of at the will of their paymasters Religion and liberty were the motives which had excited them to arms and they had a superior right to see those blessings which they had purchased with their blood insured to future generations By the same title that the Presbyterians in contradistinction to the royalists had appropriated to themselves the epithet of godly or the well affected the Independents did now in contradistinction to the Presbyterians assume this magnificent appellation and arrogate all the ascendant which naturally belongs to it Rush vol vi p one hundred thirty four Rush vol vii p five hundred sixty five Bush vol vii p four hundred seventy four Hearing of parties in the house of commons and being informed that the minority were friends to the army the majority enemies the troops naturally interested themselves in that dangerous distinction and were eager to give the superiority to their partisans Whatever hardships they underwent though perhaps derived from inevitable necessity were ascribed to a settled design of oppressing them and resented as an effect of the animosity and malice of their adversaries Notwithstanding the great revenue which accrued from taxes assessments sequestrations and compositions considerable arrears were due to the army and many of the private men as well as officers had near a twelvemonth s pay still owing them The army suspected that this deficiency was purposely contrived in order to oblige them to live at free quarters and by rendering them odious to the country serve as a pretence for disbanding them When they saw such members as were employed in committees and civil offices accumulate fortunes they accused them of rapine and public plunder And as no plan was pointed out by the commons for the payment of arrears the soldiers dreaded that after they should be disbanded or embarked for Ireland their enemies who predominated in the two houses would entirely defraud them of their right and oppress them with impunity On this ground or pretence did the first commotions begin in the army A petition addressed to Fairfax the general was handed about craving an indemnity and that ratified by the king for any illegal actions of which during the course of the war the soldiers might have been guilty together with satisfaction in arrears freedom from pressing relief of widows and maimed soldiers and pay till disbanded The commons aware of what combustible materials the army was composed were alarmed at this intelligence Such a combination they knew if not checked in its first appearance must be attended with the most dangerous consequences and must soon exalt the military above the civil authority Besides summoning some officers to answer for this attempt they immediately voted that the petition tended to introduce mutiny to put conditions upon the parliament and to obstruct the relief of Ireland and they threatened to proceed against the promoters of it as enemies to the state and disturbers of public peace Parl Hist vol xv p three hundred forty two Parl Hist vol xv p three hundred forty four This declaration which may be deemed violent especially as the army had some ground for complaint produced fatal effects The soldiers lamented that they were deprived of the privileges of Englishmen that they were not allowed so much as to represent their grievances that while petitions from Essex and other places were openly encouraged against the army their mouths were stopped and that they who were the authors of liberty to the nation were reduced by a faction in parliament to the most grievous servitude In this disposition was the army found by Warwick Dacres Massey and other commissioners who were sent to make them proposals for entering into the service of Ireland instead of enlisting the generality objected to the terms demanded an indemnity were clamorous for their arrears and though they expressed no dissatisfaction against Skippon who was appointed commander they discovered much stronger inclination to serve under Fairfax and Cromwell Some officers who were of the Presbyterian party having entered into engagements for this service could prevail on very few of the soldiers to enlist under them And as these officers lay all under the grievous reproach of deserting the army and betraying the interests of their companions the rest were further confirmed in that confederacy which they had secretly formed To petition and remonstrate being the most cautious method of conducting a confederacy an application to parliament was signed by near two hundred officers in which they made their apology with a very imperious air asserted their right of petitioning and complained of that imputation thrown upon them by the former declaration of the lower house The private men likewise of some regiments sent a letter to Skippon in which together with insisting on the same topics they lament that designs were formed against them and many of the godly party in the kingdom and declare that they could not engage for Ireland till they were satisfied in their expectations and had their just desires granted v The army in a word felt their power and resolved to be masters Rush vol vii p four hundred fifty seven Rush vol vii p four hundred fifty eight Rush vol vii p four hundred sixty one five hundred fifty six Rush vol vii p four hundred sixty eight v Rush vol vii p four hundred seventy four The parliament too resolved if possible to preserve their dominion but being destitute of power and not retaining much authority it was not easy for them to employ any expedient which could contribute to their purpose The expedient which they now made use of was the worst imaginable They sent Skippon Cromwell Ireton and Fleetwood to the head quarters at Saffron Weldon in Essex and empowered them to make offers to the army and inquire into the cause of its distempers These very generals at least the three last were secretly the authors of all the discontents and failed not to foment those disorders which they pretended to appease By their suggestion a measure was embraced which at once brought matters to extremity and rendered the mutiny incurable In opposition to the parliament at Westminster a military parliament was formed Together with a council of the principal officers which was appointed after the model of the house of peers a more free representative of the army was composed by the election of two private men or inferior officers under the title of agitators from each troop or company By this means both the general humor of that time was gratified intent on plans of imaginary republics and an easy method contrived for conducting underhand and propagating the sedition of the army This terrible court when assembled having first declared that they found no distempers in the army but many grievances under which it labored immediately voted the offers of the parliament unsatisfactory Eight weeks pay alone they said was promised a small part of fifty six weeks which they claimed as their due no visible security was given for the remainder and having been declared public enemies by the commons they might hereafter be prosecuted as such unless the declaration were recalled Before matters came to this height Cromwell had posted up to London on pretence of laying before the parliament the rising discontents of the army The parliament made one vigorous effort more to try the force of their authority they voted that all the troops which did not engage for Ireland should instantly be disbanded in their quarters Rush vol vii p four hundred eighty five Clarendon vol v p forty three Rusk vol vii p four hundred ninety seven five hundred five Whitlocke p two hundred fifty Rush vol vii p four hundred eighty seven At the same time the council of the army ordered a general rendezvous of all the regiments in order to provide for their common interests And while they thus prepared themselves for opposition to the parliament they struck a blow which at once decided the victory in their favor A party of five hundred horse appeared at Holdenby conducted by one Joyce who had once been a tailor by profession but was now advanced to the rank of cornet and was an active agitator in the army Without being opposed by the guard whose affections were all on their side Joyce came into the king s presence armed with pistols and told him that he must immediately go along with him Whither said the king To the army replied Joyce By what warrant asked the king Joyce pointed to the soldiers whom he brought along tall handsome and well accoutred Your warrant said Charles smiling is writ in fair characters legible without spelling The parliamentary commissioners came into the room they asked Joyce whether he had any orders from the parliament he said No from the general No by what authority he came he made the same reply as to the king They would write they said to the parliament to know their pleasure You may do so replied Joyce but in the mean time the king must immediately go with me Resistance was vain The king after protracting the time as long as he could went into his coach and was safely conducted to the army who were hastening to their rendezvous at Triplo Heath near Cambridge The parliament informed of this event by their commissioners were thrown into the utmost consternation Whitlocke p two hundred fifty four Warwick p two hundred ninety nine Rush vol vii p six hundred fourteen five hundred fifteen Clarendon vol v p forty seven Fairfax himself was no less surprised at the king s arrival That bold measure executed by Joyce had never been communicated to the general The orders were entirely verbal and nobody avowed them And while every one affected astonishment at the enterprise Cromwell by whose counsel it had been directed arrived from London and put an end to their deliberations This artful and audacious conspirator had conducted himself in the parliament with such profound dissimulation with such refined hypocrisy that he had long deceived those who being themselves very dexterous practitioners in the same arts should naturally have entertained the more suspicion against others At every intelligence of disorders in the army he was moved to the highest pitch of grief and of anger He wept bitterly he lamented the misfortunes of his country he advised every violent measure for suppressing the mutiny and by these precipitate counsels at once seemed to evince his own sincerity and inflamed those discontents of which he intended to make advantage He obtested heaven and earth that his devoted attachment to the parliament had rendered him so odious in the army that his life while among them was in the utmost danger and he had very narrowly escaped a conspiracy formed to assassinate him But information being brought that the most active officers and agitators were entirely his creatures the parliamentary leaders secretly resolved that next day when he should come to the house an accusation should be entered against him and he should be sent to the Tower Cromwell who in the conduct of his desperate enterprises frequently approached to the very brink of destruction knew how to make the requisite turn with proper dexterity and boldness Being informed of this design he hastened to the camp where he was received with acclamations and was instantly invested with the supreme command both of general and army Clarendon vol v p forty six Fairfax having neither talents himself for cabal nor penetration to discover the cabals of others had given his entire confidence to Cromwell who by the best colored pretences and by the appearance of an open sincerity and a scrupulous conscience imposed on the easy nature of this brave and virtuous man The council of officers and the agitators were moved altogether by Cromwell s direction and conveyed his will to the whole army By his profound and artful conduct he had now attained a situation where he could cover his enterprises from public view and seeming either to obey the commands of his superior officer or yield to the movements of the soldiers could secretly pave the way for his future greatness While the disorders of the army were yet in their infancy he kept at a distance lest his counterfeit aversion might throw a damp upon them or his secret encouragement beget suspicion in the parliament As soon as they came to maturity he openly joined the troops and in the critical moment struck that important blow of seizing the king s person and depriving the parliament of any resource of an accommodation with him Though one visor fell off another still remained to cover his natural countenance Where delay was requisite he could employ the most indefatigable patience where celerity was necessary he flew to a decision And by thus uniting in his person the most opposite talents he was enabled to combine the most contrary interests in a subserviency to his secret purposes The parliament though at present defenceless was possessed of many resources and time might easily enable them to resist that violence with which they were threatened Without further deliberation therefore Cromwell advanced the army upon them and arrived in a few days at saint Albans Nothing could be more popular than this hostility which the army commenced against the parliament As much as that assembly was once the idol of the nation as much was it now become the object of general hatred and aversion The self denying ordinance had no longer been put in execution than till Essex Manchester Waller and the other officers of that party had resigned their commission immediately after it was laid aside by tacit consent and the members sharing all offices of power and profit among them proceeded with impunity in exercising acts of oppression on the helpless nation Though the necessity of their situation might serve as an apology for many of their measures the people not accustomed to such a species of government were not disposed to make the requisite allowances A small supply of one hundred thousand pounds a year could never be obtained by former kings from the jealous humor of parliaments and the English of all nations in Europe were the least accustomed to taxes but this parliament from the commencement of the war according to some computations had levied in five years above forty millions yet were loaded with debts and incumbrances which during that age were regarded as prodigious If these computations should be thought much exaggerated as they probably are the taxes and impositions were certainly far higher than in any former state of the English government and such popular exaggerations are at least a proof of popular discontents Clement Walker s History of the two Juntos prefixed to his History of Independency p eight This is an author of spirit and ingenuity and being a zealous parliamentarian his authority is very considerable notwithstanding the air of satire which prevails in his writings This computation however seems much too large especially as the sequestrations during the time of war could not be so considerable as afterwards Yet the same sum precisely is assigned in another book called Royal Treasury of England p two hundred ninety seven But the disposal of this money was no less the object of general complaint against the parliament than the levying of it The sum of three hundred thousand pounds they openly took it is affirmed and divided among their own members The committees to whom the management of the different branches of revenue was intrusted never brought in their accounts and had unlimited power of secreting whatever sums they pleased from the public treasure These branches were needlessly multiplied in order to render the revenue more intricate to share the advantages among greater numbers and to conceal the frauds of which they were universally suspected The method of keeping accounts practised in the exchequer was confessedly the exactest the most ancient the best known and the least liable to fraud The exchequer was for that reason abolished and the revenue put under the management of a committee who were subject to no control The excise was an odious tax formerly unknown to the nation and was now extended over provisions and the common necessaries of life Near one half of the goods and chattels and at least one half of the lands rents and revenues of the kingdom had been sequestered To great numbers of loyalists all redress from these sequestrations was refused to the rest the remedy could be obtained only by paying large compositions and subscribing the covenant which they abhorred Besides pitying the ruin and desolation of so many ancient and honorable families indifferent spectators could not but blame the hardship of punishing with such severity actions which the law in its usual and most undisputed interpretation strictly required of every subject The severities too exercised against the Episcopal clergy naturally affected the royalists and even all men of candor in a sensible manner By the most moderate computation v it appears that above one half of the established clergy had been turned out to beggary and want for no other crime than their adhering to the civil and religious principles in which they had been educated and for their attachment to those laws under whose countenance they had at first embraced that profession Clement Walker s History of Independency p three one hundred sixty six Clement Walker s History of Independency p eight Clement Walker s History of Independency p eight Clement Walker s History of Independency p eight v See John Walker s Attempt towards recovering an Account of the Numbers and Sufferings of the Clergy The parliament pretended to leave the sequestered clergy a fifth of their revenue but this author makes it sufficiently appear that this provision small as it is was never regularly paid the ejected clergy To renounce Episcopacy and the liturgy and to subscribe the covenant were the only terms which could save them from so rigorous a fate and if the least mark of malignancy as it was called or affection to the king who so entirely loved them had ever escaped their lips even this hard choice was not permitted The sacred character which gives the priesthood such authority over mankind becoming more venerable from the sufferings endured for the sake of principle by these distressed royalists aggravated the general indignation against their persecutors But what excited the most universal complaint was the unlimited tyranny and despotic rule of the country committees During the war the discretionary power of these courts was excused from the plea of necessity but the nation was reduced to despair when it saw neither end put to their duration nor bounds to their authority These could sequester fine imprison and corporally punish without law or remedy They interposed in questions of private property Under color of malignancy they exercised vengeance against their private enemies To the obnoxious and sometimes to the innocent they sold their protection And instead of one star chamber which had been abolished a great number were anew erected fortified with better pretences and armed with more unlimited authority Clement Walker s History of Independency p five Hollis gives the same representation as Walker of the plundering oppressions and tyranny of the parliament only instead of laying the fault on both parties as Walker does he ascribes it solely to the Independent faction The Presbyterians indeed being commonly denominated the moderate party would probably be more inoffensive See Rush vol vii p five hundred ninety eight and Parl Hist vol xv p two hundred thirty Could any thing have increased the indignation against that slavery into which the nation from the too eager pursuit of liberty had fallen it must have been the reflection on the pretences by which the people had so long been deluded The sanctified hypocrites who called their oppressions the spoiling of the Egyptians and their rigid severity the dominion of the elect interlarded all their iniquities with long and fervent prayers saved themselves from blushing by their pious grimaces and exercised in the name of the Lord all their cruelty on men An undisguised violence could be forgiven but such a mockery of the understanding such an abuse of religion were with men of penetration objects of peculiar resentment The parliament conscious of their decay in popularity seeing a formidable armed force advance upon them were reduced to despair and found all their resources much inferior to the present necessity London still retained a strong attachment to Presbyterianism and its militia which was numerous and had acquired reputation in the wars had by a late ordinance been put into hands in whom the parliament could entirely confide This militia was now called out and ordered to guard the lines which had been drawn round the city in order to secure it against the king A body of horse was ordered to be instantly levied Many officers who had been cashiered by the new model of the army offered their service to the parliament An army of five thousand men lay in the north under the command of General Pointz who was of the Presbyterian faction but these were too distant to be employed in so urgent a necessity The forces destined for Ireland were quartered in the west and though deemed faithful to the parliament they also lay at a distance Many inland garrisons were commanded by officer of the same party but their troops being so much dispersed could at present be of no manner of service The Scots were faithful friends and zealous for Presbytery and the covenant but a long time was required ere they could collect their forces and march to the assistance of the parliament In this situation it was thought more prudent to submit and by compliance to stop the fury of the enraged army The declaration by which the military petitioners had been voted public enemies was recalled and erased from the journal book This was the first symptom which the parliament gave of submission and the army hoping by terror alone to effect all their purposes stopped at saint Albans and entered into negotiation with their masters Rush vol vii p five hundred three five hundred forty seven Clarendon vol v p forty five Here commenced the encroachments of the military upon the civil authority The army in their usurpations on the parliament copied exactly the model which the parliament itself had set them in their recent usurpations on the crown Every day they rose in their demands If one claim was granted they had another ready still more enormous and exorbitant and were determined never to be satisfied At first they pretended only to petition for what concerned themselves as soldiers next they must have a vindication of their character then it was necessary that their enemies be punished at last they claimed a right of modelling the whole government and settling the nation They preserved in words all deference and respect to the parliament but in reality insulted them and tyrannized over them That assembly they pretended not to accuse it was only evil counsellors who seduced and betrayed it They proceeded so far as to name eleven members whom in general terms they charged with high treason as enemies to the army and evil counsellors to the parliament Their names were Hollis Sir Philip Stapleton Sir William Lewis Sir John Clotworthy Sir William Waller Sir John Maynard Massey Glyn Long Harley and Nichols These were the very leaders of the Presbyterian party They insisted that these members should immediately be sequestered from parliament and be thrown into prison The commons replied that they could not upon a general charge proceed so far v The army observed to them that the cases of Strafford and Laud were direct precedents for that purpose v At last the eleven members themselves not to give occasion for discord begged leave to retire from the house and the army for the present seemed satisfied with this mark of submission v Pretending that the parliament intended to levy war upon them and to involve the nation again in blood and confusion they required that all new levies should be stopped The parliament complied with this demand v Rush vol vii p five hundred nine Rush vol vii p five hundred sixty seven six hundred thirty three vol viii p seven hundred thirty

Rush vol vii p five hundred ninety three five hundred ninety four v Rush vol vii p five hundred seventy two five hundred seventy four There being no signs of resistance the army in order to save appearances removed at the desire of the parliament to a greater distance from London and fixed their head quarters at Reading They carried the king along with them in all their marches That prince now found himself in a better situation than at Holdenby and had attained some greater degree of freedom as well as of consideration with both parties All his friends had access to his presence his correspondence with the queen was not interrupted his chaplains were restored to him and he was allowed the use of the liturgy His children were once allowed to visit him and they passed a few days at Caversham where he then resided He had not seen the duke of Gloucester his youngest son and the princess Elizabeth since he left London at the commencement of the civil disorders nor the duke of York since he went to the Scottish army before Newark No private man unacquainted with the pleasures of a court and the tumult of a camp more passionately loved his family than did this good prince and such an instance of indulgence in the army was extremely grateful to him Cromwell who was witness to the meeting of the royal family confessed that he never had been present at so tender a scene and he extremely applauded the benignity which displayed itself in the whole disposition and behavior of Charles That artful politician as well as the leaders of all parties paid court to the king and fortune notwithstanding all his calamities seemed again to smile upon him The parliament afraid of his forming some accommodation with the army addressed him in a more respectful style than formerly and invited him to reside at Richmond and contribute his assistance to the settlement of the nation The chief officers treated him with regard and spake on all occasions of restoring him to his just powers and prerogatives In the public declarations of the army the settlement of his revenue and authority was insisted on The royalists every where entertained hopes of the restoration of monarchy and the favor which they universally bore to the army contributed very much to discourage the parliament and to forward their submission Clarendon vol i p fifty one fifty two fifty seven When the king applied to have his children the parliament always told him that they could take as much care at London both of their bodies and souls as could be done at Oxford Parl Hist vol xiii p one hundred twenty seven Rush vol vii p five hundred ninety The king began to feel of what consequence he was The more the national confusions increased the more was he confident that all parties would at length have recourse to his lawful authority as the only remedy for the public disorders You cannot be without me said he on several occasions you cannot settle the nation but by my assistance A people without government and without liberty a parliament without authority an army without a legal master distractions every where terrors oppressions convulsions from this scene of confusion which could not long continue all men he hoped would be brought to reflect on that ancient government under which they and their ancestors had so long enjoyed happiness and tranquillity Though Charles kept his ears open to all proposals and expected to hold the balance between the opposite parties he entertained more hopes of accommodation with the army He had experienced the extreme rigor of the parliament They pretended totally to annihilate his authority they had confined his person In both these particulars the army showed more indulgence He had a free intercourse with his friends And in the proposals which the council of officers sent for the settlement of the nation they insisted neither on the abolition of Episcopacy nor on the punishment of the royalists the two points to which the king had the most extreme reluctance and they demanded that a period should be put to the present parliament the event for which he most ardently longed Warwick p three hundred three Parl Hist vol xvi p forty Clarendon vol v p fifty His conjunction too seemed more natural with the generals than with that usurping assembly who had so long assumed the entire sovereignty of the state and who had declared their resolution still to continue masters By gratifying a few persons with titles and preferments he might draw over he hoped the whole military power and in an instant reinstate himself in his civil authority To Ireton he offered the lieutenancy of Ireland to Cromwell the garter the title of earl of Essex and the command of the army Negotiations to this purpose were secretly conducted Cromwell pretended to hearken to them and was well pleased to keep the door open for an accommodation if the course of events should at any time render it necessary And the king who had no suspicion that one born a private gentleman could entertain the daring ambition of seizing a sceptre transmitted through a long line of monarchs indulged hopes that he would at last embrace a measure which by all the motives of duty interest and safety seemed to be recommended to him While Cromwell allured the king by these expectations he still continued his scheme of reducing the parliament to subjection and depriving them of all means of resistance To gratify the army the parliament invested Fairfax with the title of general in chief of all the forces in England and Ireland and intrusted the whole military authority to a person who though well inclined to their service was no longer at his own disposal They voted that the troops which in obedience to them had enlisted for Ireland and deserted the rebellious army should be disbanded or in other words be punished for their fidelity The forces in the north under Pointz had already mutinied against their general and had entered into an association with that body of the army which was so successfully employed in exalting the military above the civil authority That no resource might remain to the parliament it was demanded that the militia of London should be changed the Presbyterian commissioners displaced and the command restored to those who during the course of the war had constantly exercised it The parliament even complied with so violent a demand and passed a vote in obedience to the army By this unlimited patience they purposed to temporize under their present difficulties and they hoped to find a more favorable opportunity for recovering their authority and influence but the impatience of the city lost them all the advantage of their cautious measures A petition against the alteration of the militia was carried to Westminster attended by the apprentices and seditious multitude who besieged the door of the house of commons and by their clamor noise and violence obliged them to reverse that vote which they had passed so lately When gratified in this pretension they immediately dispersed and left the parliament at liberty Rush vol vii p six hundred twenty Rush vol vii p six hundred twenty nine six hundred thirty two Rush vol vii p six hundred forty one six hundred forty three Clarendon vol v p sixty one Whitlocke p two hundred sixty nine Cl Walker p thirty eight No sooner was intelligence of this tumult conveyed to Reading than the army was put in motion The two houses being under restraint they were resolved they said to vindicate against the seditious citizens the invaded privileges of parliament and restore that assembly to its just freedom of debate and counsel In their way to London they were drawn up on Hounslow Heath a formidable body twenty thousand strong and determined without regard to laws or liberty to pursue whatever measures their generals should dictate to them Here the most favorable event happened to quicken and encourage their advance The speakers of the two houses Manchester and Lenthal attended by eight peers and about sixty commoners having secretly retired from the city presented themselves with their maces and all the ensigns of their dignity and complaining of the violence put upon them applied to the army for defence and protection They were received with shouts and acclamations respect was paid to them as to the parliament of England and the army being provided with so plausible a pretence which in all public transactions is of great consequence advanced to chastise the rebellious city and to reinstate the violated parliament Neither Lenthal nor Manchester were esteemed Independents and such a step in them was unexpected But they probably foresaw that the army must in the end prevail and they were willing to pay court in time to that authority which began to predominate in the nation The parliament forced from their temporizing measures and obliged to resign at once or combat for their liberty and power prepared themselves with vigor for defence and determined to resist the violence of the army The two houses immediately chose new speakers Lord Hunsdon and Henry Pelham they renewed their former orders for enlisting troops they appointed Massey to be commander they ordered the trained bands to man the lines and the whole city was in a ferment and resounded with military preparations When any intelligence arrived that the army stopped or retreated the shout of One and all ran with alacrity from street to street among the citizens when news came of their advancing the cry of Treat and capitulate was no less loud and vehement The terror of a universal pillage and even massacre had seized the timid inhabitants Rush vol viii p seven hundred fifty Clarendon vol v p sixty three Rush vol vii p six hundred forty six Whitlocke p two hundred sixty six As the army approached Rainsborow being sent by the general over the river presented himself before Southwark and was gladly received by some soldiers who were quartered there for its defence and who were resolved not to separate their interests from those of the army It behoved then the parliament to submit The army marched in triumph through the city but preserved the greatest order decency and appearance of humility They conducted to Westminster the two speakers who took their seats as if nothing had happened The eleven impeached members being accused as authors of the tumult were expelled and most of them retired beyond sea seven peers were impeached the mayor one sheriff and three aldermen sent to the Tower several citizens and officers of the militia committed to prison every deed of the parliament annulled from the day of the tumult till the return of the speakers the lines about the city levelled the militia restored to the Independents regiments quartered in Whitehall and the Mews and the parliament being reduced to a regular formed servitude a day was appointed of solemn thanksgiving for the restoration of its liberty Rush vol viii p seven hundred ninety seven seven hundred ninety eight et cetera The Independent party among the commons exulted in their victory The whole authority of the nation they imagined was now lodged in their hands and they had a near prospect of moulding the government into that imaginary republic which had long been the object of their wishes They had secretly concurred in all encroachments of the military upon the civil power and they expected by the terror of the sword to impose a more perfect system of liberty on the reluctant nation All parties the king the church the parliament the Presbyterians had been guilty of errors since the commencement of these disorders but it must be confessed that this delusion of the Independents and republicans was of all others the most contrary to common sense and the established maxims of policy Yet were the leaders of that party Vane Fiennes saint John Martin the men in England the most celebrated for profound thought and deep contrivance and by their well colored pretences and professions they had overreached the whole nation To deceive such men would argue a superlative capacity in Cromwell were it not that besides the great difference there is between dark crooked counsels and true wisdom an exorbitant passion for rule and authority will make the most prudent overlook the dangerous consequences of such measures as seem to tend in any degree to their own advancement The leaders of the army having established their dominion over the parliament and city ventured to bring the king to Hampton Court and he lived for some time in that palace with an appearance of dignity and freedom Such equability of temper did he possess that during all the variety of fortune which he underwent no difference was perceived in his countenance or behavior and though a prisoner in the hands of his most inveterate enemies he supported towards all who approached him the majesty of a monarch and that neither with less nor greater state than he had been accustomed to maintain His manner which was not in itself popular nor gracious now appeared amiable from its great meekness and equality The parliament renewed their applications to him and presented him with the same conditions which they had offered at Newcastle The king declined accepting them and desired the parliament to take the proposals of the army into consideration and make them the foundation of the public sentiment He still entertained hopes that his negotiations with the generals would be crowned with success though every thing in that particular daily bore a worse aspect Most historians have thought that Cromwell never was sincere in his professions and that having by force rendered himself master of the king s person and by fair pretences acquired the countenance of the royalists he had employed these advantages to the enslaving of the parliament and afterwards thought of nothing but the establishment of his own unlimited authority with which he esteemed the restoration and even life of the king altogether incompatible This opinion so much warranted by the boundless ambition and profound dissimulation of his character meets with ready belief though it is more agreeable to the narrowness of human views and the darkness of futurity to suppose that this daring usurper was guided by events and did not as yet foresee with any assurance that unparalleled greatness which he afterwards attained Many writers of that age have asserted seventeen that he really intended to make a private bargain with the king a measure which carried the most plausible appearance both for his safety and advancement but that he found insuperable difficulties in reconciling to it the wild humors of the army Rush vol viii p eight hundred ten See note Q at the end of the volume The horror and antipathy of these fanatics had for many years been artfully fomented against Charles and though their principles were on all occasions easily warped and eluded by private interest yet was some coloring requisite and a flat contradiction to all former professions and tenets could not safely be proposed to them It is certain at least that Cromwell made use of this reason why he admitted rarely of visits from the king s friends and showed less favor than formerly to the royal cause The agitators he said had rendered him odious to the army and had represented him as a traitor who for the sake of private interest was ready to betray the cause of God to the great enemy of piety and religion Desperate projects too he asserted to be secretly formed for the murder of the king and he pretended much to dread lest all his authority and that of the commanding officers would not be able to restrain these enthusiasts from their bloody purposes Intelligence being daily brought to the king of menaces thrown out by the agitators he began to think of retiring from Hampton Court and of putting himself in some place of safety The guards were doubled upon him the promiscuous concourse of people restrained a more jealous care exerted in attending his person all under color of protecting him from danger but really with a view of making him uneasy in his present situation These artifices soon produced the intended effect Charles who was naturally apt to be swayed by counsel and who had not then access to any good counsel took suddenly a resolution of withdrawing himself though without any concerted at least any rational scheme for the future disposal of his person Attended only by Sir John Berkeley Ashburnham and Leg he privately left Hampton court and his escape was not discovered till near an hour after when those who entered his chamber found on the table some letters directed to the parliament to the general and to the officer who had attended him Clarendon vol v p seventy six Rush vol viii p eight hundred seventy one All night he travelled through the forest and arrived next day at Tichfield a seat of the earl of Southampton s where the countess dowager resided a woman of honor to whom the king knew he might safely intrust his person Before he arrived at this place he had gone to the sea coast and expressed great anxiety that a ship which he seemed to look for had not arrived and thence Berkeley and Leg who were not in the secret conjectured that his intention was to transport himself beyond sea The king could not hope to remain long concealed at Tichfield what measure should next be embraced was the question In the neighborhood lay the Isle of Wight of which Hammond was governor This man was entirely dependent on Cromwell At his recommendation he had married a daughter of the famous Hambden who during his lifetime had been an intimate friend of Cromwell s and whose memory was ever respected by him These circumstances were very unfavorable yet because the governor was nephew to doctor Hammond the king s favorite chaplain and had acquired a good character in the army it was thought proper to have recourse to him in the present exigence when no other rational expedient could be thought of Ashburnham and Berkeley were despatched to the island They had orders not to inform Hammond of the place where the king was concealed till they had first obtained a promise from him not to deliver up his majesty though the parliament and the army should require him but to restore him to his liberty if he could not protect him This promise it is evident would have been a very slender security yet even without exacting it Ashburnham imprudently if not treacherously brought Hammond to Tichfield and the king was obliged to put himself in his hands and to attend him to Carisbroke Castle in the Isle of Wight where though received with great demonstrations of respect and duty he was in reality a prisoner Illustration one seven hundred carisbrooke jpg CARISBROKE CASTLE Lord Clarendon is positive that the king when he fled from Hampton Court had no intention of going to this island and indeed all the circumstances of that historian s narrative which we have here followed strongly favor this opinion But there remains a letter of Charles s to the earl of Laneric secretary of Scotland in which he plainly intimates that that measure was voluntarily embraced and even insinuates that if he had thought proper he might have been in Jersey or any other place of safety eighteen Page seventy nine eighty et cetera See note R at the end of the volume Perhaps he still confided in the promises of the generals and flattered himself that if he were removed from the fury of the agitators by which his life was immediately threatened they would execute what they had so often promised in his favor Whatever may be the truth in this matter for it is impossible fully to ascertain the truth Charles never took a weaker step nor one more agreeable to Cromwell and all his enemies He was now lodged in a place removed from his partisans at the disposal of the army whence it would be very difficult to deliver him either by force or artifice And though it was always in the power of Cromwell whenever he pleased to have sent him thither yet such a measure without the king s consent would have been very invidious if not attended with some danger That the king should voluntarily throw himself into the snare and thereby gratify his implacable persecutors was to them an incident peculiarly fortunate and proved in the issue very fatal to him Cromwell being now entirely master of the parliament and free from all anxiety with regard to the custody of the king s person applied himself seriously to quell those disorders in the army which he himself had so artfully raised and so successfully employed against both king and parliament In order to engage the troops into a rebellion against their masters he had encouraged an arrogant spirit among the inferior officers and private men and the camp in many respects carried more the appearance of civil liberty than of military obedience The troops themselves were formed into a kind of republic and the plans of imaginary republics for the settlement of the state were every day the topics of conversation among these armed legislators Royalty it was agreed to abolish nobility must be set aside even all ranks of men be levelled and a universal equality of property as well as of power be introduced among the citizens The saints they said were the salt of the earth an entire parity had place among the elect and by the same rule that the apostles were exalted from the most ignoble professions the meanest sentinel if enlightened by the Spirit was entitled to equal regard with the greatest commander In order to wean the soldiers from these licentious maxims Cromwell had issued orders for discontinuing the meetings of the agitators and he pretended to pay entire obedience to the parliament whom being now fully reduced to subjection he purposed to make for the future the instruments of his authority But the levellers for so that party in the army was called having experienced the sweets of dominion would not so easily be deprived of it They secretly continued their meetings they asserted that their officers as much as any part of the church or state needed reformation several regiments joined in seditious remonstrances and petitions separate rendezvouses were concerted and every thing tended to anarchy and confusion But this distemper was soon cured by the rough but dexterous hand of Cromwell He chose the opportunity of a review that he might display the greater boldness and spread the terror the wider He seized the ringleaders before their companions held in the field a council of war shot one mutineer instantly and struck such dread into the rest that they presently threw down the symbols of sedition which they had displayed and thenceforth returned to their wonted discipline and obedience Cromwell had great deference for the counsels of Ireton a man who having grafted the soldier on the lawyer the statesman on the saint had adopted such principles as were fitted to introduce the severest tyranny while they seemed to encourage the most unbounded license in human society Fierce in his nature though probably sincere in his intentions he purposed by arbitrary power to establish liberty and in prosecution of his imagined religious purposes he thought himself dispensed from all the ordinary rules of morality by which inferior mortals must allow themselves to be governed From his suggestion Cromwell secretly called at Windsor a council of the chief officers in order to deliberate concerning the settlement of the nation and the future disposal of the king s person Rush vol viii p eight hundred forty five eight hundred fifty nine Rush vol viii p eight hundred seventy five Clarendon vol v p eighty seven Clarendon vol v p ninety two In this conference which commenced with devout prayers poured forth by Cromwell himself and other inspired persons for the officers of this army received inspiration with their commission was first opened the daring and unheard of counsel of bringing the king to justice and of punishing by a judicial sentence their sovereign for his pretended tyranny and maleadministration While Charles lived even though restrained to the closest prison conspiracies they knew and insurrections would never be wanting in favor of a prince who was so extremely revered and beloved by his own party and whom the nation in general began to regard with great affection and compassion To murder him privately was exposed to the imputation of injustice and cruelty aggravated by the baseness of such a crime and every odious epithet of traitor and assassin would by the general voice of mankind be indisputably ascribed to the actors in such a villany Some unexpected procedure must be attempted which would astonish the world by its novelty would bear the semblance of justice and would cover its barbarity by the audaciousness of the enterprise Striking in with the fanatical notions of the entire equality of mankind it would insure the devoted obedience of the army and serve as a general engagement against the royal family whom by their open and united deed they would so heinously affront and injure This measure therefore being secretly resolved on it was requisite by degrees to make the parliament adopt it and to conduct them from violence to violence till this last act of atrocious iniquity should seem in a manner wholly inevitable The king in order to remove those fears and jealousies which were perpetually pleaded as reasons for every invasion of the constitution had offered by a message sent from Carisbroke Castle to resign during his own life the power of the militia and the nomination to all the great offices provided that after his demise these prerogatives should revert to the crown But the parliament acted entirely as victors and enemies and in all their transactions with him paid no longer any regard to equity or reason At the instigation of the Independents and army they neglected this offer and framed four proposals which they sent him as preliminaries and before they would deign to treat they demanded his positive assent to all of them The following was a favorite text among the enthusiasts of that age Let the high praises of God be in the mouths of his saints and a twofold sword in their hands to execute vengeance upon the heathen and punishment upon the people to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of iron to execute upon them the judgments written This honor have all his saints Psalm cxlix ver six seven eight nine Hugh Peters the mad chaplain of Cromwell preached frequently upon this text Rush vol viii p eight hundred eighty By one he was required to invest the parliament with the military power for twenty years together with an authority to levy whatever money should be necessary for exercising it and even after the twenty years should be elapsed they reserved a right of resuming the same authority whenever they should declare the safety of the kingdom to require it By the second he was to recall all his proclamations and declarations against the parliament and acknowledge that assembly to have taken arms in their just and necessary defence By the third he was to annul all the acts and void all the patents of peerage which had passed the great seal since it had been carried from London by Lord Keeper Littleton and at the same time renounce for the future the power of making peers without consent of parliament By the fourth he gave the two houses power to adjourn as they thought proper a demand seemingly of no great importance but contrived by the Independents that they might be able to remove the parliament to places where it should remain in perpetual subjection to the army The king regarded the pretension as unusual and exorbitant that he should make such concessions while not secure of any settlement and should blindly trust his enemies for the conditions which they were afterwards to grant him He required therefore a personal treaty with the parliament and desired that all the terms on both sides should be adjusted before any concession on either side should be insisted on The republican party in the house pretended to take fire at this answer and openly inveighed in violent terms against the person and government of the king whose name hitherto had commonly in all debates been mentioned with some degree of reverence Ireton seeming to speak the sense of the army under the appellation of many thousand godly men who had ventured their lives in defence of the parliament said that the king by denying the four bills had refused safety and protection to his people that their obedience to him was but a reciprocal duty for his protection of them and that as he had failed on his part they were freed from all obligations to allegiance and must settle the nation without consulting any longer so misguided a prince Clarendon vol v p eighty eight Cl Walker p seventy Cromwell after giving an ample character of the valor good affections and godliness of the army subjoined that it was expected the parliament should guide and defend the kingdom by their own power and resolutions and not accustom the people any longer to expect safety and government from an obstinate man whose heart God had hardened that those who at the expense of their blood had hitherto defended the parliament from so many dangers would still continue with fidelity and courage to protect them against all opposition in this vigorous measure Teach them not added he by your neglecting your own safety and that of the kingdom in which theirs too is involved to imagine themselves betrayed and their interests abandoned to the rage and malice of an irreconcilable enemy whom for your sake they have dared to provoke Beware and at these words he laid his hand on his sword beware lest despair cause them to seek safety by some other means than by adhering to you who know not how to consult your own safety Such arguments prevailed though ninety one members had still the courage to oppose It was voted that no more addresses be made to the king nor any letters or messages be received from him and that it be treason for any one without leave of the two houses to have any intercourse with him The lords concurred in the same ordinance By this vote of non addresses so it was called the king was in reality dethroned and the whole constitution formally overthrown So violent a measure was supported by a declaration of the commons no less violent The blackest calumnies were there thrown upon the king such as even in their famous remonstrance they thought proper to omit as incredible and extravagant the poisoning of his father the betraying of Rochelle the contriving of the Irish massacre By blasting his fame had that injury been in their power they formed a very proper prelude to the executing of violence on his person No sooner had the king refused his assent to the four bills than Hammond by orders from the army removed all his servants cut off his correspondence with his friends and shut him up in close confinement The king afterwards showed to Sir Philip Warwick a decrepit old man who he said was employed to kindle his fire and was the best company he enjoyed during several months that this rigorous confinement lasted Cl Walker p seventy Rush vol viii p nine hundred sixty five nine hundred sixty seven Rush vol viii p nine hundred ninety eight Clarendon vol v p ninety three Warwick p three hundred twenty nine No amusement was allowed him nor society which might relieve his anxious thoughts to be speedily poisoned or assassinated was the only prospect which he had every moment before his eyes for he entertained no apprehension of a judicial sentence and execution an event of which no history hitherto furnished an example Meanwhile the parliament was very industrious in publishing from time to time the intelligence which they received from Hammond how cheerful the king was how pleased with every one that approached him how satisfied in his present condition as if the view of such benignity and constancy had not been more proper to inflame than allay the general compassion of the people Rush vol viii p nine hundred eighty nine The great source whence the king derived consolation amidst all his calamities was undoubtedly religion a principle which in him seems to have contained nothing fierce or gloomy nothing which enraged him against his adversaries or terrified him with the dismal prospect of futurity While every thing around him bore a hostile aspect while friends family relations whom he passionately loved were placed at a distance and unable to serve him he reposed himself with confidence in the arms of that Being who penetrates and sustains all nature and whose severities if received with piety and resignation he regarded as the surest pledges of unexhausted favor The parliament and army meanwhile enjoyed not in tranquillity that power which they had obtained with so much violence and injustice Combinations and conspiracies they were sensible were every where forming around them and Scotland whence the king s cause had received the first fatal disaster seemed now to promise it support and assistance Before the surrender of the king s person at Newcastle and much more since that event the subjects of discontent had been daily multiplying between the two kingdoms The Independents who began to prevail took all occasions of mortifying the Scots whom the Presbyterians looked on with the greatest affection and veneration When the Scottish commissioners who joined to a committee of English lords and commons had managed the war were ready to depart it was proposed in parliament to give them thanks for their civilities and good offices The Independents insisted that the words good offices should be struck out and thus the whole brotherly friendship and intimate alliance with the Scots resolved itself into an acknowledgment of their being well bred gentlemen The advance of the army to London the subjection of the parliament the seizing of the king at Holdenby his confinement in Carisbroke Castle were so many blows sensibly felt by that nation as threatening the final overthrow of Presbytery to which they were so passionately devoted The covenant was profanely called in the house of commons an almanac out of date and that impiety though complained of had passed uncensured Instead of being able to determine and establish orthodoxy by the sword and by penal statutes they saw the sectarian army who were absolute masters claim an unbounded liberty of conscience which the Presbyterians regarded with the utmost abhorrence All the violences put on the king they loudly blamed as repugnant to the covenant by which they stood engaged to defend his royal person And those very actions of which they themselves had been guilty they denominated treason and rebellion when executed by an opposite party The earls of Loudon Lauderdale and Laneric who were sent to London protested against the four bills as containing too great a diminution of the king s civil power and providing no security for religion They complained that notwithstanding this protestation the bills were still insisted on contrary to the solemn league and to the treaty between the two nations And when they accompanied the English commissioners to the Isle of Wight they secretly formed a treaty with the king for arming Scotland in his favor Cl Walker p eighty Clarendon vol v p one hundred one Three parties at that time prevailed in Scotland the royalists who insisted upon the restoration of the king s authority without any regard to religion sects or tenets of these Montrose though absent was regarded as the head The rigid Presbyterians who hated the king even more than they abhorred toleration and who determined to give him no assistance till he should subscribe the covenant these were governed by Argyle The moderate Presbyterians who endeavored to reconcile the interests of religion and of the crown and hoped by supporting the Presbyterian party in England to suppress the sectarian army and to reinstate the parliament as well as the king in their just freedom and authority the two brothers Hamilton and Laneric were leaders of this party When Pendennis Castle was surrendered to the parliamentary army Hamilton who then obtained his liberty returned into Scotland and being generously determined to remember ancient favors more than recent injuries he immediately embraced with zeal and success the protection of the royal cause He obtained a vote from the Scottish parliament to arm forty thousand men in support of the king s authority and to call over a considerable body under Monro who commanded the Scottish forces in Ulster And though he openly protested that the covenant was the foundation of all his measures he secretly entered into correspondence with the English royalists Sir Marmaduke Langdale and Sir Philip Musgrave who had levied considerable forces in the north of England The general assembly who sat at the same time and was guided by Argyle dreaded the consequences of these measures and foresaw that the opposite party if successful would effect the restoration of monarchy without the establishment of Presbytery in England To join the king before he had subscribed the covenant was in their eyes to restore him to his honor before Christ had obtained his and they thundered out anathemas against every one who paid obedience to the parliament Whitlocke p three hundred Two supreme independent judicatures were erected in the kingdom one threatening the people with damnation and eternal torments the other with imprisonment banishment and military execution The people were distracted in their choice and the armament of Hamilton s party though seconded by all the civil power went on but slowly The royalists he would not as yet allow to join him lest he might give offence to the ecclesiastical party though he secretly promised them trust and preferment as soon as his army should advance into England While the Scots were making preparations for the invasion of England every part of that kingdom was agitated with tumults insurrections conspiracies discontents It is seldom that the people gain any thing by revolutions in government because the new settlement jealous and insecure must commonly be supported with more expense and severity than the old but on no occasion was the truth of this maxim more sensibly felt than in the present situation of England Complaints against the oppression of ship money against the tyranny of the star chamber had roused the people to arms and having gained a complete victory over the crown they found themselves loaded with a multiplicity of taxes formerly unknown and scarcely an appearance of law and liberty remained in the administration The Presbyterians who had chiefly supported the war were enraged to find the prize just when it seemed within their reach snatched by violence from them The royalists disappointed in their expectations by the cruel treatment which the king now received from the army were strongly animated to restore him to liberty and to recover the advantages which they had unfortunately lost All orders of men were inflamed with indignation at seeing the military prevail over the civil power and king and parliament at once reduced to subjection by a mercenary army Many persons of family and distinction had from the beginning of the war adhered to the parliament but all these were by the new party deprived of authority and every office was intrusted to the most ignoble part of the nation A base populace exalted above their superiors hypocrites exercising iniquity under the visor of religion these circumstances promised not much liberty or lenity to the people and these were now found united in the same usurped and illegal administration Though the whole nation seemed to combine in their hatred of military tyranny the ends which the several parties pursued were so different that little concert was observed in their insurrections Langhorne Poyer and Powel Presbyterian officers who commanded bodies of troops in Wales were the first that declared themselves and they drew together a considerable army in those parts which were extremely devoted to the royal cause An insurrection was raised in Kent by young Hales and the earl of Norwich Lord Capel Sir Charles Lucas Sir George Lisle excited commotions in Essex The earl of Holland who had several times changed sides since the commencement of the civil wars endeavored to assemble forces in Surrey Pomfret Castle in Yorkshire was surprised by Morrice Langdale and Musgrave were in arms and masters of Berwick and Carlisle in the north What seemed the most dangerous circumstance the general spirit of discontent had seized the fleet Seventeen ships lying in the mouth of the river declared for the king and putting Rainsborow their admiral ashore sailed over to Holland where the prince of Wales took the command of them Clarendon vol v p one hundred thirty seven The English royalists exclaimed loudly against Hamilton s delays which they attributed to a refined policy in the Scots as if their intentions were that all the king s party should first be suppressed and the victory remain solely to the Presbyterians Hamilton with better reason complained of the precipitate humor of the English royalists who by their ill timed insurrections forced him to march his army before his levies were completed or his preparations in any forwardness No commotions beyond a tumult of the apprentices which was soon suppressed were raised in London the terror of the army kept the citizens in subjection The parliament was so overawed that they declared the Scots to be enemies and all who joined them traitors Ninety members however of the lower house had the courage to dissent from this vote Cromwell and the military council prepared themselves with vigor and conduct for defence The establishment of the army was at this time twenty six thousand men but by enlisting supernumeraries the regiments were greatly augmented and commonly consisted of more than double their stated complement Whitlocke p two hundred eighty four Colonel Horton first attacked the revolted troops in Wales and gave them a considerable defeat The remnants of the vanquished threw themselves into Pembroke and were there closely besieged and soon after taken by Cromwell Lambert was opposed to Langdale and Musgrave in the north and gained advantages over them Sir Michael Livesey defeated the earl of Holland at Kingston and pursuing his victory took him prisoner at saint Neots Fairfax having routed the Kentish royalists at Maidstone followed the broken army and when they joined the royalists of Essex and threw themselves into Colchester he laid siege to that place which defended itself to the last extremity A new fleet was manned and sent out under the command of War wick to oppose the revolted ships of which the prince had taken the command While the forces were employed in all quarters the parliament regained its liberty and began to act with its wonted courage and spirit The members who had withdrawn from terror of the army returned and infusing boldness into their companions restored to the Presbyterian party the ascendant which it had formerly lost The eleven impeached members were recalled and the vote by which they were expelled was reversed The vote too of non addresses was repealed and commissioners five peers and ten commoners were sent to Newport in the Isle of Wight in order to treat with the king He was allowed to summon several of his friends and old counsellors that he might have their advice in this important transaction The theologians on both sides armed with their syllogisms and quotations attended as auxiliaries By them the flame had first been raised and their appearance was but a bad prognostic of its extinction Any other instruments seemed better adapted for a treaty of pacification When the king presented himself to this company a great and sensible alteration was remarked in his aspect from what it appeared the year before when he resided at Hampton Court The moment his servants had been removed he had laid aside all care of his person and had allowed his beard and hair to grow and to hang dishevelled and neglected His hair was become almost entirely gray either from the decline of years or from that load of sorrows under which he labored and which though borne with constancy preyed inwardly on his sensible and tender mind His friends beheld with compassion and perhaps even his enemies that gray and discrowned head as he himself terms it in a copy of verses which the truth of the sentiment rather than any elegance of expression renders very pathetic Having in vain endeavored by courage to defend his throne from his armed adversaries it now behoved him by reasoning and persuasion to save some fragments of it from these peaceful and no less implacable negotiators The vigor of the king s mind notwithstanding the seeming decline of his body here appeared unbroken and undecayed The parliamentary commissioners would allow none of his council to be present and refused to enter into reasoning with any but himself He alone during the transactions of two months was obliged to maintain the argument against fifteen men of the greatest parts and capacity in both houses and no advantage was ever obtained over him v This was the scene above all others in which he was qualified to excel A quick conception a cultivated understanding a chaste conclusion a dignified manner by these accomplishments he triumphed in all discussions of cool and temperate reasoning Clarendon vol v p one hundred eighty Sir Edward Walker s Perfect Copies p six Sir Edward Walker s Perfect Copies p eight Sir Edward Walker s Perfect Copies p eight thirty eight Burnet s Memoirs of Hamilton v Herbert s Memoirs p seventy two The king is much changed said the earl of Salisbury to Sir Philip Warwick he is extremely improved of late No replied Sir Philip he was always so but you are now at last sensible of it Sir Henry Vane discoursing with his fellow commissioners drew an argument from the king s uncommon abilities why the terms of pacification must be rendered more strict and rigid But Charles s capacity shone not equally in action as in reasoning The first point insisted on by the parliamentary commissioners was the king s recalling all his proclamations and declarations against the parliament and the acknowledging that they had taken arms in their own defence He frankly offered the former concession but long scrupled the latter The falsehood as well as indignity of that acknowledgment begat in his breast an extreme reluctance against it The king had no doubt in some particulars of moment invaded from a seeming necessity the privileges of his people but having renounced all claim to these usurped powers having confessed his errors and having repaired every breach in the constitution and even erected new ramparts in order to secure it he could no longer at the commencement of the war be represented as the aggressor However it might be pretended that the former display of his arbitrary inclinations or rather his monarchical principles rendered an offensive or preventive war in the parliament prudent and reasonable it could never in any propriety of speech make it be termed a defensive one But the parliament sensible that the letter of the law condemned them as rebels and traitors deemed this point absolutely necessary for their future security and the king finding that peace could be obtained on no other terms at last yielded to it He only entered a protest which was admitted that no concession made by him should be valid unless the whole treaty of pacification were concluded Warwick p three hundred twenty four Clarendon Sir Edward Walker p three hundred nineteen Walker p eleven twelve twenty four He agreed that the parliament should retain during the term of twenty years the power over the militia and army and that of levying what money they pleased for their support He even yielded to them the right of resuming at any time afterwards this authority whenever they should declare such a resumption necessary for public safety In effect the important power of the sword was forever ravished from him and his successors He agreed that all the great offices during twenty years should be filled by both houses of parliament He relinquished to them the entire government of Ireland and the conduct of the war there He renounced the power of the wards and accepted of one hundred thousand pounds a year in lieu of it He acknowledged the validity of their great seal and gave up his own v He abandoned the power of creating peers without consent of parliament And he agreed that all the debts contracted in order to support the war against him should be paid by the people So great were the alterations made on the English constitution by this treaty that the king said not without reason that he had been more an enemy to his people by these concessions could he have prevented them than by any other action of his life Of all the demands of the parliament Charles refused only two Though he relinquished almost every power of the crown he would neither give up his friends to punishment nor desert what he esteemed his religious duty The severe repentance which he had undergone for abandoning Strafford had no doubt confirmed him in the resolution never again to be guilty of a like error His long solitude and severe afflictions had contributed to rivet him the more in those religious principles which had ever a considerable influence over him His desire however of finishing an accommodation induced him to go as far in both these particulars as he thought any wise consistent with his duty The estates of the royalists being at that time almost entirely under sequestration Charles who could give them no protection consented that they should pay such compositions as they and the parliament should agree on and only begged that they might be made as moderate as possible He had not the disposal of offices and it seemed but a small sacrifice to consent that a certain number of his friends should be rendered incapable of public employments v Walker p fifty one Walker p seventy eight Walker p forty five Walker p sixty nine seventy seven v Walker p fifty six sixty eight v Walker p sixty one But when the parliament demanded a bill of attainder and banishment against seven persons the marquis of Newcastle Lord Digby Lord Biron Sir Marmaduke Langdale Sir Richard Granville Sir Francis Doddington and Judge Jenkins the king absolutely refused compliance their banishment for a limited time he was willing to agree to Religion was the fatal point about which the differences had arisen and of all others it was the least susceptible of composition or moderation between the contending parties The parliament insisted on the establishment of Presbytery the sale of the chapter lands the abolition of all forms of prayer and strict laws against Catholics The king offered to retrench every thing which he did not esteem of apostolicat institution he was willing to abolish archbishops deans prebends canons he offered that the chapter lands should be let at low leases during ninety nine years he consented that the present church government should continue during three years after that time he required not that any thing should be restored to bishops but the power of ordination and even that power to be exercised by advice of the presbyters If the parliament upon the expiration of that period still insisted on their demand all other branches of episcopal jurisdiction were abolished and a new form of church government must by common consent be established The Book of Common Prayer he was willing to renounce but required the liberty of using some other liturgy in his own chapel a demand which though seemingly reasonable was positively refused by the parliament In the dispute on these articles one is not surprised that two of the parliamentary theologians should tell the king that if he did not consent to the utter abolition of Episcopacy he would be damned But it is not without some indignation that we read the following vote of the lords and commons The houses out of their detestation to that abominable idolatry used in the mass do declare that they cannot admit of or consent unto any such indulgence in any law as is desired by his majesty for exempting the queen and her family from the penalties to be enacted against the exercise of the mass Walker p ninety one ninety three Walker p twenty nine thirty five forty nine Walker p sixty five Walker p seventy five eighty two Rush vol viii p thirteen twenty three Walker p seventy one The treaty of marriage the regard to the queen s sex and high station even common humanity all considerations were undervalued in comparison of their bigoted prejudices nineteen See note S at the end of the volume It was evidently the interest both of king and parliament to finish their treaty with all expedition and endeavor by their combined force to resist if possible the usurping fury of the army It seemed even the interest of the parliament to leave in the king s hand a considerable share of authority by which he might be enabled to protect them and himself from so dangerous an enemy But the terms on which they insisted were so rigorous that the king fearing no worse from the most implacable enemies was in no haste to come to a conclusion And so great was the bigotry on both sides that they were willing to sacrifice the greatest civil interests rather than relinquish the most minute of their theological contentions From these causes assisted by the artifice of the Independents the treaty was spun out to such a length that the invasions and insurrections were every where subdued and the army had leisure to execute their violent and sanguinary purposes Hamilton having entered England with a numerous though undisciplined army durst not unite his forces with those of Langdale because the English royalists had refused to take the covenant and the Scottish Presbyterians though engaged for the king refused to join them on any other terms The two armies marched together though at some distance nor could even the approach of the parliamentary army under Cromwell oblige the Covenanters to consult their own safety by a close union with the royalists When principles are so absurd and so destructive of human society it may safely be averred that the more sincere and the more disinterested they are they only become the more ridiculous and the more odious Cromwell feared not to oppose eight thousand men to the numerous armies of twenty thousand commanded by Hamilton and Langdale He attacked the latter by surprise near Preston in Lancashire and though the royalists made a brave resistance yet not being succored in time by their confederates they were almost entirely cut in pieces Hamilton was next attacked put to rout and pursued to Utoxeter where he surrendered himself prisoner Cromwell followed his advantage and marching into Scotland with a considerable body joined Argyle who was also in arms and having suppressed Laneric Monro and other moderate Presbyterians he placed the power entirely in the hands of the violent party The ecclesiastical authority exalted above the civil exercised the severest vengeance on all who had a share in Hamilton s engagement as it was called nor could any of that party recover trust or even live in safety but by doing solemn and public penance for taking arms by authority of parliament in defence of their lawful sovereign The chancellor Loudon who had at first countenanced Hamilton s enterprise being terrified with the menaces of the clergy had some time before gone over to the other party and he now openly in the church though invested with the highest civil character in the kingdom did penance for his obedience to the parliament which he termed a carnal self seeking He accompanied his penance with so many tears and such pathetical addresses to the people for their prayers in this his uttermost sorrow and distress that a universal weeping and lamentation took place among the deluded audience The loan of great sums of money often to the ruin of families was exacted from all such as lay under any suspicion of favoring the king s party though their conduct had been ever so inoffensive This was a device fallen upon by the ruling party in order as they said to reach heart malignants Never in this island was known a more severe and arbitrary government than was generally exercised by the patrons of liberty in both kingdoms Whitlocke p three hundred sixty Guthrey Lucas and Sir George Lisle The siege of Colchester terminated in a manner no less unfortunate than Hamilton s engagement for the royal cause After suffering the utmost extremities of famine after feeding on the vilest aliments the garrison desired at last to capitulate Fairfax required them to surrender at discretion and he gave such an explanation to these terms as to reserve to himself power if he pleased to put them all instantly to the sword The officers endeavored though in vain to persuade the soldiers by making a vigorous sally to break through at least to sell their lives as dear as possible They were obliged to accept of the conditions offered and Fairfax instigated by Ireton to whom Cromwell in his absence had consigned over the government of the passive general seized Sir Charles and resolved to make them instant sacrifices to military justice This unusual severity was loudly exclaimed against by all the prisoners Lord Capel fearless of danger reproached Ireton with it and challenged him as they were all engaged in the same honorable cause to exercise the same impartial vengeance on all of them Lucas was first shot and he himself gave orders to fire with the same alacrity as if he had commanded a platoon of his own soldiers Lisle instantly ran and kissed the dead body then cheerfully presented himself to a like fate Thinking that the soldiers destined for his execution stood at too great a distance he called to them to come nearer one of them replied I ll warrant you sir we ll hit you he answered smiling Friends I have been nearer you when you have missed me Thus perished this generous spirit not less beloved for his modesty and humanity than esteemed for his courage and military conduct Soon after a gentleman appearing in the king s presence clothed in mourning for Sir Charles Lucas that humane prince suddenly recollecting the hard fate of his friends paid them a tribute which none of his own unparalleled misfortunes ever extorted from him he dissolved into a flood of tears Whitlocke By these multiplied successes of the army they had subdued all their enemies and none remained but the helpless king and parliament to oppose their violent measures From Cromwell s suggestion a remonstrance was drawn by the council of general officers and sent to the parliament They there complain of the treaty with the king demand his punishment for the blood spilt during the war require a dissolution of the present parliament and a more equal representative for the future and assert that though servants they are entitled to represent these important points to their masters who are themselves no better than servants and trustees of the people At the same time they advanced with the army to Windsor and sent Colonel Eure to seize the king s person at Newport and convey him to Hurst Castle in the neighborhood where he was detained in strict confinement Illustration one seven hundred five hurst castle jpg HURST CASTLE This measure being foreseen some time before the king was exhorted to make his escape which was conceived to be very easy but having given his word to the parliament not to attempt the recovery of his liberty during the treaty and three weeks after he would not by any persuasion be induced to hazard the reproach of violating that promise In vain was it urged that a promise given to the parliament could no longer be binding since they could no longer afford him protection from violence threatened him by other persons to whom he was bound by no tie or engagement The king would indulge no refinements of casuistry however plausible in such delicate subjects and was resolved that what depredations soever fortune should commit upon him she never should bereave him of his honor Colonel Cooke s Memoirs p one hundred seventy four Rush vol viii p thirteen forty seven The parliament lost not courage notwithstanding the danger with which they were so nearly menaced Though without any plan for resisting military usurpations they resolved to withstand them to the uttermost and rather to bring on a violent and visible subversion of government than lend their authority to those illegal and sanguinary measures which were projected They set aside the remonstrance of the army without deigning to answer it they voted the seizing of the king s person to be without their consent and sent a message to the general to know by what authority that enterprise had been executed and they issued orders that the army should advance no nearer to London Hollis the present leader of the Presbyterians was a man of unconquerable intrepidity and many others of that party seconded his magnanimous spirit It was proposed by them that the generals and principal officers should for their disobedience and usurpations be proclaimed traitors by the parliament But the parliament was dealing with men who would not be frightened by words nor retarded by any scrupulous delicacy The generals under the name of Fairfax for he still allowed them to employ his name marched the army to London and placing guards in Whitehall the Mews saint James s Durham House Covent Garden and Palace Yard surrounded the parliament with their hostile armaments The parliament destitute of all hopes of prevailing retained however courage to resist They attempted in the face of the army to close their treaty with the king and though they had formerly voted his concessions with regard to the church and delinquents to be unsatisfactory they now took into consideration the final resolution with regard to the whole After a violent debate of three days it was carried by a majority of one hundred and twenty nine against eighty three in the house of commons that the king s concessions were a foundation for the houses to proceed upon in the settlement of the kingdom Next day when the commons were to meet Colonel Pride formerly a drayman had environed the house with two regiments and directed by Lord Grey of Groby he seized in the passage forty one members of the Presbyterian party and sent them to a low room which passed by the appellation of hell whence they were afterwards carried to several inns Above one hundred and sixty members more were excluded and none were allowed to enter but the most furious and the most determined of the Independents and these exceeded not the number of fifty or sixty This invasion of the parliament commonly passed under the name of Colonel Pride s Purge so much disposed was the nation to make merry with the dethroning of those members who had violently arrogated the whole authority of government and deprived the king of his legal prerogatives The subsequent proceedings of the parliament if this diminutive assembly deserve that honorable name retain not the least appearance of law equity or freedom They instantly reversed the former vote and declared the king s concessions unsatisfactory They determined that no member absent at this last vote should be received till he subscribed it as agree able to his judgment They renewed their former vote of non addresses And they committed to prison Sir William Waller Sir John Clotworthy the generals Massey Brown Copley and other leaders of the Presbyterians These men by their credit and authority which was then very high had at the commencement of the war supported the parliament and thereby prepared the way for the greatness of the present leaders who at that time were of small account in the nation The secluded members having published a paper containing a narrative of the violence which had been exercised upon them and a protestation that all acts were void which from that time had been transacted in the house of commons the remaining members encountered it with a declaration in which they pronounced it false scandalous seditious and tending to the destruction of the visible and fundamental government of the kingdom These sudden and violent revolutions held the whole nation in terror and astonishment Every man dreaded to be trampled under foot in the contention between those mighty powers which disputed for the sovereignty of the state Many began to withdraw their effects beyond sea foreigners scrupled to give any credit to a people so torn by domestic faction and oppressed by military usurpation even the internal commerce of the kingdom began to stagnate and in order to remedy these growing evils the generals in the name of the army published a declaration in which they expressed their resolution of supporting law and justice The more to quiet the minds of men the council of officers took into consideration a scheme called the agreement of the people being the plan of a republic to be substituted in the place of that government which they so violently pulled in pieces Many parts of this scheme for correcting the inequalities of the representative are plausible had the nation been disposed to receive it or had the army intended to impose it Other parts are too perfect for human nature and savor strongly of that fanatical spirit so prevalent throughout the kingdom The height of all iniquity and fanatical extravagance yet remained the public trial and execution of their sovereign To this period was every measure precipitated by the zealous Independents The parliamentary leaders of that party had intended that the army themselves should execute that daring enterprise and they deemed so irregular and lawless a deed best fitted to such irregular and lawless instruments But the generals were too wise to load themselves singly with the infamy which they knew must attend an action so shocking to the general sentiments of mankind The parliament they were resolved should share with them the reproach of a measure which was thought requisite for the advancement of their common ends of safety and ambition In the house of commons therefore a committee was appointed to bring in a charge against the king On their report a vote passed declaring it treason in a king to levy war against his parliament and appointing a high court of justice to try Charles for this new invented treason This vote was sent up to the house of peers Rush vol viii p thirteen sixty four Whitlocke The house of peers during the civil wars had all along been of small account but it had lately since the king s fall become totally contemptible and very few members would submit to the mortification of attending it It happened that day to be fuller than usual and they were assembled to the number of sixteen Without one dissenting voice and almost without deliberation they instantly rejected the vote of the lower house and adjourned themselves for ten days hoping that this delay would be able to retard the furious career of the commons The commons were not to be stopped by so small an obstacle Having first established a principle which is noble in itself and seems specious but is belied by all history and experience that the people are the origin of all just power they next declared that the commons of England assembled in parliament being chosen by the people and representing them are the supreme authority of the nation and that whatever is enacted and declared to be law by the commons hath the force of law without the consent of king or house of peers The ordinance for the trial of Charles Stuart king of England so they called him was again read and unanimously assented to In proportion to the enormity of the violences and usurpations were augmented the pretences of sanctity among those regicides Should any one have voluntarily proposed said Cromwell in the house to bring the king to punishment I should have regarded him as the greatest traitor but since Providence and necessity have cast us upon it I will pray to God for a blessing on your counsels though I am not prepared to give you any advice on this important occasion Even I myself subjoined he when I was lately offering up petitions for his majesty s restoration felt my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth and considered this preternatural movement as the answer which Heaven having rejected the king had sent to my supplications A woman of Hertfordshire illuminated by prophetical visions desired admittance into the military council and communicated to the officers a revelation which assured them that their measures were consecrated from above and ratified by a heavenly sanction This intelligence gave them great comfort and much confirmed them in their present resolutions Whitlocke p three hundred sixty Colonel Harrison the son of a butcher and the most furious enthusiast in the army was sent with a strong party to conduct the king to London At Windsor Hamilton who was there detained a prisoner was admitted into the king s presence and falling on his knees passionately exclaimed My dear master I have indeed been so to you replied Charles embracing him No further intercourse was allowed between them The king was instantly hurried away Hamilton long followed him with his eyes all suffused in tears and prognosticated that in this short salutation he had given the last adieu to his sovereign and his friend Charles himself was assured that the period of his life was now approaching but notwithstanding all the preparations which were making and the intelligence which he received he could not even yet believe that his enemies really meant to conclude their violences by a public trial and execution A private assassination he every moment looked for and though Harrison assured him that his apprehensions were entirely groundless it was by that catastrophe so frequent with dethroned princes that he expected to terminate his life In appearance as well as in reality the king was now dethroned All the exterior symbols of sovereignty were withdrawn and his attendants had orders to serve him without ceremony At first he was shocked with instances of rudeness and familiarity to which he had been so little accustomed Nothing so contemptible as a despised prince was the reflection which they suggested to him But he soon reconciled his mind to this as he had done to his other calamities All the circumstances of the trial were now adjusted and the high court of justice fully constituted It consisted of one hundred and thirty three persons as named by the commons but there scarcely ever sat above seventy so difficult was it notwithstanding the blindness of prejudice and the allurements of interest to engage men of any name or character in that criminal measure Cromwell Ireton Harrison and the chief officers of the army most of them of mean birth were members together with some of the lower house and some citizens of London The twelve judges were at first appointed in the number but as they had affirmed that it was contrary to all the ideas of English law to try the king for treason by whose authority all accusations for treason must necessarily be conducted their names as well as those of some peers were afterwards struck out Bradshaw a lawyer was chosen president Coke was appointed solicitor for the people of England Dorislaus Steele and Arke were named assistants The court sat in Westminster Hall It is remarkable that in calling over the court when the crier pronounced the name of Fairfax which had been inserted in the number a voice came from one of the spectators and cried He has more wit than to be here When the charge was read against the king In the name of the people of England the same voice exclaimed Not a tenth part of them Axtel the officer who guarded the court giving orders to fire into the box whence these insolent speeches came it was discovered that Lady Fairfax was there and that it was she who had had the courage to utter them She was a person of noble extraction daughter of Horace Lord Vere of Tilbury but being seduced by the violence of the times she had long seconded her husband s zeal against the royal cause and was now as well as he struck with abhorrence at the fatal and unexpected consequence of all his boasted victories The pomp the dignity the ceremony of this transaction corresponded to the greatest conception that is suggested in the annals of human kind the delegates of a great people sitting in judgment upon their supreme magistrate and trying him for his misgovernment and breach of trust The solicitor in the name of the commons represented that Charles Stuart being admitted king of England and intrusted with a limited power yet nevertheless from a wicked design to erect an unlimited and tyrannical government had traitorously and maliciously levied war against the present parliament and the people whom they represented and was therefore impeached as a tyrant traitor murderer and a public and implacable enemy to the commonwealth After the charge was finished the president directed his discourse to the king and told him that the court expected his answer The king though long detained a prisoner and now produced as a criminal sustained by his magnanimous courage the majesty of a monarch With great temper and dignity he declined the authority of the court and refused to submit himself to their jurisdiction He represented that having been engaged in treaty with his two houses of parliament and having finished almost every article he had expected to be brought to his capital in another manner and ere this time to have been restored to his power dignity revenue as well as to his personal liberty that he could not now perceive any appearance of the upper house so essential a member of the constitution and had learned that even the commons whose authority was pretended were subdued by lawless force and were bereaved of their liberty that he himself was their native hereditary king nor was the whole authority of the state though free and united entitled to try him who derived his dignity from the Supreme Majesty of heaven that admitting those extravagant principles which levelled all orders of men the court could plead no power delegated by the people unless the consent of every individual down to the meanest and most ignorant peasant had been previously asked and obtained that he acknowledged without scruple that he had a trust committed to him and one most sacred and inviolable he was intrusted with the liberties of his people and would not now betray them by recognizing a power founded on the most atrocious violence and usurpation that having taken arms and frequently exposed his life in defence of public liberty of the constitution of the fundamental laws of the kingdom he was willing in this last and most solemn scene to seal with his blood those precious rights for which though in vain he had so long contended that those who arrogated a title to sit as his judges were born his subjects and born subjects to those laws which determined that the king can do no wrong that he was not reduced to the necessity of sheltering himself under this general maxim which guards every English monarch even the least deserving but was able by the most satisfactory reasons to justify those measures in which he had been engaged that to the whole world and even to them his pretended judges he was desirous if called upon in another manner to prove the integrity of his conduct and assert the justice of those defensive arms to which unwillingly and unfortunately he had had recourse but that in order to preserve a uniformity of conduct he must at present forego the apology of his innocence lest by ratifying an authority no better founded than that of robbers and pirates he be justly branded as the betrayer instead of being applauded as the martyr of the constitution The president in order to support the majesty of the people and maintain the superiority of his court above the prisoner still inculcated that he must not decline the authority of his judges that they overruled his objections that they were delegated by the people the only source of every lawful power and that kings themselves acted but in trust from that community which had invested this high court of justice with its jurisdiction Even according to those principles which in his present situation he was perhaps obliged to adopt his behavior in general will appear not a little harsh and barbarous but when we consider him as a subject and one too of no high character addressing himself to his unfortunate sovereign his style will be esteemed to the last degree audacious and insolent Illustration one seven hundred six charlesone jpg CHARLES I Three times was Charles produced before the court and as often declined their jurisdiction On the fourth the judges having examined some witnesses by whom it was proved that the king had appeared in arms against the forces commissioned by the parliament they pronounced sentence against him He seemed very anxious at this time to be admitted to a conference with the two houses and it was supposed that he intended to resign the crown to his son but the court refused compliance and considered that request as nothing but a delay of justice It is confessed that the king s behavior during this last scene of his life does honor to his memory and that in all appearances before his judges he never forgot his part either as a prince or as a man Firm and intrepid he maintained in each reply the utmost perspicuity and justness both of thought and expression mild and equable he rose into no passion at that unusual authority which was assumed over him His soul without effort or affectation seemed only to remain in the situation familiar to it and to look down with contempt on all the efforts of human malice and iniquity The soldiers instigated by their superiors were brought though with difficulty to cry aloud for justice Poor souls said the king to one of his attendants for a little money they would do as much against their commanders Some of them were permitted to go the utmost length of brutal insolence and to spit in his face as he was conducted along the passage to the court To excite a sentiment of pity was the only effect which this inhuman insult was able to produce upon him Rush vol viii p fourteen twenty five The people though under the rod of lawless unlimited power could not forbear with the most ardent prayers pouring forth their wishes for his preservation and in his present distress they avowed him by their generous tears for their monarch whom in their misguided fury they had before so violently rejected The king was softened at this moving scene and expressed his gratitude for their dutiful affection One soldier too seized by contagious sympathy demanded from Heaven a blessing on oppressed and fallen majesty his officer overhearing the prayer beat him to the ground in the king s presence The punishment methinks exceeds the offence this was the reflection which Charles formed on that occasion As soon as the intention of trying the king was known in foreign countries so enormous an action was exclaimed against by the general voice of reason and humanity and all men under whatever form of government they were born rejected the example as the utmost effort of undisguised usurpation and the most heinous insult on law and justice The French ambassador by orders from his court interposed in the king s behalf the Dutch employed their good offices the Scots exclaimed and protested against the violence the queen the prince wrote pathetic letters to the parliament All solicitations were found fruitless with men whose resolutions were fixed and irrevocable Four of Charles s friends persons of virtue and dignity Richmond Hertford Southampton Lindesey applied to the commons They represented that they were the king s counsellors and had concurred by their advice in all those measures which were now imputed as crimes to their royal master that in the eye of the law and according to the dictates of common reason they alone were guilty and were alone exposed to censure for every blamable action of the prince and that they now presented themselves in order to save by their own punishment that precious life which it became the commons themselves and every subject with the utmost hazard to protect and defend Such a generous effort tended to their honor but contributed nothing towards the king s safety Warwick p three hundred thirty nine Perinchef p eighty five Lloyde p three hundred nineteen The people remained in that silence and astonishment which all great passions when they have not an opportunity of exerting themselves naturally produce in the human mind The soldiers being incessantly plied with prayers sermons and exhortations were wrought up to a degree of fury and imagined that in the acts of the most extreme disloyalty towards their prince consisted their greatest merit in the eye of Heaven Three days were allowed the king between his sentence and his execution This interval he passed with great tranquillity chiefly in reading and devotion All his family that remained in England were allowed access to him It consisted only of the princess Elizabeth and the duke of Gloucester for the duke of York had made his escape Gloucester was little more than an infant the princess notwithstanding her tender years showed an advanced judgment and the calamities of her family had made a deep impression upon her After many pious consolations and advices the king gave her in charge to tell the queen that during the whole course of his life he had never once even in thought failed in his fidelity towards her and that his conjugal tenderness and his life should have an equal duration To the young duke too he could not forbear giving some advice in order to season his mind with early principles of loyalty and obedience towards his brother who was so soon to be his sovereign Holding him on his knee he said Now they will cut off thy father s head At these words the child looked very steadfastly upon him Mark child what I say they will cut off my head and perhaps make thee a king but mark what I say thou must not be a king as long as thy brothers Charles and James are alive They will cut off thy brothers heads when they can catch them And thy head too they will cut off at last Therefore I charge thee do not be made a king by them The duke sighing replied I will be torn in pieces first So determined an answer from one of such tender years filled the king s eyes with tears of joy and admiration Every night during this interval the king slept as sound as usual though the noise of workmen employed in framing the scaffold and other preparations for his execution continually resounded in his ears Burnet s History of his Own Times Clement Walker s History of Independency The morning of the fatal day he rose early and calling Herbert one of his attendants he bade him employ more than usual care in dressing him and preparing him for so great and joyful a solemnity Bishop Juxon a man endowed with the same mild and steady virtues by which the king himself was so much distinguished assisted him in his devotions and paid the last melancholy duties to his friend and sovereign The street before Whitehall was the place destined for the execution for it was intended by choosing that very place in sight of his own palace to display more evidently the triumph of popular justice over royal majesty When the king came upon the scaffold he found it so surrounded with soldiers that he could not expect to be heard by any of the people he addressed therefore his discourse to the few persons who were about him particularly Colonel Tomlinson to whose care he had lately been committed and upon whom as upon many others his amiable deportment had wrought an entire conversion He justified his own innocence in the late fatal wars and observed that he had not taken arms till after the parliament had enlisted forces nor had he any other object in his warlike operations than to preserve that authority entire which his predecessors had transmitted to him He threw not however the blame upon the parliament but was more inclined to think that ill instruments had interposed and raised in them fears and jealousies with regard to his intentions Though innocent towards his people he acknowledged the equity of his execution in the eyes of his Maker and observed that an unjust sentence which he had suffered to take effect was now punished by an unjust sentence upon himself He forgave all his enemies even the chief instruments of his death but exhorted them and the whole nation to return to the ways of peace by paying obedience to their lawful sovereign his son and successor When he was preparing himself for the block Bishop Juxon called to him There is sir but one stage more which though turbulent and troublesome is yet a very short one Consider it will soon carry you a great way it will carry you from earth to heaven and there you shall find to your great joy the prize to which you hasten a crown of glory I go replied the king from a corruptible to an incorruptible crown where no disturbance can have place At one blow was his head severed from his body A man in a visor performed the office of executioner another in a like disguise held up to the spectators the head streaming with blood and cried aloud This is the head of a traitor It is impossible to describe the grief indignation and astonishment which took place not only among the spectators who were overwhelmed with a flood of sorrow but throughout the whole nation as soon as the report of this fatal execution was conveyed to them Never monarch in the full triumph of success and victory was more dear to his people than his misfortunes and magnanimity his patience and piety had rendered this unhappy prince In proportion to their former delusions which had animated them against him was the violence of their return to duty and affection while each reproached himself either with active disloyalty towards him or with too indolent defence of his oppressed cause On weaker minds the effect of these complicated passions was prodigious Women are said to have cast forth the untimely fruit of their womb others fell into convulsions or sunk into such a melancholy as attended them to their grave nay some unmindful of themselves as though they could not or would not survive their beloved prince it is reported suddenly fell down dead The very pulpits were bedewed with unsuborned tears those pulpits which had formerly thundered out the most violent imprecations and anathemas against him And all men united in their detestation of those hypocritical parricides who by sanctified pretences had so long disguised their treasons and in this last act of iniquity had thrown an indelible stain upon the nation A fresh instance of hypocrisy was displayed the very day of the king s death The generous Fairfax not content with being absent from the trial had used all the interest which he yet retained to prevent the execution of the fatal sentence and had even employed persuasion with his own regiment though none else should follow him to rescue the king from his disloyal murderers Cromwell and Ireton informed of this intention endeavored to convince him that the Lord had rejected the king and they exhorted him to seek by prayer some direction from Heaven on this important occasion but they concealed from him that they had already signed the warrant for the execution Harrison was the person appointed to join in prayer with the unwary general By agreement he prolonged his doleful cant till intelligence arrived that the fatal blow was struck He then rose from his knees and insisted with Fairfax that this event was a miraculous and providential answer which Heaven had sent to their devout supplications Herbert p one hundred thirty five It being remarked that the king the moment before he stretched out his neck to the executioner had said to Juxon with a very earnest accent the single word Remember great mysteries were supposed to be concealed under that expression and the generals vehemently insisted with the prelate that he should inform them of the king s meaning Juxon told them that the king having frequently charged him to inculcate on his son the forgiveness of his murderers had taken this opportunity in the last moment of his life when his commands he supposed would be regarded as sacred and inviolable to reiterate that desire and that his mild spirit thus terminated its present course by an act of benevolence towards his greatest enemies The character of this prince as that of most men if not of all men was mixed but his virtues predominated extremely above his vices or more properly speaking his imperfections for scarce any of his faults rose to that pitch as to merit the appellation of vices To consider him in the most favorable light it may be affirmed that his dignity was free from pride his humanity from weakness his bravery from rashness his temperance from austerity his frugality from avarice all these virtues in him maintained their proper bounds and merited unreserved praise To speak the most harshly of him we may affirm that many of his good qualities were attended with some latent frailty which though seemingly inconsiderable was able when seconded by the extreme malevolence of his fortune to disappoint them of all their influence his beneficent disposition was clouded by a manner not very gracious his virtue was tinctured with superstition his good sense was disfigured by a deference to persons of a capacity inferior to his own and his moderate temper exempted him not from hasty and precipitate resolutions He deserves the epithet of a good rather than of a great man and was more fitted to rule in a regular established government than either to give way to the encroachments of a popular assembly or finally to subdue their pretensions He wanted suppleness and dexterity sufficient for the first measure he was nor endowed with the vigor requisite for the second Had he been born an absolute prince his humanity and good sense had rendered his reign happy and his memory precious had the limitations on prerogative been in his time quite fixed and certain his integrity had made him regard as sacred the boundaries of the constitution Unhappily his fate threw him into a period when the precedents of many former reigns savored strongly of arbitrary power and the genius of the people ran violently towards liberty And if his political prudence was not sufficient to extricate him from so perilous a situation he may be excused since even after the event when it is commonly easy to correct all errors one is at a loss to determine what conduct in his circumstances could have maintained the authority of the crown and preserved the peace of the nation Exposed without revenue without arms to the assault of furious implacable and bigoted factions it was never permitted him but with the most fatal consequences to commit the smallest mistake a condition too rigorous to be imposed on the greatest human capacity Some historians have rashly questioned the good faith of this prince but for this reproach the most malignant scrutiny of his conduct which in every circumstance is now thoroughly known affords not any reasonable foundation On the contrary if we consider the extreme difficulties to which he was so frequently reduced and compare the sincerity of his professions and declarations we shall avow that probity and honor ought justly to be numbered among his most shining qualities In every treaty those concessions which he thought he could not in conscience maintain he never could by any motive or persuasion be induced to make And though some violations of the petition of right may perhaps be imputed to him these are more to be ascribed to the necessity of his situation and to the lofty ideas of royal prerogative which from former established precedents he had imbibed than to any failure in the integrity of his principles twenty See note T at the end of the volume This prince was of a comely presence of a sweet but melancholy aspect His face was regular handsome and well complexioned his body strong healthy and justly proportioned and being of a middle stature he was capable of enduring the greatest fatigues He excelled in horsemanship and other exercises and he possessed all the exterior as well as many of the essential qualities which form an accomplished prince The tragical death of Charles begat a question whether the people in any case were entitled to judge and to punish their sovereign and most men regarding chiefly the atrocious usurpation of the pretended judges and the merit of the virtuous prince who suffered were inclined to condemn the republican principle as highly seditious and extravagant but there still were a few who abstracting from the particular circumstances of this case were able to consider the question in general and were inclined to moderate not contradict the prevailing sentiment Such might have been their reasoning If ever on any occasion it were laudable to conceal truth from the populace it must be confessed that the doctrine of resistance affords such an example and that all speculative reasoners ought to observe with regard to this principle the same cautious silence which the laws in every species of government have ever prescribed to themselves Government is instituted in order to restrain the fury and injustice of the people and being always founded on opinion not on force it is dangerous to weaken by these speculations the reverence which the multitude owe to authority and to instruct them beforehand that the case can ever happen when they may be freed from their duty of allegiance Or should it be found impossible to restrain the license of human disquisitions it must be acknowledged that the doctrine of obedience ought alone to be inculcated and that the exceptions which are rare ought seldom or never to be mentioned in popular reasonings and discourses Nor is there any danger that mankind by this prudent reserve should universally degenerate into a state of abject servitude When the exception really occurs even though it be not previously expected and descanted on it must from its very nature be so obvious and undisputed as to remove all doubt and overpower the restraint however great imposed by teaching the general doctrine of obedience But between resisting a prince and dethroning him there is a wide interval and the abuses of power which can warrant the latter violence are greater and more enormous than those which will justify the former History however supplies us with examples even of this kind and the reality of the supposition though for the future it ought ever to be little looked for must by all candid inquirers be acknowledged in the past But between dethroning a prince and punishing him there is another very wide interval and it were not strange if even men of the most enlarged thought should question whether human nature could ever in any monarch reach that height of depravity as to warrant in revolted subjects this last act of extraordinary jurisdiction That illusion if it be an illusion which teaches us to pay a sacred regard to the persona of princes is so salutary that to dissipate it by the formal trial and punishment of a sovereign will have more pernicious effects upon the people than the example of justice can be supposed to have a beneficial influence upon princes by checking their career of tyranny It is dangerous also by these examples to reduce princes to despair or bring matters to such extremities against persons endowed with great power as to leave them no resource but in the most violent and most sanguinary counsels This general position being established it must however be observed that no reader almost of any party or principle was ever shocked when he read in ancient history that the Roman senate voted Nero their absolute sovereign to be a public enemy and even without trial condemned him to the severest and most ignominious punishment a punishment from which the meanest Roman citizen was by the laws exempted The crimes of that bloody tyrant are so enormous that they break through all rules and extort a confession that such a dethroned prince is no longer superior to his people and can no longer plead in his own defence laws which were established for conducting the ordinary course of administration But when we pass from the case of Nero to that of Charles the great disproportion or rather total contrariety of character immediately strikes us and we stand astonished that among a civilized people so much virtue could ever meet with so fatal a catastrophe History the great mistress of wisdom furnishes examples of all kinds and every prudential as well as moral precept may be authorized by those events which her enlarged mirror is able to present to us From the memorable revolutions which passed in England during this period we may naturally deduce the same useful lesson which Charles himself in his later years inferred that it is dangerous for princes even from the appearance of necessity to assume more authority than the laws have allowed them But it must be confessed that these events furnish us with another instruction no less natural and no less useful concerning the madness of the people the furies of fanaticism and the danger of mercenary armies In order to close this part of British history it is also necessary to relate the dissolution of the monarchy in England that event soon followed upon the death of the monarch When the peers met on the day appointed in their adjournment they entered upon business and sent down some votes to the commons of which the latter deigned not to take the least notice In a few days the lower house passed a vote that they would make no more addresses to the house of peers nor receive any front them and that that house was useless and dangerous and was therefore to be abolished A like vote passed with regard to the monarchy and it is remarkable that Martin a zealous republican in the debate on this question confessed that if they desired a king the last was as proper as any gentleman in England The commons ordered a new great seal to be engraved on which that assembly was represented with this legend On the first year of freedom by God s blessing restored sixteen forty eight The forms of all public business were changed from the king s name to that of the keepers of the liberties of England And it was declared high treason to proclaim or any otherwise acknowledge Charles Stuart commonly called prince of Wales Walker s History of Independency part ii The court of king s bench was called

The commons intended it is said to bind the princess Elizabeth apprentice to a button maker the duke of Gloucester was to be taught some other mechanical employment But the former soon died of grief as is supposed for her father s tragical end the latter was by Cromwell sent beyond sea The king s statue in the exchange was thrown down and on the pedestal these words were inscribed Exit tyrannus regum ultimus The tyrant is gone the last of the kings Duke Hamilton was tried by a new high court of justice as earl of Cambridge in England and condemned for treason This sentence which was certainly hard but which ought to save his memory from all imputations of treachery to his master was executed on a scaffold erected before Westminster Hall Lord Capel underwent the same fate Both these noblemen had escaped from prison but were afterwards discovered and taken To all the solicitations of their friends for pardon the generals and parliamentary leaders still replied that it was certainly the intention of Providence they should suffer since it had permitted them to fall into the hands of their enemies after they had once recovered their liberty The earl of Holland lost his life by a like sentence Though of a polite and courtly behavior he died lamented by no party His ingratitude to the king and his frequent changing of sides were regarded as great stains on his memory The earl of Norwich and Sir John Owen being condemned by the same court were pardoned by the commons The king left six children three males Charles born in sixteen thirty James duke of York born in

published in the king s name a few days after his execution It seems almost impossible in the controverted parts of history to say any thing which will satisfy the zealots of both parties but with regard to the genuineness of that production it is not easy for an historian to fix any opinion which will be entirely to his own satisfaction The proofs brought to evince that this work is or is not the king s are so convincing that if an impartial reader peruse any one side apart he will think it impossible that arguments could be produced sufficient to counterbalance so strong an evidence and when he compares both sides he will be some time at a loss to fix any determination Should an absolute suspense of judgment be found difficult or disagreeable in so interesting a question I must confess that I much incline to give the preference to the arguments of the royalists The testimonies which prove that performance to be the king s are more numerous certain and direct than those on the other side This is the case even if we consider the external evidence but when we weigh the internal derived from the style and composition there is no manner of comparison These meditations resemble in elegance purity neatness and simplicity the genius of those performances which we know with certainty to have flowed from the royal pen but are so unlike the bombast perplexed rhetorical and corrupt style of doctor Gauden to whom they are ascribed that no human testimony seems sufficient to convince us that he was the author Yet all the evidences which would rob the king of that honor tend to prove that doctor Gauden had the merit of writing so fine a performance and the infamy of imposing it on the world for the king s See on the one hand Toland s Amyntor and on the other Wagataffe s Vindication of the Royal Martyr with Young s Addition We may remark that Lord Clarendon s total silence with regard to this subject in so full of history composed in vindication of the king s measures and character forms a presumption on Toland s side and a presumption of which that author was ignorant the works of the noble historian not being then published Bishop Burnet s testimony too must be allowed of some weight against the Icon It is not easy to conceive the general compassion excited towards the king by the publishing at so critical a juncture a work so full of piety meekness and humanity Many have not scrupled to ascribe to that book the subsequent restoration of the royal family Milton compares its effects to those which were wrought on the tumultuous Romans by Anthony s reading to them the will of Caesar The Icon passed through fifty editions in a twelvemonth and independent of the great interest taken in it by the nation as the supposed production of their murdered sovereign it must be acknowledged the best prose composition which at the time of its publication was to be found in the English language CHAPTER LX THE COMMONWEALTH CONTEMPORARY MONARCHS EMP of GERM K OF FRANCE K or SPAIN Ferdinand III sixteen fifty eight Lewis XIII Philip IV The confusions which overspread England after the murder of Charles I proceeded as well

none	none	 In order to convey a just notion of Irish affairs it will be necessary to look backwards some years 
8245-274392-0035	train-other-500	and to relate briefly those transactions which had passed during the memorable revolutions in England When the late king agreed to that cessation of arms with the Popish rebels which was become so requisite
8245-274392-0036	train-other-500	as well for the security of the Irish Protestants as for promoting his interests in England the parliament in order to blacken his conduct reproached him with favoring that odious rebellion

8245-274392-0037	train-other-500	They even went so far as to declare it entirely null and invalid because finished without their consent and in this declaration the Scots in Ulster and the earl of Inchiquin a nobleman of great authority in Munster
8245-274392-0038	train-other-500	professed to adhere By their means the war was still kept alive but as the dangerous distractions in England hindered the parliament from sending any considerable assistance to their allies in Ireland the marquis of Ormond lord lieutenant
8245-274392-0039	train-other-500	being a native of Ireland and a person endowed with great prudence and virtue formed a scheme for composing the disorders of his country and for engaging the rebel Irish to support the cause of his royal master
8245-274392-0040	train-other-500	There were many circumstances which strongly invited the natives of Ireland to embrace the king s party
none	none	 The maxims of that prince had always led him to give a reasonable indulgence to the Catholics throughout all his dominions and one principal ground of that enmity which the Puritans professed against him was this tacit toleration The parliament on the contrary even when unprovoked had ever menaced the Papists with the most rigid restraint if not a total extirpation and immediately after the commencement of the Irish rebellion they put to sale all the estates of the rebels and had engaged the public faith for transferring them to the adventurers who had already advanced money upon that security The success therefore which the arms of the parliament met with at Naseby struck a just terror into the Irish and engaged the council of Kilkenny composed of deputies from all the Catholic counties and cities to conclude a peace with the marquis of Ormond sixteen forty three sixteen forty six They professed to return to their duty and allegiance engaged to furnish ten thousand men for the support of the king s authority in England and were content with stipulating in return indemnity for their rebellion and toleration of their religion Ormond not doubting but a peace so advantageous and even necessary to the Irish would be strictly observed advanced with a small body of troops to Kilkenny in order to concert measures for common defence with his new allies The pope had sent over to Ireland a nuncio Rinuccini an Italian and this man whose commission empowered him to direct the spiritual concerns of the Irish was emboldened by their ignorance and bigotry to assume the chief authority in the civil government Foreseeing that a general submission to the lord lieutenant would put an end to his own influence he conspired with Owen O Neal who commanded the native Irish in Ulster and who bore a great jealousy to Preston the general chiefly trusted by the council of Kilkenny By concert these two malecontents secretly drew forces together and were ready to fall on Ormond who remained in security trusting to the pacification so lately concluded with the rebels He received intelligence of their treachery made his retreat with celerity and conduct and sheltered his small army in Dublin and the other fortified towns which still remained in the hands of the Protestants The nuncio full of arrogance levity and ambition was not contented with this violation of treaty He summoned an assembly of the clergy at Waterford and engaged them to declare against that pacification which the civil council had concluded with their sovereign He even thundered out a sentence of excommunication against all who should adhere to a peace so prejudicial as he pretended to the Catholic religion and the deluded Irish terrified with his spiritual menaces ranged themselves every where on his side and submitted to his authority Without scruple he carried on war against the lord lieutenant and threatened with a siege the Protestant garrisons which were all of them very ill provided for defence Meanwhile the unfortunate king was necessitated to take shelter in the Scottish army and being there reduced to close confinement and secluded from all commerce with his friends despaired that his authority or even his liberty would ever be restored to him He sent orders to Ormond if he could not defend himself rather to submit to the English than to the Irish rebels and accordingly the lord lieutenant being reduced to extremities delivered up Dublin Tredah Dundalk and other garrisons to Colonel Michael Jones who took possession of them in the name of the English parliament Ormond himself went over to England was admitted into the king s presence received a grateful acknowledgment for his past services and during some time lived in tranquillity near London But being banished with the other royalists to a distance from that city and seeing every event turn out unfortunately for his royal master and threaten him with a catastrophe still more direful he thought proper to retire into France where he joined the queen and the prince of Wales In Ireland during these transactions the authority of the nuncio prevailed without control among all the Catholics and that prelate by his indiscretion and insolence soon made them repent of the power with which they had intrusted him Prudent men likewise were sensible of the total destruction which was hanging over the nation from the English parliament and saw no resource or safety but in giving support to the declining authority of the king The earl of Clanricarde a nobleman of an ancient family a person too of merit who had ever preserved his loyalty was sensible of the ruin which threatened his countrymen and was resolved if possible to prevent it He secretly formed a combination among the Catholics he entered into a correspondence with Inchiquin who preserved great authority over the Protestants in Munster he attacked the nuncio whom he chased out of the island and he sent to Paris a deputation inviting the lord lieutenant to return and take possession of his government Ormond on his arrival in Ireland found the kingdom divided into many factions among which either open war or secret enmity prevailed The authority of the English parliament was established in Dublin and the other towns which he himself had delivered into their hands O Neal maintained his credit in Ulster and having entered into a secret correspondence with the parliamentary generals was more intent on schemes for his own personal safety than anxious for the preservation of his country or religion The other Irish divided between their clergy who were averse to Ormond and their nobility who were attached to him were very uncertain in their motions and feeble in their measures The Scots in the north enraged as well as their other countrymen against the usurpations of the sectarian army professed their adherence to the king but were still hindered by many prejudices from entering into a cordial union with his lieutenant All these distracted councils and contrary humors checked the progress of Ormond and enabled the parliamentary forces in Ireland to maintain their ground against him The republican faction meanwhile in England employed in subduing the revolted royalists in reducing the parliament to subjection in the trial condemnation and execution of their sovereign totally neglected the supplying of Ireland and allowed Jones and the forces in Dublin to remain in the utmost weakness and necessity The lord lieutenant though surrounded with difficulties neglected not the favorable opportunity of promoting the royal cause Having at last assembled an army of sixteen thousand men he advanced upon the parliamentary garrisons Dundalk where Monk commanded was delivered up by the troops who mutinied against their governor Tredah Neury and other forts were taken Dublin was threatened with a siege and the affairs of the lieutenant appeared in so prosperous a condition that the young king entertained thoughts of coming in person into Ireland When the English commonwealth was brought to some tolerable settlement men began to cast their eyes towards the neighboring island During the contest of the two parties the government of Ireland had remained a great object of intrigue and the Presbyterians endeavored to obtain the lieutenancy for Waller the Independents for Lambert After the execution of the king Cromwell himself began to aspire to a command where so much glory he saw might be won and so much authority acquired In his absence he took care to have his name proposed to the council of state and both friends and enemies concurred immediately to vote him into that important office the former suspected that the matter had not been proposed merely by chance without his own concurrence the latter desired to remove him to a distance and hoped during his absence to gain the ascendant over Fairfax whom he had so long blinded by his hypocritical professions Cromwell himself when informed of his election feigned surprise and pretended at first to hesitate with regard to the acceptance of the command And Lambert either deceived by his dissimulation or in his turn feigning to be deceived still continued notwithstanding this disappointment his friendship and connections with Cromwell The new lieutenant immediately applied himself with his wonted vigilance to make preparations for his expedition Many disorders in England it behoved him previously to compose All places were full of danger and inquietude Though men astonished with the successes of the army remained in seeming tranquillity symptoms of the greatest discontent every where appeared The English long accustomed to a mild administration and unacquainted with dissimulation could not conform their speech and countenance to the present necessity or pretend attachment to a form of government which they generally regarded with such violent abhorrence It was requisite to change the magistracy of London and to degrade as well as punish the mayor and some of the aldermen before the proclamation for the abolition of monarchy could be published in the city An engagement being framed to support the commonwealth without king or house of peers the army was with some difficulty brought to subscribe it but though it was imposed upon the rest of the nation under severe penalties no less than putting all who refused out of the protection of law such obstinate reluctance was observed in the people that even the imperious parliament was obliged to desist from it The spirit of fanaticism by which that assembly had at first been strongly supported was now turned in a great measure against them The pulpits being chiefly filled with Presbyterians or disguised royalists and having long been the scene of news and politics could by no penalties be restrained from declarations unfavorable to the established government Numberless were the extravagancies which broke out among the people Everard a disbanded soldier having preached that the time was now come when the community of goods would be renewed among Christians led out his followers to take possession of the land and being carried before the general he refused to salute him because he was but his fellow creature What seemed more dangerous the army itself was infected with like humors twenty one Whitlocke See note U at the end of the volume Though the levellers had for a time been suppressed by the audacious spirit of Cromwell they still continued to propagate

8245-274393-0001	train-other-500	They framed a remonstrance and sent five agitators to present it to the general and council of war

8245-274393-0002	train-other-500	One Lockier having carried his sedition further was sentenced to death but this punishment was so far from quelling the mutinous spirit that above a thousand of his companions showed their adherence to him by attending his funeral

8245-274393-0005	train-other-500	And this tumultuous spirit though it still lurked in the army and broke out from time to time seemed for the present to be suppressed Petitions

8245-274393-0006	train-other-500	were presented to the parliament by Lieutenant Colonel Lilburn the person who for dispersing seditious libels had formerly been treated with such severity by the star chamber His liberty was at this time as ill relished by the parliament
8245-274393-0007	train-other-500	and he was thrown into prison as a promoter of sedition and disorder in the commonwealth The women applied by petition for his release but were now desired to mind their household affairs and leave the government of the state to the men
8245-274393-0008	train-other-500	From all quarters the parliament was harassed with petitions of a very free nature which strongly spoke the sense of the nation and proved how ardently all men longed for the restoration of their laws and liberties
8245-274393-0009	train-other-500	Even in a feast which the city gave to the parliament and council of state it was deemed a requisite precaution if we may credit Walker and Dugdale
none	none	 to swear all the cooks that they would serve nothing but wholesome food to them The parliament judged it necessary to enlarge the laws of high treason beyond those narrow bounds within which they had been confined during the monarchy They even comprehended verbal offences nay intentions though they had never appeared in any overt act against the state To affirm the present government to be a usurpation to assert that the parliament or council of state were tyrannical or illegal to endeavor subverting their authority or stirring up sedition against them these offences were declared to be high treason The power of imprisonment of which the petition of right had bereaved the king it was now found necessary to restore to the council of state and all the jails in England were filled with men whom the jealousies and fears of the ruling party had represented as dangerous The taxes continued by the new government and which being unusual were esteemed heavy increased the general ill will under which it labored Besides the customs and excise ninety thousand pounds a month were levied on land for the subsistence of the army The sequestrations and compositions of the royalists the sale of the crown lands and of the dean and chapter lands though they yielded great sums were not sufficient to support the vast expenses and as was suspected the great depredations of the parliament and of their creatures History of Independency part ii Parl History vol xix p one hundred thirty six one hundred seventy six Amidst all these difficulties and disturbances the steady mind of Cromwell without confusion or embarrassment still pursued its purpose While he was collecting an army of twelve thousand men in the west of England he sent to Ireland under Reynolds and Venables a reenforcement of four thousand horse and foot in order to strengthen Jones and enable him to defend himself against the marquis of Ormond who lay at Finglass and was making preparations for the attack of Dublin Inchiquin who had now made a treaty with the king s lieutenant having with a separate body taken Tredah and Dundalk gave a defeat to Offarrell who served under O Neal and to young Coot who commanded some parliamentary forces After he had joined his troops to the main army with whom for some time he remained united Ormond passed the River Liffy and took post at Rathmines two miles from Dublin with a view of commencing the siege of that city In order to cut off all further supply from Jones he had begun the reparation of an old fort which lay at the gates of Dublin and being exhausted with continual fatigue for some days he had retired to rest after leaving orders to keep his forces under arms He was suddenly awaked with the noise of firing and starting from his bed saw every thing already in tumult and confusion Jones an excellent officer formerly a lawyer had sallied out with the reenforcement newly arrived and attacking the party employed in repairing the fort he totally routed them pursued the advantage and fell in with the army which had neglected Ormond s orders These he soon threw into disorder put them to flight in spite of all the efforts of the lord lieutenant chased them off the field seized all their tents baggage ammunition and returned victorious to Dublin after killing a thousand men and taking above two thousand prisoners Parl Hist vol xix p one hundred sixty five This loss which threw some blemish on the military character of Ormond was irreparable to the royal cause That numerous army which with so much pains and difficulty the lord lieutenant had been collecting for more than a year was dispersed in a moment Cromwell soon after arrived in Dublin where he was welcomed with shouts and rejoicings He hastened to Tredah That town was well fortified Ormond had thrown into it a good garrison of three thousand men under Sir Arthur Aston an officer of reputation He expected that Tredah lying in the neighborhood of Dublin 
8245-274393-0010	train-other-500	would first be attempted by Cromwell and he was desirous to employ the enemy some time in that siege while he himself should repair his broken forces But Cromwell knew the importance of despatch Having made a breach he ordered a general assault

8245-274393-0011	train-other-500	and himself along with Ireton led on his men All opposition was overborne by the furious valor of the troops The town was taken sword in hand and orders being issued to give no quarter a cruel slaughter was made of the garrison
8245-274393-0012	train-other-500	Even a few who were saved by the soldiers satiated with blood were next day miserably butchered by orders from the general One person alone of the garrison escaped to be a messenger of this universal havoc and destruction
8245-274393-0013	train-other-500	Cromwell pretended to retaliate by this severe execution the cruelty of the Irish massacre but he well knew that almost the whole garrison was English and his justice was only a barbarous policy in order to terrify all other garrisons from resistance
8245-274393-0014	train-other-500	His policy however had the desired effect Having led the army without delay to Wexford he began to batter the town The garrison after a slight defence offered to capitulate but before they obtained a cessation they imprudently neglected their guards

none	none	 came to him as deputy from the committee of estates in Scotland and informed him of the conditions to which he must necessarily submit before he could be admitted to the exercise of his authority Conditions more severe were never imposed by subjects upon their sovereign but as the affairs of Ireland began to decline and the king found it no longer safe to venture himself in that island 
8245-274393-0037	train-other-500	he gave a civil answer to Winram and desired commissioners to meet him at Breda in order to enter into a treaty with regard to these conditions The earls of Cassilis and Lothian Lord Burley the laird of Liberton and other commissioners arrived at Breda
8245-274393-0038	train-other-500	but without any power of treating the king must submit without reserve to the terms imposed upon him The terms were that he should issue a proclamation banishing from court all excommunicated persons that is all those who

8245-274393-0058	train-other-500	and the king s honor lay rather in showing some early symptoms of courage and activity than in choosing strictly a party among theological controversies with which it might be supposed he was as yet very little acquainted These arguments

8245-274393-0059	train-other-500	the king s brother in law who both of them thought it ridiculous to refuse a kingdom merely from regard to Episcopacy had great influence on Charles But what chiefly determined him to comply was the account brought him of the fate of Montrose who
8245-274393-0060	train-other-500	with all the circumstances of rage and contumely had been put to death by his zealous countrymen Though in this instance the king saw more evidently the furious spirit by which the Scots were actuated
none	none	 he had now no further resource and was obliged to grant whatever was demanded of him Montrose 
8245-274393-0061	train-other-500	having laid down his arms at the command of the late king had retired into France
none	none	 and contrary to his natural disposition had lived for some time inactive at Paris He there became acquainted with the famous Cardinal de Retz and that penetrating judge celebrates him in his memoirs as one of those heroes of whom there are no longer any remains in the world and who are only to be met with in Plutarch Desirous of improving his martial genius he took a journey to Germany was caressed by the emperor received the rank of mareschal and proposed to levy a regiment for the imperial service While employed for that purpose in the Low Countries he heard of the tragical death of the king and at the same time received from his young master a renewal of his commission of captain general in Scotland His ardent and daring spirit needed but this authority to put him in action He gathered followers in Holland and the north of Germany whom his great reputation allured to him The king of Denmark and duke of Holstein sent him some small supply of money the queen of Sweden furnished him with arms the prince of Orange with ships and Montrose hastening his enterprise lest the king s agreement with the Scots should make him revoke his commission set out for the Orkneys with about five hundred men most of them Germans Burnet Clarendon These were all the preparations which he could make against a kingdom settled in domestic peace supported by a disciplined army fully apprised of his enterprise and prepared against him Some of his retainers having told him of a prophecy that to him and him alone it was reserved to restore the king s authority in all his dominions he lent a willing ear to suggestions which however ill grounded or improbable were so conformable to his own daring character He armed several of the inhabitants of the Orkneys though an unwarlike people and carried them over with him to Caithness hoping that the general affection to the king s service and the fame of his former exploits would make the Highlanders flock to his standard But all men were now harassed and fatigued with wars and disorders many of those who formerly adhered to him had been severely punished by the Covenanters and no prospect of success was entertained in opposition to so great a force as was drawn together against him But however weak Montrose s army the memory of past events struck a great terror into the committee of estates They immediately ordered Lesley and Holborne to march against him with an army of four thousand men Strahan was sent before with a body of cavalry to check his progress He fell unexpectedly on Montrose who had no horse to bring him intelligence The royalists were put to flight all of them either killed or taken prisoners and Montrose himself having put on the disguise of a peasant was perfidiously delivered into the hands of his enemies by a friend to whom he had intrusted his person All the insolence which success can produce in ungenerous minds was exercised by the Covenanters against Montrose whom they so much hated and so much dreaded Theological antipathy further increased their indignities towards a person whom they regarded as impious on account of the excommunication which had been pronounced against him Lesley led him about for several days in the same low habit under which he had disguised himself The vulgar wherever he passed were instigated to reproach and vilify him When he came to Edinburgh every circumstance of elaborate rage and insult was put in practice by order of the parliament At the gate of the city he was met by the magistrates and put into a new cart purposely made with a high chair or bench where he wus placed that the people might have a full view of him He was bound with a cord drawn over his breast and shoulders and fastened through holes made in the cart The hangman then took off the hat of the noble prisoner and rode himself before the cart in his livery and with his bonnet on the other officers who were taken prisoners with the marquis walking two and two before them The populace more generous and humane when they saw so mighty a change of fortune in this great man so lately their dread and terror into whose hands the magistrates a few years before had delivered on their knees the keys of the city were struck with compassion and viewed him with silent tears and admiration The preachers next Sunday exclaimed against this movement of rebel nature as they termed it and reproached the people with their profane tenderness towards the capital enemy of piety and religion When he was carried before the parliament which was then sitting Loudon the chancellor in a violent declamation reproached him with the breach of the national covenant which he had subscribed his rebellion against God the king and the kingdom and the many horrible murders treasons and impieties for which he was now to be brought to condign punishment Montrose in his answer maintained the same superiority above his enemies to which by his fame and great actions as well as by the consciousness of a good cause he was justly entitled He told the parliament that since the king as he was informed had so far avowed their authority as to enter into a treaty with them he now appeared uncovered before their tribunal a respect which while they stood in open defiance to their sovereign they would in vain have required of him that he acknowledged with infinite shame and remorse the errors of his early conduct when their plausible pretences had seduced him to tread with them the paths of rebellion and bear arms against his prince and country that his following services he hoped had sufficiently testified his repentance and his death would now atone for that guilt the only one with which he could justly reproach himself That in all his warlike enterprises he was warranted by that commission which he had received from his and their master against whose lawful authority they had erected their standard that to venture his life for his sovereign was the least part of his merit he had even thrown down his arms in obedience to the sacred commands of the king and had resigned to them the victory which in defiance of all their efforts he was still enabled to dispute with them that no blood had ever been shed by him but in the field of battle and many persons were now in his eye many now dared to pronounce sentence of death upon him whose life forfeited by the laws of war he had formerly saved from the fury of the soldiers that he was sorry to find no better testimony of their return to allegiance than the murder of so faithful a subject in whose death the king s commission must be at once so highly injured and affronted that as to himself they had in vain endeavored to vilify and degrade him by all their studied indignities the justice of his cause he knew would ennoble any fortune nor had he other affliction than to see the authority of his prince with which he was invested treated with so much ignominy and that he now joyfully followed by a like unjust sentence his late sovereign and should be happy if in his future destiny he could follow him to the same blissful mansions where his piety and humane virtues had already without doubt secured him an eternal recompense Montrose s sentence was next pronounced against him That he James Graham for this was the only name they vouchsafed to give him should next day be carried to Edinburgh Cross and there be hanged on a gibbet thirty feet high for the space of three hours then be taken down his head he cut off upon a scaffold and affixed to the prison his legs and arms be stuck up on the four chief towns of the kingdom his body be buried in the place appropriated for common malefactors except the church upon his repentance should take off his excommunication The clergy hoping that the terrors of immediate death had now given them an advantage over their enemy flocked about him and insulted over his fallen fortunes They pronounced his damnation and assured him that the judgment which he was so soon to suffer would prove but an easy prologue to that which he must undergo hereafter They next offered to pray with him but he was too well acquainted with those forms of imprecation which they called prayers Lord vouchsafe yet to touch the obdurate heart of this proud incorrigible sinner this wicked perjured traitorous and profane person who refuses to hearken to the voice of thy church Such were the petitions which he expected they would according to custom offer up for him He told them that they were a miserably deluded and deluding people and would shortly bring their country under the most insupportable servitude to which any nation had ever been reduced For my part added he I am much prouder to have my head affixed to the place where it is sentenced to stand than to have my picture hang in the king s bed chamber So far from being sorry that my quarters are to be sent to four cities of the kingdom I wish I had limbs enow to be dispersed into all the cities of Christendom there to remain as testimonies in favor of the cause for which I suffer This sentiment that very evening while in prison he threw into verse The poem remains a single monument of his heroic spirit and no despicable proof of his poetical genius Now was led forth amidst the insults of his enemies and the tears of the people this man of illustrious birth and of the greatest renown in the nation to suffer for his adhering to the laws of his country and the rights of his sovereign the ignominious death destined to the meanest malefactor Every attempt which the insolence of the governing party had made to subdue his spirit had hitherto proved fruitless they made yet one effort more in this last and melancholy scene when all enmity arising from motives merely human is commonly softened and disarmed The executioner brought that book which had been published in elegant Latin of his great military actions and tied it with a cord about his neck Montrose smiled at this new instance of their malice He thanked them however for their officious zeal and said that he bore this testimony of his bravery and loyalty with more pride than he had ever worn the garter Having asked whether they had any more indignities to put upon him and renewing some devout ejaculations he patiently endured the last act of the executioner Thus perished in the thirty eighth year of his age the gallant marquis of Montrose the man whose military genius both by valor and conduct had shone forth beyond any which during these civil disorders had appeared in the three kingdoms The finer arts too he had in his youth successfully cultivated and whatever was sublime elegant or noble touched his great soul Nor was he insensible to the pleasures either of society or of love Something however of the vast and unbounded characterized his actions and deportment and it was merely by an heroic effort of duty that he brought his mind impatient of superiority and even of equality to pay such unlimited submission to the will of his sovereign The vengeance of the Covenanters was not satisfied with Montrose s execution Urrey whose inconstancy now led him to take part with the king suffered about the same time Spotiswood of Daersie a youth of eighteen Sir Francis Hay of Dalgetie and Colonel Sibbald all of them of birth and character underwent a like fate These were taken prisoners with Montrose The marquis of Huntley about a year before had also fallen a victim to the severity of the Covenanters The past scene displays in a full light the barbarity of this theological faction the sequel will sufficiently display their absurdity The king in consequence of his agreement with the commissioners of Scotland set sail for that country and being escorted by seven Dutch ships of war who were sent to guard the herring fishery he arrived in the Frith of Cromarty Before he was permitted to land he was required to sign the covenant and many sermons and lectures were made him exhorting him to persevere in that holy confederacy Hamilton Lauderdale Dumfermling and other noblemen of that party whom they called engagers were immediately separated from him and obliged to retire to their houses where they lived in a private manner without trust or authority None of his English friends who had served his father were allowed to remain in the kingdom The king himself found that he was considered as a mere pageant of state and that the few remains of royalty which he possessed served only to draw on him the greater indignities One of the quarters of Montrose his faithful servant who had borne his commission had been sent to Aberdeen and was still allowed to hang over the gates when he passed by that place Sir Edward Walker s Historical Discourses p one hundred fifty nine Sir Edward Walker s Historical Discourses p one hundred sixty The general assembly and afterwards the committee of estates and the army who were entirely governed by the assembly set forth a public declaration in which they protested that they did not espouse any malignant quarrel or party but fought merely on their former grounds or principles that they disclaimed all the sins and guilt of the king and of his house nor would they own him or his interest otherwise than with a subordination to God and so far as he owned and prosecuted the cause of God and acknowledged the sins of his house and of his former ways The king lying entirely at mercy and having no assurance of life or liberty further than was agreeable to the fancy of these austere zealots was constrained to embrace a measure which nothing but the necessity of his affairs and his great youth and inexperience could excuse He issued a declaration such as they required of him He there gave thanks for the merciful dispensations of Providence by which he was recovered from the snare of evil counsel had attained a full persuasion of the righteousness of the covenant and was induced to cast himself and his interests wholly upon God He desired to be deeply humbled and afflicted in spirit because of his father s following wicked measures opposing the covenant and the work of reformation and shedding the blood of God s people throughout all his dominions He lamented the idolatry of his mother and the toleration of it in his father s house a matter of great offence he said to all the Protestant churches and a great provocation to him who is a jealous God visiting the sins of the father upon the children He professed that he would have no enemies but the enemies of the covenant and that he detested all Popery superstition prelacy heresy schism and profaneness and was resolved not to tolerate much less to countenance any of them in any of his dominions He declared that he should never love or favor those who had so little conscience as to follow his interests in preference to the gospel and the kingdom of Jesus Christ And he expressed his hope that whatever ill success his former guilt might have drawn upon his cause yet now having obtained mercy to be on God s side and to acknowledge his own cause subordinate to that of God divine providence would crown his arms with victory Sir Edward Walker s Historical Discourses p one hundred sixty six one hundred sixty seven Sir Edward Walker s Historical Discourses p one hundred seventy Still the Covenanters and the clergy were diffident of the king s sincerity The facility which he discovered in yielding whatever was required of him made them suspect that he regarded all his concessions merely as ridiculous farces to which he must of necessity submit They had another trial prepared for him Instead of the solemnity of his coronation which was delayed they were resolved that he should pass through a public humiliation and do penance before the whole people They sent him twelve articles of repentance which he was to acknowledge and the king had agreed that he would submit to this indignity The various transgressions of his father and grandfather together with the idolatry of his mother are again enumerated and aggravated in these articles and further declarations were insisted on that he sought the restoration of his rights for the sole advancement of religion and in subordination to the kingdom of Christ In short having exalted the altar above the throne and brought royalty under their feet the clergy were resolved to trample on it and vilify it by every instance of contumely which their present influence enabled them to impose upon their unhappy prince Charles in the mean time found his authority entirely annihilated as well as his character degraded He was consulted in no public measure He was not called to assist at any councils His favor was sufficient to discredit any pretender to office or advancement All efforts which he made to unite the opposite parties increased the suspicion which the Covenanters had entertained of him as if he were not entirely their own Argyle who by subtleties and compliances partly led and partly was governed by this wild faction still turned a deaf ear to all advances which the king made to enter into confidence with him Malignants and engagers continued to be the objects of general hatred and persecution and whoever was obnoxious to the clergy failed not to have one or other of these epithets affixed to him The fanaticism which prevailed being so full of sour and angry principles and so overcharged with various antipathies had acquired a new object of abhorrence these were the sorcerers So prevalent was the opinion of witchcraft that great numbers accused of that crime were burnt by sentence of the magistrates throughout all parts of Scotland In a village near Berwick which contained only fourteen houses fourteen persons were punished by fire and it became a science every where much studied and cultivated to distinguish a true witch by proper trials and symptoms Sir Edward Walker s Historical Discourses p one hundred seventy eight Whitlocke p four hundred four four hundred eight Whitlocke p three hundred ninety six four hundred eighteen The advance of the English army under Cromwell was not able to appease or soften the animosities among the parties in Scotland The clergy were still resolute to exclude all but their most zealous adherents As soon as the English parliament found that the treaty between the king and the Scots would probably terminate in an accommodation they made preparations for a war which they saw would in the end prove inevitable Cromwell having broken the force and courage of the Irish was sent for and he left the command of Ireland to Ireton who governed that kingdom in the character of deputy and with vigilance and industry persevered in the work of subduing and expelling the natives It was expected that Fairfax who still retained the name of general would continue to act against Scotland and appear at the head of the forces a station for which he was well qualified and where alone he made any figure But Fairfax though he had allowed the army to make use of his name in murdering their sovereign and offering violence to the parliament had entertained unsurmountable scruples against invading the Scots whom he considered as zealous Presbyterians and united to England by the sacred bands of the covenant He was further disgusted at the extremities into which he had already been hurried and was confirmed in his repugnance by the exhortations of his wife who had great influence over him and was herself much governed by the Presbyterian clergy A committee of parliament was sent to reason with him and Cromwell was of the number In vain did they urge that the Scots had first broken the covenant by their invasion of England under Hamilton and that they would surely renew their hostile attempts if not prevented by the vigorous measures of the commonwealth Cromwell who knew the rigid inflexibility of Fairfax in every thing which he regarded as matter of principle ventured to solicit him with the utmost earnestness and he went so far as to shed tears of grief and vexation on the occasion No one could suspect any ambition in the man who labored so zealously to retain his general in that high office which he knew he himself was alone entitled to fill The same warmth of temper which made Cromwell a frantic enthusiast rendered him the most dangerous of hypocrites and it was to this turn of mind as much as to his courage and capacity that he owed all his wonderful successes By the contagious ferment of his zeal he engaged every one to cooeperate with him in his measures and entering easily and affectionately into every part which he was disposed to act he was enabled even after multiplied deceits to cover under a tempest of passion all his crooked schemes and profound artifices Fairfax having resigned his commission it was bestowed on Cromwell who was declared captain general of all the forces in England This command in a commonwealth which stood entirely by arms was of the utmost importance and was the chief step which this ambitious politician had yet made towards sovereign power He immediately marched his forces and entered Scotland with an army of sixteen thousand men The command of the Scottish army was given to Lesley an experienced officer who formed a very proper plan of defence He intrenched himself in a fortified camp between Edinburgh and Leith and took care to remove from the counties of Merse and the Lothians every thing which could serve to the subsistence of the English army Cromwell advanced to the Scotch camp and endeavored by every expedient to bring Lesley to a battle the prudent Scotchman knew that though superior in numbers his army was much inferior in discipline to the English and he carefully kept himself within his intrenchments By skirmishes and small rencounters he tried to confirm the spirits of his soldiers and he was successful in these enterprises His army daily increased both in numbers and courage The king came to the camp and having exerted himself in an action gained on the affections of the soldiery who were more desirous of serving under a young prince of spirit and vivacity than under a committee of talking gown men The clergy were alarmed They ordered Charles immediately to leave the camp They also purged it carefully of about four thousand malignants and engagers whose zeal had led them to attend the king and who were the soldiers of chief credit and experience in the nation They then concluded that they had an army composed entirely of saints and could not be beaten They murmured extremely not only against their prudent general but also against the Lord on account of his delays in giving them deliverance and they plainly told him that if he would not save them from the English sectaries he should no longer be their God Sir Edw Walker p one hundred sixty five Sir Edw Walker p one hundred sixty eight Whitlocke p four hundred forty nine An advantage having offered itself on a Sunday they hindered the general from making use of it lest he should involve the nation in the guilt of Sabbath breaking Cromwell found himself in a very bad situation He had no provisions but what he received by sea He had not had the precaution to bring these in sufficient quantities and his army was reduced to difficulties He retired to Dunbar Lesley followed him and encamped on the heights of Lammermure which overlook that town There lay many difficult passes between Dunbar and Berwick and of these Lesley had taken possession The English general was reduced to extremities He had even embraced a resolution of sending by sea all his foot and artillery to England and of breaking through at all hazards with his cavalry The madness of the Scottish ecclesiastics saved him from this loss and dishonor Night and day the ministers had been wrestling with the Lord in prayer as they termed it and they fancied that they had at last obtained the victory Revelations they said were made them that the sectarian and heretical army together with Agag meaning Cromwell was delivered into their hands Upon the faith of these visions they forced their general in spite of his remonstrances to descend into the plain with a view of attacking the English in their retreat Cromwell looking through a glass saw the enemy s camp in motion and foretold without the help of revelations that the Lord had delivered them into his hands He gave orders immediately for an attack In this battle it was easily observed that nothing in military actions can supply the place of discipline and experience and that in the presence of real danger where men are not accustomed to it the fumes of enthusiasm presently dissipate and lose their influence The Scots though double in number to the English were soon put to flight and pursued with great slaughter The chief if not only resistance was made by one regiment of Highlanders that part of the army which was the least infected with fanaticism No victory could be more complete than this which was obtained by Cromwell About three thousand of the enemy were slain and nine thousand taken prisoners Cromwell pursued his advantage and took possession of Edinburgh and Leith The remnant of the Scottish army fled to Stirling The approach of the winter season and an ague which seized Cromwell kept him from pushing the victory any further The clergy made great lamentations and told the Lord that to them it was little to sacrifice their lives and estates but to him it was a great loss to suffer his elect to be destroyed They published a declaration containing the cause of their late misfortunes These visitations they ascribed to the manifold provocations of the king s house of which they feared he had not yet thoroughly repented the secret intrusion of malignants into the king s family and even into the camp the leaving of a most malignant and profane guard of horse who being sent for to be purged came two days before the defeat and were allowed to fight with the army the owning of the king s quarrel by many without subordination to religion and liberty and the carnal self seeking of some together with the neglect of family prayers by others Cromwell having been so successful in the war of the sword took up the pen against the Scottish ecclesiastics He wrote them some polemical letters in which he maintained the chief points of the Independent theology He took care likewise to retort on them their favorite argument of providence and asked them whether the Lord had not declared against them But the ministers thought that the same events which to their enemies were judgments to them were trials and they replied that the Lord had only hid his face for a time from Jacob But Cromwell insisted that the appeal had been made to God in the most express and solemn manner and that in the fields of Dunbar an irrevocable decision had been awarded in favor of the English army Sir Edward Walker This is the best of Cromwell s wretched compositions that remains and we shall here extract a passage out of it You say you have not so learned Christ as to hang the equity of your cause upon events We could wish that blindness had not been upon your eyes to all those marvellous dispensations which God hath wrought lately in England But did not you solemnly appeal and pray Did not we do so too And ought not we and you to think with fear and trembling of the hand of the great God in this mighty and strange appearance of his but can slightly call it an event Were not both your and our expectations renewed from time to time while we waited on God to see which way he would manifest himself upon our appeals And shall we after all these our prayers fastings tears expectations and solemn appeals call these mere events The Lord pity you Surely we fear because it has been a merciful and a gracious deliverance to us I beseech you in the bowels of Christ search after the mind of the Lord in it towards you and we shall help you by our prayers that you may find it For yet if we know our heart at all our bowels do in Christ yearn after the godly in Scotland Thurloe vol i p one hundred fifty eight The defeat of the Scots was regarded by the king as a fortunate event The armies which fought on both sides were almost equally his enemies and the vanquished were now obliged to give him some more authority and apply to him for support The parliament was summoned to meet at saint Johnstone s Hamilton Lauderdale and all the engagers were admitted into court and camp on condition of doing public penance and expressing repentance for their late transgressions Some malignants also crept in under various pretences The intended humiliation or penance of the king was changed into the ceremony of his coronation which was performed at Scone with great pomp and solemnity But amidst all this appearance of respect Charles remained in the hands of the most rigid Covenanters and though treated with civility and courtesy by Argyle a man of parts and address he was little better than a prisoner and was still exposed to all the rudeness and pedantry of the ecclesiastics This young prince was in a situation which very ill suited his temper and disposition All those good qualities which he possessed his affability his wit his gayety his gentleman like disengaged behavior were here so many vices and his love of ease liberty and pleasure was regarded as the highest enormity Though artful in the practice of courtly dissimulation the sanctified style was utterly unknown to him and he never could mould his deportment into that starched grimace which the Covenanters required as an infallible mark of conversion The duke of Buckingham was the only English courtier allowed to attend him and by his ingenious talent for ridicule he had rendered himself extremely agreeable to his master While so many objects of derision surrounded them it was difficult to be altogether insensible to the temptation and wholly to suppress the laugh Obliged to attend from morning to night at prayers and sermons they betrayed evident symptoms of weariness or contempt The clergy never could esteem the king sufficiently regenerated and by continual exhortations remonstrances and reprimands they still endeavored to bring him to a juster sense of his spiritual duty The king s passion for the fair could not altogether be restrained He had once been observed using some familiarities with a young woman and a committee of ministers was appointed to reprove him for a behavior so unbecoming a covenanted monarch The spokesman of the committee one Douglas began with a severe aspect informed the king that great scandal had been given to the godly enlarged on the heinous nature of sin and concluded with exhorting his majesty whenever he was disposed to amuse himself to be more careful for the future in shutting the windows This delicacy so unusual to the place and to the character of the man was remarked by the king and he never forgot the obligation The king shocked at all the indignities and perhaps still more tired with all the formalities to which he was obliged to submit made an attempt to regain his liberty General Middleton at the head of some royalists being proscribed by the Covenanters kept in the mountains expecting some opportunity of serving his master The king resolved to join this body He secretly made his escape from Argyle and fled towards the Highlands Colonel Montgomery with a troop of horse was sent in pursuit of him He overtook the king and persuaded him to return The royalists being too weak to support him Charles was the more easily induced to comply This incident procured him afterwards better treatment and more authority the Covenanters being afraid of driving him by their rigors to some desperate resolution Argyle renewed his courtship to the king and the king with equal dissimulation pretended to repose great confidence in Argyle He even went so far as to drop hints of his intention to marry that nobleman s daughter but he had to do with a man too wise to be seduced by such gross artifices As soon as the season would permit the Scottish army was assembled under Hamilton and Lesley and the king was allowed to join the camp The forces of the western counties notwithstanding the imminent danger which threatened their country were resolute not to unite their cause with that of an army which admitted any engagers or malignants among them and they kept in a body apart under Ker They called themselves the protesters and their frantic clergy declaimed equally against the king and against Cromwell The other party were denominated resolutioners and these distinctions continued long after to divide and agitate the kingdom Charles encamped at the Torwood and his generals resolved to conduct themselves by the same cautious maxims which so long as they were embraced had been successful during the former campaign The town of Stirling lay at his back and the whole north supplied him with provisions Strong intrenchments defended his front and it was in vain that Cromwell made every attempt to bring him to an engagement After losing much time the English general sent Lambert over the Frith into Fife with an intention of cutting off the provisions of the enemy Lambert fell upon Holborne and Brown who commanded a party of the Scots and put them to rout with great slaughter Cromwell also passed over with his whole army and lying at the back of the king made it impossible for him to keep his post any longer Charles reduced to despair embraced a resolution worthy of a young prince contending for empire Having the way open he resolved immediately to march into England where he expected that all his friends and all those who were discontented with the present government would flock to his standard He persuaded the generals to enter into the same views and with one consent the army to the number of fourteen thousand men rose from their camp and advanced by great journeys towards the south Cromwell was surprised at this movement of the royal army Wholly intent on offending his enemy he had exposed his friends to imminent danger and saw the king with numerous forces marching into England where his presence from the general hatred which prevailed against the parliament was capable of producing some great revolution But if this conduct was an oversight in Cromwell he quickly repaired it by his vigilance and activity He despatched letters to the parliament exhorting them not to be dismayed at the approach of the Scots he sent orders every where for assembling forces to oppose the king he ordered Lambert with a body of cavalry to hang upon the rear of the royal army and infest their march and he himself leaving Monk with seven thousand men to complete the reduction of Scotland followed the king with all the expedition possible Charles found himself disappointed in his expectations of increasing his army The Scots terrified at the prospect of so hazardous an enterprise fell off in great numbers The English Presbyterians having no warning given them of the king s approach were not prepared to join him To the royalists this measure was equally unexpected and they were further deterred from joining the Scottish army by the orders which the committee of ministers had issued not to admit any even in this desperate extremity who would not subscribe the covenant The earl of Derby leaving the Isle of Man where he had hitherto maintained his independence was employed in levying forces in Cheshire and Lancashire but was soon suppressed by a party of the parliamentary army And the king when he arrived at Worcester found that his forces extremely harassed by a hasty and fatiguing march were not more numerous than when he rose from his camp in the Torwood Such is the influence of established government that the commonwealth though founded in usurpation the most unjust and unpopular had authority sufficient to raise every where the militia of the counties and these united with the regular forces bent all their efforts against the king With an army of about thirty thousand men Cromwell fell upon Worcester and attacking it on all sides and meeting with little resistance except from Duke Hamilton and General Middleton broke in upon the disordered royalists The streets of the city were strowed with dead Hamilton a nobleman of bravery and honor was mortally wounded Massey wounded and taken prisoner the king himself having given many proofs of personal valor was obliged to fly The whole Scottish army was either killed or taken prisoners The country people inflamed with national antipathy put to death the few that escaped from the field of battle The king left Worcester at six o clock in the afternoon and without halting travelled about twenty six miles in company with fifty or sixty of his friends To provide for his safety he thought it best to separate himself from his companions and he left them without communicating his intentions to any of them By the earl of Derby s directions he went to Boscobel a lone house in the borders of Staffordshire inhabited by one Penderell a farmer To this man Charles intrusted himself The man had dignity of sentiments much above his condition and though death was denounced against all who concealed the king and a great reward promised to any one who should betray him he professed and maintained unshaken fidelity He took the assistance of his four brothers equally honorable with himself and having clothed the king in a garb like their own they led him into the neighboring wood put a bill in his hand and pretended to employ themselves in cutting fagots Some nights he lay upon straw in the house and fed on such homely fare as it afforded For a better concealment he mounted upon an oak where he sheltered himself among the leaves and branches for twenty four hours He saw several soldiers pass by All of them were intent in search of the king and some expressed in his hearing their earnest wishes of seizing him This tree was afterwards denominated the royal oak and for many years was regarded by the neighborhood with great veneration Charles was in the middle of the kingdom and could neither stay in his retreat nor stir a step from it without the most imminent danger Fears hopes and party zeal interested multitudes to discover him and even the smallest indiscretion of his friends might prove fatal Having joined Lord Wilmot who was skulking in the neighborhood they agreed to put themselves into the hands of Colonel Lane a zealous royalist who lived at Bentley not many miles distant The king s feet were so hurt by walking about in heavy boots or countrymen s shoes which did not fit him that he was obliged to mount on horseback and he travelled in this situation to Bentley attended by the Penderells who had been so faithful to him Lane formed a scheme for his journey to Bristol where it was hoped he would find a ship in which he might transport himself He had a near kinswoman missus Norton who lived within three miles of that city and was with child very near the time of her delivery He obtained a pass for during those times of confusion this precaution was requisite for his sister Jane Lane and a servant to travel towards Bristol under pretence of visiting and attending her relation The king rode before the lady and personated the servant When they arrived at Norton s missus Lane pretended that she had brought along as her servant a poor lad a neighboring farmer s son who was ill of an ague and she begged a private room for him where he might be quiet Though Charles kept himself retired in this chamber the butler one Pope soon knew him the king was alarmed but made the butler promise that he would keep the secret from every mortal even from his master and he was faithful to his engagement No ship it was found would for a month set sail from Bristol either for France or Spain and the king was obliged to go elsewhere for a passage He intrusted himself to Colone Windham of Dorsetshire an affectionate partisan of the royal family The natural effect of the long civil wars and of the furious rage to which all men were wrought up in their different factions was that every one s inclinations and affections were thoroughly known and even the courage and fidelity of most men by the variety of incidents had been put to trial The royalists too had many of them been obliged to make concealments in their houses for themselves their friends or more valuable effects and the arts of eluding the enemy had been frequently practised All these circumstances proved favorable to the king in the present exigency As he often passed through the hands of Catholics the priests hole as they called it the place where they were obliged to conceal their persecuted priests was sometimes employed for sheltering their distressed sovereign Windham before he received the king asked leave to intrust the important secret to his mother his wife and four servants on whose fidelity he could rely Of all these no one proved wanting either in honor or discretion The venerable old matron on the reception of her royal guest expressed the utmost joy that having lost without regret three sons and one grandchild in defence of his father she was now reserved in her declining years to be instrumental in the preservation of himself Windham told the king that Sir Thomas his father in the year sixteen thirty six a few days before his death called to him his five sons My children said he we have hitherto seen serene and quiet times under our three last sovereigns but I must now warn you to prepare for clouds and storms Factions arise on every side and threaten the tranquillity of your native country But whatever happen do you faithfully honor and obey your prince and adhere to the crown I charge you never to forsake the crown though it should hang upon a bush These last words added Windham made such impressions on all our breasts that the many afflictions of these sad times could never efface their indelible characters From innumerable instances it appears how deep rooted in the minds of the English gentry of that age was the principle of loyalty to their sovereign that noble and generous principle inferior only in excellence to the more enlarged and more enlightened affection towards a legal constitution But during those times of military usurpation these passions were the same The king continued several days in Windham s house and all his friends in Britain and in every part of Europe remained in the most anxious suspense with regard to his fortunes no one could conjecture whether he were dead or alive and the report of his death being generally believed happily relaxed the vigilant search of his enemies Trials were made to procure a vessel for his escape but he still met with disappointments Having left Windham s house he was obliged again to return to it He passed through many other adventures assumed different disguises in every step was exposed to imminent perils and received daily proofs of uncorrupted fidelity and attachment The sagacity of a smith who remarked that his horse s shoes had been made in the north not in the west as he pretended once detected him and he narrowly escaped At Shoreham in Sussex a vessel was at last found in which he embarked He had been known to so many that if he had not set sail in that critical moment it had been impossible for him to escape After one and forty days concealment he arrived safely at Fescamp in Normandy No less than forty men and women had at different times been privy to his concealment and escape The battle of Worcester afforded Cromwell what he called his crowning mercy So elated was he that he intended to have knighted in the field two of his generals Lambert and Fleetwood but was dissuaded by his friends from exerting this act of regal authority His power and ambition were too great to brook submission to the empty name of a republic which stood chiefly by his influence and was supported by his victories How early he entertained thoughts of taking into his hand the reins of government is uncertain We are only assured that he now discovered to his intimate friends these aspiring views and even expressed a desire of assuming the rank of king which he had contributed with such seeming zeal to abolish The little popularity and credit acquired by the republicans further stimulated the ambition of this enterprising politician These men had not that large thought nor those comprehensive views which might qualify them for acting the part of legislators selfish aims and bigotry chiefly engrossed their attention They carried their rigid austerity so far as to enact a law declaring fornication after the first act to be felony without benefit of clergy They made small progress in that important work which they professed to have so much at heart the settling of a new model of representation and a bill was introduced into the house against painting patches and other immodest dress of women but it did not pass v Heath s Chronicle p three hundred one Parl Hist vol xx p forty seven Whitlocke p five hundred twenty three Scobel p one hundred twenty one v Parl Hist vol xix p two hundred sixty three The nation began to apprehend that they intended to establish themselves as a perpetual legislature and to confine the whole power to sixty or seventy persons who called themselves the parliament of the commonwealth of England And while they pretended to bestow new liberties upon the nation they found themselves obliged to infringe even the most valuable of those which through time immemorial had been transmitted from their ancestors Not daring to intrust the trials of treason to juries who being chosen indifferently from among the people would have been little favorable to the commonwealth and would have formed their verdict upon the ancient laws they eluded that noble institution by which the government of this island has ever been so much distinguished They had evidently seen in the trial of Lilburn what they could expect from juries This man the most turbulent but the most upright and courageous of human kind was tried for a transgression of the new statute of treasons but though he was plainly guilty he was acquitted to the great joy of the people Westminster Hall nay the whole city rang with shouts and acclamations Never did any established power receive so strong a declaration of its usurpation and invalidity and from no institution besides the admirable one of juries could be expected this magnanimous effort That they might not for the future be exposed to affronts which so much lessened their authority the parliament erected a high court of justice which was to receive indictments from the council of state This court was composed of men devoted to the ruling party without name or character determined to sacrifice every thing to their own safety or ambition Colonel Eusebius Andrews and Colonel Walter Slingsby were tried by this court for conspiracies and condemned to death They were royalists and refused to plead before so illegal a jurisdiction Love Gibbons and other Presbyterians having entered into a plot against the republic were also tried condemned and executed The earl of Derby Sir Timothy Featherstone Bemboe being taken prisoners after the battle of Worcester were put to death by sentence of a court martial a method of proceeding declared illegal by that very petition of right for which a former parliament had so strenuously contended and which after great efforts they had extorted from the king Excepting their principles of toleration the maxims by which the republicans regulated ecclesiastical affairs no more prognosticated any durable settlement than those by which they conducted their civil concerns The Presbyterian model of congregations classes and assemblies was not allowed to be finished it seemed even the intention of many leaders in the parliament to admit of no established church and to leave every one without any guidance of the magistrate to embrace whatever sect and to support whatever clergy were most agreeable to him The parliament went so far as to make some approaches in one province to their Independent model Almost all the clergy of Wales being ejected as malignants itinerant preachers with small salaries were settled not above four or five in each county and these being furnished with horses at the public expense hurried from place to place and carried as they expressed themselves the glad tidings of the gospel They were all of them men of the lowest birth and education who had deserted mechanical trades in order to follow this new profession And in this particular as well as in their wandering life they pretended to be more truly apostolical doctor John Walker s Attempt p one hundred forty seven et seq The republicans both by the turn of their disposition and by the nature of the instruments which they employed were better qualified for acts of force and vigor than for the slow and deliberate work of legislation Notwithstanding the late wars and bloodshed and the present factions the power of England had never in any period appeared so formidable to the neighboring kingdoms as it did at this time in the hands of the commonwealth A numerous army served equally to retain every one in implicit subjection to established authority and to strike a terror into foreign nations The power of peace and war was lodged in the same hands with that of imposing taxes and no difference of views among the several members of the legislature could any longer be apprehended The present impositions though much superior to what had ever formerly been experienced were in reality moderate and what a nation so opulent could easily bear The military genius of the people had by the civil contests been roused from its former lethargy and excellent officers were formed in every branch of service The confusion into which all things had been thrown had given opportunity to men of low stations to break through their obscurity and to raise themselves by their courage to commands which they were well qualified to exercise but to which their birth could never have entitled them And while so great a power was lodged in such active hands no wonder the republic was successful in all its enterprises Blake a man of great courage and a generous disposition the same person who had defended Lyme and Taunten with such unshaken obstinacy against the late king was made an admiral and though he had hitherto been accustomed only to land service into which too he had not entered till past fifty years of age he soon raised the naval glory of the nation to a greater height than it had ever attained in any former period A fleet was put under his command and he received orders to pursue Prince Rupert to whom the king had intrusted that squadron which had deserted to him Rupert took shelter in Kinsale and escaping thence fled towards the coast of Portugal Blake pursued and chased him into the Tagus where he intended to make an attack upon him But the king of Portugal moved by the favor which throughout all Europe attended the royal cause refused Blake admittance and aided Prince Rupert in making his escape To be revenged of this partiality the English admiral made prize of twenty Portuguese ships richly laden and he threatened still further vengeance The king of Portugal dreading so dangerous a foe to his newly acquired dominion and sensible of the unequal contest in which he was engaged made all possible submissions to the haughty republic and was at last admitted to negotiate the renewal of his alliance with England Prince Rupert having lost a great part of his squadron on the coast of Spain made sail towards the West Indies His brother Prince Maurice was there shipwrecked in a hurricane Every where this squadron subsisted by privateering sometimes on English sometimes on Spanish vessels And Rupert at last returned to France where he disposed of the remnants of his fleet together with his prizes All the settlements in America except New England which had been planted entirely by the Puritans adhered to the royal party even after the settlement of the republic and Sir George Ayscue was sent with a squadron to reduce them Bermudas Antigua and Virginia were soon subdued Barbadoes commanded by Lord Willoughby of Parham made some resistance but was at last obliged to submit With equal ease were Jersey Guernsey Scilly and the Isle of Man brought under subjection to the republic and the sea which had been much infested by privateers from these islands was rendered safe to the English commerce The countess of Derby defended the Isle of Man and with great reluctance yielded to the necessity of surrendering to the enemy This lady a daughter of the illustrious house of Trimoille in France had during the civil war displayed a manly courage by her obstinate defence of Latham House against the parliamentary forces and she retained the glory of being the last person in the three kingdoms and in all their dependent dominions who submitted to the victorious commonwealth twenty four See note X at the end of the volume Ireland and Scotland were now entirely subjected and reduced to tranquillity Ireton the new deputy of Ireland at the head of a numerous army thirty thousand strong prosecuted the work of subduing the revolted Irish and he defeated them in many rencounters which though of themselves of no great moment proved fatal to their declining cause He punished without mercy all the prisoners who had any hand in the massacres Sir Phelim O Neale among the rest was some time after brought to the gibbet and suffered an ignominious death which he had so well merited by his inhuman cruelties Limeric a considerable town still remained in the hands of the Irish and Ireton after a vigorous siege made himself master of it He was here infected with the plague and shortly after died a memorable personage much celebrated for his vigilance industry capacity even for the strict execution of justice in that unlimited command which he possessed in Ireland He was observed to be inflexible in all his purposes and it was believed by many that he was animated with a sincere and passionate love of liberty and never could have been induced by any motive to submit to the smallest appearance of regal government Cromwell appeared to be much affected by his death and the republicans who reposed great confidence in him were inconsolable To show their regard for his merit and services they bestowed an estate of two thousand pounds a year on his family and honored him with a magnificent funeral at the public charge Though the established government was but the mere shadow of a commonwealth yet was it beginning by proper arts to encourage that public spirit which no other species of civil polity is ever able fully to inspire The command of the army in Ireland devolved on Lieutenant General Ludlow The civil government of the island was intrusted to commissioners Ludlow continued to push the advantages against the Irish and every where obtained an easy victory That unhappy people disgusted with the king on account of those violent declarations against them and their religion which had been extorted by the Scots applied to the king of Spain to the duke of Lorraine and found assistance nowhere Clanricarde unable to resist the prevailing power made submissions to the parliament and retired into England where he soon after died He was a steady Catholic but a man much respected by all parties The successes which attended Monk in Scotland were no less decisive That able general laid siege to Stirling Castle and though it was well provided for defence it was soon surrendered to him He there became master of all the records of the kingdom and he sent them to England The earl of Leven the earl of Crawford Lord Ogilvy and other noblemen having met near Perth in order to concert measures for raising a new army were suddenly set upon by Colonel Alured and most of them taken prisoners Sir Philip Musgrave with some Scots being engaged at Dumfries in a like enterprise met with a like fate Dundee was a town well fortified supplied with a good garrison under Lumisden and full of all the rich furniture the plate and money of the kingdom which had been sent thither as to a place of safety Monk appeared before it and having made a breach gave a general assault He carried the town and following the example and instructions of Cromwell put all the inhabitants to the sword in order to strike a general terror into the kingdom Warned by this example Aberdeen saint Andrew s Inverness and other towns and forts yielded of their own accord to the enemy Argyle made his submissions to the English commonwealth and excepting a few royalists who remained some time in the mountains under the earl of Glencairn Lord Balcarras and General Middleton that kingdom which had hitherto through all ages by means of its situation poverty and valor maintained its independence was reduced to total subjection The English parliament sent Sir Harry Vane saint John and other commissioners to settle Scotland These men who possessed little of the true spirit of liberty knew how to maintain the appearance of it and they required the voluntary consent of all the counties and towns of this conquered kingdom before they would unite them into the same commonwealth with England The clergy protested because they said this incorporating union would draw along with it a subordination of the church to the state in the things of Christ English judges joined to some Scottish were appointed to determine all causes justice was strictly administered order and peace maintained and the Scots freed from the tyranny of the ecclesiastics were not much dissatisfied with the present government twenty five The prudent conduct of Monk a man who possessed a capacity for the arts both of peace and war served much to reconcile the minds of men and to allay their prejudices By the total reduction and pacification of the British dominions the parliament had leisure to look abroad and to exert their vigor in foreign enterprises The Dutch were the first that felt the weight of their arms During the life of Frederic Henry prince of Orange the Dutch republic had maintained a neutrality in the civil wars of England and had never interposed except by her good offices between the contending parties When William who had married an English princess succeeded to his father s commands and authority the states both before and after the execution of the late king were accused of taking steps more favorable to the royal cause and of betraying a great prejudice against that of the parliament It was long before the envoy of the English commonwealth could obtain an audience of the states general The murderers of Dorislaus were not pursued with such vigor as the parliament expected And much regard had been paid to the king and many good offices performed to him both by the public and by men of all ranks in the United Provinces After the death of William prince of Orange which was attended with the depression of his party and the triumph of the Dutch republicans the parliament thought that the time was now favorable for cementing a closer confederacy with the states Whitlocke p four hundred ninety six Heathe s Chronicle p three hundred seven See note Y at the end of the volume sixteen forty seven October seventeen sixteen fifty saint John chief justice who was sent over to the Hague had entertained the idea of forming a kind of coalition between the two republics which would have rendered their interests totally inseparable but fearing that so extraordinary a project would not be relished he contented himself with dropping some hints of it and openly went no further than to propose a strict defensive alliance between England and the United Provinces such as has now for near seventy years taken place between these friendly powers But the states who were unwilling to form a nearer confederacy with a government whose measures were so obnoxious and whose situation seemed so precarious offered only to renew the former alliances with England And the haughty saint John disgusted with this disappointment as well as incensed at many affronts which had been offered him with impunity by the retainers of the Palatine and Orange families and indeed by the populace in general returned into England and endeavored to foment a quarrel between the republics The movement of great states are often directed by as slender springs as those of individuals Though war with so considerable a naval power as the Dutch who were in peace with all their other neighbors might seem dangerous to the yet unsettled commonwealth there were several motives which at this time induced the English parliament to embrace hostile measures Many of the members thought that a foreign war would serve as a pretence for continuing the same parliament and delaying the new model of a representative with which the nation had so long been flattered Others hoped that the war would furnish a reason for maintaining some time longer that numerous standing army which was so much complained of Thurloe vol i p one hundred eighty two We are told in the Life of Sir Harry Vane that that famous republican opposed the Dutch war and that it was the military gentlemen chiefly who supported that measure On the other hand some who dreaded the increasing power of Cromwell expected that the great expense of naval armaments would prove a motive for diminishing the military establishment To divert the attention of the public from domestic quarrels towards foreign transactions seemed in the present disposition of men s minds to be good policy The superior power of the English commonwealth together with its advantages of situation promised success and the parliamentary leaders hoped to gain many rich prizes from the Dutch to distress and sink their flourishing commerce and by victories to throw a lustre on their own establishment which was so new and unpopular All these views enforced by the violent spirit of saint John who had great influence over Crom well determined the parliament to change the purposed alliance into a furious war against the United Provinces To cover these hostile intentions the parliament under pretence of providing for the interests of commerce embraced such measures as they knew would give disgust to the states They framed the famous act of navigation which prohibited all nations from importing into England in their bottoms any commodity which was not the growth and manufacture of their own country By this law though the terms in which it was conceived were general the Dutch were principally affected because their country produces few commodities and they subsist chiefly by being the general carriers and factors of Europe Letters of reprisal were granted to several merchants who complained of injuries which they pretended they had received from the states and above eighty Dutch ships fell into their hands and were made prizes The cruelties committed on the English at Amboyna which were certainly enormous but which seemed to be buried in oblivion by a thirty years silence were again made the ground of complaint And the allowing the murderers of Dorislaus to escape and the conniving at the insults to which saint John had been exposed were represented as symptoms of an unfriendly if not a hostile disposition in the states The states alarmed at all these steps sent orders to their ambassadors to endeavor the renewal of the treaty of alliance which had been broken off by the abrupt departure of saint John Not to be unprepared they equipped a fleet of a hundred and fifty sail and took care by their ministers at London to inform the council of the state of that armament This intelligence instead of striking terror into the English republic was considered as a menace and further confirmed the parliament in their hostile resolutions The minds of men in both states were every day more irritated against each other and it was not long before these humors broke forth into action Tromp an admiral of great renown received from the states the command of a fleet of forty two sail in order to protect the Dutch navigation against the privateers of the English He was forced by stress of weather as he alleged to take shelter in the road of Dover where he met with Blake who commanded an English fleet much inferior in number Who was the aggressor in the action which ensued between these two admirals both of them men of such prompt and fiery dispositions it is not easy to determine since each of them sent to his own state a relation totally opposite in all its circumstances to that of the other and yet supported by the testimony of every captain in his fleet Blake pretended that having given a signal to the Dutch admiral to strike Tromp instead of complying fired a broadside at him Tromp asserted that he was preparing to strike and that the English admiral nevertheless began hostilities It is certain that the admiralty of Holland who are distinct from the council of state had given Tromp no orders to strike but had left him to his own discretion with regard to that vain but much contested ceremonial They seemed willing to introduce the claim of an equality with the new commonwealth and to interpret the former respect paid the English flag as a deference due only to the monarchy This circumstance forms a strong presumption against the narrative of the Dutch admiral The whole Orange party it must be remarked to which Tromp was suspected to adhere was desirous of a war with England Blake though his squadron consisted only of fifteen vessels reenforced after the battle began by eight under Captain Bourne maintained the fight with bravery for five hours and sunk one ship of the enemy and took another Night parted the combatants and the Dutch fleet retired towards the coast of Holland The populace of London were enraged and would have insulted the Dutch ambassadors who lived at Chelsea had not the council of state sent guards to protect them When the states heard of this action of which the consequences were easily foreseen they were in the utmost consternation They immediately despatched Paw pensionary of Holland as their ambassador extraordinary to London and ordered him to lay before the parliament the narrative which Tromp had sent of the late rencounter They entreated them by all the bands of their common religion and common liberties not to precipitate themselves into hostile measures but to appoint commissioners who should examine every circumstance of the action and clear up the truth which lay in obscurity And they pretended that they had given no orders to their admiral to offer any violence to the English but would severely punish him if they found upon inquiry that he had been guilty of an action which they so much disapproved The imperious parliament would hearken to none of these reasons or remonstrances Elated by the numerous successes which they had obtained over their domestic enemies they thought that every thing must yield to their fortunate arms and they gladly seized the opportunity which they sought of making war upon the states They demanded that without any further delay or inquiry reparation should be made for all the damages which the English had sustained And when this demand was not complied with they despatched orders for commencing war against the United Provinces Blake sailed northwards with a numerous fleet and fell upon the herring busses which were escorted by twelve men of war All these he either took or dispersed Tromp followed him with a fleet of above a hundred sail When these two admirals were within sight of each other and preparing for battle a furious storm attacked them Blake took shelter in the English harbors The Dutch fleet was dispersed and received great damage Sir George Ayscue though he commanded only forty ships according to the English accounts engaged near Plymouth the famous De Ruiter who had under him fifty ships of war with thirty merchantmen The Dutch ships were indeed of inferior force to the English De Ruiter the only admiral in Europe who has attained a renown equal to that of the greatest general defended himself so well that Ayscue gained no advantage over him Night parted them in the greatest heat of the action De Ruiter next day sailed off with his convoy The English fleet had been so shattered in the fight that it was not able to pursue Near the coast of Kent Blake seconded by Bourne and Pen met a Dutch squadron nearly equal in numbers commanded by De Witte and De Ruiter A battle was fought much to the disadvantage of the Dutch Their rear admiral was boarded and taken Two other vessels were sunk and one blown up The Dutch next day made sail towards Holland The English were not so successful in the Mediterranean Van Galen with much superior force attacked Captain Badily and defeated him He bought however his victory with the loss of his life Sea fights are seldom so decisive as to disable the vanquished from making head in a little time against the victors Tromp seconded by De Ruiter met near the Goodwins with Blake whose fleet was inferior to the Dutch but who resolved not to decline the combat A furious battle commenced where the admirals on both sides as well as the inferior officers and seamen exerted great bravery In this action the Dutch had the advantage Blake himself was wounded The Garland and Bonaventure were taken Two ships were burned and one sunk and night came opportunely to save the English fleet After this victory Tromp in a bravado fixed a broom to his mainmast as if he were resolved to sweep the sea entirely of all English vessels Great preparations were made in England in order to wipe off this disgrace A gallant fleet of eighty sail was fitted out Blake commanded and Dean under him together with Monk who had been sent for from Scotland When the English lay off Portland they descried near break of day a Dutch fleet of seventy six vessels sailing up the Channel along with a convoy of three hundred merchantmen who had received orders to wait at the Isle of Rhe till the fleet should arrive to escort them Tromp and under him De Ruiter commanded the Dutch This battle was the most furious that had yet been fought between these warlike and rival nations Three days was the combat continued with the utmost rage and obstinacy and Blake who was victor gained not more honor than Tromp who was vanquished The Dutch admiral made a skilful retreat and saved all the merchant ships except thirty He lost however eleven ships of war had two thousand men slain and near fifteen hundred taken prisoners The English though many of their ships were extremely shattered had but one sunk Their slain were not much inferior in number to those of the enemy All these successes of the English were chiefly owing to the superior size of their vessels an advantage which all the skill and bravery of the Dutch admirals could not compensate By means of ship money an imposition which had been so much complained of and in some respects with reason the late king had put the navy into a situation which it had never attained in any former reign and he ventured to build ships of a size which was then unusual But the misfortunes which the Dutch met with in battle were small in comparison of those which their trade sustained from the English Their whole commerce by the Channel was cut off even that to the Baltic was much infested by English privateers Their fisheries were totally suspended A great number of their ships above sixteen hundred had fallen into the hands of the enemy And all this distress they suffered not for any national interests or necessity but from vain points of honor and personal resentments of which it was difficult to give a satisfactory account to the public They resolved therefore to gratify the pride of the parliament and to make some advances towards peace They met not however with a favorable reception and it was not without pleasure that they learned the dissolution of that haughty assembly by the violence of Cromwell an even from which they expected a more prosperous turn to their affairs The zealous republicans in the parliament had not been the chief or first promoters of the war but when it was once entered upon they endeavored to draw from it every possible advantage On all occasions they set up the fleet in opposition to the army and celebrated the glory and successes of their naval armaments They insisted on the intolerable expense to which the nation was subjected and urged the necessity of diminishing it by a reduction of the land forces They had ordered some regiments to serve on board the fleet in the quality of marines And Cromwell by the whole train of their proceedings evidently saw that they had entertained a jealousy of his power and ambition and were resolved to bring him to a subordination under their authority Without scruple or delay he resolved to prevent them On such firm foundations was built the credit of this extraordinary man that though a great master of fraud and dissimulation he judged it superfluous to employ any disguise in conducting this bold enterprise He summoned a general council of officers and immediately found that they were disposed to receive whatever impressions he was pleased to give them Most of them were his creatures had owed their advancement to his favor and relied entirely upon him for their future preferment The breach being already made between the military and civil powers when the late king was seized at Holdenby the general officers regarded the parliament as at once their creature and their rival and thought that they themselves were entitled to share among them those offices and riches of which its members had so long kept possession Harrison Rich Overton and a few others who retained some principle were guided by notions so extravagant that they were easily deluded into measures the most violent and most criminal And the whole army had already been guilty of such illegal and atrocious actions that they could entertain no further scruple with regard to any enterprise which might serve their selfish or fanatical purposes In the council of officers it was presently voted to frame a remonstrance to the parliament After complaining of the arrears due to the army they there desired the parliament to reflect how many years they had sitten and what professions they had formerly made of their intentions to new model the representative and establish successive parliaments who might bear the burden of national affairs from which they themselves would gladly after so much danger and fatigue be at last relieved They confessed that the parliament had achieved great enterprises and had surmounted mighty difficulties yet was it an injury they said to the rest of the nation to be excluded from bearing any part in the service of their country It was now full time for them to give place to others and they therefore desired them after settling a council who might execute the laws during the interval to summon a new parliament and establish that free and equal government which they had so long promised to the people The parliament took this remonstrance in ill part and made a sharp reply to the council of officers The officers insisted on their advice and by mutual altercation and opposition the breach became still wider between the army and the commonwealth Cromwell finding matters ripe for his purpose called a council of officers in order to come to a determination with regard to the public settlement As he had here many friends so had he also some opponents Harrison having assured the council that the general sought only to pave the way for the government of Jesus and his saints Major Streater briskly replied that Jesus ought then to come quickly for if he delayed it till after Christmas he would come too late he would find his place occupied While the officers were in debate Colonel Ingoldsby informed Cromwell that the parliament was sitting and had come to a resolution not to dissolve themselves but to fill up the house by new elections and was at that very time engaged in deliberations with regard to this expedient Cromwell in a rage immediately hastened to the house and carried a body of three hundred soldiers along with him Some of them he placed at the door some in the lobby some on the stairs He first addressed himself to his friend saint John and told him that he had come with a purpose of doing what grieved him to the very soul and what he had earnestly with tears besought the Lord not to impose upon him but there was a necessity in order to the glory of God and good of the nation He sat down for some time and heard the debate He beckoned Harrison and told him that he now judged the parliament ripe for a dissolution Sir said Harrison the work is very great and dangerous I desire you seriously to consider before you engage in it You say well replied the general and thereupon sat still about a quarter of an hour When the question was ready to be put he said again to Harrison This is the time I must do it And suddenly starting up he loaded the parliament with the vilest reproaches for their tyranny ambition oppression and robbery of the public Then stamping with his foot which was a signal for the soldiers to enter For shame said he to the parliament get you gone give place to honester men to those who will more faithfully discharge their trust You are no longer a parliament I tell you you are no longer a parliament The Lord has done with you he has chosen other instruments for carrying on his work Sir Harry Vane exclaiming against this proceeding he cried with a loud voice O Sir Harry Vane Sir Harry Vane The Lord deliver me from Sir Harry Vane Taking hold of Martin by the cloak Thou art a whoremaster said he to another Thou art an adulterer to a third Thou art a drunkard and a glutton And thou an extortioner to a fourth He commanded a soldier to seize the mace What shall we do with this bauble Here take it away It is you said he addressing himself to the house that have forced me upon this I have sought the Lord night and day that he would rather slay me than put me upon this work Having commanded the soldiers to clear the hall he himself went out the last and ordering the doors to be locked departed to his lodgings in Whitehall In this furious manner which so well denotes his genuine character did Cromwell without the least opposition or even murmur annihilate that famous assembly which had filled all Europe with the renown of its actions and with astonishment at its crimes and whose commencement was not more ardently desired by the people than was its final dissolution All parties now reaped successively the melancholy pleasure of seeing the injuries which they had suffered revenged on their enemies and that too by the same arts which had been practised against them The king had in some instances stretched his prerogative beyond its just bounds and aided by the church had well nigh put an end to all the liberties and privileges of the nation The Presbyterians checked the progress of the court and clergy and excited by cant and hypocrisy the populace first to tumults then to war against the king the peers and all the royalists No sooner had they reached the pinnacle of grandeur than the Independents under the appearance of still greater sanctity instigated the army against them and reduced them to subjection The Independents amidst their empty dreams of liberty or rather of dominion were oppressed by the rebellion of their own servants and found themselves at once exposed to the insults of power and hatred of the people By recent as well as all ancient example it was become evident that illegal violence with whatever preferences it may be covered and whatever object it may pursue must inevitably end at last in the arbitrary and despotic government of a single person CHAPTER LXI Illustration one seven hundred twenty six cromwell jpg CROMWELL THE COMMONWEALTH OLIVER CROMWELL in whose hands the dissolution of the parliament had left the whole power civil and military of three kingdoms was born at Huntingdon the last year of the former century of a good family though he himself being the son of a second brother inherited but a small estate from his father In the course of his education he had been sent to the university but his genius was found little fitted for the calm and elegant occupations of learning and he made small proficiency in his studies He even threw himself into a dissolute and disorderly course of life and he consumed in gaming drinking debauchery and country riots the more early years of his youth and dissipated part of his patrimony All of a sudden the spirit of reformation seized him he married affected a grave and composed behavior entered into all the zeal and rigor of the Puritanical party and offered to restore to every one whatever sums he had formerly gained by gaming The same vehemence of temper which had transported him into the extremes of pleasure now distinguished his religious habits His house was the resort of all the zealous clergy of the party and his hospitality as well as his liberalities to the silenced and deprived ministers proved as chargeable as his former debaucheries Though he had acquired a tolerable fortune by a maternal uncle he found his affairs so injured by his expenses that he was obliged to take a farm at saint Ives and apply himself for some years to agriculture as a profession But this expedient served rather to involve him in further debts and difficulties The long prayers which he said to his family in the morning and again in the afternoon consumed his own time and that of his ploughmen and he reserved no leisure for the care of his temporal affairs His active mind superior to the low occupations to which he was condemned preyed upon itself and he indulged his imagination in visions illuminations revelations the great nourishment of that hypochondriacal temper to which he was ever subject Urged by his wants and his piety he had made a party with Hambden his near kinsman who was pressed only by the latter motive to transport himself into New England now become the retreat of the more zealous among the Puritanical party and it was an order of council which obliged them to disembark and remain in England The earl of Bedford who possessed a large estate in the fen country near the Isle of Ely having undertaken to drain these morasses was obliged to apply to the king and by the powers of the prerogative he got commissioners appointed who conducted that work and divided the new acquired land among the several proprietors He met with opposition from many among whom Cromwell distinguished himself and this was the first public opportunity which he had met with of discovering the factious zeal and obstinacy of his character From accident and intrigue he was chosen by the town of Cambridge member of the long parliament His domestic affairs were then in greater disorder and he seemed not to possess any talents which could qualify him to rise in that public sphere into which he was now at last entered His person was ungraceful his dress slovenly his voice untonable his elocution homely tedious obscure and embarrassed The fervor of his spirit frequently prompted him to rise in the house but he was not heard with attention his name for above two years is not to be found oftener than twice in any committee and those committees into which he was admitted were chosen for affairs which would more interest the zealots than the men of business In comparison of the eloquent speakers and fine gentlemen of the house he was entirely overlooked and his friend Hambden alone was acquainted with the depth of his genius and foretold that if a civil war should ensue he would soon rise to eminence and distinction Cromwell himself seems to have been conscious where his strength lay and partly from that motive partly from the uncontrollable fury of his zeal he always joined that party which pushed every thing to extremities against the king He was active in promoting the famous remonstrance which was the signal for all the ensuing commotions and when after a long debate it was carried by a small majority he told Lord Falkland that if the question had been lost he was resolved next day to have converted into ready money the remains of his fortune and immediately to have left the kingdom Nor was this resolution he said peculiar to himself many others of his party he knew to be equally determined He was no less than forty three years of age when he first embraced the military profession and by force of genius without any master he soon became an excellent officer though perhaps he never reached the fame of a consummate commander He raised a troop of horse fixed his quarters in Cambridge exerted great severity towards that university which zealously adhered to the royal party and showed himself a man who would go all lengths in favor of that cause which he had espoused He would not allow his soldiers to perplex their heads with those subtleties of fighting by the king s authority against his person and of obeying his majesty s commands signified by both houses of parliament he plainly told them that if he met the king in battle he would fire a pistol in his face as readily as against any other man His troop of horse he soon augmented to a regiment and he first instituted that discipline and inspired that spirit which rendered the parliamentary armies in the end victorious Your troops said he to Hambden according to his own account are most of them old decayed serving men and tapsters and such kind of fellows the king s forces are composed of gentlemen s younger sons and persons of good quality And do you think that the mean spirits of such base and low fellows as ours will ever be able to encounter gentlemen that have honor and courage and resolution in them You must get men of spirit and take it not ill that I say of a spirit that is likely to go as far as gentlemen will go or else I am sure you will still be beaten as you have hitherto been in every encounter Conference held at Whitehall He did as he proposed He enlisted the sons of freeholders and farmers He carefully invited into his regiment all the zealous fanatics throughout England When they were collected in a body their enthusiastic spirit still rose to a higher pitch Their colonel from his own natural character as well as from policy was sufficiently inclined to increase the flame He preached he prayed he fought he punished he rewarded The wild enthusiasm together with valor and discipline still propagated itself and all men cast their eyes on so pious and so successful a leader From low commands he rose with great rapidity to be really the first though in appearance only the second in the army By fraud and violence he soon rendered himself the first in the state In proportion to the increase of his authority his talents always seemed to expand themselves and he displayed every day new abilities which had lain dormant till the very emergence by which they were called forth into action All Europe stood astonished to see a nation so turbulent and unruly who for some doubtful encroachments on their privileges had dethroned and murdered an excellent prince descended from a long line of monarchs now at last subdued and reduced to slavery by one who a few years before was no better than a private gentleman whose name was not known in the nation and who was little regarded even in that low sphere to which he had always been confined The indignation entertained by the people against an authority founded on such manifest usurpation was not so violent as might naturally be expected Congratulatory addresses the first of the kind were made to Cromwell by the fleet by the army even by many of the chief corporations and counties of England but especially by the several congregations of saints dispersed throughout the kingdom See Milton s State Papers The royalists though they could not love the man who had imbrued his hands in the blood of their sovereign expected more lenity from him than from the jealous and imperious republicans who had hitherto governed The Presbyterians were pleased to see those men by whom they had been outwitted and expelled now in their turn expelled and outwitted by their own servant and they applauded him for this last act of violence upon the parliament These two parties composed the bulk of the nation and kept the people in some tolerable temper All men likewise harassed with wars and factions were glad to see any prospect of settlement And they deemed it less ignominious to submit to a person of such admirable talents and capacity than to a few ignoble enthusiastic hypocrites who under the name of a republic had reduced them to a cruel subjection The republicans being dethroned by Cromwell were the party whose resentment he had the greatest reason to apprehend That party besides the Independents contained two sets of men who are seemingly of the most opposite principles but who were then united by a similitude of genius and of character The first and most numerous were the Millenarians or Fifth Monarchy men who insisted that dominion being founded in grace all distinction in magistracy must be abolished except what arose from piety and holiness who expected suddenly the second coming of Christ upon earth and who pretended that the saints in the mean while that is themselves were alone entitled to govern The second were the Deists who had no other object than political liberty who denied entirely the truth of revelation and insinuated that all the various sects so heated against each other were alike founded in folly and in error Men of such daring geniuses were not contented with the ancient and legal forms of civil government but challenged a degree of freedom beyond what they expected ever to enjoy under any monarchy Martin Challoner Harrington Sidney Wildman Nevil were esteemed the heads of this small division The Deists were perfectly hated by Cromwell because he had no hold of enthusiasm by which he could govern or overreach them he therefore treated them with great rigor and disdain and usually denominated them the heathens As the Millenarians had a great interest in the army it was much more important for him to gain their confidence and their size of understanding afforded him great facility in deceiving them Of late years it had been so usual a topic of conversation to discourse of parliaments and councils and senates and the soldiers themselves had been so much accustomed to enter into that spirit that Cromwell thought it requisite to establish something which might bear the face of a commonwealth He supposed that God in his providence had thrown the whole right as well as power of government into his hands and without any more ceremony by the advice of his council of officers he sent summons to a hundred and twenty eight persons of different towns and counties of England to five of Scotland to six of Ireland He pretended by his sole act and deed to devolve upon these the whole authority of the state This legislative power they were to exercise during fifteen months and they were afterwards to choose the same number of persons who might succeed them in that high and important office There were great numbers at that time who made it a principle always to adhere to any power which was uppermost and to support the established government This maxim is not peculiar to the people of that age but what may be esteemed peculiar to them is that there prevailed a hypocritical phrase for expressing so prudential a conduct it was called a waiting upon providence When providence therefore was so kind as to bestow on these men now assembled together the supreme authority they must have been very ungrateful if in their turn they had been wanting in complaisance towards it They immediately voted themselves a parliament and having their own consent as well as that of Oliver Cromwell for their legislative authority they now proceeded very gravely to the exercise of it In this notable assembly were some persons of the rank of gentlemen but the far greater part were low mechanics Fifth Monarchy men Anabaptists Antinomians Independents the very dregs of the fanatics They began with seeking God by prayer this office was performed by eight or ten gifted men of the assembly and with so much success that according to the confession of all they had never before in any of their devotional exercises enjoyed so much of the Holy Spirit as was then communicated to them Their hearts were no doubt dilated when they considered the high dignity to which they supposed themselves exalted They had been told by Cromwell in his first discourse that he never looked to see such a day when Christ should be so owned Parl Hist vol xx p one hundred eighty two These are his expressions Indeed I have but one word more to say to you though in that perhaps I shall show my weakness it is by way of encouragement to you in this work give me leave to begin thus I confess I never looked to have seen such a day as this it may be nor you neither when Jesus Christ should be so owned as he is at this day and in this work Jesus Christ is owned this day by your call and you own him by your willingness to appear for him and you manifest this as far as poor creatures can do to be a day of the power of Christ I know you will remember that scripture he makes his people willing in the day of his power God manifests it to be the day of the power of Christ having through so much blood and so much trial as has been upon this nation he makes this one of the greatest mercies next to his own Son to have his people called to the supreme authority God hath owned his Son and hath owned you and hath made you to own him I confess I never looked to have seen such a day I did not I suppose at this passage he cried for he was very much given to weeping and could at any time shed abundance of tears The rest of the speech may be seen among Milton s State Papers p one hundred six It is very curious and full of the same obscurity confusion embarrassment and absurdity which appear in almost all Oliver s productions They thought it therefore their duty to proceed to a thorough reformation and to pave the way for the reign of the Redeemer and for that great work which it was expected the Lord was to bring forth among them All fanatics being consecrated by their own fond imaginations naturally hear an antipathy to the ecclesiastics who claim a peculiar sanctity derived merely from their office and priestly character This parliament took into consideration the abolition of the clerical function as savoring of Popery and the taking away of tithes which they called a relic of Judaism Learning also and the universities were deemed heathenish and unnecessary the common law was denominated a badge of the conquest and of Norman slavery and they threatened the lawyers with a total abrogation of their profession Some steps were even taken towards an abolition of the chancery the highest court of judicature in the kingdom and the Mosaical law was intended to be established as the sole system of English jurisprudence Of all the extraordinary schemes adopted by these legislators they had not leisure to finish any except that which established the legal solemnization of marriage by the civil magistrate alone without the interposition of the clergy They found themselves exposed to the derision of the public Among the fanatics of the house there was an active member much noted for his long prayers sermons and harangues He was a leather seller in London his name Praise God Barebone This ridiculous name which seems to have been chosen by some poet or allegorist to suit so ridiculous a personage struck the fancy of the people and they commonly affixed to this assembly the appellation of Barebone s parliament Whitlocke p five hundred forty three five hundred forty eight Conference held at Whitehall It was usual for the pretended saints at that time to change their names from Henry Edward Anthony William which they regarded as heathenish into others more sanctified and godly even the New Testament names James Andrew John Peter were not held in such regard as those which were borrowed from the Old Testament Hezekiah Habakkuk Joshua Zerobabel Sometimes a whole godly sentence was adopted as a name Here are the names of a jury said to be enclosed in the county of

list than the first chapter of saint Matthew The brother of this Praise God Barebone had for name If Christ had not died for you you had been damned Barebone But the people tired of this long name retained only the last word and commonly gave him the appellation of Damn d Barebone The Dutch ambassadors endeavored to enter into negotiation with this parliament but though Protestants and even Presbyterians they met with a bad reception from those who pretended to a sanctity so much superior The Hollanders were regarded as worldly minded men intent only on commerce and industry whom it was fitting the saints should first extirpate ere they undertook that great work to which they believed themselves destined by Providence of subduing Antichrist the man of sin and extending to the uttermost bounds of the earth the kingdom of the Redeemer The ambassadors finding themselves proscribed not as enemies of England but of Christ remained in astonishment and knew not which was most to be admired the implacable spirit or egregious folly of these pretended saints Cromwell began to be ashamed of his legislature If he ever had any design in summoning so preposterous an assembly beyond amusing the populace and the army he had intended to alarm the clergy and lawyers and he had so far succeeded as to make them desire any other government which might secure their professions now brought in danger by these desperate fanatics Cromwell himself was dissatisfied that the parliament though they had derived all their authority from him began to pretend power from the Lord and to insist already on their divine commission He had been careful to summon in his writs several persons entirely devoted to him Thurloe vol i p two hundred seventy three five hundred ninety one Also Stubbe p ninety one ninety two Thurloe vol i p three hundred ninety three By concert these met early and it was mentioned by some among them that the sitting of this parliament any longer would be of no service to the nation They hastened therefore to Cromwell along with Rouse their speaker and by a formal deed or assignment restored into his hands that supreme authority which they had so lately received from him General Harrison and about twenty more remained in the house and that they might prevent the reign of the saints from coming to an untimely end they placed one Moyer in the chair and began to draw up protests They were soon interrupted by Colonel White with a party of soldiers He asked them what they did there We are seeking the Lord said they Then you may go elsewhere replied he for to my certain knowledge he has not been here these many years The military being now in appearance as well as in reality the sole power which prevailed in the nation Cromwell though fit to indulge a new fancy for he seems not to have had any deliberate plan in all these alterations Lambert his creature who under the appearance of obsequiousness to him indulged in unbounded ambition proposed in a council of officers to adopt another scheme of government and to temper the liberty of a commonwealth by the authority of a single person who should be known by the appellation of protector Without delay he prepared what was called the instrument of government containing the plan of this new legislature and as it was supposed to be agreeable to the general it was immediately voted by the council of officers Cromwell was declared protector and with great solemnity installed in that high office So little were these men endowed with the spirit of legislation that they confessed or rather boasted that they had employed only four days in drawing this instrument by which the whole government of three kingdoms was pretended to be regulated and adjusted to all succeeding generations There appears no difficulty in believing them when it is considered how crude and undigested a system of civil polity they endeavored to establish The chief articles of the instrument are these A council was appointed which was not to exceed twenty one nor be less than thirteen persons These were to enjoy their office during life or good behavior and in case of a vacancy the remaining members named three of whom the protector chose one The protector was appointed supreme magistrate of the commonwealth in his name was all justice to be administered from him were all magistracy and honors derived he had the power of pardoning all crimes excepting murder and treason to him the benefit of all forfeitures devolved The right of peace war and alliance rested in him but in these particulars he was to act by the advice and with the consent of his council The power of the sword was vested in the protector jointly with the parliament while it was sitting or with the council of state in the intervals He was obliged to summon a parliament every three years and allow them to sit five months without adjournment prorogation or dissolution The bills which they passed were to be presented to the protector for his assent but if within twenty days it were not obtained they were to become laws by the authority alone of parliament A standing army for Great Britain and Ireland was established of twenty thousand foot and ten thousand horse and funds were assigned for their support These were not to be diminished without consent of the protector and in this article alone he assumed a negative During the intervals of parliament the protector and council had the power of enacting laws which were to be valid till the next meeting of parliament The chancellor treasurer admiral chief governors of Ireland and Scotland and the chief justices of both the benches must be chosen with the approbation of parliament and in the intervals with the approbation of the council to be afterwards ratified by parliament The protector was to enjoy his office during life and on his death the place was immediately to be supplied by the council This was the instrument of government enacted by the council of officers and solemnly sworn to by Oliver Cromwell The council of state named by the instrument were fifteen men entirely devoted to the protector and by reason of the opposition among themselves in party and principles not likely ever to combine against him Cromwell said that he accepted the dignity of protector merely that he might exert the duty of a constable and preserve peace in the nation Affairs indeed were brought to that pass by the furious animosities of the several factions that the extensive authority and even arbitrary power of some first magistrate was become a necessary evil in order to keep the people from relapsing into blood and confusion The Independents were too small a party ever to establish a popular government or intrust the nation where they had so little interest with the free choice of its representatives The Presbyterians had adopted the violent maxims of persecution incompatible at all times with the peace of society much more with the wild zeal of those numerous sects which prevailed among the people The royalists were so much enraged by the injuries which they had suffered that the other prevailing parties would never submit to them who they knew were enabled merely by the execution of the ancient laws to take severe vengeance upon them Had Cromwell been guilty of no crime but this temporary usurpation the plea of necessity and public good which he alleged might be allowed in every view a reasonable excuse for his conduct During the variety of ridiculous and distracted scenes which the civil government exhibited in England the military force was exerted with vigor conduct and unanimity and never did the kingdom appear more formidable to all foreign nations The English fleet consisting of a hundred sail and commanded by Monk and Dean and under them by Pen and Lauson met near the coast of Flanders with the Dutch fleet equally numerous and commanded by Tromp The two republics were not inflamed by any national antipathy and their interests very little interfered yet few battles have been disputed with more fierce and obstinate courage than were those many naval combats which were fought during this short but violent war The desire of remaining sole lords of the ocean animated these states to an honorable emulation against each other After a battle of two days in the first of which Dean was killed the Dutch inferior in the size of their ships were obliged with great loss to retire into their harbors Blake towards the end of the fight joined his countrymen with eighteen sail The English fleet lay off the coast of Holland and totally interrupted the commerce of that republic Illustration one seven hundred thirty four blake jpg ADMIRAL BLAKE The ambassadors whom the Dutch had sent over to England gave them hopes of peace But as they could obtain no cessation of hostilities the states unwilling to suffer any longer the loss and dishonor of being blockaded by the enemy made the utmost efforts to recover their injured honor Never on any occasion did the power and vigor of that republic appear in a more conspicuous light In a few weeks they had repaired and manned their fleet and they equipped some Ships of a larger size than any which they had hitherto sent to sea Tromp issued out determined again to fight the victors and to die rather than to yield the contest He met with the enemy commanded by Monk and both sides immediately rushed into the combat Tromp gallantly animating his men with his sword drawn was shot through the heart with a musket ball This event alone decided the battle in favor of the English Though near thirty ships of the Dutch were sunk and taken they little regarded this loss compared with that of their brave admiral Meanwhile the negotiations of peace were continually advancing The states overwhelmed with the expense of the war terrified by their losses and mortified by their defeats were extremely desirous of an accommodation with an enemy whom they found by experience too powerful for them The king having shown an inclination to serve on board their fleet though they expressed their sense of the honor intended them they declined an offer which might inflame the quarrel with the English commonwealth The great obstacle to the peace was found not to be any animosity on the part of the English but on the contrary a desire too earnest of union and confederacy Cromwell had revived the chimerical scheme of a coalition with the United Provinces a total conjunction of government privileges interests and councils This project appeared so wild to the states that they wondered any man of sense could ever entertain it and they refused to enter into conferences with regard to a proposal which could serve only to delay any practicable scheme of accommodation The peace was at last signed by Cromwell now invested with the dignity of protector and it proves sufficiently that the war had been impolitic since after the most signal victories no terms more advantageous could be obtained A defensive league was made between the two republics They agreed each of them to banish the enemies of the other those who had been concerned in the massacre of Amboyna were to be punished if any remained alive the honor of the flag was yielded to the English eighty five thousand pounds were stipulated to be paid by the Dutch East India Company for losses which the English Company had sustained and the Island of Polerone in the East Indies was promised to be ceded to the latter Cromwell jealous of the connections between the royal family and that of Orange insisted on a separate article that neither the young prince nor any of his family should ever be invested with the dignity of stadtholder The province of Holland strongly prejudiced against that office which they esteemed dangerous to liberty secretly ratified this article The protector knowing that the other provinces would not be induced to make such a concession was satisfied with this security The Dutch war being successful and the peace reasonable brought credit to Cromwell s administration An act of justice which he exercised at home gave likewise satisfaction to the people though the regularity of it may perhaps appear somewhat doubtful Don Pantaleon brother to the Portuguese ambassador and joined with him in the same commission fancying himself to be insulted came upon the exchange armed and attended by several servants By mistake he fell on a gentleman whom he took for the person that had given him the offence and having butchered him with many wounds he and all his attendants took shelter in the house of the Portuguese ambassador who had connived at this base enterprise The populace surrounded the house and threatened to set fire to it Cromwell sent a guard who seized all the criminals They were brought to trial and notwithstanding the opposition of the ambassador who pleaded the privileges of his office Don Pantaleon was executed on Tower Hill The laws of nations were here plainly violated but the crime committed by the Portuguese gentleman was to the last degree atrocious and the vigorous chastisement of it suiting so well the undaunted character of Cromwell was universally approved of at home and admired among foreign nations The situation of Portugal obliged that court to acquiesce and the ambassador soon after signed with the protector a treaty of peace and alliance which was very advantageous to the English commerce Thurloe vol ii p four hundred twenty nine Thurloe vol i p six hundred sixteen Another act of severity but necessary in his situation was at the very same time exercised by the protector in the capital punishment of Gerard and Vowel two royalists who were accused of conspiring against his life He had erected a high court of justice for their trial an infringement of the ancient laws which at this time was become familiar but one to which no custom or precedent could reconcile the nation Juries were found altogether unmanageable The restless Lilburn for new offences had been brought to a new trial and had been acquitted with new triumph and exultation If no other method of conviction had been devised during this illegal and unpopular government all its enemies were assured of entire impunity The protector had occasion to observe the prejudices entertained against his government by the disposition of the parliament which he summoned on the third of September that day of the year on which he gained his two great victories of Dunbar and Worcester and which he always regarded as fortunate for him It must be confessed that if we are left to gather Cromwell s intentions from his instrument of government it is such a motley piece that we cannot easily conjecture whether he seriously meant to establish a tyranny or a republic On one hand a first magistrate in so extensive a government seemed necessary both for the dignity and tranquillity of the state and the authority which he assumed as protector was in some respects inferior to the prerogatives which the laws intrusted and still intrust to the king On the other hand the legislative power which he reserved to himself and council together with so great an army independent of the parliament were bad prognostics of his intention to submit to a civil and legal constitution But if this were not his intention the method in which he distributed and conducted the elections being so favorable to liberty form an inconsistency which is not easily accounted for He deprived of their right of election all the small boroughs places the most exposed to influence and corruption Of four hundred members which represented England two hundred and seventy were chosen by the counties The rest were elected by London and the more considerable corporations The lower populace too so easily guided or deceived were excluded from the elections an estate of two hundred pounds value was necessary to entitle any one to a vote The elections of this parliament were conducted with perfect freedom and excepting that such of the royalists as had borne arms against the parliament and all their sons were excluded a more fair representation of the people could not be desired or expected Thirty members were returned from Scotland as many from Ireland The protector seems to have been disappointed when he found that all these precautions which were probably nothing but covers to his ambition had not procured him the confidence of the public Though Cromwell s administration was less odious to every party than that of any other party yet was it entirely acceptable to none The royalists had been instructed by the king to remain quiet and to cover themselves under the appearance of republicans and they found in this latter faction such inveterate hatred against the protector that they could not wish for more zealous adversaries to his authority It was maintained by them that the pretence of liberty and a popular election was but a new artifice of this great deceiver in order to lay asleep the deluded nation and give himself leisure rivet their chains more securely upon them that in the instrument of government he openly declared his intention of still retaining the same mercenary army by whose assistance he had subdued the ancient established government and who would with less scruple obey him in overturning whenever he should please to order them that new system which he himself had been pleased to model that being sensible of the danger and uncertainty of all military government he endeavored to intermix some appearance and but an appearance of civil administration and to balance the army by a seeming consent of the people that the absurd trial which he had made of a parliament elected by himself appointed perpetually to elect their successors plainly proved that he aimed at nothing but temporary expedients was totally averse to a free republican government and possessed not that mature and deliberate reflection which could qualify him to act the part of a legislator that his imperious character which had betrayed itself in so many incidents could never seriously submit to legal limitations nor would the very image of popular government be longer upheld than while conformable to his arbitrary will and pleasure and that the best policy was to oblige him to take off the mask at once and either submit entirely to that parliament which he had summoned or by totally rejecting its authority leave himself no resource but in his seditious and enthusiastic army In prosecution of these views the parliament having heard the protector s speech three hours long and having chosen Lenthal for their speaker immediately entered into a discussion of the pretended instrument of government and of that authority which Cromwell by the title of protector had assumed over the nation Thurloe vol ii p five hundred eighty eight The greatest liberty was used in arraigning this new dignity and even the personal character and conduct of Cromwell escaped not without censure The utmost that could be obtained by the officers and by the court party for so they were called was to protract the debate by arguments and long speeches and prevent the decision of a question which they were sensible would be carried against them by a great majority The protector surprised and enraged at this refractory spirit in the parliament which however he had so much reason to expect sent for them to the painted chamber and with an air of great authority inveighed against their conduct He told them that nothing could be more absurd than for them to dispute his title since the same instrument of government which made them a parliament had invested him with the protectorship that some points in the new constitution were supposed to be fundamentals and were not on any pretence to be altered or disputed that among these were the government of the nation by a single person and a parliament their joint authority over the army and militia the succession of new parliaments and liberty of conscience and that with regard to these particulars there was reserved to him a negative voice to which in the other circumstances of government he confessed himself nowise entitled The protector now found the necessity of exacting a security which had he foreseen the spirit of the house he would with better grace have required at their first meeting Thurloe vol ii p six hundred twenty He obliged the members to sign a recognition of his authority and an engagement not to propose or consent to any alteration in the government as it was settled in a single person and a parliament and he placed guards at the door of the house who allowed none but subscribers to enter Most of the members after some hesitation submitted to this condition but retained the same refractory spirit which they had discovered in their first debates The instrument of government was taken in pieces and examined article by article with the most scrupulous accuracy very free topics were advanced with the general approbation of the house and during the whole course of their proceedings they neither sent up one bill to the protector nor took any notice of him Being informed that conspiracies were entered into between the members and some malecontent officers he hastened to the dissolution of so dangerous an assembly By the instrument of government to which he had sworn no parliament could be dissolved till it had sitten five months but Cromwell pretended that a month contained only twenty eight days according to the method of computation practised in paying the fleet and army The full time therefore according to this reckoning being elapsed the parliament was ordered to attend the protector who made them a tedious confused angry harangue and dismissed them Were we to judge of Cromwell s capacity by this and indeed by all his other compositions we should be apt to entertain no very favorable idea of it But in the great variety of human geniuses there are some which though they see their object clearly and distinctly in general yet when they come to unfold its parts by discourse or writing lose that luminous conception which they had before attained All accounts agree in ascribing to Cromwell a tiresome dark unintelligible elocution even when he had no intention to disguise his meaning yet no man s actions were ever in such a variety of difficult incidents more decisive and judicious The electing of a discontented parliament is a proof of a discontented nation the angry and abrupt dissolution of that parliament is always sure to increase the general discontent The members of this assembly returning to their counties propagated that spirit of mutiny which they had exerted in the house Sir Harry Vane and the old republicans who maintained the indissoluble authority of the long parliament encouraged the murmurs against the present usurpation though they acted so cautiously as to give the protector no handle against them Wildman and some others of that party carried still further their conspiracies against the protector s authority The royalists observing this general ill will towards the establishment could no longer be retained in subjection but fancied that every one who was dissatisfied like them had also embraced the same views and inclinations They did not consider that the old parliamentary party though many of them were displeased with Cromwell who had dispossessed them of their power were still more apprehensive of any success to the royal cause whence besides a certain prospect of the same consequence they had so much reason to dread the severest vengeance for their past transgressions In concert with the king a conspiracy was entered into by the royalists throughout England and a day of general rising appointed Information of this design was conveyed to Cromwell The protector s administration was extremely vigilant Thurloe his secretary had spies every where Manning who had access to the king s family kept a regular correspondence with him and it was not difficult to obtain intelligence of a confederacy so generally diffused among a party who valued themselves more on zeal and courage than on secrecy and sobriety Many of the royalists were thrown into prison Others on the approach of the day were terrified with the danger of the undertaking and remained at home In one place alone the conspiracy broke into action Penruddoc Groves Jones and other gentlemen of the west entered Salisbury with about two hundred horse at the very time when the sheriff and judges were holding the assizes These they made prisoners and they proclaimed the king Contrary to their expectations they received no accession of force so prevalent was the terror of the established government Having in vain wandered about for some time they were totally discouraged and one troop of horse was able at last to suppress them The leaders of the conspiracy being taken prisoners were capitally punished The rest were sold for slaves and transported to Barbadoes The easy subduing of this insurrection which by the boldness of the undertaking struck at first a great terror into the nation was a singular felicity to the protector who could not without danger have brought together any considerable body of his mutinous army in order to suppress it The very insurrection itself he regarded as a fortunate event since it proved the reality of those conspiracies which his enemies on every occasion represented as mere fictions invented to color his tyrannical severities He resolved to keep no longer any terms with the royalists who though they were not perhaps the most implacable of his enemies were those whom he could oppress under the most plausible pretences and who met with least countenance and protection from his adherents He issued an edict with the consent of his council for exacting the tenth penny from that whole party in order as he pretended to make them pay the expenses to which their mutinous disposition continually exposed the public Without regard to compositions articles of capitulation or acts of indemnity all the royalists however harassed with former oppressions were obliged anew to redeem themselves by great sums of money and many of them were reduced by these multiplied disasters to extreme poverty Whoever was known to be disaffected or even lay under any suspicion though no guilt could be proved against him was exposed to the new exaction In order to raise this imposition which commonly passed by the name of decimation the protector instituted twelve major generals and divided the whole kingdom of England into so many military jurisdictions Parl Hist vol xx p four hundred thirty three These men assisted by commissioners had power to subject whom they pleased to decimation to levy all the taxes imposed by the protector and his council and to imprison any person who should be exposed to their jealousy or suspicion nor was there any appeal from them but to the protector himself and his council Under color of these powers which were sufficiently exorbitant the major generals exercised an authority still more arbitrary and acted as if absolute masters of the property and person of every subject All reasonable men now concluded that the very mask of liberty was thrown aside and that the nation was forever subjected to military and despotic government exercised not in the legal manner of European nations but according to the maxims of Eastern tyranny Not only the supreme magistrate owed his authority to illegal force and usurpation he had parcelled out the people into so many subdivisions of slavery and had delegated to his inferior ministers the same unlimited authority which he himself had so violently assumed A government totally military and despotic is almost sure after some time to fall into impotence and languor but when it immediately succeeds a legal constitution it may at first to foreign nations appear very vigorous and active and may exert with more unanimity that power spirit and riches which had been acquired under a better form It seems now proper after so long an interval to look abroad to the general state of Europe and to consider the measures which England at this time embraced in its negotiations with the neighboring princes The moderate temper and unwarlike genius of the two last princes the extreme difficulties under which they labored at home and the great security which they enjoyed from foreign enemies had rendered them negligent of the transactions on the continent and England during their reigns had been in a manner overlooked in the general system of Europe The bold and restless genius of the protector led him to extend his alliances and enterprises to every part of Christendom and partly from the ascendant of his magnanimous spirit partly from the situation of foreign kingdoms the weight of England even under its most legal and bravest princes was never more sensibly felt than during this unjust and violent usurpation A war of thirty years the most signal and most destructive that had appeared in modern annals was at last finished in Germany and by the treaty of Westphalia were composed those fatal quarrels which had been excited by the palatine s precipitate acceptance of the crown of Bohemia The young palatine was restored to part of his dignities and of his dominions The rights privileges and authority of the several members of the Germanic body were fixed and ascertained sovereign princes and free states were in some degree reduced to obedience under laws and by the valor of the heroic Gustavus the enterprises of the active Richelieu the intrigues of the artful Mazarine was in part effected after an infinite expense of blood and treasure which had been fondly expected and loudly demanded from the feeble efforts of the pacific James seconded by the scanty supplies of his jealous parliaments In sixteen forty eight This prince during the civil wars had much neglected his uncle and paid court to the parliament he accepted of a pension of eight thousand pounds a year from them and took a place in their assembly of divines Sweden which had acquired by conquest large dominions in the north of Germany was engaged in enterprises which promised her from her success and valor still more extensive acquisitions on the side both of Poland and of Denmark Charles X who had mounted the throne of that kingdom after the voluntary resignation of Christina being stimulated by the fame of Gustavus as well as by his own martial disposition carried his conquering arms to the south of the Baltic and gained the celebrated battle of Warsaw which had been obstinately disputed during the space of three days The protector at the time his alliance was courted by every power in Europe anxiously courted the alliance of Sweden and he was fond of forming a confederacy with a Protestant power of such renown even though it threatened the whole north with conquest and subjection The transactions of the parliament and protector with France had been various and complicated The emissaries of Richelieu had furnished fuel to the flame of rebellion when it first broke out in Scotland but after the conflagration had diffused itself the French court observing the materials to be of themselves sufficiently combustible found it unnecessary any longer to animate the British malecontents to an opposition of their sovereign On the contrary they offered their mediation for composing these intestine disorders and their ambassadors from decency pretended to act in concert with the court of England and to receive directions from a prince with whom their master was connected by so near an affinity Meanwhile Richelieu died and soon after him the French king Louis XIII leaving his son an infant four years old and his widow Anne of Austria regent of the kingdom Cardinal Mazarine succeeded Richelieu in the ministry and the same general plan of policy though by men of such opposite characters was still continued in the French councils The establishment of royal authority the reduction of the Austrian family were pursued with ardor and success and every year brought an accession of force and grandeur to the French monarchy Not only battles were won towns and fortresses taken the genius too of the nation seemed gradually to improve and to compose itself to the spirit of dutiful obedience and of steady enterprise A Conde a Turenne were formed and the troops animated by their valor and guided by their discipline acquired every day a greater ascendant over the Spaniards All of a sudden from some intrigues of the court and some discontents in the courts of judicature intestine commotions were excited and every thing relapsed into confusion But these rebellions of the French neither ennobled by the spirit of liberty nor disgraced by the fanatical extravagancies which distinguished the British civil wars were conducted with little bloodshed and made but a small impression on the minds of the people Though seconded by the force of Spain and conducted by the prince of Conde the malecontents in a little time were either expelled or subdued and the French monarchy having lost a few of its conquests returned with fresh vigor to the acquisition of new dominion The queen of England and her son Charles during these commotions passed most of their time at Paris and notwithstanding their near connection of blood received but few civilities and still less support from the French court Had the queen regent been ever so much inclined to assist the English prince the disorders of her own affairs would for a long time have rendered such intentions impracticable The banished queen had a moderate pension assigned her but it was so ill paid and her credit ran so low that one morning when the cardinal De Retz waited on her she informed him that her daughter the princess Henrietta was obliged to lie abed for want of a fire to warm her To such a condition was reduced in the midst of Paris a queen of England and daughter of Henry IV of France The English parliament however having assumed the sovereignty of the state resented the countenance cold as it was which the French court gave to the unfortunate monarch On pretence of injuries of which the English merchants complained they issued letters of reprisal upon the French and Blake went so far as to attack and seize a whole squadron of ships which were carrying supplies to Dunkirk then closely besieged by the Spaniards That town disappointed of these supplies fell into the hands of the enemy The French ministers soon found it necessary to change their measures They treated Charles with such affected indifference that he thought it more decent to withdraw and prevent the indignity of being desired to leave the kingdom He went first to Spaw thence he retired to Cologne where he lived two years on a small pension about six thousand pounds a year paid him by the court of France and on some contributions sent him by his friends in England In the management of his family he discovered a disposition to order and economy and his temper cheerful careless and sociable was more than a sufficient compensation for that empire of which his enemies had bereaved him Sir Edward Hyde created lord chancellor and the marquis of Ormond were his chief friends and confidants If the French ministry had thought it prudent to bend under the English parliament they deemed it still more necessary to pay deference to the protector when he assumed the reins of government Cardinal Mazarine by whom all the counsels of France were directed was artful and vigilant supple and patient false and intriguing desirous rather to prevail by dexterity than violence and placing his honor more in the final success of his measures than in the splendor and magnanimity of the means which he employed Cromwell by his imperious character rather than by the advantage of his situation acquired an ascendant over this man and every proposal made by the protector however unreasonable in itself and urged with whatever insolence met with a ready compliance from the politic and timid cardinal Bourdeaux was sent over to England as minister and all circumstances of respect were paid to the daring usurper who had imbrued his hands in the blood of his sovereign a prince so nearly related to the royal family of France With indefatigable patience did Bourdeaux conduct this negotiation which Cromwell seemed entirely to neglect and though privateers with English commission committed daily depredations on the French commerce Mazarine was content in hopes of a fortunate issue still to submit to these indignities Thurloe vol iii p one hundred three six hundred nineteen six hundred fifty three In the treaty which was signed after long negotiation the protector s name was inserted before the French king s in that copy which remained in England Thurloe vol vi p one hundred sixteen See further vol vii p one hundred seventy eight The court of Spain less connected with the unfortunate royal family and reduced to greater distress than the French monarchy had been still more forward in her advances to the prosperous parliament and protector Don Alonzo de Cardenas the Spanish envoy was the first public minister who recognized the authority of the new republic and in return for this civility Ascham was sent envoy into Spain by the parliament No sooner had this minister arrived in Madrid than some of the banished royalists inflamed by that inveterate hatred which animated the English factions broke into his chamber and murdered him together with his secretary Immediately they took sanctuary in the churches and assisted by the general favor which every where attended the royal cause were enabled most of them to make their escape Only one of the criminals suffered death and the parliament seemed to rest satisfied with this atonement Spain at this time assailed every where by vigorous enemies from without and laboring under many internal disorders retained nothing of her former grandeur except the haughty pride of her counsels and the hatred and jealousy of her neighbors Portugal had rebelled and established her monarchy in the house of Braganza Catalonia complaining of violated privileges had revolted to France Naples was shaken with popular convulsions the Low Countries were invaded with superior forces and seemed ready to change their master the Spanish infantry anciently so formidable had been annihilated by Conde in the fields of Rocroy and though the same prince banished France sustained by his activity and valor the falling fortunes of Spain he could only hope to protract not prevent the ruin with which that monarchy was visibly threatened Had Cromwell understood and regarded the interests of his country he would have supported the declining condition of Spain against the dangerous ambition of France and preserved that balance of power on which the greatness and security of England so much depend Had he studied only his own interests he would have maintained an exact neutrality between those great monarchies nor would he have hazarded his ill acquired and unsettled power by provoking foreign enemies who might lend assistance to domestic faction and overturn his tottering throne But his magnanimity undervalued danger his active disposition and avidity of extensive glory made him incapable of repose and as the policy of men is continually warped by their temper no sooner was peace made with Holland than he began to deliberate what new enemy he should invade with his victorious arms The extensive empire and yet extreme weakness of Spain in the West Indies the vigorous courage and great naval power of England were circumstances which when compared excited the ambition of the enterprising protector and made him hope that he might by some gainful conquest render forever illustrious that dominion which he had assumed over his country Should he fail of these durable acquisitions the Indian treasures which must every year cross the ocean to reach Spain were he thought a sure prey to the English navy and would support his military force without his laying new burdens on the discontented people From France a vigorous resistance must be expected no plunder no conquests could be hoped for the progress of his arms even if attended with success must there be slow and gradual and the advantages acquired however real would be less striking to the multitude whom it was his interest to allure The royal family so closely connected with the French monarch might receive great assistance from that neighboring kingdom and an army of French Protestants landed in England would be able he dreaded to unite the most opposite factions against the present usurpation These motives of policy were probably seconded by his bigoted prejudices as no human mind ever contained so strange a mixture of sagacity and absurdity as that of this extraordinary personage The Swedish alliance though much contrary to the interests of England he had contracted merely from his zeal for Protestantism and Sweden being closely connected with France he could not hope to maintain that confederacy in which he so much prided himself should a rupture ensue between England and this latter kingdom See the account of the negotiations with France and Spain by Thurloe vol i p seven hundred fifty nine He proposed to Sweden a general league and confederacy of all the Protestants Whitlocke p six hundred twenty Thurloe vol vii p one In order to judge of the maxims by which he conducted his foreign politics see further Thurloe vol iv p two hundred ninety five three hundred forty three four hundred forty three vol vii p one hundred seventy four Thurloe vol i p seven hundred fifty nine The Hugonots he expected would meet with better treatment while he engaged in a close union with their sovereign And as the Spaniards were much more Papists than the French were much more exposed to the old Puritanical hatred and had even erected the bloody tribunal of the inquisition whose rigors they had refused to mitigate on Cromwell s solicitation he hoped that a holy and meritorious war with such idolaters could not fail of protection from Heaven A preacher likewise inspired as was supposed by a prophetic spirit bid him go and prosper calling him a stone cut out of the mountains without hands that would break the pride of the Spaniard crush Antichrist and make way for the purity of the gospel over the whole world v Thurloe vol i p seven hundred fifty nine Thurloe vol i p seven hundred fifty nine Thurloe vol i p seven hundred fifty nine Don Alonzo said that the Indian trade and the inquisition were his master s two eyes and the protector insisted upon the putting out both of them at once Carrington p one hundred ninety one v Bates Actuated equally by these bigoted these ambitious and these interested motives the protector equipped two considerable squadrons and while he was making those preparations the neighboring states ignorant of his intentions remained in suspense and looked with anxious expectation on what side the storm should discharge itself One of these squadrons consisting of thirty capital ships was sent into the Mediterranean under Blake whose fame was now spread over Europe No English fleet except during the crusades had ever before sailed in those seas and from one extremity to the other there was no naval force Christian or Mahometan able to resist them The Roman pontiff whose weakness and whose pride equally provoked attacks dreaded invasion from a power which professed the most inveterate enmity against him and which so little regulated its movements by the usual motives of interest and prudence Blake casting anchor before Leghorn demanded and obtained from the duke of Tuscany reparation for some losses which the English commerce had formerly sustained from him He next sailed to Algiers and compelled the dey to make peace and to restrain his piratical subjects from further violences on the English He presented himself before Tunis and having there made the same demands the dey of that republic bade him look to the castles of Porto Farino and Goletta and do his utmost Blake needed not to be roused by such a bravado he drew his ships close up to the castles and tore them in pieces with his artillery He sent a numerous detachment of sailors in their long boats into the harbor and burned every ship which lay there This bold action which its very temerity perhaps rendered safe was executed with little loss and filled all that part of the world with the renown of English valor The other squadron was not equally successful It was commanded by Pen and carried on board four thousand men under the command of Venables About five thousand more joined them from Barbadoes and saint Christopher s Both these officers were inclined to the king s service and it is pretended that Cromwell was obliged to hurry the soldiers on board in order to prevent the execution of a conspiracy which had been formed among them in favor of the exiled family The ill success of this enterprise may justly be ascribed as much to the injudicious schemes of the protector who planned it as to the bad execution of the officers by whom it was conducted The soldiers were the refuse of the whole army the forces enlisted in the West Indies were the most profligate of mankind Pen and Venables were of incompatible tempers the troops were not furnished with arms fit for such an expedition their provisions were defective both in quantity and quality all hopes of pillage the best incentive to valor among such men were refused the soldiers and seamen no directions or intelligence were given to conduct the officers in then enterprise and at the same time they were tied down to follow the advice of commissioners who disconcerted them in all their projects Clarendon Vita de Berwici p one hundred twenty four Burchet s Naval History See also Carte s Collection vol ii p forty six forty seven Thurloe vol iii p five hundred five It was agreed by the admiral and general to attempt saint Domingo the only place of strength in the Island of Hispaniola On the approach of the English the Spaniards in a fright deserted their houses and fled into the woods Contrary to the opinion of Venables the soldiers were disembarked without guides ten leagues distant from the town They wandered four days through the woods without provisions and was still more intolerable in that sultry climate without water The Spaniards recovered spirit and attacked them The English discouraged with the bad conduct of their officers and scarcely alive from hunger thirst and fatigue were unable to resist An inconsiderable number of the enemy put the whole army to rout killed six hundred of them and chased the rest on board their vessels The English commanders in order to atone as much as possible for this unprosperous attempt bent their course to Jamaica which was surrendered to them without a blow Pen and Venables returned to England and were both of them sent to the Tower by the protector who though commonly master of his fiery temper was thrown into a violent passion at this disappointment He had made a conquest of greater importance than he was himself at that time aware of yet was it much inferior to the vast projects which he had formed He gave orders however to support it by men and money and that island has ever since remained in the hands of the English the chief acquisition which they owe to the enterprising spirit of Cromwell As soon as the news of this expedition which was an unwarrantable violation of treaty arrived in Europe the Spaniards declared war against England and seized all the ships and goods of English merchants of which they could make themselves masters The commerce with Spain so profitable to the English was cut off and near fifteen hundred vessels it is computed fell in a few years into the hands of the enemy Blake to whom Montague was now joined in command after receiving new orders prepared himself for hostilities against the Spaniards Several sea officers having entertained scruples of conscience with regard to the justice of the Spanish war threw up their commissions and retired Thurloe vol iv p one hundred thirty five World s Mistake in Oliver Cromwell in the Harl Miscel vol i Thurloe vol iv p six hundred seventy six hundred eighty eight No commands they thought of their superiors could justify a war which was contrary to the principles of natural equity and which the civil magistrate had no right to order Individuals they maintained in resigning to the public their natural liberty could bestow on it only what they themselves were possessed of a right of performing lawful actions and could invest it with no authority of commanding what is contrary to the decrees of Heaven Such maxims though they seem reasonable are perhaps too perfect for human nature and must be regarded as one effect though of the most innocent and even honorable kind of that spirit partly fanatical partly republican which predominated in England Blake lay some time off Cadiz in expectation of intercepting the Plate fleet but was at last obliged for want of water to make sail towards Portugal Captain Stayner whom he had left on the coast with a squadron of seven vessels came in sight of the galleons and immediately set sail to pursue them The Spanish admiral ran his ship ashore two others followed his example the English took two ships valued at near two millions of pieces of eight Two galleons were set on fire and the marquis of Badajox viceroy of Peru with his wife and his daughter betrothed to the young duke of Medina Celi were destroyed in them The marquis himself might have escaped but seeing these unfortunate women astonished with the danger fall in a swoon and perish in the flames he rather chose to die with them than drag out a life imbittered with the remembrance of such dismal scenes When the treasures gained by this enterprise arrived at Portsmouth the protector from a spirit of ostentation ordered them to be transported by land to London Thurloe vol v p four hundred thirty three The next action against the Spaniards was more honorable though less profitable to the nation Blake having heard that a Spanish fleet of sixteen ships much richer than the former had taken shelter in the Canaries immediately made sail towards them He found them in the Bay of Santa Cruz disposed in a formidable posture The bay was secured with a strong castle well provided with cannon besides seven forts in several parts of it all united by a line of communication manned with musketeers Don Diego Diagues the Spanish admiral ordered all his smaller vessels to moor close to the shore and posted the larger galleons farther off at anchor with their broadsides to the sea Blake was rather animated than daunted with this appearance The wind seconded his courage and blowing full into the bay in a moment brought him among the thickest of his enemies After a resistance of four hours the Spaniards yielded to English valor and abandoned their ships which were set on fire and consumed with all their treasure The greatest danger still remained to the English They lay under the fire of the castle and all the forts which must in a little time have torn them in pieces But the wind suddenly shifting carried them out of the bay where they left the Spaniards in astonishment at the happy temerity of their audacious victors This was the last and greatest action of the gallant Blake He was consumed with a dropsy and scurvy and hastened home that he might yield up his breath in his native country which he had so much adorned by his valor As he came within sight of land he expired twentieth of April sixteen fifty seven Never man so zealous for a faction was so much respected and esteemed even by the opposite factions He was by principle an inflexible republican and the late usurpations amidst all the trust and caresses which he received from the ruling powers were thought to be very little grateful to him It is still our duty he said to the seamen to fight for our country into what hands soever the government may fall Disinterested generous liberal ambitious only of true glory dreadful only to his avowed enemies he forms one of the most perfect characters of the age and the least stained with those errors and violences which were then so predominant The protector ordered him a pompous funeral at the public charge but the tears of his countrymen were the most honorable panegyric on his memory The conduct of the protector in foreign affairs though imprudent and impolitic was full of vigor and enterprise and drew a consideration to his country which since the reign of Elizabeth it seemed to have totally lost The great mind of this successful usurper was intent on spreading the renown of the English nation and while he struck mankind with astonishment at his extraordinary fortune he seemed to ennoble instead of debasing that people whom he had reduced to subjection It was his boast that he would render the name of an Englishman as much feared and revered as ever was that of a Roman and as his countrymen found some reality in these pretensions their national vanity being gratified made them bear with more patience all the indignities and calamities under which they labored It must also be acknowledged that the protector in his civil and domestic administration displayed as great regard both to justice and clemency as his usurped authority derived from no law and founded only on the sword could possibly permit All the chief offices in the courts of judicature were filled with men of integrity amidst the virulence of faction the decrees of the judges were upright and impartial and to every man but himself and to himself except where necessity required the contrary the law was the great rule of conduct and behavior Vane and Lilburn whose credit with the republicans and levellers he dreaded were indeed for some time confined to prison Cony who refused to pay illegal taxes was obliged by menaces to depart from his obstinacy high courts of justice were erected to try those who had engaged in conspiracies and insurrections against the protector s authority and whom he could not safely commit to the verdict of juries But these irregularities were deemed inevitable consequences of his illegal authority And though often urged by his officers as is pretended to attempt a general massacre of the royalists he always with horror rejected such sanguinary counsels Clarendon Life of Lord Berwick et cetera In the army was laid the sole basis of the protector s power and in managing it consisted the chief art and delicacy of his government The soldiers were held in exact discipline a policy which both accustomed them to obedience and made them less hateful and burdensome to the people He augmented their pay though the public necessities sometimes obliged him to run in arrears to them Their interests they were sensible were closely connected with those of their general and protector And he entirely commanded their affectionate regard by his abilities and success in almost every enterprise which he had hitherto undertaken But all military government is precarious much more where it stands in opposition to civil establishments and still more where it encounters religious prejudices By the wild fanaticism which he had nourished in the soldiers he had seduced them into measures for which if openly proposed to them they would have entertained the utmost aversion But this same spirit rendered them more difficult to be governed and made their caprices terrible even to that hand which directed their movements So often taught that the office of king was a usurpation upon Christ they were apt to suspect a protector not to be altogether compatible with that divine authority Harrison though raised to the highest dignity and possessed of Cromwell s confidence became his most inveterate enemy

principles and Cromwell was obliged to deprive them of their commissions Their influence which was before thought unbounded among the troops seemed from that moment to be totally annihilated The more effectually to curb the enthusiastic and seditious spirit of the troops Cromwell established a kind of militia in the several counties Companies of infantry and cavalry were enlisted under proper officers regular pay distributed among them and a resource by that means provided both against the insurrections of the royalists and mutiny of the army Religion can never be deemed a point of small consequence in civil government but during this period it may be regarded as the great spring of men s actions and determinations Though transported himself with the most frantic whimseys Cromwell had adopted a scheme for regulating this principle in others which was sagacious and political Being resolved to maintain a national church yet determined neither to admit Episcopacy nor Presbytery he established a number of commissioners under the name of tryers partly laymen partly ecclesiastics some Presbyterians some Independents These presented to all livings which were formerly in the gift of the crown they examined and admitted such persons as received holy orders and they inspected the lives doctrine and behavior of the clergy Instead of supporting that union between learning and theology which has so long been attempted in Europe these tryers embraced the latter principle in its full purity and made it the sole object of their examination The candidates were no more perplexed with questions concerning their progress in Greek and Roman erudition concerning their talent for profane arts and sciences the chief object of scrutiny regarded their advances in grace and fixing the critical moment of their conversion With the pretended saints of all denominations Cromwell was familiar and easy Laying aside the state of protector which on other occasions he well knew how to maintain he insinuated to them that nothing but necessity could ever oblige him to invest himself with it He talked spiritually to them he sighed he wept he canted he prayed He even entered with them into an emulation of ghostly gifts and these men instead of grieving to be outdone in their own way were proud that his highness by his princely example had dignified those practices in which they themselves were daily occupied Cromwell followed though but in part the advice which he received from General Harrison at the time when the intimacy and endearment most strongly subsisted betwixt them Let the waiting upon Jehovah said that military saint be the greatest and most considerable business you have every day reckon it so more than to eat sleep and counsel together Run aside sometimes from your company and get a word with the Lord Why should not you have three or four precious souls always standing at your elbow with whom you might now and then turn into a corner I have found refreshment and mercy in such a way Milton s State Papers p twelve If Cromwell might be said to adhere to any particular form of religion they were the Independents who could chiefly boast of his favor and it may be affirmed that such pastors of that sect as were not passionately addicted to civil liberty were all of them devoted to him The Presbyterian clergy also saved from the ravages of the Anabaptists and Millenarians and enjoying their establishments and tithes were not averse to his government though he still entertained a great jealousy of that ambitious and restless spirit by which they were actuated He granted an unbounded liberty of conscience to all but Catholics and Prelatists and by that means he both attached the wild sectaries to his person and employed them in curbing the domineering spirit of the Presbyterians I am the only man he was often heard to say who has known how to subdue that insolent sect which can suffer none but itself The Protestant zeal which possessed the Presbyterians and Independents was highly gratified by the haughty manner in which the protector so successfully supported the persecuted Protestants throughout all Europe Even the duke of Savoy so remote a power and so little exposed to the naval force of England was obliged by the authority of France to comply with his mediation and to tolerate the Protestants of the valleys against whom that prince had commenced a furious persecution France itself was constrained to bear not only with the religion but even in some instances with the seditious insolence of the Hugonots and when the French court applied for a reciprocal toleration of the Catholic religion in England the protector who arrogated in every thing the superiority would hearken to no such proposal He had entertained a project of instituting a college in imitation of that at Rome for the propagation of the faith and his apostles in zeal though not in unanimity had certainly been a full match for the Catholics Cromwell retained the church of England in constraint though he permitted its clergy a little more liberty than the Republican parliament had formerly allowed He was pleased that the superior lenity of his administration should in every thing be remarked He bridled the royalists both by the army which he retained and by those secret spies which he found means to intermix in all their counsels Manning being detected and punished with death he corrupted Sir Richard Willis who was much trusted by Chancellor Hyde and all the royalists and by means of this man he was let into every design and conspiracy of the party He could disconcert any project by confining the persons who were to be the actors in it and as he restored them afterwards to liberty his severity passed only for the result of general jealousy and suspicion The secret source of his intelligence remained still unknown and unsuspected Conspiracies for an assassination he was chiefly afraid of these being designs which no prudence or vigilance could evade Colonel Titus under the name of Allen had written a spirited discourse exhorting every one to embrace this method of vengeance and Cromwell knew that the inflamed minds of the royal party were sufficiently disposed to put the doctrine in practice against him He openly told them that assassinations were base and odious and he never would commence hostilities by so shameful an expedient but if the first attempt or provocation came from them he would retaliate to the uttermost He had instruments he said whom he could employ and he never would desist till he had totally exterminated the royal family This menace more than all his guards contributed to the security of his person twenty six See note Z at the end of the volume There was no point about which the protector was more solicitous than to procure intelligence This article alone it is said cost him sixty thousand pounds a year Postmasters both at home and abroad were in his pay carriers were searched or bribed secretaries and clerks were corrupted the greatest zealots in all parties were often these who conveyed private information to him and nothing could escape his vigilant inquiry Such at least is the representation made by historians of Cromwell s administration but it must be confessed that if we may judge by those volumes of Thurloe s papers which have been lately published this affair like many others has been greatly magnified We scarcely find by that collection that any secret counsels of foreign states except those of Holland which are not expected to be concealed were known to the protector The general behavior and deportment of this man who had been raised from a very private station who had passed most of his youth in the country and who was still constrained so much to frequent bad company was such as might befit the greatest monarch He maintained a dignity without either affectation or ostentation and supported with all strangers that high idea with which his great exploits and prodigious fortune had impressed them Among his ancient friends he could relax himself and by trifling and amusement jesting and making verses he feared not exposing himself to their most familiar approaches With others he sometimes pushed matters to the length of rustic buffoonery and he would amuse himself by putting burning coals into the boots and hose of the officers who attended him Before the king s trial a meeting was agreed on between the chiefs of the republican party and the general officers in order to concert the model of that free government which they were to substitute in the room of the monarchical constitution now totally subverted After debates on this subject the most important that could fall under the discussion of human creatures Ludlow tells us that Cromwell by way of frolic threw a cushion at his head and when Ludlow took up another cushion in order to return the compliment the general ran down stairs and had almost fallen in the hurry When the high court of justice was signing the warrant for the execution of the king a matter if possible still more serious Cromwell taking the pen in his hand before he subscribed his name bedaubed with ink the face of Martin who sat next him And the pen being delivered to Martin he practised the same frolic upon Cromwell Whitlocke p six hundred forty seven Bates Trial of the Regicides He frequently gave feasts to his inferior officers and when the meat was set upon the table a signal was given the soldiers rushed in upon them and with much noise tumult and confusion ran away with all the dishes and disappointed the guests of their expected meal Bates That vein of frolic and pleasantry which made a part however inconsistent of Cromwell s character was apt sometimes to betray him into other inconsistencies and to discover itself even where religion might seem to be a little concerned It is a tradition that one day sitting at table the protector had a bottle of wine brought him of a kind which he valued so highly that he must needs open the bottle himself but in attempting it the corkscrew dropped from his hand Immediately his courtiers and generals flung themselves on the floor to recover it Cromwell burst out a laughing Should any fool said he put in his head at the door he would fancy from your posture that you were seeking the Lord and you are only seeking a corkscrew Amidst all the unguarded play and buffoonery of this singular personage he took the opportunity of remarking the characters designs and weaknesses of men and he would sometimes push them by an indulgence in wine to open to him the most secret recesses of their bosom Great regularity however and even austerity of manners were always maintained in his court and he was careful never by any liberties to give offence to the most rigid of the godly Some state was upheld but with little expense and without any splendor The nobility though courted by him kept at a distance and disdained to intermix with those mean persons who were the instruments of his government Without departing from economy he was generous to those who served him and he knew how to find out and engage in his interests every man possessed of those talents which any particular employment demanded His generals his admirals his judges his ambassadors were persons who contributed all of them in their several spheres to the security of the protector and to the honor and interest of the nation Under pretence of uniting Scotland and Ireland in one commonwealth with England Cromwell had reduced those kingdoms to a total subjection and he treated them entirely as conquered provinces The civil administration of Scotland was placed in a council consisting mostly of English of which Lord Broghile was president Justice was administered by seven judges four of whom were English In order to cure the tyrannical nobility he both abolished all vassalage and revived the office of justice of peace which King James had introduced but was not able to support A long line of forts and garrisons was maintained throughout the kingdom An army of ten thousand men kept everything in peace and obedience and neither the banditti of the mountains nor the bigots of the Low Countries could indulge their inclination to turbulence and disorder He courted the Presbyterian clergy though he nourished that intestine enmity which prevailed between the resolutioners and protesters and he found that very little policy was requisite to foment quarrels among theologians He permitted no church assemblies being sensible that from thence had proceeded many of the past disorders And in the main the Scots were obliged to acknowledge that never before while they enjoyed their irregular factious liberty had they attained so much happiness as at present when reduced to subjection under a foreign nation Whitlocke p five hundred seventy Thurloe vol iv p fifty seven Thurloe vol vi p five hundred fifty seven The protector s administration of Ireland was more severe and violent The government of that island was first intrusted to Fleetwood a notorious fanatic who had married Ireton s widow then to Henry Cromwell second son of the protector a young man of an amiable mild disposition and not destitute of vigor and capacity Above five millions of acres forfeited either by the Popish rebels or by the adherents of the king were divided partly among the adventurers who had advanced money to the parliament partly among the English soldiers who had arrears due to them Examples of a more sudden and violent change of property are scarcely to be found in any history An order was even issued to confine all the native Irish to the province of Connaught where they would be shut up by rivers lakes and mountains and could not it was hoped be any longer dangerous to the English government but this barbarous and absurd policy which from an impatience of attaining immediate security must have depopulated all the other provinces and rendered the English estates of no value was soon abandoned as impracticable Cromwell began to hope that by his administration attended with so much lustre and success abroad so much order and tranquillity at home he had now acquired such authority as would enable him to meet the representatives of the nation and would assure him of their dutiful compliance with his government He summoned a parliament but not trusting altogether to the good will of the people he used every art which his new model of representation allowed him to employ in order to influence the elections and fill the house with his own creatures Ireland being entirely in the hands of the army chose few but such officers as were most acceptable to him Scotland showed a like compliance and as the nobility and gentry of that kingdom regarded their attendance on English parliaments as an ignominious badge of slavery it was on that account more easy for the officers to prevail in the elections Notwithstanding all these precautions the protector still found that the majority would not be favorable to him He set guards therefore on the door who permitted none to enter but such as produced a warrant from his council and the council rejected about a hundred who either refused a recognition of the protector s government or were on other accounts obnoxious to him These protested against so egregious a violence subversive of all liberty but every application for redress was neglected both by the council and the parliament The majority of the parliament by means of these arts and violences was now at last either friendly to the protector or resolved by their compliance to adjust if possible this military government to their laws and liberties They voted a renunciation of all title in Charles Stuart or any of his family and this was the first act dignified with the appearance of national consent which had ever had that tendency Colonel Jephson in order to sound the inclinations of the house ventured to move that the parliament should bestow the crown on Cromwell and no surprise or reluctance was discovered on the occasion When Cromwell afterwards asked Jephson what induced him to make such a motion As long said Jephson as I have the honor to sit in parliament I must follow the dictates of my own conscience whatever offence I may be so unfortunate as to give you Get thee gone said Cromwell giving him a gentle blow on the shoulder get thee gone for a mad fellow as thou art In order to pave the way to this advancement for which he so ardently longed Cromwell resolved to sacrifice his major generals whom he knew to be extremely odious to the nation That measure was also become necessary for his own security All government purely military fluctuates perpetually between a despotic monarchy and a despotic aristocracy according as the authority of the chief commander prevails or that of the officers next him in rank and dignity The major generals being possessed of so much distinct jurisdiction began to establish a separate title to power and had rendered themselves formidable to the protector himself and for this inconvenience though he had not foreseen it he well knew before it was too late to provide a proper remedy Claypole his son in law who possessed his confidence abandoned them to the pleasure of the house and though the name was still retained it was agreed to abridge or rather entirely annihilate the power of the major generals At length a motion in form was made by Alderman Pack one of the city members for investing the protector with the dignity of king This motion at first excited great disorder and divided the whole house into parties The chief opposition came from the usual adherents of the protector the major generals and such officers as depended on them Lambert a man of deep intrigue and of great interest in the army had long entertained the ambition of succeeding Cromwell in the protectorship and he foresaw that if the monarchy were restored hereditary right would also be established and the crown be transmitted to the posterity of the prince first elected He pleaded therefore conscience and rousing all those civil and religious jealousies against kingly government which had been so industriously encouraged among the soldiers and which served them as a pretence for so many violences he raised a numerous and still more formidable party against the motion On the other hand the motion was supported by every one who was more particularly devoted to the protector and who hoped by so acceptable a measure to pay court to the prevailing authority Many persons also attached to their country despaired of ever being able to subvert the present illegal establishment and were desirous by fixing it on ancient foundations to induce the protector from views of his own safety to pay a regard to the ancient laws and liberties of the kingdom Even the royalists imprudently joined in the measure and hoped that when the question regarded only persons not forms of government no one would any longer balance between the ancient royal family and an ignoble usurper who by blood treason and perfidy had made his way to the throne The bill was voted by a considerable majority and a committee was appointed to reason with the protector and to overcome those scruples which he pretended against accepting so liberal an offer The conference lasted for several days The committee urged that all the statutes and customs of England were founded on the supposition of regal authority and could not without extreme violence be adjusted to any other form of government that a protector except during the minority of a king was a name utterly unknown to the laws and no man was acquainted with the extent or limits of his authority that if it were attempted to define every part of his jurisdiction many years if not ages would be required for the execution of so complicated a work if the whole power of the king were at once transferred to him the question was plainly about a name and the preference was indisputably due to the ancient title that the English constitution was more anxious concerning the form of government than concerning the birthright of the first magistrate and had provided by an express law of Henry VII for the security of those who act in defence of the king in being by whatever means he might have acquired possession that it was extremely the interest of all his highness s friends to seek the shelter of this statute and even the people in general were desirous of such a settlement and in all juries were with great difficulty induced to give their verdict in favor of a protector that the great source of all the late commotions had been the jealousy of liberty and that a republic together with a protector had been established in order to provide further securities for the freedom of the constitution but that by experience the remedy had been found insufficient even dangerous and pernicious since every indeterminate power such as that of a protector must be arbitrary and the more arbitrary as it was contrary to the genius and inclination of the people The difficulty consisted not in persuading Cromwell He was sufficiently convinced of the solidity of these reasons and his inclination as well as judgment was entirely on the side of the committee But how to bring over the soldiers to the same way of thinking was the question The office of king had been painted to them in such horrible colors that there were no hopes of reconciling them suddenly to it even though bestowed upon their general to whom they were so much devoted A contradiction open and direct to all past professions would make them pass in the eyes of the whole nation for the most shameless hypocrites enlisted by no other than mercenary motives in the cause of the most perfidious traitor Principles such as they were had been encouraged in them by every consideration human and divine and though it was easy where interest concurred to deceive them by the thinnest disguises it might be found dangerous at once to pull off the mask and to show them in a full light the whole crime and deformity of their conduct Suspended between these fears and his own most ardent desires Cromwell protracted the time and seemed still to oppose the reasonings of the committee in hopes that by artifice he might be able to reconcile the refractory minds of the soldiers to his new dignity While the protector argued so much in contradiction both to his judgment and inclination it is no wonder that his elocution always confused embarrassed and unintelligible should be involved in tenfold darkness and discover no glimmering of common sense or reason An exact account of this conference remains and may be regarded as a great curiosity The members of the committee in their reasonings discover judgment knowledge elocution Lord Broghill in particular exerts himself on this memorable occasion But what a contrast when we pass to the protector s replies After so singular a manner does nature distribute her talents that in a nation abounding with sense and learning a man who by superior personal merit alone had made his way to supreme dignity and had even obliged the parliament to make him a tender of the crown was yet incapable of expressing himself on this occasion but in a manner which a peasant of the most ordinary capacity would justly be ashamed of We shall produce any passage at random for his discourse is all of a piece I confess for it behoves me to deal plainly with you I must confess I would say I hope I may be understood in this for indeed I must be tender what I say to such an audience as this I say I would be understood that in this argument I do not make parallel betwixt men of a different mind and a parliament which shall have their desires I know there is no comparison nor can it be urged upon me that my words have the least color that way because the parliament seems to give liberty to me to say any thing to you as that that is a tender of my humble reasons and judgment and opinion to them and if I think they are such and will be such to them and are faithful servants and will be so to the supreme authority and the legislative wheresoever it is if I say I should not tell you knowing their minds to be so I should not be faithful if I should not tell you so to the end you may report it to the parliament I shall say something for myself for my own mind I do profess it I urn not a man scrupulous about words or names of such things I have not but as I have the word of God and I hope I shall ever have it for the rule of my conscience for my informations so truly men that have been led in dark paths through the providence and dispensation of God why surely it is not to be objected to a man for who can love to walk in the dark But providence does so dispose And though a man may impute his own folly and blindness to providence sinfully yet it must be at my peril the case may be that it is the providence of God that doth lead men in darkness I must need say that I have had a great deal of experience of providence and though it is no rule without or against the word yet it is a very good expositor of the word in many cases Conference at Whitehall The great defect in Oliver s speeches consists not in his want of elocution but in his want of ideas The sagacity of his actions and the absurdity of his discourse form the most prodigious contrast that ever was known The collection of all his speeches letters sermons for he also wrote sermons would make a great curiosity and with a few exceptions might justly pass for one of the most nonsensical books in the world The opposition which Cromwell dreaded was not that which came from Lambert and his adherents whom he now regarded as capital enemies and whom he was resolved on the first occasion to deprive of all power and authority it was that which he met with in his own family and from men who by interest as well as inclination were the most devoted to him Fleetwood had married his daughter Desborow his sister yet these men actuated by principle alone could by no persuasion artifice or entreaty be induced to consent that their friend and patron should be invested with regal dignity They told him that if he accepted of the crown they would instantly throw up their commissions and never afterwards should have it in their power to serve him Thurloe vol vi p two hundred sixty one Colonel Pride procured a petition against the office of king signed by a majority of the officers who were in London and the neighborhood Several persons it is said had entered into an engagement to murder the protector within a few hours after he should have accepted the offer of the parliament Some sudden mutiny in the army was justly dreaded And upon the whole Cromwell after the agony and perplexity of long doubt was at last obliged to refuse that crown which the representatives of the nation in the most solemn manner had tendered to him Most historians are inclined to blame his choice but he must be allowed the best judge of his own situation And in such complicated subjects the alteration of a very minute circumstance unknown to the spectator will often be sufficient to cast the balance and render a determination which in itself may be uneligible very prudent or even absolutely necessary to the actor A dream or prophecy Lord Clarendon mentions which he affirms and he must have known the truth was universally talked of almost from the beginning of the civil wars and long before Cromwell was so considerable a person as to bestow upon it any degree of probability In this prophecy it was foretold that Cromwell should be the greatest man in England and would nearly but never would fully mount the throne Such a prepossession probably arose from the heated imagination either of himself or of his followers and as it might be one cause of the great progress which he had already made it is not an unlikely reason which may be assigned for his refusing at this time any further elevation The parliament when the regal dignity was rejected by Cromwell found themselves obliged to retain the name of a commonwealth and protector and as the government was hitherto a manifest usurpation it was thought proper to sanctify it by a seeming choice of the people and their representatives Instead of the instrument of government which was the work of the general officers alone an humble petition and advice was framed and offered to the protector by the parliament This was represented as the great basis cf the republican establishment regulating and limiting the powers of each member of the constitution and securing the liberty of the people to the most remote posterity By this deed the authority of protector was in some particulars enlarged in others it was considerably diminished He had the power of nominating his successor he had a perpetual revenue assigned him a million a year for the pay of the fleet and army three hundred thousand pounds for the support of civil government and he had authority to name another house who should enjoy their seats during life and exercise some functions of the former house of peers But he abandoned the power assumed in the intervals of parliament of framing laws with the consent of his council and he agreed that no members of either house should be excluded but by the consent of that house of which they were members The other articles were in the main the same as in the instrument of government The instrument of government Cromwell had formerly extolled as the most perfect work of human invention he now represented it as a rotten plank upon which no man could trust himself without sinking Even the humble petition and advice which he extolled in its turn appeared so lame and imperfect that it was found requisite this very session to mend it by a supplement and after all it may be regarded as a crude and undigested model of government It was however accepted for the voluntary deed of the whole people in the three united nations and Cromwell as if his power had just commenced from this popular consent was anew inaugurated in Westminster Hall after the most solemn and most pompous manner The parliament having adjourned itself the protector deprived Lambert of all his commissions but still allowed him a considerable pension of two thousand pounds a year as a bribe for his future peaceable deportment Lambert s authority in the army to the surprise of every body was found immediately to expire with the loss of his commission Packet and some other officers whom Cromwell suspected were also displaced Richard eldest son of the protector was brought to court introduced into public business and thenceforth regarded by many as his heir in the protectorship though Cromwell sometimes employed the gross artifice of flattering others with hopes of the succession Richard was a person possessed of the most peaceable inoffensive unambitious character and had hitherto lived contentedly in the country on a small estate which his wife had brought him All the activity which he discovered and which never was great was however exerted to beneficent purposes at the time of the king s trial he had fallen on his knees before his father and had conjured him by every tie of duty and humanity to spare the life of that monarch Cromwell had two daughters unmarried one of them he now gave in marriage to the grandson and heir of his great friend the earl of Warwick with whom he had in every fortune preserved an uninterrupted intimacy and good correspondence The other he married to the viscount Fauconberg of a family formerly devoted to the royal party He was ambitious of forming connections with the nobility and it was one chief motive for his desiring the title of king that he might replace every thing in its natural order and restore to the ancient families the trust and honor of which he now found himself obliged for his own safety to deprive them The parliament was again assembled consisting as in the times of monarchy of two houses the commons and the other house Cromwell during the interval had sent writs to his house of peers which consisted of sixty members They were composed of five or six ancient peers of several gentlemen of fortune and distinction and of some officers who had risen from the meanest stations None of the ancient peers however though summoned by writ would deign to accept of a seat which they must share with such companions as were assigned them The protector endeavored at first to maintain the appearance of a legal magistrate He placed no guard at the door of either house but soon found how incompatible liberty is with military usurpations By bringing so great a number of his friends and adherents into the other house he had lost the majority among the national representatives In consequence of a clause in the humble petition and advice the commons assumed a power of readmitting those members whom the council had formerly excluded Sir Arthur Hazelrig and some others whom Cromwell had created lords rather chose to take their seat with the commons An incontestable majority now declared themselves against the protector and they refused to acknowledge the jurisdiction of that other house which he had established Even the validity of the humble petition and advice was questioned as being voted by a parliament which lay under force and which was deprived by military violence of a considerable number of its members The protector dreading combinations between the parliament and the malecontents in the army resolved to allow no leisure for forming any conspiracy against him and with expressions of great displeasure he dissolved the parliament When urged by Fleetwood and others of his friends not to precipitate himself into this rash measure he swore by the living God that they should not sit a moment longer These distractions at home were not able to take off the protector s attention from foreign affairs and in all his measures he proceeded with the same vigor and enterprise as if secure of the duty and attachment of the three kingdoms His alliance with Sweden he still supported and he endeavored to assist that crown in its successful enterprises for reducing all its neighbors to subjection and rendering itself absolute master of the Baltic As soon as Spain declared war against him he concluded a peace and an alliance with France and united himself in all his counsels with that potent and ambitious kingdom Spain having long courted in vain the friendship of the successful usurper was reduced at last to apply to the unfortunate prince Charles formed a league with Philip removed his small court to Bruges in the Low Countries and raised four regiments of his own subjects whom he employed in the Spanish service The duke of York who had with applause served some campaigns in the French army and who had merited the particular esteem of Marshal Turenne now joined his brother and continued to seek military experience under Don John of Austria and the prince of Conde The scheme of foreign politics adopted by the protector was highly imprudent but was suitable to that magnanimity and enterprise with which he was so signally endowed He was particularly desirous of conquest and dominion on the continent and he sent over into Flanders six thousand men under Reynolds who joined the French army commanded by Turenne In the former campaign Mardyke was taken and put into the hands of the English Early this campaign siege was laid to Dunkirk and when the Spanish army advanced to relieve it the combined armies of France and England marched out of their trenches and fought the battle of the Dunes where the Spaniards were totally defeated He aspired to get possession of Elsinore and the passage of the Sound See World s Mistake in Oliver Cromwell He also endeavored to get possession of Bremen Thurloe vol vi p four hundred seventy eight It was remarked by the saints of that time that the battle was fought on a day which was held for a fast in London so that as Fleetwood said Thurloe vol vii p one hundred fifty nine while we were praying they were fighting and the Lord hath given a signal answer The Lord has not only owned us in our work there but in our waiting upon him in a way of prayer which is indeed our old experienced approved way in all streights and difficulties Cromwell s letter to Blake and Montague his brave admirals is remarkable for the same spirit Thurloe vol iv p seven hundred forty four You have says he as I verily believe and am persuaded a plentiful stock of prayers going for you daily sent up by the soberest and most approved ministers and Christians in this nation and notwithstanding some discouragements very much wrestling of faith for you which are to us and I trust will be to you matter of great encouragement But notwithstanding all this it will be good for you and us to deliver up ourselves and all our affairs to the disposition of our all wise Father who not only out of prerogative but because of his goodness wisdom and truth ought to be resigned unto by his creatures especially those who are children of his begetting through the spirit et cetera The valor of the English was much remarked on this occasion Dunkirk being soon after surrendered was by agreement delivered to Cromwell He committed the government of that important place to Lockhart a Scotchman of abilities who had married his niece and was his ambassador at the court of France This acquisition was regarded by the protector as the means only of obtaining further advantages He was resolved to concert measures with the French court for the final conquest and partition of the Low Countries Had he lived much longer and maintained his authority in England so chimerical or rather so dangerous a project would certainly have been carried into execution And this first and principal step towards more extensive conquest which France during a whole century has never yet been able by an infinite expense of blood and treasure fully to attain had at once been accomplished by the enterprising though unskilful politics of Cromwell During these transactions great demonstrations of mutual friendship and regard passed between the French king and the protector Lord Fauconberg Cromwell s son in law was despatched to Louis then in the camp before Dunkirk and was received with the regard usually paid to foreign princes by the French court Mazarine sent to London his nephew Mancini along with the duke of Crequi and expressed his regret that his urgent affairs should deprive him of the honor which he had long wished for of paying in person his respects to the greatest man in the world Thurloe vol i p seven hundred sixty two Thurloe vol vii p one hundred fifty one one hundred fifty eight In reality the cardinal had not entertained so high an idea of Cromwell He used to say that he was a fortunate madman Vie de Cromwell par Raguenet See also Carte s Collection vol ii p eighty one Gumble s Life of Monk p ninety three World s Mistake in Oliver Cromwell The protector reaped little satisfaction from the success of his arms abroad the situation in which he stood at home kept him in perpetual uneasiness and inquietude His administration so expensive both by military enterprises and secret intelligence had exhausted his revenue and involved him in a considerable debt The royalists he heard had renewed their conspiracies for a general insurrection and Ormond was secretly come over with a view of concerting measures for the execution of this project Lord Fairfax Sir William Waller and many heads of the Presbyterians had secretly entered into the engagement Even the army was infected with the general spirit of discontent and some sudden and dangerous eruption was every moment to be dreaded from it No hopes remained after his violent breach with the last parliament that he should ever be able to establish with general consent a legal settlement or temper the military with any mixture of civil authority All his arts and policy were exhausted and having so often by fraud and false pretences deceived every party and almost every individual he could no longer hope by repeating the same professions to meet with equal confidence and regard However zealous the royalists their conspiracy took not effect Willis discovered the whole to the protector Ormond was obliged to fly and he deemed himself fortunate to have escaped so vigilant an administration Great numbers were thrown into prison A high court of justice was anew erected for the trial of those criminals whose guilt was most apparent Notwithstanding the recognition of his authority by the last parliament the protector could not as yet trust to an unbiased jury Sir Henry Slingsby and doctor Huet were condemned and beheaded Mordaunt brother to the earl of Peterborough narrowly escaped The numbers for his condemnation and his acquittal were equal and just as the sentence was pronounced in his favor Colonel Pride who was resolved to condemn him came into court Ashton Storey and Bestley were hanged in different streets of the city The conspiracy of the Millenarians in the army struck Cromwell with still greater apprehensions Harrison and the other discarded officers of that party could not remain at rest Stimulated equally by revenge by ambition and by conscience they still harbored in their breast some desperate project and there wanted not officers in the army who from like motives were disposed to second all their undertakings The levellers and agitators had been encouraged by Cromwell to interpose with their advice in all political deliberations and he had even pretended to honor many of them with his intimate friendship while he conducted his daring enterprises against the king and the parliament It was a usual practice with him in order to familiarize himself the more with the agitators who were commonly corporals or sergeants to take them to bed with him and there after prayers and exhortations to discuss together their projects and principles political as well as religious Having assumed the dignity of protector he excluded them from all his councils and had neither leisure nor inclination to indulge them any further in their wonted familiarities Among those who were enraged at this treatment was Sexby an active agitator who now employed against him all that restless industry which had formerly been exerted in his favor He even went so far as to enter into a correspondence with Spain and Cromwell who knew the distempers of the army was justly afraid of some mutiny to which a day an hour an instant might provide leaders Of assassinations likewise he was apprehensive from the zealous spirit which actuated the soldiers Sindercome had undertaken to murder him and by the most unaccountable accidents had often been prevented from executing his bloody purpose His design was discovered but the protector could never find the bottom of the enterprise nor detect any of his accomplices He was tried by a jury and notwithstanding the general odium attending that crime notwithstanding the clear and full proof of his guilt so little conviction prevailed of the protector s right to the supreme government it was with the utmost difficulty that this conspirator was condemned When every thing was prepared for his execution he was found dead from poison as is supposed which he had voluntarily taken Thurloe voL vi p fifty three The protector might better have supported those fears and apprehensions which the public distempers occasioned had he enjoyed any domestic satisfaction or possessed any cordial friend of his own family in whose bosom he could safely have unloaded his anxious and corroding cares But Fleetwood his son in law actuated by the wildest zeal began to estrange himself from him and was enraged to discover that Cromwell in all his enterprises had entertained views of promoting his own grandeur more than of encouraging piety and religion of which he made such fervent professions His eldest daughter married to Fleetwood had adopted republican principles so vehement that she could not with patience behold power lodged in a single person even in her indulgent father His other daughters were no less prejudiced in favor of the royal cause and regretted the violences and iniquities into which they thought their family had so unhappily been transported Above all the sickness of missus Claypole his peculiar favorite a lady endued with many humane virtues and amiable accomplishments depressed his anxious mind and poisoned all his enjoyments She had entertained a high regard for doctor Huet lately executed and being refused his pardon the melancholy of her temper increased by her distempered body had prompted her to lament to her father all his sanguinary measures and urge him to compunction for those heinous crimes into which his fatal ambition had betrayed him Her death which followed soon after gave new edge to every word which she had uttered All composure of mind was now forever fled from the protector he felt that the grandeur which he had attained with so much guilt and courage could not insure him that tranquillity which it belongs to virtue alone and moderation fully to ascertain Overwhelmed with the load of public affairs dreading perpetually some fatal accident in his distempered government seeing nothing around him but treacherous friends or enraged enemies possessing the confidence of no party resting his title on no principle civil or religious he found his power to depend on so delicate a poise of factions and interests as the smallest event was able without any preparation in a moment to overturn Death too which with such signal intrepidity he had braved in the field being incessantly threatened by the poniards of fanatical or interested assassins was ever present to his terrified apprehension and haunted him in every scene of business or repose Each action of his life betrayed the terrors under which he labored The aspect of strangers was uneasy to him with a piercing and anxious eye he surveyed every face to which he was not daily accustomed He never moved a step without strong guards attending him he wore armor under his clothes and further secured himself by offensive weapons a sword falchion and pistols which he always carried about him He returned from no place by the direct road or by the same way which he went Every journey he performed with hurry and precipitation Seldom he slept above three nights together in the same chamber and he never let it be known beforehand what chamber he intended to choose nor intrusted himself in any which was not provided with back doors at which sentinels were carefully placed Society terrified him while he reflected on his numerous unknown and implacable enemies solitude astonished him by withdrawing that protection which he found so necessary for his security His body also from the contagion of his anxious mind began to be affected and his health seemed sensibly to decline He was seized with a slow fever which changed into a tertian ague For the space of a week no dangerous symptoms appeared and in the intervals of the fits he was able to walk abroad At length the fever increased and he himself began to entertain some thoughts of death and to cast his eye towards that future existence whose idea had once been intimately present to him though since in the hurry of affairs and the shock of wars and factions it had no doubt been considerably obliterated He asked Goodwin one of his preachers if the doctrine were true that the elect could never fall or suffer a final reprobation Nothing more certain replied the preacher Then I am safe said the protector for I am sure that once I was in a state of grace His physicians were sensible of the perilous condition to which his distemper had reduced him but his chaplains by their prayers visions and revelations so buoyed up his hopes that he began to believe his life out of all danger A favorable answer it was pretended had been returned by Heaven to the petitions of all the godly and he relied on their asseverations much more than on the opinion of the most experienced physicians I tell you he cried with confidence to the latter I tell you I shall not die of this distemper I am well assured of my recovery It is promised by the Lord not only to my supplications but to those of men who hold a stricter commerce and more intimate correspondence with him Ye may have skill in your profession but nature can do more than all the physicians in the world and God is far above nature Nay to such a degree of madness did their enthusiastic assurances mount that upon a fast day which was observed on his account both at Hampton Court and at Whitehall they did not so much pray for his health as give thanks for the undoubted pledges which they had received of his recovery He himself was overheard offering up his addresses to Heaven and so far had the illusions of fanaticism prevailed over the plainest dictates of natural morality that he assumed more the character of a mediator in interceding for his people than that of a criminal whose atrocious violation of social duty had from every tribunal human and divine merited the severest vengeance Bates See also Ihurloe vol vii p three hundred fifty six four hundred sixteen Meanwhile all the symptoms began to wear a more fatal aspect and the physicians were obliged to break silence and to declare that the protector could not survive the next fit with which he was threatened The council was alarmed A deputation was sent to know his will with regard to his successor His senses were gone and he could not now express his intentions They asked him whether he did not mean that his eldest son Richard should succeed him in the protectorship A simple affirmative was or seemed to be extorted from him Soon after on the third of September that very day which he had always considered as the most fortunate for him he expired A violent tempest which immediately succeeded his death served as a subject of discourse to the vulgar His partisans as well as his enemies were fond of remarking this event and each of them endeavored by forced inferences to interpret it as a confirmation of their particular prejudices The writers attached to the memory of this wonderful person make his character with regard to abilities bear the air of the most extravagant panegyric his enemies form such a representation of his moral qualities as resembles the most virulent invective Both of them it must be confessed are supported by such striking circumstances in his conduct and fortune as bestow on their representation a great air of probability What can be more extraordinary it is said than that a person of private birth and education no fortune no eminent qualities of body which have sometimes nor shining talents of mind which have often raised men to the highest dignities should have the courage to attempt and the abilities to execute so great a design as the subverting one of the most ancient and best established monarchies in the world That he should have the power and boldness to put his prince and master to an open and infamous death Should banish that numerous and strongly allied family Cover all these temerities under a seeming obedience to a parliament in whose service he pretended to be retained Trample too upon that parliament in their turn and scornfully expel them as soon as they gave him ground of dissatisfaction Erect in their place the dominion of the saints and give reality to the most visionary idea which the heated imagination of any fanatic was ever able to entertain Suppress again that monster in its infancy and openly set up himself above all things that ever were called sovereign in England Overcome first all his enemies by arms and all his friends afterwards by artifice Serve all parties patiently for a while and command them victoriously at last Overrun each corner of the three nations and subdue with equal facility both the riches of the south and the poverty of the north Be feared and courted by all foreign princes and be adopted a brother to the gods of the earth Call together parliaments with a word of his pen and scatter them again with the breath of his mouth Reduce to subjection a warlike and discontented nation by means of a mutinous army Command a mutinous army by means of seditious and factious officers Be humbly and daily petitioned that he would be pleased at the rate of millions a year to be hired as master of those who had hired him before to be their servant Have the estates and lives of three nations as much at his disposal as was once the little inheritance of his father and be as noble and liberal in the spending of them And lastly for there is no end of enumerating every particular of his glory with one word bequeath all this power and splendor to his posterity He possessed of peace at home and triumph abroad Be buried among kings and with more than regal solemnity and leave a name behind him not to be extinguished but with the whole world which as it was too little for his praise so might it have been for his conquests if the short line of his mortal life could have stretched out to the extent of his immortal designs Cowley s Discourses This passage is altered in some particulars from the original My intention is not to disfigure this picture drawn by so masterly a hand I shall only endeavor to remove from it somewhat of the marvellous a circumstance which on all occasions gives much ground for doubt and suspicion It seems to me that the circumstance of Cromwell s life in which his abilities are principally discovered is his rising from a private station in opposition to so many rivals so much advanced before him to a high command and authority in the army His great courage his signal military talents his eminent dexterity and address were all requisite for this important acquisition Yet will not this promotion appear the effect of supernatural abilities when we consider that Fairfax himself a private gentleman who had not the advantage of a seat in parliament had through the same steps attained even a superior rank and if endued with common capacity and penetration had been able to retain it To incite such an army to rebellion against the parliament required no uncommon art or industry to have kept them in obedience had been the more difficult enterprise When the breach was once formed between the military and civil powers a supreme and absolute authority from that moment is devolved on the general and if he be afterwards pleased to employ artifice or policy it may be regarded on most occasions as great condescension if not as superfluous caution That Cromwell was ever able really to blind or overreach either the king or the republicans does not appear as they possessed no means of resisting the force under his command they were glad to temporize with him and by seeming to be deceived wait for opportunities of freeing themselves from his dominion If he seduced the military fanatics it is to be considered that their interests and his evidently concurred that their ignorance and low education exposed them to the grossest imposition and that he himself was at bottom as frantic an enthusiast as the worst of them and in order to obtain their confidence needed but to display those vulgar and ridiculous habits which he had early acquired and on which he set so high a value An army is so forcible and at the same time so coarse a weapon that any hand which wields it may without much dexterity perform any operation and attain any ascendant in human society The domestic administration of Cromwell though it discovers great abilities was conducted without any plan either of liberty or arbitrary power perhaps his difficult situation admitted of neither His foreign enterprises though full of intrepidity were pernicious to national interest and seem more the result of impetuous fury or narrow prejudices than of cool foresight and deliberation An eminent personage however he was in many respects and even a superior genius but unequal and irregular in his operations And though not defective in any talent except that of elocution the abilities which in him were most admirable and which most contributed to his marvellous success were the magnanimous resolution of his enterprises and his peculiar dexterity in discovering the characters and practising on the weaknesses of mankind If we survey the moral character of Cromwell with that indulgence which is due to the blindness and infirmities of the human species we shall not be inclined to load his memory with such violent reproaches as those which his enemies usually throw upon it Amidst the passions and prejudices of that period that he should prefer the parliamentary to the royal cause will not appear extraordinary since even at present some men of sense and knowledge are disposed to think that the question with regard to the justice of the quar rel may be regarded as doubtful and uncertain The murder of the king the most atrocious of all his actions was to him covered under a mighty cloud of republican and fanatical illusions and it is not impossible but he might believe it as many others did the most meritorious action that he could perform His subsequent usurpation was the effect of necessity as well as of ambition nor is it easy to see how the various factions could at that time have been restrained without a mixture of military and arbitrary authority The private deportment of Cromwell as a son a husband a father a friend is exposed to no considerable censure if it does not rather merit praise And upon the whole his character does not appear more extraordinary and unusual by the mixture of so much absurdity with so much penetration than by his tempering such violent ambition and such enraged fanaticism with so much regard to justice and humanity Cromwell was in the fifty ninth year of his age when he died He was of a robust frame of body and of a manly though not of an agreeable aspect He left only two sons Richard and Henry and three daughters one married to General Fleetwood another to Lord Fauconberg a third to Lord Rich His father died when he was very young His mother lived till after he was protector and contrary to her orders he buried her with great pomp in Westminster Abbey She could not be persuaded that his power or person was ever in safety At every noise which she heard she exclaimed that her son was murdered and was never satisfied that he was alive if she did not receive frequent visits from him She was a decent woman and by her frugality and industry had raised and educated a numerous family upon a small fortune She had even been obliged to set up a brewery at Huntingdon which she managed to good advantage Hence Cromwell in the invectives of that age is often stigmatized with the name of the brewer Ludlow by way of insult mentions the great accession which he would receive to his royal revenues upon his mother s death who possessed a jointure of sixty pounds a year upon his estate She was of a good family of the name of Stuart remotely allied as is by some supposed to the royal family CHAPTER LXII THE COMMONWEALTH All the arts of Cromwell s policy had been so often practised that they began to lose their effect and his power instead of being confirmed by time and success seemed every day to become more uncertain and precarious His friends the most closely connected with him and his counsellors the most trusted were entering into cabals against his authority and with all his penetration into the characters of men he could not find any ministers on whom he could rely Men of probity and honor he knew would not submit to be the instruments of a usurpation violent and illegal those who were free from the restraint of principle might betray from interest that cause in which from no better motives they had enlisted themselves Even those on whom he conferred any favor never deemed the recompense an equivalent for the sacrifices which they made to obtain it whoever was refused any demand justified his anger by the specious colors of conscience and of duty Such difficulties surrounded the protector that his dying at so critical a time is esteemed by many the most fortunate circumstance that ever attended him and it was thought that all his courage and dexterity could not much longer have extended his usurped administration But when that potent hand was removed which conducted the government every one expected a sudden dissolution of the unwieldy and ill jointed fabric Richard a young man of no experience educated in the country accustomed to a retired life unacquainted with the officers and unknown to them recommended by no military exploits endeared by no familiarities could not long it was thought maintain that authority which his father had acquired by so many valorous achievements and such signal successes And when it was observed that he possessed only the virtues of private life which in his situation were so many vices that indolence incapacity irresolution attended his facility and good nature the various hopes of men were excited by the expectation of some great event or revolution For some time however the public was disappointed in this opinion The council recognized the succession of Richard Fleetwood in whose favor it was supposed Cromwell had formerly made a will renounced all claim or pretension to the protectorship Henry Richard s brother who governed Ireland with popularity insured him the obedience of that kingdom Monk whose authority was well established in Scotland being much attached to the family of Cromwell immediately proclaimed the new protector the army every where the fleet acknowledged his title above ninety addresses from the counties and most considerable corporations congratulated him on his accession in all the terms of dutiful allegiance foreign ministers were forward in paying him the usual compliments and Richard whose moderate unambitious character never would have led him to contend for empire was tempted to accept of so rich an inheritance which seemed to be tendered to him by the consent of all mankind It was found necessary to call a parliament in order to furnish supplies both for the ordinary administration and for fulfilling those engagements with foreign princes particularly Sweden into which the late protector had entered In hopes of obtaining greater influence in elections the ancient right was restored to all the small boroughs and the counties were allowed no more than their usual members The house of peers or the other house consisted of the same persons that had been appointed by Oliver All the commons at first signed without hesitation an engagement not to alter the present government They next proceeded to examine the humble petition and advice and after great opposition and many vehement debates it was at length with much difficulty carried by the court party to confirm it An acknowledgment too of the authority of the other house was extorted from them though it was resolved not to treat this house of peers with any greater respect than they should return to the commons A declaration was also made that the establishment of the other house should nowise prejudice the right of such of the ancient peers as had from the beginning of the war adhered to the parliament But in all these proceedings the opposition among the commons was so considerable and the debates were so much prolonged that all business was retarded and great alarm given to the partisans of the young protector But there was another quarter from which greater dangers were justly apprehended The most considerable officers of the army and even Fleetwood brother in law to the protector were entering into cabals against him No character in human society is more dangerous than that of the fanatic because if attended with weak judgment he is exposed to the suggestions of others if supported by more discernment he is entirely governed by his own illusions which sanctify his most selfish views and passions Fleetwood was of the former species and as he was extremely addicted to a republic and even to the fifth monarchy or dominion of the saints it was easy for those who had insinuated themselves into his confidence to instil disgusts against the dignity of protector The whole republican party in the army which was still considerable Fitz Mason Moss Farley united themselves to that general The officers too of the same party whom Cromwell had discarded Overton Ludlow Rich Okey Alured began to appear and to recover that authority which had been only for a time suspended A party likewise who found themselves eclipsed in Richard s favor Sydenham Kelsey Berry Haines joined the cabal of the others Even Desborow the protector s uncle lent his authority to that faction But above all the intrigues of Lambert who was now roused from his retreat inflamed all those dangerous humors and threatened the nation with some great convulsion The discontented officers established their meetings in Fleetwood s apartments and because he dwelt in Wallingford House the party received a denomination from that place Richard who possessed neither resolution nor penetration was prevailed on to give an unguarded consent for calling a general council of officers who might make him proposals as they pretended for the good of the army No sooner were they assembled than they voted a remonstrance They there lamented that the good old cause as they termed it that is the cause for which they had engaged against the late king was entirely neglected and they proposed as a remedy that the whole military power should be intrusted to some person in whom they might all confide The city militia influenced by two aldermen Tichburn and Ireton expressed the same resolution of adhering to the good old cause The protector was justly alarmed at those movements among the officers The persons in whom he chiefly confided were all of them excepting Broghill men of civil characters and professions Fiennes Thurloe Whitlocke Wolseley who could only assist him with their advice and opinion He possessed none of those arts which were proper to gain an enthusiastic army Murmurs being thrown out against some promotions which he had made Would you have me said he prefer none but the godly Here is Dick Ingoldsby continued he who can neither pray nor preach yet will I trust him before ye all This imprudence gave great offence to the pretended saints The other qualities of the protector were correspondent to these sentiments he was of a gentle humane and generous disposition Some of his party offering to put an end to those intrigues by the death of Lambert he declared that he would not purchase power or dominion by such sanguinary measures The parliament was no less alarmed at the military cabals They voted that there should be no meeting or general council of officers except with the protector s consent or by his orders This vote brought affairs immediately to a rupture The officers hastened to Richard and demanded of him the dissolution of the parliament Desborow a man of a clownish and brutal nature threatened him if he should refuse compliance The protector wanted the resolution to deny and possessed little ability to resist The parliament was dissolved and by the same act the protector was by every one considered as effectually dethroned Soon after he signed his demission in form Henry the deputy of Ireland was endowed with the same moderate disposition as Richard but as he possessed more vigor and capacity it was apprehended that he might make resistance His popularity in Ireland was great and even his personal authority notwithstanding his youth was considerable Had his ambition been very eager he had no doubt been able to create disturbance but being threatened by Sir Hardress Waller Colonel John Jones and other officers he very quietly resigned his command and retired to England He had once entertained thoughts which he had not resolution to execute of proclaiming the king in Dublin Ludlow Carte s Collections vol ii p two hundred forty three Thus fell suddenly and from an enormous height but by a rare fortune without any hurt or injury the family of the Cromwells Richard continued to possess an estate which was moderate and burdened too with a large debt which he had contracted for the interment of his father After the restoration though he remained unmolested he thought proper to travel for some years and at Pezenas in Languedoc he was introduced under a borrowed name to the prince of Conti That prince talking of English affairs broke out into admiration of Cromwell s courage and capacity But as for that poor pitiful fellow Richard said he what has become of him How could he be such a blockhead as to reap no greater benefit from all his father s crimes and successes Richard extended his peaceful and quiet life to an extreme old age and died not till the latter end of Queen Anne s reign His social virtues more valuable than the greatest capacity met with a recompense more precious than noisy fame and more suitable contentment and tranquillity The council of officers now possessed of supreme authority deliberated what form of government they should establish Many of them seemed inclined to exercise the power of the sword in the most open manner but as it was apprehended that the people would with great difficulty be induced to pay taxes levied by arbitrary will and pleasure it was agreed to preserve the shadow of civil administration and to revive the long parliament which had been expelled by Cromwell That assembly could not be dissolved it was asserted but by their own consent and violence had interrupted but was not able to destroy their right to government The officers also expected that as these members had sufficiently felt their own weakness they would be contented to act in subordination to the military commanders and would thenceforth allow all the authority to remain where the power was so visibly vested The officers applied to Lenthal the speaker and proposed to him that the parliament should resume their seats Lenthal was of a low timid spirit and being uncertain what issue might attend these measures was desirous of evading the proposal He replied that he could by no means comply with the desire of the officers being engaged in a business of far greater importance to himself which he could not omit on any account because it concerned the salvation of his own soul The officers pressed him to tell what it might be He was preparing he said to participate of the Lord s supper which he resolved to take next Sabbath They insisted that mercy was preferable to sacrifice and that he could not better prepare himself for that great duty than by contributing so the public service All their remonstrances had no effect However on the appointed day the speaker being informed that a quorum of the house was likely to meet thought proper notwithstanding the salvation of his soul as Ludlow observes to join them and the house immediately proceeded upon business The secluded members attempted but in vain to resume their seats among them The numbers of this parliament were small little exceeding seventy members the authority in the nation ever since they had been purged by the army was extremely diminished and after their expulsion had been totally annihilated but being all of them men of violent ambition some of them men of experience and capacity they were resolved since they enjoyed the title of the supreme authority and observed that some appearance of a parliament was requisite for the purposes of the army not to act a subordinate part to those who acknowledged themselves their servants They chose a council in which they took care that the officers of Wallingford House should not be the majority they appointed Fleetwood lieutenant general but inserted in his commission that it should only continue during the pleasure of the house they chose seven persons who should nominate to such commands as became vacant and they voted that all commissions should be received from the speaker and be signed by him in the name of the house These precautions the tendency of which was visible gave great disgust to the general officers and their discontent would immediately have broken out into some resolution fatal to the parliament had it not been checked by the apprehensions of danger from the common enemy The bulk of the nation consisted of royalists and Presbyterians and to both these parties the dominion of the pretended parliament had ever been to the last degree odious When that assembly was expelled by Cromwell contempt had succeeded to hatred and no reserve had been used in expressing the utmost derision against the impotent ambition of these usurpers Seeing them reinstated in authority all orders of men felt the highest indignation together with apprehensions lest such tyrannical rulers should exert their power by taking vengeance upon their enemies who had so openly insulted them A secret reconciliation therefore was made between the rival parties and it was agreed that burying former enmities in oblivion all efforts should be used for the overthrow of the rump so they called the parliament in allusion to that part of the animal body The Presbyterians sensible from experience that their passion for liberty how ever laudable had carried them into unwarrantable excesses were willing to lay aside ancient jealousies and at all hazards to restore the royal family The nobility the gentry bent their passionate endeavors to the same enterprise by which alone they could be redeemed from slavery And no man was so remote from party so indifferent to public good as not to feel the most ardent wishes for the dissolution of that tyranny which whether the civil or the military part of it were considered appeared equally oppressive and ruinous to the nation Mordaunt who had so narrowly escaped on his trial before the high court of justice seemed rather animated than daunted with past danger and having by his resolute behavior obtained the highest confidence of the royal party he was now become the centre of all their conspiracies In many counties a resolution was taken to rise in arms Lord Willoughby of Parham and Sir Horatio Townshend undertook to secure Lynne General Massey engaged to seize Gloucester Lord Newport Littleton and other gentlemen conspired to take possession of Shrewsbury Sir George Booth of Chester Sir Thomas Middleton of North Wales Arundel Pollar Granville Trelawney of Plymouth and Exeter A day was appointed for the execution of all these enterprises And the king attended by the duke of York had secretly arrived at Calais with a resolution of putting himself at the head of his loyal subjects The French court had promised to supply him with a small body of forces in order to countenance the insurrections of the English This combination was disconcerted by the infidelity of Sir Richard Willis That traitor continued with the parliament the same correspondence which he had begun with Cromwell He had engaged to reveal all conspiracies so far as to destroy their effect but reserved to himself if he pleased the power of concealing the conspirators He took care never to name any of the old genuine cavaliers who had zealously adhered and were resolved still to adhere to the royal cause in every fortune These men he esteemed these he even loved He betrayed only the new converts among the Presbyterians or such lukewarm royalists as discouraged with their disappointments were resolved to expose themselves to no more hazards a lively proof how impossible it is even for the most corrupted minds to divest themselves of all regard to morality and social duty Many of the conspirators in the different counties were thrown into prison others astonished at such symptoms of secret treachery left their houses or remained quiet the most tempestuous weather prevailed during the whole time appointed for the rendezvouses insomuch that some found it impossible to join their friends and others were dismayed with fear and superstition at an incident so unusual during the summer season Of all the projects the only one which took effect was that of Sir George Booth for the seizing of Chester The earl of Derby Lord Herbert of Cherbury mister Lee Colonel Morgan entered into this enterprise Sir William Middleton joined Booth with some troops from North Wales and the malecontents were powerful enough to subdue all in that neighborhood who ventured to oppose them In their declaration they made no mention of the king they only demanded a free and full parliament The parliament was justly alarmed How combustible the materials they well knew and the fire was now fallen among them Booth was of a family eminently Presbyterian and his conjunction with the royalists they regarded as a dangerous symptom They had many officers whose fidelity they could more depend on than that of Lambert but there was no one in whose vigilance and capacity they reposed such confidence They commissioned him to suppress the rebels He made incredible haste Booth imprudently ventured himself out of the walls of Chester and exposed in the open field his raw troops against these hardy veterans He was soon routed and taken prisoner His whole army was dispersed And the parliament had no further occupation than to fill all the jails with their open or secret enemies Designs were even entertained of transporting the loyal families to Barbadoes Jamaica and the other colonies lest they should propagate in England children of the same malignant affections with themselves This success hastened the ruin of the parliament Lambert at the head of a body of troops was no less dangerous to them than Booth A thousand pounds which they sent him to buy a jewel were employed by him in liberalities to his officers At his instigation they drew up a petition and transmitted it to Fleetwood a weak man and an honest if sincerity in folly deserve that honorable name The import of this petition was that Fleetwood should be made commander in chief Lambert major general Desborow lieutenant general of the horse Monk major general of the foot To which a demand was added that no officer should be dismissed from his command but by a court martial The parliament alarmed at the danger immediately cashiered Lambert Desborow Berry Clarke Barrow Kelsey Cobbet Sir Arthur Hazelrig proposed the impeachment of Lambert for high treason Fleetwood s commission was vacated and the command of the army was vested in seven persons of whom that general was one The parliament voted that they would have no more general officers And they declared it high treason to levy any money without consent of parliament But these votes were feeble weapons in opposition to the swords of the soldiery Lambert drew some troops together in order to decide the controversy Okey who was leading his regiment to the assistance of the parliament was deserted by them Morley and Moss brought their regiments into Palace yard resolute to oppose the violence of Lambert But that artful general knew an easy way of disappointing them He placed his soldiers in the streets which led to Westminster Hall When the speaker came in his coach he ordered the horses to be turned and very civilly conducted him home The other members were in like manner intercepted And the two regiments in Palace yard observing that they were exposed to derision peaceably retired to their quarters A little before this bold enterprise a solemn fast had been kept by the army and it is remarked that this ceremony was the usual prelude to every signal violence which they committed The officers found themselves again invested with supreme authority of which they intended forever to retain the substance however they might bestow on others the empty shadow or appearance They elected a committee of twenty three persons of whom seven were officers These they pretended to invest with sovereign authority and they called them a committee of safety They spoke every where of summoning a parliament chosen by the people but they really took some steps towards assembling a military parliament composed of officers elected from every regiment in the service Ludlow Throughout the three kingdoms there prevailed nothing but the melancholy fears to the nobility and gentry of a bloody massacre and extermination to the rest of the people of perpetual servitude beneath those sanctified robbers whose union and whose divisions would be equally destructive and who under pretence of superior illuminations would soon extirpate if possible all private morality as they had already done all public law and justice from the British dominions During the time that England continued in this distracted condition the other kingdoms of Europe were hastening towards a composure of those differences by which they had so long been agitated The parliament while it preserved authority instead of following the imprudent politics of Cromwell and lending assistance to the conquering Swede embraced the maxims of the Dutch commonwealth and resolved in conjunction with that state to mediate by force an accommodation between the northern crowns Montague was sent with a squadron to the Baltic and carried with him as ambassador Algernon Sidney the celebrated republican Sidney found the Swedish monarch employed in the siege of Copenhagen the capital of his enemy and was highly pleased that with a Roman arrogance he could check the progress of royal victories and display in so signal a manner the superiority of freedom above tyranny With the highest indignation the ambitious prince was obliged to submit to the imperious mediation of the two commonwealths It is cruel said he that laws should be prescribed me by parricides and pedlers But his whole army was enclosed in an island and might be starved by the combined squadrons of England and Holland He was obliged therefore to quit his prey when he had so nearly gotten possession of it and having agreed to a pacification with Denmark he retired into his own country where he soon after died The wars between France and Spain were also concluded by the treaty of the Pyrenees These animosities had long been carried on between the rival states even while governed by a sister and brother who cordially loved and esteemed each other But politics which had so long prevailed over these friendly affections now at last yielded to their influence and never was the triumph more full and complete The Spanish Low Countries if not every part of that monarchy lay almost entirely at the mercy of its enemy Broken armies disordered finances slow and irresolute counsels by these resources alone were the dispersed provinces of Spain defended against the vigorous power of France But the queen regent anxious for the fate of her brother employed her authority with the cardinal to stop the progress of the French conquests and put an end to a quarrel which being commenced by ambition and attended with victory was at last concluded with moderation The young monarch of France though aspiring and warlike in his character was at this time entirely occupied in the pleasures of love and gallantry and had passively resigned the reins of empire into the hands of his politic minister And he remained an unconcerned spectator while an opportunity for conquest was parted with which he never was able during the whole course of his active reign fully to retrieve The ministers of the two crowns Mazarine and Don Louis de Haro met at the foot of the Pyrenees in the Isle of Pheasants a place which was supposed to belong to neither kingdom The negotiation being brought to an issue by frequent conferences between the ministers the monarchs themselves agreed to a congress and these two splendid courts appeared in their full lustre amidst those savage mountains Philip brought his daughter Mary Therese along with him and giving her in marriage to his nephew Louis endeavored to cement by this new tie the incompatible interests of the two monarchies The French king made a solemn renunciation of every succession which might accrue to him in right of his consort a vain formality too weak to restrain the ungoverned ambition of princes The affairs of England were in so great disorder that it was not possible to comprehend that kingdom in the treaty or adjust measures with a power which was in such incessant fluctuation The king reduced to despair by the failure of all enterprises for his restoration was resolved to try the weak resource of foreign succors and he went to the Pyrenees at the time when the two ministers were in the midst of their negotiations Don Louis received him with that generous civility peculiar to his nation and expressed great inclination had the low condition of Spain allowed him to give assistance to the distressed monarch The cautious Mazarine pleading the alliance of France with the English commonwealth refused even to see him and though the king offered to marry the cardinal s niece he could for the present obtain nothing but empty profusions of respect and protestations of services The condition of that monarch to all the world seemed totally desperate King James s Memoirs His friends had been baffled in every attempt for his service the scaffold had often streamed with the blood of the more active royalists the spirits of many were broken with tedious imprisonments the estates of all were burdened by the fines and confiscations which had been levied upon them no one durst openly avow himself of that party and so small did their number seem to a superficial view that even should the nation recover its liberty which was deemed nowise probable it was judged uncertain what form of government it would embrace But amidst all these gloomy prospects fortune by a surprising revolution was now paving the way for the king to mount in peace and triumph the throne of his ancestors It was by the prudence and loyalty of General Monk that this happy change was at last accomplished George Monk to whom the fate was reserved of reestablishing monarchy and finishing the bloody dissensions of three kingdoms was the second son of a family in Devonshire ancient and honorable but lately from too great hospitality and expense somewhat fallen to decay He betook himself in early youth to the profession of arms and was engaged in the unfortunate expeditions to Cadiz and the Isle of Rhe After England had concluded peace with all her neighbors he sought military experience in the Low Countries the great school of war to all the European nations and he rose to the command of a company under Lord Goring This company consisted of two hundred men of whom a hundred were volunteers often men of family and fortune sometimes noblemen who lived upon their own income in a splendid manner such a military turn at that time prevailed among the English When the sound of war was first heard in this island Monk returned to England partly desirous of promotion in his native country partly disgusted with some ill usage from the states of which he found reason to complain Upon the Scottish pacification he was employed by the earl of Leicester against the Irish rebels and having obtained a regiment was soon taken notice of for his military skill and for his calm and deliberate valor Without ostentation expense or caresses merely by his humane and equal temper he gained the good will of the soldiery who with a mixture of familiarity and affection usually called him honest George Monk an honorable appellation which they still continued to him even during his greatest elevation He was remarkable for his moderation in party and while all around him were inflamed into rage against the opposite faction he fell under suspicion from the candor and tranquillity of his behavior When the Irish army was called over into England surmises of this kind had been so far credited that he had even been suspended from his command and ordered to Oxford that he might answer the charge laid against him His established character for truth and sincerity here stood him in great stead and upon his earnest protestations and declarations he was soon restored to his regiment which he joined at the siege of Nantwich The day after his arrival Fairfax attacked and defeated the royalists commanded by Biron and took Colonel Monk prisoner He was sent to the Tower where he endured above two years all the rigors of poverty and confinement The king however was so mindful as to send him notwithstanding his own difficulties a present of one hundred guineas but it was not till after the royalists were totally subdued that he recovered his liberty Monk however distressed had always refused the most inviting offers from the parliament but Cromwell sensible of his merit having solicited him to engage in the wars against the Irish who were considered as rebels both by king and parliament he was not unwilling to repair his broken fortunes by accepting a command which he flattered himself was reconcilable to the strictest principles of honor Having once engaged with the parliament he was obliged to obey orders and found himself necessitated to fight both against the marquis of Ormond in Ireland and against the king himself in Scotland Upon the reduction of the latter kingdom Monk was left with the supreme command and by the equality and justice of his administration he was able to give contentment to that restless people now reduced to subjection by a nation whom they hated No less acceptable was his authority to the officers and soldiers and foreseeing that the good will of the army under his command might some time be of great service to him he had with much care and success cultivated their friendship The connections which he had formed with Cromwell his benefactor preserved him faithful to Richard who had been enjoined by his father to follow in every thing the directions of General Monk When the long parliament was restored Monk who was not prepared for opposition acknowledged their authority and was continued in his command from which it would not have been safe to attempt dislodging him After the army had expelled the parliament he protested against the violence and resolved as he pretended to vindicate their invaded privileges Deeper designs either in the king s favor or his own were from the beginning suspected to be the motive of his actions A rivalship had long subsisted between him and Lambert and every body saw the reason why he opposed the elevation of that ambitious general by whose success his own authority he knew would soon be subverted But little friendship had ever subsisted between him and the parliamentary leaders and it seemed nowise probable that he intended to employ his industry and spend his blood for the advancement of ene enemy above another How early he entertained designs for the king s restoration we know not with certainty it is likely that as soon as Richard was deposed he foresaw that without such an expedient it would be impossible ever to bring the nation to a regular settlement His elder and younger brothers were devoted to the royal cause the Granvilles his near relations and all the rest of his kindred were in the same interests he himself was intoxicated with no fumes of enthusiasm and had maintained no connections with any of the fanatical tribe His early engagements had been with the king and he had left that service without receiving any disgust from the royal family Since he had enlisted himself with the opposite party he had been guilty of no violence or rigor which might render him obnoxious His return therefore to loyalty was easy and open and nothing could be supposed to counterbalance his natural propensity to that measure except the views of his own elevation and the prospect of usurping the same grandeur and authority which had been assumed by Cromwell But from such exorbitant if not impossible projects the natural tranquillity and moderation of his temper the calmness and solidity of his genius not to mention his age now upon the decline seem to have set him at a distance Cromwell himself he always asserted could not long have maintained his usurpation and any other person even equal to him in genius it was obvious would now find it more difficult to practise arts of which every one from experience was sufficiently aware It is more agreeable therefore to reason as well as candor to suppose that Monk as soon as he put himself in motion had entertained views of effecting the king s restoration nor ought any objections derived from his profound silence even to Charles himself to be regarded as considerable His temper was naturally reserved his circumstances required dissimulation the king he knew was surrounded with spies and traitors and upon the whole it seems hard to interpret that conduct which ought to exalt our idea of his prudence as a disparagement of his probity Gumble s Life of Monk p ninety three Sir John Granville hoping that the general would engage in the king s service sent into Scotland his younger brother a clergyman doctor Monk who carried him a letter and invitation from the king When the doctor arrived he found that his brother was then holding a council of officers and was not to be seen for some hours In the mean time he was received and entertained by Price the general s chaplain a man of probity as well as a partisan of the king s The doctor having an entire confidence in the chaplain talked very freely to him about the object of his journey and engaged him if there should be occasion to second his applications At last the general arrives the brothers embrace and after some preliminary conversation the doctor opens his business Monk interrupted him to know whether he had ever before to any body mentioned the subject To nobody replied his brother but to Price whom I know to be entirely in your confidence The general altering his countenance turned the discourse and would enter into no further confidence with him but sent him away with the first opportunity He would not trust his own brother the moment he knew that he had disclosed the secret though to a man whom he himself could have trusted Lord Lansdowne s Defence of General Monk His conduct in all other particulars was full of the same reserve and prudence and no less was requisite for effecting the difficult work which he had undertaken All the officers in his army of whom he entertained any suspicion he immediately cashiered Cobbet who had been sent by the committee of safety under pretence of communicating their resolutions to Monk but really with a view of debauching his army he committed to custody he drew together the several scattered regiments he summoned an assembly somewhat resembling a convention of states and having communicated to them his resolution of marching into England he received a seasonable though no great supply of money Hearing that Lambert was advancing northward with his army Monk sent Cloberry and two other commissioners to London with large professions of his inclination to peace and with offers of terms for an accommodation His chief aim was to gain time and relax the preparations of his enemies The committee of safety fell into the snare A treaty was signed by Monk s commissioners but he refused to ratify it and complained that they had exceeded their powers He desired however to enter into a new negotiation at Newcastle The committee willingly accepted this fallacious offer Meanwhile these military sovereigns found themselves surrounded on all hands with inextricable difficulties The nation had fallen into total anarchy and by refusing the payment of all taxes reduced the army to the greatest necessities While Lambert s forces were assembling at Newcastle Hazelrig and Morley took possession of Portsmouth and declared for the parliament A party sent to suppress them was persuaded by their commander to join in the same declaration The city apprentices rose in a tumult and demanded a free parliament Though they were suppressed by Colonel Hewson a man who from the profession of a cobbler had risen to a high rank in the army the city still discovered symptoms of the most dangerous discontent It even established a kind of separate government and assumed the supreme authority within itself Admiral Lawson with his squadron came into the river and declared for the parliament Hazelrig and Morley hearing of this important event left Portsmouth and advanced towards London The regiments near that city being solicited by their old officers who had been cashiered by the committee of safety revolted again to the parliament Desborow s regiment being sent by Lambert to support his friends no sooner arrived at saint Albans than it declared for the same assembly Fleetwood s hand was found too weak and unstable to support this ill founded fabric which every where around him was falling into ruins When he received intelligence of any murmurs among the soldiers he would prostrate himself in prayer and could hardly be prevailed with to join the troops Even when among them he would in the midst of any discourse invite them all to prayer and put himself on his knees before them If any of his friends exhorted him to more vigor they could get no other answer than that God had spitten in his face and would not hear him Men now ceased to wonder why Lambert had promoted him to the office of general and had contented himself with the second command in the army Lenthal the speaker being invited by the officers again assumed authority and summoned together the parliament which twice before had been expelled with so much reproach and ignominy As soon as assembled they repealed their act against the payment of excise and customs they appointed commissioners for assigning quarters to the army and without taking any notice of Lambert they sent orders to the forces under his command immediately to repair to those quarters which were appointed them Lambert was now in a very disconsolate condition Monk he saw had passed the Tweed at Coldstream and was advancing upon him His own soldiers deserted him in great multitudes and joined the enemy Lord Fairfax too he heard had raised forces behind him and had possessed himself of York without declaring his purpose The last orders of the parliament so entirely stripped him of his army that there remained not with him above a hundred horse all the rest went to their quarters with quietness and resignation and he himself was some time after arrested and committed to the Tower The other officers who had formerly been cashiered by the parliament and who had resumed their commands that they might subdue that assembly were again cashiered and confined to their houses Sir Harry Vane and some members who had concurred with the committee of safety were ordered into a like confinement And the parliament now seemed to be again possessed of more absolute authority than ever and to be without any danger of opposition or control The republican party was at this time guided by two men Hazelrig and Vane who were of opposite characters and mortally hated each other Hazelrig who possessed greater authority in the parliament was haughty imperious precipitate vainglorious without civility without prudence qualified only by his noisy pertinacious obstinacy to acquire an ascendant in public assemblies Vane was noted in all civil transactions for temper insinuation address and a profound judgment in all religious speculations for folly and extravagance He was a perfect enthusiast and fancying that he was certainly favored with inspiration he deemed himself to speak in the language of the times to be a man above ordinances and by reason of his perfection to be unlimited and unrestrained by any rules which govern inferior mortals These whimseys mingling with pride had so corrupted his excellent understanding that sometimes he thought himself the person deputed to reign on earth for a thousand years over the whole congregation of the faithful Clarendon Monk though informed of the restoration of the parliament from whom he received no orders still advanced with his army which was near six thousand men the scattered forces in England were above five times more numerous Fairfax who had resolved to declare for the king not being able to make the general open his intentions retired to his own house in Yorkshire In all counties through which Monk passed the prime gentry flocked to him with addresses expressing their earnest desire that he would be instrumental in restoring the nation to peace and tranquillity and to the enjoyment of those liberties which by law were their birthright but of which during so many years they had been fatally bereaved and that in order to this salutary purpose he would prevail either for the restoring of those members who had been secluded before the king s death or for the election of a new parliament who might legally and by general consent again govern the nation Though Monk pretended not to favor these addresses that ray of hope which the knowledge of his character and situation afforded mightily animated all men The tyranny and the anarchy which now equally oppressed the kingdom the experience of past distractions the dread of future convulsions the indignation against military usurpation against sanctified hypocrisy all these motives had united every party except the most desperate into ardent wishes for the king s restoration the only remedy for all these fatal evils Scot and Robinson were sent as deputies by the parliament under pretence of congratulating the general but in reality to serve as spies upon him The city despatched four of their principal citizens to perform like compliments and at the same time to confirm the general in his inclination to a free parliament the object of all men s prayers and endeavors The authority of Monk could scarcely secure the parliamentary deputies from those insults which the general hatred and contempt towards their masters drew from men of every rank and denomination Monk continued his march with few interruptions till he reached saint Albans He there sent a message to the parliament desiring them to remove from London those regiments which though they now professed to return to their duty had so lately offered violence to that assembly This message was unexpected and exceedingly perplexed the house Their fate they found must still depend on a mercenary army and they were as distant as ever from their imaginary sovereignty However they found it necessary to comply The soldiers made more difficulty A mutiny arose among them One regiment in particular quartered in Somerset House expressly refused to yield their place to the northern army But those officers who would gladly on such an occasion have inflamed the quarrel were absent or in confinement and for want of leaders the soldiers were at last with great reluctance obliged to submit Monk with his army took quarters in Westminster The general was introduced to the House and thanks were given him by Lenthal for the eminent services which he had done his country Monk was a prudent not an eloquent speaker He told the house that the services which he had been enabled to perform were no more than his duty and merited not such praises as those with which they were pleased to honor him that among many persons of greater worth who bore their commission he had been employed as the instrument of Providence for effecting their restoration but he considered this service as a step only to more important services which it was their part to render to the nation that while on his march he observed all ranks of men in all places to be in earnest expectation of a settlement after the violent convulsions to which they had been exposed and to have no prospect of that blessing but from the dissolution of the present parliament and from the summoning of a new one free and full who meeting without oaths or engagements might finally give contentment to the nation that applications had been made to him for that purpose but that he sensible of his duty had still told the petitioners that the parliament itself which was now free and would soon be full was the best judge of all these measures and that the whole community ought to acquiesce in their determination that though he expressed himself in this manner to the people he must now freely inform the house that the fewer engagements were exacted the more comprehensive would their plan prove and the more satisfaction would it give to the nation and that it was sufficient for public security if the fanatical party and the royalists were excluded since the principles of these factions were destructive either of government or of liberty This speech containing matter which was both agreeable and disagreeable to the house as well as to the nation still kept every one in suspense and upheld that uncertainty in which it seemed the general s interest to retain the public But it was impossible for the kingdom to remain long in this doubtful situation the people as well as the parliament pushed matters to a decision During the late convulsions the payment of taxes had been interrupted and though the parliament upon their assembling renewed the ordinances for impositions yet so little reverence did the people pay to those legislators that they gave very slow and unwilling obedience to their commands The common council of London flatly refused to submit to an assessment required of them and declared that till a free and lawful parliament imposed taxes they never should deem it their duty to make any payment This resolution if yielded to would immediately have put an end to the dominion of the parliament they were determined therefore upon this occasion to make at once a full experiment of their own power and of their general s obedience Monk received orders to march into the city to seize twelve persons the most obnoxious to the parliament to remove the posts and chains from all the streets and to take down and break the portcullises and gates of the city and very few hours were allowed him to deliberate upon the execution of these violent orders To the great surprise and consternation of all men Monk prepared himself for obedience Neglecting the entreaties of his friends the remonstrances of his officers the cries of the people he entered the city in a military manner he apprehended as many as he could of the proscribed persons whom he sent to the Tower with all the circumstances of contempt he broke the gates and portcullises and having exposed the city to the scorn and derision of all who hated it he returned in triumph to his quarters in Westminster No sooner had the general leisure to reflect than he found that this last measure instead of being a continuation of that cautious ambiguity which he had hitherto maintained was taking party without reserve and laying himself as well as the nation at the mercy of that tyrannical parliament whose power and long been odious as their persons contemptible to all men He resolved therefore before it were too late to repair the dangerous mistake into which he had been betrayed and to show the whole world still more without reserve that he meant no longer to be the minister of violence and usurpation After complaining of the odious service in which ha had been employed he wrote a letter to the house reproaching them as well with the new cabals which they had formed with Vane and Lambert as with the encouragement given to a fanatical petition presented by Praise God Barebone and he required them in the name of the citizens soldiers and whole commonwealth to issue writs within a week for the filling of their house and to fix the time for their own dissolution and the assembling of a new parliament Having despatched this letter which might be regarded he thought as an undoubted pledge of his sincerity he marched with his army into the city and desired Allen the mayor to summon a common council at Guildhall He there made many apologies for the indignity which two days before he had been obliged to put upon them assured them of his perseverance in the measures which he had adopted and desired that they might mutually plight their faith for a strict union between city and army in every enterprise for the happiness and settlement of the commonwealth It would be difficult to describe the joy and exultation which displayed itself throughout the city as soon as intelligence was conveyed of this happy measure embraced by the general The prospect of peace concord liberty justice broke forth at once from amidst the deepest darkness in which the nation had ever been involved The view of past calamities no longer presented dismal prognostics of the future it tended only to enhance the general exultation for those scenes of happiness and tranquillity which all men now confidently promised themselves The royalists the Presbyterians forgetting all animosities mingled in common joy and transport and vowed never more to gratify the ambition of false and factious tyrants by their calamitous divisions The populace more outrageous in their festivity made the air resound with acclamations and illuminated every street with signals of jollity and triumph Applauses of the general were every where intermingled with detestation against the parliament The most ridiculous inventions were adopted in order to express this latter passion At every bonfire rumps were roasted and where these could no longer be found pieces of flesh were cut into that shape and the funeral of the parliament the populace exclaimed was celebrated by these symbols of hatred and derision The parliament though in the agonies of despair made still one effort for the recovery of their dominion They sent a committee with offers to gain the general He refused to hear them except in the presence of some of the secluded members Though several persons desperate from guilt and fanaticism promised to invest him with the dignity of supreme magistrate and to support his government he would not hearken to such wild proposals Having fixed a close correspondence with the city and established its militia in hands whose fidelity could be relied on he returned with his army to Westminster and pursued every proper measure for the settlement of the nation While he still pretended to maintain republican principles he was taking large steps towards the reestablishment of the ancient monarchy The secluded members upon the general s invitation went to the house and finding no longer any obstruction they entered and immediately appeared to be the majority most of the Independents left the place The restored members first repealed all the ordinances by which they had been excluded they gave Sir George Booth and his party their liberty and estates they renewed the general s commission and enlarged his powers they fixed an assessment for the support of the fleet and army and having passed these votes for the present composure of the kingdom they dissolved themselves and issued writs for the immediate assembling of a new parliament This last measure had been previously concerted with the general who knew that all men however different in affections expectations and designs united in their detestation of the long parliament A council of state was established consisting of men of character and moderation most of whom during the civil wars had made a great figure among the Presbyterians The militia of the kingdom was put into such hands as would promote order and settlement These conjoined with Monk s army which lay united at London were esteemed a sufficient check on the more numerous though dispersed army of whose inclinations there was still much reason to be diffident Monk however was every day removing the more obnoxious officers and bringing the troops to a state of discipline and obedience Overton governor of Hull had declared his resolution to keep possession of that fortress till the coming of King Jesus but when Alured produced the authority of parliament for his delivering the place to Colonel Fairfax he thought proper to comply Montague who commanded the fleet in the Baltic had entered into the conspiracy with Sir George Booth and pretending want of provisions had sailed from the Sound towards the coast of England with an intention of supporting that insurrection of the royalists On his arrival he received the news of Booth s defeat and the total failure of the enterprise The great difficulties to which the parliament was then reduced allowed them no leisure to examine strictly the reasons which he gave for quitting his station and they allowed him to retire peaceably to his country house The council of state now conferred on him in conjunction with Monk the command of the fleet and secured the naval as well as military force in hands favorable to the public settlement Notwithstanding all these steps which were taking towards the reestablishment of monarchy Monk still maintained the appearance of zeal for a commonwealth and hitherto allowed no canal of correspondence between himself and the king to be opened To call a free parliament and to restore the royal family were visibly in the present disposition of the kingdom one and the same measure yet would not the general declare otherwise than by his actions that he had adopted the king s interests and nothing but necessity extorted at last the confession from him His silence in the commencement of his enterprise ought to be no objection to his sincerity since he maintained the same reserve at a time when consistent with common sense he could have entertained no other purpose twenty seven See note AA at the end of the volume There was one Morrice a gentleman of Devonshire of a sedentary studious disposition nearly related to Monk and one who had always maintained the strictest intimacy with him With this friend alone did Monk deliberate concerning that great enterprise which he had projected Sir John Granville who had a commission from the king applied to Morrice for access to the general but received for answer that the general desired him to communicate his business to Morrice Granville though importunately urged twice refused to deliver his message to any but Monk himself and this cautious politician finding him now a person whose secrecy could be safely trusted admitted him to his presence and opened to him his whole intentions Still he scrupled to commit any thing to writing he delivered only a verbal message by Granville assuring the king of his services giving advice for his conduct and exhorting him instantly to leave the Spanish territories and retire into Holland He was apprehensive lest Spain might detain him as a pledge for the recovery of Dunkirk and Jamaica Charles followed these directions and very narrowly escaped to Breda Had he protracted his journey a few hours he had certainly under pretence of honor and respect been arrested by the Spaniards Lockhart who was governor of Dunkirk and nowise averse to the king s service was applied to on this occasion The state of England was set before him the certainty of the restoration represented and the prospect of great favor displayed if he would anticipate the vows of the kingdom and receive the king into his fortress Lockhart still replied that his commission was derived from an English parliament and he would not open his gates but in obedience to the same authority This scruple though in the present emergence it approaches towards superstition it is difficult for us entirely to condemn Lansdowne Clarendon Burnet The elections for the new parliament went every where in favor of the king s party This was one of those popular torrents where the most indifferent or even the most averse are transported with the general passion and zealously adopt the sentiments of the community to which they belong The enthusiasts themselves seemed to be disarmed of their fury and between despair and astonishment gave way to those measures which they found it would be impossible for them by their utmost efforts to withstand The Presbyterians and the royalists being united formed the voice of the nation which without noise but with infinite ardor called for the king s restoration The kingdom was almost entirely in the hands of the former party and some zealous leaders among them began to renew the demand of those conditions which had been required of the late king in the treaty of Newport but the general opinion seemed to condemn all those rigorous and jealous capitulations with their sovereign Harassed with convulsions and disorders men ardently longed for repose and were terrified at the mention of negotiations or delays which might afford opportunity to the seditious army still to breed new confusion The passion too for liberty having been carried to such violent extremes and having produced such bloody commotions began by a natural movement to give place to a spirit of loyalty and obedience and the public was less zealous in a cause which was become odious on account of the calamities which had so long attended it After the legal concessions made by the late king the constitution seemed to be sufficiently secured and the additional conditions insisted on as they had been framed during the greatest ardor of the contest amounted rather to annihilation than a limitation of monarchy Above all the general was averse to the mention of conditions and resolved that the crown which he intended to restore should be conferred on the king entirely free and unencumbered Without further scruple therefore or jealousy the people gave their voice in elections for such as they knew to entertain sentiments favorable to monarchy and all paid court to a party which they foresaw was soon to govern the nation Though the parliament had voted that no one should be elected who had himself or whose father had borne arms for the late king little regard was any where paid to this ordinance The leaders of the Presbyterians the earl of Manchester Lord Fairfax Lord Robarts Hollis Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper Annesley Lewis were determined to atone for past transgressions by their present zeal for the royal interests and from former merits successes and sufferings they had acquired with their party the highest credit and authority The affairs of Ireland were in a condition no less favorable to the king As soon as Monk declared against the English army he despatched emissaries into Ireland and engaged the officers in that kingdom to concur with him in the same measures Lord Broghill president of Munster and Sir Charles Coote president of Connaught went so far as to enter into a correspondence with the king and to promise their assistance for his restoration In conjunction with Sir Theophilus Jones and other officers they took possession of the government and excluded Ludlow who was zealous for the rump parliament but whom they pretended to be in a confederacy with the committee of safety They kept themselves in readiness to serve the king but made no declarations till they should see the turn which affairs took in England But all these promising views had almost been blasted by an untoward accident Upon the admission of the secluded members the republican party particularly the late king s judges were seized with the justest despair and endeavored to infuse the same sentiment into the army By themselves or their emissaries they represented to the soldiers that all those brave actions which had been performed during the war and which were so meritorious in the eyes of the parliament would no doubt be regarded as the deepest crimes by the royalists and would expose the army to the severest vengeance that in vain did that party make professions of moderation and lenity the king s death the execution of so many of the nobility and gentry the sequestration and imprisonment of the rest were in their eyes crimes so deep and offences so personal as must be prosecuted with the most implacable resentment that the loss of all arrears and the cashiering of every officer and soldier were the lightest punishment which must be expected after the dispersion of the army no further protection remained to them either for life or property but the clemency of enraged victors and that even if the most perfect security could be obtained it were inglorious to be reduced by treachery and deceit to subjection under a foe who in the open field had so often yielded to their superior valor After these suggestions had been infused into the army Lambert suddenly made his escape from the Tower and threw Monk and the council of state into great consternation They knew Lambert s vigor and activity they were acquainted with his popularity in the army they were sensible that though the soldiers had lately deserted him they sufficiently expressed their remorse and their detestation of those who by false professions they found had so egregiously deceived them It seemed necessary therefore to employ the greatest celerity in suppressing so dangerous a foe Colonel Ingoldsby who had been one of the late king s judges but who was now entirely engaged in the royal cause was despatched after him He overtook him at Daventry while he had yet assembled but four troops of horse One of them deserted him Another quickly followed the example He himself endeavoring to make his escape was seized by Ingoldsby to whom he made submissions not suitable to his former character of spirit and valor Okey Axtel Cobbet Crede and other officers of that party were taken prisoners with him All the roads were full of soldiers hastening to join them In a few days they had been formidable And it was thought that it might prove dangerous for Monk himself to have assembled any considerable body of his republican army for their suppression so that nothing could be more happy than the sudden extinction of this rising flame When the parliament met they chose Sir Harbottle Grimstone speaker a man who though he had for some time concurred with the late parliament had long been esteemed affectionate to the king s service The great dangers incurred during former usurpations joined to the extreme caution of the general kept every one in awe and none dared for some days to make any mention of the king The members exerted their spirit chiefly in bitter invectives against the memory of Cromwell and in execrations against the inhuman murder of their late sovereign At last the general having sufficiently sounded their inclinations gave directions to Annesley president of the council to inform them that one Sir John Granville a servant of the king s had been sent over by his majesty and was now at the door with a letter to the commons The loudest acclamations were excited by this intelligence Granville was called in the letter accompanied with a declaration greedily read without one moment s delay and without a contradictory vote a committee was appointed to prepare an answer and in order to spread the same satisfaction throughout the kingdom it was voted that the letter and declaration should immediately be published The people freed from the state of suspense in which they had so long been held now changed their anxious hope for the unmixed effusions of joy and displayed a social triumph and exultation which no private prosperity even the greatest is ever able fully to inspire Traditions remain of men particularly of Oughtred the mathematician who died of pleasure when informed of this happy and surprising event The King s declaration was well calculated to uphold the satisfaction inspired by the prospect of public settlement It offered a general amnesty to all persons whatsoever and that without any exceptions but such as should afterwards be made by parliament it promised liberty of conscience and a concurrence in any act of parliament which upon mature deliberation should be offered for insuring that indulgence it submitted to the arbitration of the same assembly the inquiry into all grants purchases and alienations and it assured the soldiers of all their arrears and promised them for the future the same pay which they then enjoyed The lords perceiving the spirit by which the kingdom as well as the commons was animated hastened to reinstate themselves in their ancient authority and to take their share in the settlement of the nation They found the doors of their house open and all were admitted even such as had formerly been excluded on account of their pretended delinquency The two houses attended while the king was proclaimed with great solemnity in Palace Yard at Whitehall and at Temple Bar The commons voted five hundred pounds to buy a jewel for Granville who had brought them the king s gracious messages a present of fifty thousand pounds was conferred on the king ten thousand pounds on the duke of York five thousand pounds on the duke of Gloucester A committee of lords and commons was despatched to invite his majesty to return and take possession of the government The rapidity with which all these events were conducted was marvellous and discovered the passionate zeal and entire unanimity of the nation Such an impatience appeared and such an emulation in lords and commons and city who should make the most lively expressions of their joy and duty that as the noble historian expresses it a man could not but wonder where those people dwelt who had done all the mischief and kept the king so many years from enjoying the comfort and support of such excellent subjects The king himself said that it must surely have been his own fault that he had not sooner taken possession of the throne since he found every body so zealous in promoting his happy restoration The respect of foreign powers soon followed the submission of the king s subjects Spain invited him to return to the Low Countries and embark in some of her maritime towns France made protestations of affection and regard and offered Calais for the same purpose The states general sent deputies with a like friendly invitation The king resolved to accept of this last offer The people of the republic bore him a cordial affection and politics no longer restrained their magistrates from promoting and expressing that sentiment As he passed from Breda to the Hague he was attended by numerous crowds and was received with the loudest acclamations as if themselves not their rivals in power and commerce were now restored to peace and security The states general in a body and afterwards the states of Holland apart performed their compliments with the greatest solemnity every person of distinction was ambitious of being introduced to his majesty all ambassadors and public ministers of kings princes or states repaired to him and professed the joy of their masters in his behalf so that one would have thought that from the united efforts of Christendom had been derived this revolution which diffused every where such universal satisfaction The English fleet came in sight of Scheveling Montague had not waited for orders from the parliament but had persuaded the officers of themselves to tender their duty to his majesty The duke of York immediately went on board and took the command of the fleet as high admiral When the king disembarked at Dover he was met by the general whom he cordially embraced Never subject in fact probably in his intentions had deserved better of his king and country In the space of a few months without effusion of blood by his cautious and disinterested conduct alone he had bestowed settlement on three kingdoms which had long been torn with the most violent convulsions and having obstinately refused the most inviting conditions offered him by the king as well as by every party in the kingdom he freely restored his injured master to the vacant throne The king entered London on the twenty ninth of May which was also his birthday The fond imaginations of men interpreted as a happy omen the concurrence of two such joyful periods At this era it may be proper to stop a moment and take a general survey of the age so far as regards manners finances arms commerce arts and sciences The chief use of history is that it affords materials for disquisitions of this nature and it seems the duty of an historian to point out the proper inferences and conclusions No people could undergo a change more sudden and entire in their manners than did the English nation during this period From tranquillity concord submission sobriety they passed in an instant to a state of faction fanaticism rebellion and almost frenzy The violence of the English parties exceeded any thing which we can now imagine had they continued but a little longer there was just reason to dread all the horrors of the ancient massacres and proscriptions The military usurpers whose authority was founded on palpable injustice and was supported by no national party would have been impelled by rage and despair into such sanguinary measures and if these furious expedients had been employed on one side revenge would naturally have pushed the other party after a return of power to retaliate upon their enemies No social intercourse was maintained between the parties no marriages or alliances contracted The royalists though oppressed harassed persecuted disdained all affinity with their masters The more they were reduced to subjection the greater superiority did they affect above those usurpers who by violence and injustice had acquired an ascendant over them The manners of the two factions were as opposite as those of the most distant nations Your friends the cavaliers said a parliamentarian to a royalist are very dissolute and debauched True replied the royalist they have the infirmities of men but your friends the roundheads have the vices of devils tyranny rebellion and spiritual pride Riot and disorder it is certain notwithstanding the good example set them by Charles I prevailed very much among his partisans Being commonly men of birth and fortune to whom excesses are less pernicious than to the vulgar they were too apt to indulge themselves in all pleasures particularly those of the table Opposition to the rigid preciseness of their antagonists increased their inclination to good fellow ship and the character of a man of pleasure was affected among them as a sure pledge of attachment to the church and monarchy Even when ruined by confiscations and sequestrations they endeavored to maintain the appearance of a careless and social jollity As much as hope is superior to fear said a poor and merry cavalier so much is our situation preferable to that of our enemies We laugh while they tremble Sir Philip Warwick The gloomy enthusiasm which prevailed among the parliamentary party is surely the most curious spectacle presented by any history and the most instructive as well as entertaining to a philosophical mind All recreations were in a manner suspended by the rigid severity of the Presbyterians and Independents Horse races and cock matches were prohibited as the greatest enormities Killing no Murder Even bear baiting was esteemed heathenish and unchristian the sport of it not the inhumanity gave offence Colonel Hewson from his pious zeal marched with his regiment into London and destroyed all the bears which were kept there for the diversion of the citizens This adventure seems to have given birth to the fiction of Hudibras Though the English nation be naturally candid and sincere hypocrisy prevailed among them beyond any example in ancient or modern times The religious hypocrisy it may be remarked is of a peculiar nature and being generally unknown to the person himself though more dangerous it implies less falsehood than any other species of insincerity The Old Testament preferably to the New was the favorite of all the sectaries The Eastern poetical style of that composition made it more easily susceptible of a turn which was agreeable to them We have had occasion in the course of this work to speak of the many sects which prevailed in England to enumerate them all would be impossible The Quakers however are so considerable at least so singular as to merit some attention and as they renounced by principle the use of arms they never made such a figure in public transactions as to enter into any part of our narrative The religion of the Quakers like most others began with the lowest vulgar and in its progress came at last to comprehend people of better quality and fashion George Fox born at Drayton in Lancashire in sixteen twenty four was the founder of this sect He was the son of a weaver and was himself bound apprentice to a shoemaker Feeling a stronger impulse towards spiritual contemplations than towards that mechanical profession he left his master and went about the country clothed in a leathern doublet a dress which he long affected as well for its singularity as its cheapness That he might wean himself from sublunary objects he broke off all connections with his friends and family and never dwelt a moment in one place lest habit should beget new connections and depress the sublimity of his aerial meditations He frequently wandered into the woods and passed whole days in hollow trees without company or any other amusement than his Bible Having reached that pitch of perfection as to need no other book he soon advanced to another state of spiritual progress and began to pay less regard even to that divine composition itself His own breast he imagined was full of the same inspiration which had guided the prophets and apostles themselves and by this inward light must every spiritual obscurity be cleared by this living spirit must the dead letter be animated When he had been sufficiently consecrated in his own imagination he felt that the fumes of self applause soon dissipate if not continually supplied by the admiration of others and he began to seek proselytes Proselytes were easily gained at a time when all men s affections were turned towards religion and when the most extravagant modes of it were sure to be most popular All the forms of ceremony invented by pride and ostentation Fox and his disciples from a superior pride and ostentation carefully rejected even the ordinary rites of civility were shunned as the nourishment of carnal vanity and self conceit They would bestow no titles of distinction the name of friend was the only salutation with which they indiscriminately accosted every one To no person would they make a bow or move their hat or give any signs of reverence Instead of that affected adulation introduced into modern tongues of speaking to individuals as if they were a multitude they returned to the simplicity of ancient languages and thou and thee were the only expressions which on any consideration they could be brought to employ Dress too a material circumstance distinguished the members of this sect Every superfluity and ornament was carefully retrenched no plaits to their coat no buttons to their sleeves no lace no ruffles no embroidery Even a button to the hat though sometimes useful yet not being always so was universally rejected by them with horror and detestation The violent enthusiasm of this sect like all high passions being too strong for the weak nerves to sustain threw the preachers into convulsions and shakings and distortions in their limbs and they thence receded the appellation of Quakers Amidst the great toleration which was then granted to all sects and even encouragement given to all innovations this sect alone suffered persecution From the fervor of their zeal the Quakers broke into churches disturbed public worship and harassed the minister and audience with railing and reproaches When carried before a magistrate they refused him all reverence and treated him with the same familiarity as if he had been their equal Sometimes they were thrown into mad houses sometimes into prisons sometimes whipped sometimes pilloried The patience and fortitude with which they suffered begat compassion admiration esteem A supernatural spirit was believed to support them under those sufferings which the ordinary state of humanity freed from the illusions of passion is unable to sustain The following story is told by Whitlocke p five hundred ninety nine Some Quakers at Hasington in Northumberland coming to the minister on the Sabbath day and speaking to him the people fell upon the Quakers and almost killed one or two of them who going out fell on their knees and prayed God to pardon the people who knew not what they did and afterwards speaking to the people so convinced them of the evil they had done in beating them that the country people fell a quarrelling and beat one another more than they had before beaten the Quakers The Quakers crept into the army but as they preached universal peace they seduced the military zealots from their profession and would soon had they been suffered have put an end without any defeat or calamity to the dominion of the saints These attempts became a fresh ground of persecution and a new reason for their progress among the people Morals with this sect were carried or affected to be carried to the same degree of extravagance as religion Give a Quaker a blow on one cheek he held up the other ask his cloak he gave you his coat also the greatest interest could not engage him in any court of judicature to swear even to the truth he never asked more for his wares than the precise sum which he was determined to accept This last maxim is laudable and continues still to be religiously observed by the sect No fanatics ever carried further the hatred to ceremonies forms orders rites and positive institutions Even baptism and the Lord s supper by all other sects believed to be interwoven with the very vitals of Christianity were disdainfully rejected by them The very Sabbath they profaned The holiness of churches they derided and they would give to these sacred edifices no other appellation than that of shops or steeplehouses No priests were admitted in their sect every one had received from immediate illumination a character much superior to the sacerdotal When they met for divine worship each rose up in his place and delivered the extemporary inspirations of the Holy Ghost women also were admitted to teach the brethren and were considered as proper vehicles to convey the dictates of the spirit Sometimes a great many preachers were moved to speak at once sometimes a total silence prevailed in their congregations Some Quakers attempted to fast forty days in imitation of Christ and one of them bravely perished in the experiment A female Quaker came naked into the church where the protector sat being moved by the spirit as she said to appeal as a sign to the people A number of them fancied that the renovation of all things had commenced and that clothes were to be rejected together with other superfluities The sufferings which followed the practice of this doctrine were a species of persecution not well calculated for promoting it James Naylor was a Quaker noted for blasphemy or rather madness in the time of the protectorship He fancied that he himself was transformed into Christ and was become the real savior of the world and in consequence of this frenzy he endeavored to imitate many actions of the Messiah related in the evangelists As he bore a resemblance to the common pictures of Christ he allowed his beard to grow in a like form he raised a person from the dead he was ministered unto by women he entered Bristol mounted on a horse I suppose from the difficulty in that place of finding an ass his disciples spread their garments before him and cried Hosanna to the highest holy holy is the Lord God of Sabaoth When carried before the magistrate he would give no other answer to all questions than Thou hast said it What is remarkable the parliament thought that the matter deserved their attention Near ten days they spent in inquiries and debates about him Whitlocke p six hundred twenty four Harleian Miscellany vol vi p three hundred ninety nine One Dorcas Barberry made oath before a magistrate that she had been dead two days and that Naylor had brought her to life Harleian Miscellany vol vi p three hundred ninety nine Thurloe vol v p seven hundred eight They condemned him to be pilloried whipped burned in the face and to have his tongue bored through with a red hot iron All these severities he bore with the usual patience So far his delusion supported him But the sequel spoiled all He was sent to Bridewell confined to hard labor fed on bread and water and debarred from all his disciples male and female His illusions dissipated and after some time he was contented to come out an ordinary man and return to his usual occupations The chief taxes in England during the time of the commonwealth were the monthly assessments the excise and the customs The assessments were levied on personal estates as well as on land and commissioners were appointed in each county for rating the individuals The highest assessment amounted to one hundred and twenty thousand pounds a month in England the lowest was thirty five thousand The assessments in Scotland were sometimes ten thousand pounds a month commonly six thousand Those on Ireland nine thousand At a medium this tax might have afforded about a million a year The excise during the civil wars was levied on bread flesh meat as well as beer ale strong waters and many other commodities After the king was subdued bread and flesh meat were exempted from excise The customs on exportation were lowered in sixteen fifty six In sixteen fifty commissioners were appointed to levy both customs and excises Cromwell in sixteen fifty seven returned to the old practice of farming Eleven hundred thousand pounds were then offered both for customs and excise a greater sum than had ever been levied by the commissioners the whole of the taxes during that period might at a medium amount to above two millions a year a sum which though moderate much exceeded the revenue of any former king v Sequestrations compositions sale of crown and church lands and of the lands of delinquents yielded also considerable sums but very difficult to be estimated Church lands are said to have been sold for a million v None of these were ever valued at above ten or eleven years purchase v The estates of delinquents amounted to above two hundred thousand pounds a year Cromwell died more than two millions in debt v though the parliament had left him in the treasury above five hundred thousand pounds and in stores the value of seven hundred thousand pounds v Scobel p four hundred nineteen Thurloe vol ii p four hundred seventy six Scobel p three hundred seventy six Thurloe vol vi p four hundred twenty five v It appears that the late king s revenue from sixteen thirty seven to the meeting of the long parliament was only nine hundred thousand pounds of which two hundred thousand may be esteemed illegal v doctor Walker p fourteen v Thurloe vol i p seven hundred fifty three v Thurloe vol ii p four hundred fourteen v Thurloe vol vii p six hundred sixty seven The committee of danger in April sixteen forty eight voted to raise the army to forty thousand men The same year the pay of the army was estimated at eighty thousand pounds a month The establishment of the army in sixteen fifty two was in Scotland fifteen thousand foot two thousand five hundred and eighty horse five hundred and sixty dragoons in England four thousand seven hundred foot two thousand five hundred and twenty horse garrisons six thousand one hundred and fifty four In all thirty one thousand five hundred and fourteen besides officers The army in Scotland was afterwards considerably reduced The army in Ireland was not much short of twenty thousand men so that upon the whole the commonwealth maintained in sixteen fifty two a standing army of more than fifty thousand men Its pay amounted to a yearly sum of one million forty seven thousand seven hundred and fifteen pounds Afterwards the protector reduced the establishment to thirty thousand men as appears by the instrument of government and humble petition and advice His frequent enterprises obliged him from time to time to augment them Richard had on foot in England an army of thirteen thousand two hundred and fifty eight men in Scotland nine thousand five hundred and six in Ireland about ten thousand men v The foot soldiers had commonly a shilling a day v The horse had two shillings and sixpence so that many gentlemen and younger brothers of good family enlisted in the protector s cavalry v No wonder that such men were averse from the reestablishment of civil government by which they well knew they must be deprived of so gainful a profession At the time of the battle of Worcester the parliament had on foot about eighty thousand men partly militia partly regular forces The vigor of the commonwealth and the great capacity of those members who had assumed the government never at any time appeared so conspicuous v Whitlocke p two hundred ninety eight Whitlocke p three hundred seventy eight Journal twod December sixteen fifty two Journal twod December sixteen fifty two v Journal sixth of April sixteen fifty nine v Thurloe vol i p three hundred ninety five vol ii p four hundred fourteen v Gumble s Life of Monk v Whitlocke p four hundred seventy seven The whole revenue of the public during the protectorship of Richard was estimated at one million eight hundred and sixty eight thousand seven hundred and seventeen pounds his annual expenses at two millions two hundred and one thousand five hundred and forty pounds An additional revenue was demanded from parliament The commerce and industry of England increased extremely during the peaceable period of Charles s reign the trade to the East Indies and to Guinea became considerable The English possessed almost the sole trade with Spain Twenty thousand cloths were annually sent to Turkey Commerce met with interruption no doubt from the civil wars and convulsions which afterwards prevailed though it soon recovered after the establishment of the commonwealth The war with the Dutch by distressing the commerce of so formidable a rival served to encourage trade in England the Spanish war was to an equal degree pernicious All the effects of the English merchants to an immense value were confiscated in Spain The prevalence of democratical principles engaged the country gentlemen to bind their sons apprentices to merchants and commerce has ever since been more honorable in England than in any other European kingdom The exclusive companies which formerly confined trade were never expressly abolished by any ordinance of parliament during the commonwealth but as men paid no regard to the prerogative whence the charters of these companies were derived the monopoly was gradually invaded and commerce increased by the increase of liberty Interest in sixteen fifty was reduced to six per cent The customs in England before the civil wars are said to have amounted to five hundred thousand pounds a year a sum ten times greater than during the best period in Queen Elizabeth s reign but there is probably some exaggeration in this matter The post house in sixteen fifty three was farmed at ten thousand pounds a year which was deemed a considerable sum for the three kingdoms Letters paid only about half the present postage From sixteen nineteen to sixteen thirty eight there had been coined six millions nine hundred thousand and forty two pounds From sixteen thirty eight to sixteen fifty seven the coinage amounted to seven millions seven hundred and thirty three thousand five hundred and twenty one pounds v Journal seventh April sixteen fifty nine Strafford s Letters vol i p four hundred twenty one four hundred twenty three four hundred thirty four hundred sixty seven Clarendon Lewis Roberts s Treasure of Traffick v Happy Future State of England doctor Davenant has told us from the registers of the mint that between fifteen fifty eight and sixteen fifty nine there had been coined nineteen millions eight hundred and thirty two thousand four hundred and seventy six pounds in gold and silver The first mention of tea coffee and chocolate is about sixteen sixty Asparagus artichokes cauliflower and a variety of salads were about the same time introduced into England The colony of New England increased by means of the Puritans who fled thither in order to free themselves from the constraint which Laud and the church party had imposed upon them and before the commencement of the civil wars it is supposed to have contained twenty five thousand souls For a like reason the Catholics afterwards who found themselves exposed to many hardships and dreaded still worse treatment went over to America in great numbers and settled the colony of Maryland Before the civil wars learning and the fine arts were favored at court and a good taste began to prevail in the nation The king loved pictures sometimes handled the pencil himself and was a good judge of the art The pieces of foreign masters were bought up at a vast price and the value of pictures doubled in Europe by the emulation between Charles and Philip IV of Spain who were touched with the same elegant passion Vandyke was caressed and enriched at court Inigo Jones was master of the king s buildings though afterwards persecuted by the parliament on account of the part which he had in rebuilding saint Paul s and for obeying some orders of council by which he was directed to pull down houses in order to make room for that edifice Laws who had not been surpassed by any musician before him was much beloved by the king who called him the father of music Charles was a good judge of writing and was thought by some more anxious with regard to purity of style than became a monarch Anderson vol ii p one hundred eleven Anderson vol ii p one hundred eleven British Empire in America vol i p three hundred seventy two Purnet Notwithstanding his narrow revenue and his freedom from all vanity he lived in such magnificence that he possessed four and twenty palaces all of them elegantly and completely furnished insomuch that when he removed from one to another he was not obliged to transport any thing along with him Cromwell though himself a barbarian was not insensible to literary merit Usher notwithstanding his being a bishop received a pension from him Marvel and Milton were in his service Waller who was his relation was caressed by him That poet always said that the protector himself was not so wholly illiterate as was commonly imagined He gave a hundred pounds a year to the divinity professor at Oxford and an historian mentions this bounty as an instance of his love of literature He intended to have erected a college at Durham for the benefit of the northern counties Civil wars especially when founded on principles of liberty are not commonly unfavorable to the arts of elocution and composition or rather by presenting nobler and more interesting objects they amply compensate that tranquillity of which they bereave the muses The speeches of the parliamentary orators during this period are of a strain much superior to what any former age had produced in England and the force and compass of our tongue were then first put to trial It must however be confessed that the wretched fanaticism which so much infected the parliamentary party was no less destructive of taste and science than of all law and order Gayety and wit were proscribed human learning despised freedom of inquiry detested cant and hypocrisy alone encouraged It was an article positively insisted on in the preliminaries to the treaty of Uxbridge that all play houses should forever be abolished Sir John Davenant says Whitlocke speaking of the year sixteen fifty eight published an opera notwithstanding the nicety of the times All the king s furniture was put to sale his pictures disposed of at very low prices enriched all the collections in Europe the cartoons when complete were only appraised at three hundred pounds though the whole collection of the king s curiosities was sold at above fifty thousand Neale s History of the Puritans vol iv p one hundred twenty three Page six hundred thirty nine Parl Hist vol xix p eighty three Even the royal palaces were pulled in pieces and the materials of them sold The very library and medals at saint James s were intended by the generals to be brought to auction in order to pay the arrears of some regiments of cavalry quartered near London but Seiden apprehensive of the loss engaged his friend Whitlocke then lord keeper for the commonwealth to apply for the office of librarian This expedient saved that valuable collection It is however remarkable that the greatest genius by far that shone out in England during this period was deeply engaged with these fanatics and even prostituted his pen in theological controversy in factious disputes and in justifying the most violent measures of the party This was John Milton whose poems are admirable though liable to some objections his prose writings disagreeable though not altogether defective in genius Nor are all his poems equal his Paradise Lost his Comus and a few others shine out amidst some flat and insipid compositions Even in the Paradise Lost his capital performance there are very long passages amounting to near a third of the work almost wholly destitute of harmony and elegance nay of all vigor of imagination This natural inequality in Milton s genius was much increased by the inequalities in his subject of which some parts are of themselves the most lofty that can enter into human conception others would have required the most labored elegance of composition to support them It is certain that this author when in a happy mood and employed on a noble subject is the most wonderfully sublime of any poet in any language Homer and Lucretius and Tasso not excepted More concise than Homer more simple than Tasso more nervous than Lucretius had he lived in a later age and learned to polish some rudeness in his verses had he enjoyed better fortune and possessed leisure to watch the returns of genius in himself he had attained the pinnacle of perfection and borne away the palm of epic poetry It is well known that Milton never enjoyed in his lifetime the reputation which he deserved His Paradise Lost was long neglected prejudices against an apologist for the regicides and against a work not wholly purged from the cant of former times kept the ignorant world from perceiving the prodigious merit of that performance Lord Somers by encouraging a good edition of it about twenty years after the author s death first brought it into request and Tonson in his dedication of a smaller edition speaks of it as a work just beginning to be known Even during the prevalence of Milton s party he seems never to have been much regarded and Whitlocke talks of one Milton as he calls him a blind man who was employed in translating a treaty with Sweden into Latin These forms of expression are amusing to posterity who consider how obscure Whitlocke himself though lord keeper and ambassador and indeed a man of great abilities and merit has become in comparison of Milton It is not strange that Milton received no encouragement after the restoration it is more to be admired that he escaped with his life Many of the cavaliers blamed extremely that lenity towards him which was so honorable in the king and so advantageous to posterity It is said that he had saved Davenant s life during the protectorship and Davenant in return afforded him like protection after the restoration being sensible that men of letters ought always to regard their sympathy of taste as a more powerful band of union than any difference of party or opinion as a source of animosity It was during a state of poverty blindness disgrace danger and old age that Milton composed his wonderful poem which not only surpassed all the performances of his contemporaries but all the compositions which had flowed from his pen during the vigor of his age and the height of his prosperity This circumstance is not the least remarkable of all those which attend that great genius He died in sixteen seventy four aged sixty six Waller was the first refiner of English poetry at least of English rhyme but his performances still abound with many faults and what is more material they contain but feeble and superficial beauties Gayety wit and ingenuity are their ruling character they aspire not to the sublime still less to the pathetic They treat of love without making us feel any tenderness and abound in panegyric without exciting admiration The panegyric however on Cromwell contains more force than we should expect from the other compositions of this poet Waller was born to an ample fortune was early introduced to the court and lived in the best company He possessed talents for eloquence as well as poetry and till his death which happened in a good old age he was the delight of the house of commons The errors of his life proceeded more from want of courage than of honor or integrity He died in sixteen eighty seven aged eighty two Cowley is an author extremely corrupted by the bad taste of his age but had he lived even in the purest times of Greece nor Rome he must always have been a very indifferent poet He had no ear for harmony and his verses are only known to be such by the rhyme which terminates them In his rugged untenable numbers are conveyed sentiments the most strained and distorted long spun allegories distant allusions and forced conceits Great ingenuity however and vigor of thought sometimes break out amidst those unnatural conceptions a few anacreontics surprise us by their ease and gayety his prose writings please by the honesty and goodness which they express and even by their spleen and melancholy This author was much more praised and admired during his lifetime and celebrated after his death than the great Milton He died in sixteen sixty seven aged forty nine Sir John Denham in his Cooper s Hill for none of his other poems merit attention has a loftiness and vigor which had not before him been attained by any English poet who wrote in rhyme The mechanical difficulties of that measure retarded its improvement Shakspeare whose tragic scenes are sometimes so wonderfully forcible and expressive is a very indifferent poet when he attempts to rhyme Precision and neatness are chiefly wanting in Denham He died in sixteen eighty eight aged seventy three No English author in that age was more celebrated both abroad and at home than Hobbes in our time he is much neglected a lively instance how precarious all reputations founded on reasoning and philosophy A pleasant comedy which paints the manners of the age and exposes a faithful picture of nature is a durable work and is transmitted to the latest posterity But a system whether physical or metaphysical commonly owes its success to its novelty and is no sooner canvassed with impartiality than its weakness is discovered Hobbes s politics are fitted only to promote tyranny and his ethics to encourage licentiousness Though an enemy to religion he partakes nothing of the spirit of scepticism but is as positive and dogmatical as if human reason and his reason in particular could attain a thorough conviction in these subjects Clearness and propriety of style are the chief excellencies of Hobbes s writings In his own person he is represented to have been a man of virtue a character nowise surprising notwithstanding his libertine system of ethics Timidity is the principal fault with which he is reproached he lived to an extreme old age yet could never reconcile himself to the thoughts of death The boldness of his opinions and sentiments form a remarkable contrast to this part of his character He died in sixteen seventy nine aged ninety one Harrington s Oceana was well adapted to that age when the plans of imaginary republics were the daily subjects of debate and conversation and even in our time it is justly admired as a work of genius and invention The idea however of a perfect and immortal commonwealth will always be found as chimerical as that of a perfect and immortal man The style of this author wants ease and fluency but the good matter which his work contains makes compensation He died in sixteen seventy seven aged sixty six Harvey is entitled to the glory of having made by reasoning alone without any mixture of accident a capital discovery in one of the most important branches of science He had also the happiness of establishing at once his theory on the most solid and convincing proofs and posterity has added little to the arguments suggested by his industry and ingenuity His treatise of the circulation of the blood is further embellished by that warmth and spirit which so naturally accompany the genius of invention This great man was much favored by Charles I who gave him the liberty of using all the deer in the royal forests for perfecting his discoveries on the generation of animals It was remarked that no physician in Europe who had reached forty years of age ever to the end of his life adopted Harvey s doctrine of the circulation of the blood and that his practice in London diminished extremely from the reproach drawn upon him by that great and signal discovery So slow is the progress of truth in every science even when not opposed by factious or superstitious prejudices He died in sixteen fifty seven aged seventy nine This age affords great materials for history but did not produce any accomplished historian Clarendon however will always be esteemed an entertaining writer even independent of our curiosity to know the facts which he relates His style is prolix and redundant and suffocates us by the length of its periods but it discovers imagination and sentiment and pleases us at the same time that we disapprove of it He is more partial in appearance than in reality for he seems perpetually anxious to apologize for the king but his apologies are often well grounded He is less partial in his relation of facts than in his account of characters he was too honest a man to falsify the former his affections were easily capable unknown to himself of disguising the latter An air of probity and goodness runs through the whole work as these qualities did in reality embellish the whole life of the author He died in sixteen seventy four aged sixty six These are the chief performances which engage the attention of posterity Those numberless productions with which the press then abounded the cant of the pulpit the declamations of party the subtilties of theology all these have long ago sunk in silence and oblivion Even a writer such as Selden whose learning was his chief excellency or Chillingworth an acute disputant against the Papists will scarcely be ranked among the classics of our language or country NOTES Footnote one NOTE A p fifteen By a speech of Sir Simon D Ewes in the first year of the long parliament it clearly appears that the nation never had even to that time been rightly informed concerning the transactions of the Spanish negotiation and still believed the court of Madrid to have been altogether insincere in their professions What reason upon that supposition had they to blame either the prince or Buckingham for their conduct or for the narrative delivered to the parliament This is a capital fact and ought to be well attended to D Ewes s speech is in Nalson vol ii p three hundred sixty eight No author or historian of that age mentions the discovery of Buckingham s impostures as a cause of disgust in the parliament Whitlocke p one only says that the commons began to suspect that it had been spleen in Buckingham not zeal for public good which had induced him to break the Spanish match a clear proof that his falsehood was not suspected Wilson p seven hundred eighty says that Buckingham lost his popularity after Bristol arrived not because that nobleman discovered to the world the falsehood of his narrative but because he proved that Buckingham while in Spain had professed himself a Papist which is false and which was never said by Bristol In all the debates which remain not the least hint is ever given that any falsehood was suspected in the narrative I shall further add that even if the parliament had discovered the deceit in Buckingham s narrative this ought not to have altered their political measures or made them refuse supply to the king They had supposed it practicable to wrest the Palatinate by arms from the house of Austria they had represented it as prudent to expend the blood and treasure of the nation in such an enterprise they had believed that the king of Spain never had any sincere intention of restoring that principality It is certain that he had not now any such intention and though there was reason to suspect that this alteration in his views had proceeded from the ill conduct of Buckingham yet past errors could not be retrieved and the nation was undoubtedly in the same situation which the parliament had ever supposed when they so much harassed their sovereign by their impatient importunate and even undutiful solicitations To which we may add that Charles himself was certainly deceived by Buckingham when he corroborated his favorite s narrative by his testimony Party historians are somewhat inconsistent in their representations of these transactions They represent the Spaniards as totally insincere that they may reproach James with credulity in being so long deceived by them They represent them as sincere that they may reproach the king the prince and the duke with falsehood in their narrative to the parliament The truth is they were insincere at first but the reasons proceeding from bigotry were not suspected by James and were at last overcome They became sincere but the prince deceived by the many unavoidable causes of delay believed that they were still deceiving him Footnote two NOTE B p forty two This petition is of so great importance that we shall here give it at length Humbly show unto our sovereign lord the king the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in parliament assembled That whereas it is declared and enacted by a statute made in the time of the reign of King Edward I commonly called Statutum de Tallagio non concedendo That no tallage or aid shall be levied by the king or his heirs in this realm without the good will and assent of the archbishops bishops earls barons knights burgesses and other the freemen of the commonalty of this realm and by authority of parliament holden in the five and twentieth year of the reign of King Edward III it is declared and enacted That from thenceforth no person shall be compelled to make any loans to the king against his will because such loans were against reason and the franchise of the land and by other laws of this realm it is provided That none should be charged by any charge or imposition called a benevolence or by such like charge by which the statutes before mentioned and other the good laws and statutes of this realm your subjects have inherited this freedom that they should not be compelled to contribute to any tax tallage aid or other like charge not set by common consent in parliament II Yet nevertheless of late divers commissions directed to sundry commissioners in several counties with instructions have issued by means whereof your people have been in divers places assembled and required to lend certain sums of money unto your majesty and many of them upon their refusal to do so have had an oath administered unto them not warrantable by the laws or statutes of this realm and have been constrained to become bound to make appearance and give attendance before your privy council and in other places and others of them have been therefore imprisoned confined and sundry other ways molested and disquieted and divers other charges have been laid and levied upon your people in several counties by lord lieutenants deputy lieutenants commissioners for musters justices of peace and others by command or direction from your majesty or your privy council against the laws and free customs of this realm III And whereas also by the statute called the Great Charter of the liberties of England it is declared and enacted That no freeman may be taken or imprisoned or be disseized of his freehold or liberties or his free customs or be outlawed or exiled or in any manner destroyed but by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land IV And in the eight and twentieth year of the reign of King Edward III it was declared and enacted by authority of parliament That no man of what estate or condition that he be should be put out of his land or tenements nor taken nor imprisoned nor dispirited nor put to death without being brought to answer by due process of law V Nevertheless against the tenor of the said statutes and other the good laws and statutes of your realm to that end provided divers of your subjects have of late been imprisoned without any cause showed and when for their deliverance they were brought before justice by your majesty s writs of habeas corpus there to undergo and receive as the court should order and their keepers commanded to certify the causes of their detainer no cause was certified but that they were detained by your majesty s special command signified by the lords of your privy council and yet were returned back to several prisons without being charged with any thing to which they might make answer according to the law VI And whereas of late great companies of soldiers and mariners have been dispersed into divers counties of the realm and the inhabitants against their wills have been compelled to receive them into their houses and there to suffer them to sojourn against the laws and customs of this realm and to the great grievance and vexation of the people VII And whereas also by authority of parliament in the five and twentieth year of the reign of King Edward III it is declared and enacted That no man should be forejudged of life or limb against the form of the Great Charter and law of the land and by the said Great Charter and other the laws and statutes of this your realm no man ought to be judged to death but by the laws established in this your realm either by the customs of the same realm or by acts of parliament and whereas no offender of what kind soever is exempted from the proceedings to be used and punishments to be inflicted by the laws and statutes of this your realm nevertheless of late divers commissions under your majesty s great seal have issued forth by which certain persons have been assigned and appointed commissioners with power and authority to proceed within the land according to the justice of martial law against such soldiers and mariners or other dissolute persons joining with them as should commit any murther robbery felony mutiny or other outrage or misdemeanor whatsoever and by such summary course and order as is agreeable to martial law and as is used in armies in time of war to proceed to the trial and condemnation of such offenders and them to cause to be executed and put to death according to the law martial VIII By pretext whereof some of your majesty s subjects have been by some of the said commissioners put to death when and where if by the laws and statutes of the land they had deserved death by the same laws and statutes also they might and by no other ought to have been judged and executed IX And also sundry grievous offenders by color thereof claiming an exemption have escaped the punishments due to them by the laws and statutes of this your realm by reason that divers of your officers and ministers of justice have unjustly refused or forborne to proceed against such offenders according to the same laws

shall serve you according to the laws and statutes of this realm as they tender the honor of your majesty and the prosperity of this kingdom Stat seventeen Car cap fourteen Footnote three NOTE C p fifty two The reason assigned by Sir Philip Warwick p two for this unusual measure of the commons is that they intended to deprive the crown of the prerogative which it had assumed of varying the rates of the impositions and at the same time were resolved to cut off the new rates fixed by James These were considerable diminutions both of revenue and prerogative and whether they would have there stopped considering their present disposition may be much doubted The king it seems and the lords were resolved not to trust them nor to render a revenue once precarious which perhaps they might never afterwards be able to get reestablished on the old footing Footnote four NOTE D p eighty Here is a passage of Sir John Davis s Question concerning Impositions p one hundred thirty one This power of laying on arbitrarily new impositions being a prerogative in point of government as well as in point of profit it cannot be restrained or bound by act of parliament it can not be limited by any certain or fixt rule of law no more than the course of a pilot upon the sea who must turn the helm or bear higher or lower sail according to the wind or weather and therefore it may be properly said that the king s prerogative in this point is as strong as Samson it cannot be bound for though an act of parliament be made to restrain it and the king doth give his consent unto it as Samson was bound with his own consent yet if the Philistines come that is if any just or important occasion do arise it cannot hold or restrain the prerogative it will be as thread and broken as easy as the bonds of Samson The king s prerogatives are the sunbeams of the crown and as inseparable from it as the sunbeams from the sun The king s crown must be taken from him Samson s hair must be cut off before his courage can be any jot abated Hence it is that neither the king s act nor any act of parliament can give away his prerogative Footnote five NOTE E p one hundred twenty one We shall here make use of the liberty allowed in a note to expatiate a little on the present subject It must be confessed that the king in this declaration touched upon that circumstance in the English constitution which it is most difficult or rather altogether impossible to regulate by laws and which must be governed by certain delicate ideas of propriety and decency rather than by any exact rule or prescription To deny the parliament all right of remonstrating against what they esteem grievances were to reduce that assembly to a total insignificancy and to deprive the people of every advantage which they could reap from popular councils To complain of the parliament s employing the power of taxation as the means of extorting concessions from their sovereign were to expect that they would entirely disarm themselves and renounce the sole expedient provided by the constitution for insuring to the kingdom a just and legal administration In different periods of English story there occur instances of their remonstrating with their princes in the freest manner and sometimes of their refusing supply when disgusted with any circumstance of public conduct It is however certain that this power though essential to parliaments may easily be abused as well by the frequency and minuteness of their remonstrances as by their intrusion into every part of the king s counsels and determinations Under color of advice they may give disguised orders and in complaining of grievances they may draw to themselves every power of government Whatever measure is embraced without consulting them may be pronounced an oppression of the people and till corrected they may refuse the most necessary supplies to their indigent sovereign From the very nature of this parliamentary liberty it is evident that it must be left unbounded by law for who can foretell how frequently grievances may occur or what part of administration may be affected by them From the nature too of the human frame it may be expected that this liberty would be exerted in its full extent and no branch of authority be allowed to remain unmolested in the hands of the prince for will the weak limitations of respect and decorum be sufficient to restrain human ambition which so frequently breaks through all the prescriptions of law and justice But here it is observable that the wisdom of the English constitution or rather the concurrence of accidents has provided in different periods certain irregular checks to this privilege of parliament and thereby maintained in some tolerable measure the dignity and authority of the crown In the ancient constitution before the beginning of the seventeenth century the meetings of parliament were precarious and were not frequent The sessions were short and the members had no leisure either to get acquainted with each other or with public business The ignorance of the age made men more submissive to that authority which governed them And above all the large demesnes of the crown with the small expense of government during that period rendered the prince almost independent and taught the parliament to preserve great submission and duty towards him In our present constitution many accidents which have rendered governments every where as well as in Great Britain much more burdensome than formerly have thrown into the hands of the crown the disposal of a large revenue and have enabled the king by the private interest and ambition of the members to restrain the public interest and ambition of the body While the opposition for we must still have an opposition open or disguised endeavors to draw every branch of administration under the cognizance of parliament the courtiers reserve a part to the disposal of the crown and the royal prerogative though deprived of its ancient powers still maintains a due weight in the balance of the constitution It was the fate of the house of Stuart to govern England at a period when the former source of authority was already much diminished and before the latter began to flow in any tolerable abundance Without a regular and fixed foundation the throne perpetually tottered and the prince sat upon it anxiously and precariously Every expedient used by James and Charles in order to support their dignity we have seen attended with sensible inconveniencies The majesty of the crown derived from ancient powers and prerogatives procured respect and checked the approaches of insolent intruders But it begat in the king so high an idea of his own rank and station as made him incapable of stooping to popular courses or submitting in any degree to the control of parliament The alliance with the hierarchy strengthened law by the sanction of religion but it enraged the Puritanical party and exposed the prince to the attacks of enemies numerous violent and implacable The memory too of these two kings from like causes has been attended in some degree with the same infelicity which pursued them during the whole course of their lives Though it must be confessed that their skill in government was not proportioned to the extreme delicacy of their situation a sufficient indulgence has not been given them and all the blame by several historians has been unjustly thrown on their side Their violations of law particularly those of Charles are in some few instances transgressions of a plain limit which was marked out to loyal authority But the encroachments of the commons though in the beginning less positive and determinate are no less discernible by good judges and were equally capable of destroying the just balance of the constitution While they exercised the powers transmitted to them in a manner more independent and less compliant than had ever before been practised the kings were perhaps imprudently but as they imagined from necessity tempted to assume powers which had scarcely ever been exercised or had been exercised in a different manner by the crown And from the shock of these opposite pretensions together with religious controversy arose all the factions convulsions and disorders which attended that period This footnote was in the first editions a part of the text Footnote six NOTE F p one hundred sixty six mister Carte in his Life of the duke of Ormond has given us some evidence to prove that this letter was entirely a forgery of the popular leaders in order to induce the king to sacrifice Strafford He tells us that Strafford said so to his son the night before his execution But there are some reasons why I adhere to the common way of telling this story one The account of the forgery comes through several hands and from men of characters not fully known to the public a circumstance which weakens every evidence It is a hearsay of a hearsay two It seems impossible but young Lord Strafford must inform the king who would not have failed to trace the forgery and expose his enemies to their merited infamy three It is not to be conceived but Clarendon and Whitlocke not to mention others must have heard of the matter four Sir George Ratcliffe in his Life of Strafford tells the story the same way that Clarendon and Whitlocke do Would he also who was Strafford s intimate friend never have heard of the forgery It is remarkable that this Life is dedicated or addressed to young Strafford Would not he have put Sir George right in so material and interesting a fact Footnote seven NOTE G p one hundred sixty seven What made this bill appear of less consequence was that the parliament voted tonnage and poundage for no longer a period than two months and as that branch was more than half of the revenue and the government could not possibly subsist without it it seemed indirectly in the power of the parliament to continue themselves as long as they pleased This indeed was true in the ordinary administration of government but on the approaches towards a civil war which was not then foreseen it had been of great consequence to the king to have reserved the right of dissolution and to have endured any extremity rather than allow the continuance of the parliament Footnote eight NOTE H p one hundred ninety It is now so universally allowed notwithstanding some muttering to the contrary that the king had no hand in the Irish rebellion that it will be superfluous to insist on a point which seems so clear I shall only suggest a very few arguments among an infinite number which occur one Ought the affirmation of perfidious infamous rebels ever to have passed for any authority two Nobody can tell us what the words of the pretended commission were That commission which we find in Rush vol v p four hundred and in Milton s Works Toland s edition is plainly an imposture because it pretends to be dated in October sixteen forty one yet mentions facts which happened not till some months after It appears that the Irish rebels observing some inconsistence in their first forgery were obliged to forge this commission anew yet could not render it coherent or probable three Nothing could be more obviously pernicious to the king s cause than the Irish rebellion because it increased his necessities and rendered him still more dependent on the parliament who had before sufficiently shown on what terms they would assist him four The instant the king heard of the rebellion which was a very few days after its commencement he wrote to the parliament and gave over to them the management of the war Had he built any projects on that rebellion would he not have waited some little time to see how they would succeed Would he presently have adopted a measure which was evidently so hurtful to his authority five What can be imagined to be the king s projects To raise the Irish to arms I suppose and bring them over to England for his assistance But is it not plain that the king never intended to raise war in England Had that been his intention would he have rendered the parliament perpetual Does it not appear by the whole train of events that the parliament forced him into the war six The king conveyed to the justices intelligence which ought to have prevented the rebellion seven The Irish Catholics in all their future transactions with the king where they endeavor to excuse their insurrection never had the assurance to plead his commission Even amongst themselves they dropped that pretext It appears that Sir Phelim O Neale chiefly and he only at first promoted that imposture See Carte s Ormond vol iii No one hundred one hundred eleven one hundred twelve one hundred fourteen one hundred fifteen one hundred twenty one one hundred thirty two one hundred thirty seven eight O Neale himself confessed the imposture on his trial and at his execution See Nalson vol ii p five hundred twenty eight Maguire at his execution made a like confession nine It is ridiculous to mention the justification which Charles II gave to the marquis of Antrim as if he had acted by his father s commission Antrim had no hand in the first rebellion and the massacre He joined not the rebels till two years after it was with the king s consent and he did important service in sending over a body of men to Montrose Footnote nine NOTE I p two hundred twenty The great courage and conduct displayed by many of the popular leaders have commonly inclined men to do them in one respect more honor than they deserve and to suppose that like able politicians they employed pretences which they secretly despised in order to serve their selfish purposes It is however probable if not certain that they were generally speaking the dupes of their own zeal Hypocrisy quite pure and free from fanaticism is perhaps except among men fixed in a determined philosophical scepticism then unknown as rare as fanaticism entirely purged from all mixture of hypocrisy So congenial to the human mind are religions sentiments that it is impossible to counterfeit long these holy fervors without feeling some share of the assumed warmth and on the other hand so precarious and temporary from the frailty of human nature is the operation of these spiritual views that the religious ecstasies if constantly employed must often be counterfeit and must be warped by those more familiar motives of interest and ambition which insensibly gain upon the mind This indeed teems the key to most of the celebrated characters of that age Equally full of fraud and of ardor these pious patriots talked perpetually of seeking the Lord yet still pursued their own purposes and have left a memorable lesson to posterity how delusive how destructive that principle is by which they were animated With regard to the people we can entertain no doubt that the controversy was on their part entirely theological The generality of the nation could never have flown out into such fury in order to obtain new privileges and acquire greater liberty than they and their ancestors had ever been acquainted with Their fathers had been entirely satisfied with the government of Elizabeth Why should they have been thrown into such extreme rage against Charles who from the beginning of his reign wished only to maintain such a government And why not at least compound matters with him when by all his laws it appeared that he had agreed to depart from it especially AS he had put it entirely out of his power to retract that resolution It is in vain therefore to dignify this civil war and the parliamentary authors of it by supposing it to have any other considerable foundation than theological zeal that great source of animosity among men The royalists also were very commonly zealots but as they were at the same time maintaining the established constitution in state as well as church they had an object which was natural and which might produce the greatest passion even without any considerable mixture of theological fervor The former part of this footnote was in the first editions a part of the text Footnote eleven NOTE K p two hundred twenty one In some of these declarations supposed to be penned by Lord Falkland is found the first regular definition of the constitution according to our present ideas of it that occurs in any English composition at least any published by authority The three species of government monarchical aristocratical and democratical are there plainly distinguished and the English government is expressly said to be none of them pure but all of them mixed and tempered together This style though the sense of it was implied in many institutions no former king of England would have used and no subject would have been permitted to use Banks and the crown lawyers against Hambden in the case of ship money insist plainly and openly on the king s absolute and sovereign power and the opposite lawyers do not deny it they only assert that the subjects have also a fundamental property in their goods and that no part of them can be taken but by their own consent in parliament But that the parliament was instituted to check and control the king and share the supreme power would in all former times have been esteemed very blunt and indiscreet if not illegal language We need not be surprised that governments should long continue though the boundaries of authority in their several branches be implicit confused and undetermined This is the case all over the world Who can draw an exact line between the spiritual and temporal powers in Catholic states What code ascertained the precise authority of the Roman senate in every occurrence Perhaps the English is the first mixed government where the authority of every part has been very accurately defined and yet there still remain many very important questions between the two houses that by common consent are buried in a discreet silence The king s power is indeed more exactly limited but this period of which we now treat is the time a which that accuracy commenced And it appears from Warwick and Hobbes that many royalists blamed this philosophical precision in the king s penman and thought that the veil was very imprudently drawn off the mysteries of government It is certain that liberty reaped mighty advantages from these controversies and inquiries and the royal authority itself became more secure within those provinces which were assigned to it Since the first publication of this History the sequel of Lord Clarendon has been published where that nobleman asserts that he himself was the author of most of these remonstrances and memorials of the king Footnote twelve NOTE L p two hundred forty Whitlocke who was one of the commissioners says p sixty five In this treaty the king manifested his great parts and abilities strength of reason and quickness of apprehension with much patience in hearing what was objected against him wherein he allowed all freedom and would himself sum up the arguments and give a most clear judgment upon them His unhappiness was that he had a better opinion of others judgments than of his own though they were weaker than his own and of this the parliament commissioners had experience to their great trouble They were often waiting on the king and debating some points of the treaty with him until midnight before they could come to a conclusion Upon one of the most material points they pressed his majesty with their reasons and best arguments they could use to grant what they desired The king said he was fully satisfied and promised to give them his answer in writing according to their desire but because it was then past midnight and too late to put it into writing he would have it drawn up next morning when he commanded them to wait on him again and then he would give them his answer in writing as it was now agreed upon But next morning the king told them that he had altered his mind and some of his friends of whom the commissioners inquired told them that after they were gone and even his council retired some of his bed chamber never left pressing and persuading him till they prevailed on him to change his former resolutions It is difficult however to conceive that any negotiation could have succeeded between the king and parliament while the latter insisted as they did all along on a total submission to all their demands and challenged the whole power which they professedly intended to employ to the punishment of all the king s friends Footnote thirteen NOTE M p two hundred forty seven The author is sensible that some blame may be thrown upon him on account of this last clause in mister Hambden s character as if he were willing to entertain a suspicion of bad intentions where the actions were praiseworthy But the author s meaning is directly contrary He esteems the last actions of mister Hambden s life to hare been very blamable though as they were derived from good motives only pushed to an extreme there is room left to believe that the intentions of that patriot as well as of many of his party were laudable Had the preceding administration of the king which we are apt to call arbitrary proceeded from ambition and an unjust desire of encroaching on the ancient liberties of the people there would have been less reason for giving him any trust or leaving in his hands a considerable share of that power which he had so much abused But if his conduct was derived in a great measure from necessity and from a natural desire of defending that prerogative which was transmitted to him from his ancestors and which his parliaments were visibly encroaching on there is no reason why he may not be esteemed a very virtuous prince and entirely worthy of trust from his people The attempt therefore of totally annihilating monarchical power was a very blamable extreme especially as it was attended with the danger to say the least of a civil war which besides the numberless ills inseparable from it exposed liberty to much greater perils than it could have incurred under the now limited authority of the king But as these points could not be supposed be clear during the time as they are or may be at present there are great reasons of alleviation for men who were heated by the controversy or engaged in the action And it is remarkable that even at present such is the force of party prejudices there are few people who have coolness enough to see these matters in a proper light or are convinced that the parliament could prudently have stopped in their pretensions They still plead the violations of liberty attempted by the king after granting the petition of right without considering the extreme harsh treatment which he met with after making that great concession and the impossibility of supporting government by the revenue then settled on the crown The worst of it is that there was a great tang of enthusiasm in the conduct of the parliamentary leaders which though it might render their conduct sincere will not much enhance their character with posterity And though Hambden was perhaps less infected with this spirit than many of his associates he appears not to have been altogether free from it Eds intended migration to America where he could only propose the advantage of enjoying Puritanical prayers and sermons will be allowed a proof of the prevalence of this spirit in him Footnote fourteen NOTE N p two hundred sixty In a letter of the king to the queen preserved in the British Museum and published by missus Macaulay vol iv p four hundred twenty he says that unless religion was preserved the militia being not as in France a formed powerful strength would be of little use to the crown and that if the pulpits had not obedience which would never be if Presbyterian government was absolutely established the king would have but small comfort of the militia This reasoning shows the king s good sense and proves that his attachment to Episcopacy though partly founded on religious principles was also in his situation derived from the soundest views of civil policy In reality it was easy for the king to perceive by the necessary connection between trifles and important matters and by the connection maintained at that time between religion and politics that when he was contending for the surplice he was in effect fighting for his crown and even for his head Few of the popular party could perceive this connection Most of them were carried headlong by fanaticism as might be expected in the ignorant multitude Few even of the leaders seem to have had more enlarged views Footnote fifteen NOTE O p two hundred ninety eight That Laud s severity was not extreme appears from this feet that he caused the acts or records of the high commission court to be searched and found that there had been fewer suspensions deprivations and other punishments by three during the seven years of his time than hi any seven years of his predecessor Abbott who was notwithstanding in great esteem with the house of commons Troubles and Trials of Laud p one hundred sixty four But Abbot was little attached to the court and was also a Puritan in doctrine and bore a mortal hatred to the Papists Not to mention that the mutinous spirit was rising higher in the time of Laud and would less bear control The maxims however of his administration were the same that had ever prevailed in England and that had place in every other European nation except Holland which studied chiefly the interests of commerce and France which was fettered by edicts and treaties To have changed them for the modern maxims of toleration how reasonable soever would have been deemed a very bold and dangerous enterprise It is a principle advanced by President Montesquieu that where the magistrate is satisfied with the established religion he ought to repress the first attempts towards innovation and only grant a toleration to sects that are diffused and established See L Esprit des Loix liv twenty five chap ten According to this principle Laud s indulgence to the Catholics and severity to the Puritans would admit of apology I own however that it is very questionable whether persecution can in any case be justified but at the same time it would be hard to give that appellation to Laud s conduct who only enforced the act of uniformity and expelled the clergymen that accepted of benefices and yet refused to observe the ceremonies which they previously knew to be enjoined by law He never refused them separate places of worship because they themselves would have esteemed it impious to demand them and no less impious to allow them Footnote sixteen NOTE P p three hundred nineteen doctor Birch has written a treatise on this subject It is not my business to oppose any facts contained in that gentleman s performance I shall only produce arguments which prove that Glamorgan when he received his private commission had injunctions from the king to net altogether in concert with Ormond one It seems to be implied in the very words of the commission Glamorgan is empowered and authorized to treat and conclude with the confederate Roman Catholics in Ireland If upon necessity any articles be condescended unto wherein the king s lieutenant cannot so well be seen in as not fit for us at present publicly to own Here no articles are mentioned which are not fit to be communicated to Ormond but only not fit for him and the king publicly to be seen in and to avow two The king s protestation to Ormond ought both on account of that prince s character and the reasons he assigns to have the greatest weight The words are these Ormond I cannot but add to my long letter that upon the word of a Christian I never intended Glamorgan should treat any thing without your approbation much less without your knowledge For besides the injury to you I was always diffident of his judgment though I could not think him so extremely weak as now to my cost I have found which you may easily perceive in a postscript of a letter of mine to you Carte vol ii App xxiii It is impossible that any man of honor however he might dissemble with his enemies would assert a falsehood in so solemn a manner to his best friend especially where that person must have had opportunities of knowing the truth The letter whose postscript is mentioned by the king is to be found in Carte vol ii App xiii three As the king had really so low an opinion of Glamorgan s understanding it is very unlikely that he would trust him with the sole management of so important and delicate a treaty And if he had intended that Glamorgan s negotiation should have been independent of Ormond he would never have told the latter nobleman of it nor have put him on his guard against Glamorgan s imprudence That the king judged aright of this nobleman s character appears from his Century of Arts or Scantling of Inventions which is a ridiculous compound of Hes chimeras and impossibilities and shows what might be expected from such a man four mister Carte has published a whole series of the king s correspondence with Ormond from the time that Glamorgan came into Ireland and it is evident that Charles all along considers the lord lieutenant as the person who was conducting the negotiations with the Irish The thirty first of July sixteen forty five after the battle of Naseby being reduced to great straits he writes earnestly to Ormond to conclude a peace upon certain conditions mentioned much inferior to those granted by Glamorgan and to come over himself with all the Irish he could engage in his service Carte vol iii No four hundred This would have been a great absurdity if he had already fixed a different canal by which on very different conditions he purposed to establish a peace On the twenty twod of October as his distresses multiply he somewhat enlarges the conditions though they still fall short of Glamorgan s a new absurdity See Carte vol iii p four hundred eleven five But What is equivalent to a demonstration that Glamorgan was conscious that he had no powers to conclude a treaty on these terms or without consulting the lord lieutenant and did not even expect that the king would ratify the articles is the defeasance which he gave to the Irish council at the time of signing the treaty The earl of Glamorgan does no way intend hereby to oblige his majesty other than he himself shall please after he has received these ten thousand men as a pledge and testimony of the said Roman Catholics loyalty and fidelity to his majesty yet he promises faithfully upon his word and honor not to acquaint his majesty with this defeasance till he had endeavored as far as in him lay to induce his majesty to the granting of the particulars in the said articles but that done the said commissioners discharge the said earl of Glamorgan both in honor and conscience of any further engagement to them therein though his majesty should not be pleased to grant the said particulars in the articles mentioned the said earl having given them assurance upon his word honor and voluntary oath that he would never to any person whatsoever discover this defeasance in the interim without their consents doctor Birch p ninety six All Glamorgan s view was to get troops for the king s service without hurting his own honor or his master s The wonder only is why the Irish accepted of a treaty which bound nobody and which the very person who concludes it seems to confess he does not expect to be ratified They probably hoped that the king would from their services be more easily induced to ratify a treaty which was concluded than to consent to its conclusion six I might add that the lord lieutenant s concurrence in the treaty was the more requisite because without it the treaty could not be carried into execution by Glamorgan nor the Irish troops be transported into England and even with Ormond s concurrence it clearly appears that a treaty so ruinous to the Protestant religion in Ireland could not be executed in opposition to the zealous Protestants in that kingdom No one can doubt of this truth who peruses Ormond s correspondence in mister Carte The king was sufficiently apprised of this difficulty It appears indeed to be the only reason why Ormond objected to the granting of high terms to the Irish Catholics doctor Birch in p three hundred sixty has published a letter of the king s to Glamorgan where he says Howbeit I know you cannot be but confident of my making good all instructions and promises to you and the nuncio But it is to be remarked that this letter is dated in April sixth sixteen forty six after there had been a new negotiation entered into between Glamorgan and the Irish and after a provisional treaty had even been concluded between them See doctor Birch p one hundred seventy nine The king s assurances therefore can plainly relate only to this recent transaction The old treaty had long been disavowed by the king and supposed by all parties to be annulled Footnote seventeen NOTE Q p three hundred forty seven Salmonet Ludlow Hollis et cetera all these especially the last being the declared inveterate enemies of Cromwell are the more to be credited when they advance any fact which may serve to apologize for his violent and criminal conduct There prevails a story that Cromwell intercepted a letter written to the queen where the king said that he would first raise and then destroy Cromwell But besides that this conduct seems to contradict the character of the king it is on other accounts totally unworthy of credit It is first told by Roger Coke a very passionate and foolish historian who wrote too so late as King William s reign and even he mentions it only as a mere rumor or hearsay without any known foundation In the memoirs of Lord Broghill we meet with another story of an intercepted letter which deserves some more attention and agrees very well with the narration here given It is thus related by mister Maurice chaplain to Roger earl of Orrery Lord Orrery in the time of his greatness with Cromwell just after he had so seasonably relieved him in his great distress at Clonmell riding out of Youghall one day with him and Ireton they fell into discourse about the king s death Cromwell thereupon said more than once that if the king had followed his own judgment and had been attended by none but trusty servants he had fooled them all and that once they had a mind to have closed with him but upon something that happened fell off from that design Orrery finding them in good humor and being alone with them asked if he might presume to desire to know why they would once have closed with his majesty and why they did not Cromwell very freely told him he would satisfy him in both his queries The reason says he why we would have closed with the king was this we found that the Scotch and Presbyterians began to be more powerful than we and were likely to agree with him and leave us in the lurch For this reason we thought it best to prevent them by offering first to come in upon reasonable conditions but whilst our thoughts were taken up with this subject there came a letter to us from one of our spies who was of the king s bedchamber acquainting us that our final doom was decreed that very day that he could not possibly learn what it was but we might discover it if we could but intercept a letter sent from the king to the queen wherein he informed her of his resolution that this letter was sown up in the skirt of a saddle and the bearer of it would come with the saddle upon his head about ten of the clock that night to the Blue Boar in Holborn where he was to take horse for Dover The messenger knew nothing of the letter in the saddle though some in Dover did We were at Windsor said Cromwell when we received this letter and immediately upon the receipt of it Ireton and I resolved to take one trusty fellow with us and to go in troopers habits to that inn We did so and leaving our man at the gate of the inn which had a wicket only open to let persons in and out to watch and give us notice when any man came in with a saddle we went into a drinking stall We there continued drinking cans of beer till about ten of the clock when our sentinel at the gate gave us notice that the man with the saddle was come We rose up presently and just as the man was leading out his horse saddled we came up to him with drawn swords and told him we were to search all that went in and out there but as he looked like an honest man we would only search his saddle and so dismiss him The saddle was ungirt we carried it into the stall where we had been drinking and ripping open one of the skirts we there found the letter we wanted Having thus got it into our hands we delivered the man whom we had left with our sentinel his saddle told him he was an honest fellow and bid him go about his business which he did pursuing his journey without more ado and ignorant of the harm he had suffered We found in the letter that his majesty acquainted the queen that he was courted by both factions the Scotch Presbyterians and the army and that those which bade the fairest for him should have him But yet he thought he should close with the Scots sooner than with the other Upon this we returned to Windsor and finding we were not like to have good terms from the king we from that time vowed his destruction This relation suiting well enough with other passages and circumstances at this time I have inserted to gratify the reader s curiosity Carte s Ormond vol ii p twelve Footnote eighteen NOTE R p three hundred forty nine These are the words Laneric I wonder to hear if that be true that some of my friends say that my going to Jersey would have much more furthered my personal treaty than my coming hither for which as I see no color of reason so I had not been here if I had thought that fancy true or had not been secured of a personal treaty of which I neither do nor I hope will repent for I am daily more and more satisfied with the governor and find these islanders very good peaceable and quiet people This encouragement I have thought not unfit for you to receive hoping at least it may do good upon others though needless to you Burnet s Memoirs of Hamilton p three hundred twenty six See also Rushworth part four vol ii p nine hundred forty one All the writers of that age except Clarendon represent the king s going to the Isle of Wight as voluntary and intended Perhaps the king thought it little for his credit to be trepanned into this measure and was more willing to take it on himself as entirely voluntary Perhaps he thought it would encourage his friends if they thought him in a situation which was not disagreeable to him Footnote nineteen NOTE S p three hundred sixty four The king composed a letter to the prince in which he related the whole course of this transaction and accompanied his narrative with several wise as well as pathetical reflections and advices The words with which he concluded the letter are remarkable By what hath been said you see how long I have labored in the search of peace Do not you be disheartened to tread in the same steps Use all worthy means to restore yourself to your rights but prefer the way of peace Show the greatness of your mine rather to conquer your enemies by pardoning than by punishing If you saw how unmanly and unchristian the implacable disposition is in our ill wishers you would avoid that spirit Censure me not for having parted with so much of our right The price was great but the commodity was security to us peace to my people And I am confident that another parliament would remember how useful a king s power is to a people s liberty of how much power I divested myself that I and they might meet once again in a parliamentary way in order to agree the bounds of prince and people Give belief to my experience never to affect more greatness or prerogative than what is really and intrinsically for the good of the subjects not the satisfaction of favorites If you thus use it you will never want means to be a father to all and a bountiful prince to any whom you incline to be extraordinarily gracious to You may perceive that all men intrust their treasure where it returns them interest and if a prince like the sea receive and repay all the fresh streams which the rivers intrust with him they will not grudge but pride themselves to make him up an ocean These considerations may make you as great a prince as your father if a low one and your state may be so much the more established as mine hath been shaken For our subjects have learned I dare say that victories over their princes are but triumphs over themselves and so will more unwillingly hearken to changes hereafter The English nation are a sober people however at present infatuated I know not but this may be the last time I may speak to you or the world publicly I am sensible into what hands I am fallen and yet I bless God I have those inward refreshments which the malice of my enemies cannot perturb I have learned to be busy myself by retiring into myself and therefore can the better digest whatever befalls me not doubting but God s providence will restrain our enemies power and turn their fierceness into his praise To conclude if God give you success use it humbly and be ever far from revenge If he restore you to your right on hard conditions whatever you promise keep These men who have violated laws which they were bound to preserve will find their triumphs full of trouble But do not you think any thing in the world worth attaining by foul and unjust means Footnote twenty NOTE T p three hundred eighty The imputation of insincerity on Charles I like most party clamors is difficult to be removed though it may not here be improper to say something with regard to it I shall first remark that this imputation seems to be of a later growth than his own age and that even his enemies though they loaded him with many calumnies did not insist on this accusation Ludlow I think is almost the only parliamentarian who imputes that vice to him and how passionate a writer he is must be obvious to every one Neither Clarendon nor any other of the royalists ever justify him from insincerity as not supposing that he had ever been accused of it In the second place his deportment and character in common life was free from that vice He was reserved distant stately cold in his address plain in his discourse inflexible in his principles wide of the caressing insinuating manners of his son or the professing talkative humor of his father The imputation of insincerity must be grounded on some of his public actions which we are therefore in the third place to examine The following are the only instances which I find cited to confirm that accusation one His vouching Buckingham s narrative of the transactions in Spain But it is evident that Charles himself was deceived why otherwise did he quarrel with Spain The following is a passage of a letter from Lord Kensington ambassador in France to the duke of Buckingham Cabbala p three hundred eighteen But his highness the prince had observed as great a weakness and folly as that in that after they the Spaniards had used him so ill they would suffer him to depart which was one of the first speeches he uttered after he came into the ship But did he say so said the queen of France Yes madam I will assure you quoth I from the witness of mine own ears She smiled and replied Indeed I heard he was used ill So he was answered I but not in his entertainment for that was as splendid as that country could afford it but in their frivolous delays and in the unreasonable conditions which they propounded and pressed upon the advantage they had of his princely person two Bishop Burnet in his History of the House of Hamilton p one hundred fifty four has preserved a letter of the king s to the Scottish bishops in which he desires them not to be present at the parliament where they would be forced to ratify the abolition of their own order For adds the king we do hereby assure you that it shall be still one of our chiefest studies how to rectify and establish the government of that church aright and to repair your losses which we desire you to be most confident of And in another place You may rest secure that though perhaps we may give way for the present to that which will be prejudicial both to the church and our own government yet we shall not leave thinking in time how to remedy both But does the king say that he will arbitrarily revoke his concessions Does not candor require us rather to suppose that he hoped his authority would so far recover as to enable him to obtain the national consent to reestablish Episcopacy which he believed so material a part of religion as well as of government It is not easy indeed to think how he could hope to effect this purpose in any other way than his father had taken that is by consent of parliament three There is a passage in Lord Clarendon where it is said that the king assented the more easily to the bill which excluded the bishops from the house of peers because he thought that that law being enacted by force could not be valid But the king certainly reasoned right in that conclusion Three fourths of the temporal peers were at that time banished by the violence of the populace Twelve bishops were unjustly thrown into the Tower by the commons Great numbers of the commons themselves were kept away by fear or violence The king himself was chased from London If all this be not force there is no such thing But this scruple of the king s affects only the bishops bill and that against pressing The other constitutional laws had passed without the least appearance of violence as did indeed all the bills passed during the first year except Strafford s attainder which could not be recalled The parliament therefore even if they had known the king s sentiments in this particular could not on that account have had any just foundation of jealousy four The king s letter intercepted at Naseby has been the source of much clamor We have spoken of it already in chapter lviii Nothing is more usual in all public transactions than such distinctions Alter the death of Charles II of Spain King William s ambassadors gave the duke of Anjou the title of King of Spain yet at that very time King William was secretly forming alliances to dethrone him and soon after he refused him that title and insisted as he had reason that he had not acknowledged his right Yet King William justly passes for a very sincere prince and this transaction is not regarded as any objection to his character in that particular In all the negotiations at the peace of Ryswic the French ambassadors always addressed King William as king of England yet it was made an express article of the treaty that the French king should acknowledge him as such Such a palpable difference is there between giving a title to a prince and positively recognizing his right to it I may add that Charles when he asserted that protestation in the council books before his council surely thought he had reason to justify his conduct There were too many men of honor in that company to avow a palpable cheat To which we may subjoin that if men were as much disposed to judge of this prince s actions with candor as severity this precaution of entering a protest in his council books might rather pass for a proof of scrupulous honor lest he should afterwards be reproached with breach of his word when he should think proper again to declare the assembly at Westminster no parliament five The denying of his commission to Glamorgan is another instance which has been cited This matter has been already treated in a footnote to chapter lviii That transaction was entirely innocent Even if the king had given a commission to Glamorgan to conclude that treaty and had ratified it will any reasonable man in our age think it strange that in order to save his own life his crown his family his friends and his party he should make a treaty with Papists and grant them very large concessions for their religion six There is another of the king s intercepted letters to the queen commonly mentioned where it is pretended he talked of raising and then destroying Cromwell But that story stands on no manner of foundation as we have observed in a preceding footnote to this chapter In a word the parliament after the commencement of their violences and still more after beginning the civil war had reason for their scruples and jealousies founded on the very nature of their situation and on the general propensity of the human mind not on any fault of the king s character who was candid sincere upright as much as any man whom we meet with in history Perhaps it would be difficult to find another character so unexceptionable in this particular As to the other circumstances of Charles s character chiefly exclaimed against namely his arbitrary principles in government one may venture to assert that the greatest enemies of this prince will not find in the long line of his predecessors from the conquest to his time any one king except perhaps his father whose administration was not more arbitrary and less legal or whose conduct could have been recommended to him by the popular party themselves as a model in this particular for his government Nor is it sufficient to say that example and precedent can never authorize vices Examples and precedents uniform and ancient can surely fix the nature of any constitution and the limits of any form of government There is indeed no other principle by which those landmarks or boundaries can be settled What a paradox in human affairs that Henry VIII should have been almost adored in his lifetime and his memory be respected while Charles I should by the same people at no greater distance than a century have been led to a public and ignominious execution and his name be ever after pursued by falsehood and by obloquy Even at present an historian who prompted by his courageous generosity should venture though from the most authentic and undisputed facts to vindicate the fame of that prince would be sure to meet with such treatment as would discourage even the boldest from so dangerous however splendid an enterprise Footnote twenty one NOTE U p three hundred ninety four The following instance of extravagance is given by Walker in his History of Independency part ii p one hundred fifty two About this time there came six soldiers into the parish church of Walton upon Thames near twilight mister Faucet the preacher there not having till then ended his sermon One of the soldiers had a lantern in his hand and a candle burning in it and in the other hand four candles not lighted He desired the parishioners to stay a while saying he had a message from God unto them and thereupon offered to go into the pulpit But the people refusing to give him leave so to do or to stay in the church he went into the churchyard and there told them that he had a vision wherein he had received a command from God to deliver his will unto them which he was to deliver and they to receive upon pain of damnation consisting of five lights one That the Sabbath was abolished as unnecessary Jewish and merely ceremonial And here quoth he I should put out the first light but the wind is so high I cannot kindle it two That tithes are abolished as Jewish and ceremonial a great burden to the saints of God and a discouragement of industry and tillage And here I should put out my second light et cetera three That ministers are abolished as anti Christian and of no longer use now Christ himself descends into the hearts of his saints and his spirit enlighteneth them with revelations and inspirations And here I should put out my third light et cetera four Magistrates are abolished as useless now that Christ himself is in purity amongst us and hath erected the kingdom of the saints upon earth Besides they are tyrants and oppressors of the liberty of the saints and tie them to laws and ordinances mere human inventions And here I should put out my fourth light et cetera five Then putting his hand into his pocket and pulling out a little Bible he showed it open to the people saying Here is a book you have in great veneration consisting of two parts the Old and New Testament I must tell you it is abolished It containeth beggarly rudiments milk for babes But now Christ is in glory amongst us and imparts a further measure of his spirit to his saints than this can afford I am commanded to burn it before your face Then putting out the candle he said And here my fifth light is extinguished It became a pretty common doctrine at that time that it was unworthy of a Christian man to pay rent to his fellow creatures and landlords were obliged to use all the penalties of law against their tenants whose conscience was scrupulous Footnote twenty four NOTE X p four hundred twenty four When the earl of Derby was alive he had been summoned by Ireton to surrender the Isle of Man and he returned this spirited and memorable answer I received your letter with indignation and with scorn return you this answer that I cannot but wonder whence you should gather any hopes that I should prove like you treacherous to my sovereign since you cannot be ignorant of my former actions in his late majesty s service from which principles of loyalty I am no whit departed I scorn your proffers I disdain your favor I abhor your treason and am so far from delivering up this island to your advantage that I shall keep it to the utmost of my power to your destruction Take this for your final answer and forbear any farther solicitations for if you trouble me with any more messages of this nature I will burn the paper and hang up the bearer This is the immutable resolution and shall be the undoubted practice of him who accounts it his chiefest glory to be his majesty s most loyal and obedient subject DERBY Footnote twenty five NOTE Y p four hundred twenty six It had been a usual policy of the Presbyterian ecclesiastics to settle a chaplain in the great families who acted as a spy upon his master and gave them intelligence of the most private transactions and discourses of the family a signal instance of priestly tyranny and the subjection of the nobility They even obliged the servants to give intelligence against their masters Whitlocke p five hundred two The same author p five hundred twelve tells the following story The synod meeting at Perth and citing the ministers and people who had expressed a dislike of their heavenly government the men being out of the way their wives resolved to answer for them And on the day of appearance one hundred and twenty women with good clubs in their hands came and besieged the church where the reverend ministers sat They sent one of their number to treat with the females and he threatening excommunication they basted him for his labor kept him prisoner and sent a party of sixty who routed the rest of the clergy bruised their bodies sorely took all their baggage and twelve horses One of the ministers after a mile s running taking all creatures for his foes meeting with a soldier fell on his knees who knowing nothing of the matter asked the blackcoat what he meant The female conquerors having laid hold on the synod clerk beat him till he forswore his office Thirteen ministers rallied about four miles from the place and voted that this village should never more have a synod in it but be accursed and that though in the years sixteen thirty eight and sixteen thirty nine the godly women were cried up for stoning the bishops yet now the whole sex should be esteemed wicked Footnote twenty six NOTE Z p four hundred sixty eight About this time an accident had almost robbed the protector of his life and saved his enemies the trouble of all their machinations Having got six fine Friesland coach horses as a present from the count of Oldenburgh he undertook for his amusement to drive them about Hyde Park his secretary Thurloe being in the coach The horses were startled and ran away He was unable to command them or keep the box He fell upon the pole was dragged upon the ground for some time A pistol which he carried in his pocket went off and by that singular good fortune which ever attended him he was taken up without any considerable hurt or bruise Footnote twenty seven NOTE AA p five hundred twelve After Monk s declaration for a free parliament on the eleventh of February he could mean nothing but the king s restoration yet it was long before he would open himself even to the king This declaration was within eight days after his arrival in London Had he ever intended to have set up for himself he would not surely have so soon abandoned a project so inviting he would have taken some steps which would have betrayed it It could only have been some disappointment some frustrated attempt which could have made him renounce the road of private ambition But there is not the least symptom of such intentions The story told of Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper by mister Locke has not any appearance of truth See Lord Linsdowne s Vindication and Philips s Continuation of Baker I shall add to what those authors have advanced that Cardinal Mazarine wished for the king s restoration though he would not have ventured much to have procured it End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The History of England in Three Volumes Vol I Part E by
