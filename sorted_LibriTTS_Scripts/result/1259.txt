none	none	yes Mazarin continued whilst his wonted smile full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his pale lips yes these noises prove to me indeed that the destiny of favorites is precarious but ye shall know I am no ordinary favorite No The Earl of Essex tis true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by his royal mistress whilst I I have nothing but a simple circlet of gold with a cipher on it and a date but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of the Palais Royal so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout Down with Mazarin I unknown and unperceived by them incite them to cry out Long live the Duke de Beaufort one day another Long live the Prince de Conde and again Long live the parliament And at this word the smile on the cardinal s lips assumed an expression of hatred of which his mild countenance seemed incapable The parliament We shall soon see how to dispose he continued of the parliament Both Orleans and Montargis are ours It will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying out Down with Mazarin will finish by shouting out Down with all the people I have mentioned each in his turn It is said that Mazarin who though a cardinal had not taken such vows as to prevent it was secretly married to Anne of Austria La Porte s Memoirs Richelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they now praise after his death was even less popular than I am Often he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of being sent away The queen will never banish me and even were I obliged to yield to the populace she would yield with me if I fly she will fly and then we shall see how the rebels will get on without either king or queen Oh were I not a foreigner were I but a Frenchman were I but of gentle birth The position of the cardinal was indeed critical and recent events had added to his difficulties Discontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in France Crushed and impoverished by taxation imposed by Mazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down to the very dust the people as the Advocate General Talon described it had nothing left to them except their souls and as those could not be sold by auction they began to murmur Patience had in vain been recommended to them by reports of brilliant victories gained by France laurels however were not meat and drink and the people had for some time been in a state of discontent Had this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signified for when the lower classes alone complained the court of France separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voice but unluckily Mazarin had had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments in the Court of Requests at a high price and as the officers of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union amongst themselves and enraged swore on the Bible not to allow of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions which might ensue and should any one of them chance to forfeit his post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss Now the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending parties On the seventh of January between seven and eight hundred tradesmen had assembled in Paris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied on house property They deputed ten of their number to wait upon the Duke of Orleans who according to his custom affected popularity The duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves against its collectors by force of arms They were listened to with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty We will see

none	none	we can do Two days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal and their spokesman addressed Mazarin with so much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received from the Duke of Orleans that he would see what could be done and in accordance with that intention a council of state was assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned This man named Emery was the object of popular detestation in the first place because he was superintendent of finance and every superintendent of finance deserved to be hated in the second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred He was the son of a banker at Lyons named Particelli who after becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to Emery and Cardinal Richelieu having discovered in him great financial aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to Louis XIII under his assumed name in order that he might be appointed to the post he subsequently held You surprise me exclaimed the monarch I am rejoiced to hear you speak of Monsieur d Emery as calculated for a post which requires a man of probity I was really afraid that you were going to force that villain Particelli upon me Sire replied Richelieu rest assured that Particelli the man
1914_121449_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 to whom 
none	none	your majesty refers has been hanged Ah so much the better exclaimed the king It is not for nothing that I am styled Louis the Just and he signed Emery s appointment This was the same Emery who became eventually superintendent of finance He was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the day before near the palace The mob had insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold fringe This lady was the daughter of Nicholas de Camus who arrived in Paris with twenty francs in his pocket became secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an income of forty thousand for himself The fact was that Emery s son had run a great chance of being suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed Nothing therefore was settled that day as Emery s head was not steady enough for business after such an occurrence On the next day Mathieu Mole the chief president whose courage at this crisis says the Cardinal de Retz was equal to that of the Duc de Beaufort and the Prince de Conde in other words of the two men who were considered the bravest in France had been attacked in his turn The people threatened to hold him responsible for the evils that hung over them But the chief president had replied with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the king s wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and proceed at once to hang the most active among them To which the others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows erected they would serve for the hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the people s misery Nor was this all On the eleventh the queen in going to mass at Notre Dame as she always did on Saturdays was followed by more than two hundred women demanding justice These poor creatures had no bad intentions They wished only to be allowed to fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they might move her to compassion but they were prevented by the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way haughtily disdainful of their entreaties At length parliament was convoked the authority of the king was to be maintained One day it was the morning of the day my story begins the king Louis XIV then ten years of age went in state under pretext of returning thanks for his recovery from the small pox to Notre Dame He took the opportunity of calling out his guard the Swiss troops and the musketeers and he had planted them round the Palais Royal on the quays and on the Pont Neuf After mass the young monarch drove to the Parliament House
1914_121446_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 where 
none	none	upon the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as he had already passed but issued new ones each one according to Cardinal de Retz more ruinous than the others a proceeding which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the chief president Mole whilst President Blancmesnil and Councillor Broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes The king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude to the Palais Royal All minds were uneasy most were foreboding many of the people used threatening language At first indeed they were doubtful whether the king s visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten or increase their burdens but scarcely was it known that the taxes were to be still further increased when cries of Down with Mazarin Long live Broussel Long live Blancmesnil resounded through the city For the people had learned that Broussel and Blancmesnil had made speeches in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies had been without avail it had none the less won for them the people s good will All attempts to disperse the groups collected in the streets or silence their exclamations were in vain Orders had just been given to the royal guards and the Swiss guards not only to stand firm but to send out patrols to the streets of Saint Denis and Saint Martin where the people thronged and where they were the most vociferous when the mayor of Paris was announced at the Palais Royal He was shown in directly he came to say that if these offensive precautions were not discontinued in two hours Paris would be under arms Deliberations were being held when a lieutenant in the guards named Comminges made his appearance with his clothes all torn his face streaming with blood The queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on As the mayor had foreseen the sight of the guards had exasperated the mob The tocsin was sounded Comminges had arrested one of the ringleaders and had ordered him to be hanged near the cross of Du Trahoir but in attempting to execute this command the soldiery were attacked in the market place with stones and halberds the delinquent had escaped to the Rue des Lombards and rushed into a house They broke open the doors and searched the dwelling but in vain Comminges wounded by a stone which had struck him on the forehead had left a picket in the street and returned to the Palais Royal followed by a menacing crowd to tell his story This account confirmed that of the mayor The authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious revolt Mazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the quays and on the Pont Neuf on account of the ceremonial of the day and that they would soon withdraw In fact about four o clock they were all concentrated about the Palais Royal the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers and Swiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance Such was the state of affairs at the very moment we introduced our readers to the study of Cardinal Mazarin once that of Cardinal Richelieu We have seen in what state of mind he listened to the murmurs from below which even reached him in his seclusion and to the guns the firing of which resounded through that room All at once he raised his head his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed a resolution he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the table near him he shrilled it twice A door hidden in the tapestry opened noiselessly and a man in black silently advanced and stood behind the chair on which Mazarin sat Bernouin said the cardinal not turning round for having whistled he knew that it was his valet de chambre who was behind him what musketeers are now within the palace The Black Musketeers my lord What company Treville s company Is there any officer belonging to this company in the ante chamber Lieutenant d Artagnan A man on whom we can depend I hope Yes my lord Give me a uniform of one of these musketeers and help me to put it on The valet went out as silently as he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded The cardinal in deep thought and in silence began to take off the robes of state he had assumed in order to be present at the sitting of parliament and to attire himself in the military coat which he wore with a certain degree of easy grace owing to his former campaigns in Italy When he was completely dressed he said Send hither Monsieur d Artagnan The valet went out of the room this time by the centre door but still as silently as before one might have fancied him an apparition When he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass with a feeling of self satisfaction Still young for he was scarcely forty six years of age he possessed great elegance of form and was above the middle height his complexion was brilliant and beautiful his glance full of expression his nose though large was well proportioned his forehead broad and majestic his hair of a chestnut color was curled slightly his beard which was darker than his hair was turned carefully with a curling iron a practice that greatly improved it After a short time the cardinal arranged his shoulder belt then looked with great complacency at his hands which were most elegant and of which he took the greatest care and throwing on one side the large kid gloves tried on at first as belonging to the uniform he put on others of silk only At this instant the door opened Monsieur d Artagnan said the valet de chambre An officer as he spoke entered the apartment He was a man between thirty nine and forty years of age of medium height but a
2010_121416_000130_000000	train-clean-360	 very well 
none	none	proportioned figure with an intellectual and animated physiognomy his beard black and his hair turning gray as often happens when people have found life either too gay or too sad more especially when they happen to be of swart complexion D Artagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment How perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room Seeing however no one there except a musketeer of his own troop he fixed his eyes upon the supposed soldier in whose dress nevertheless he recognized at the first glance the cardinal The lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but respectful posture such as became a man of good birth who had in the course of his life been frequently in the society of the highest nobles The cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather than serious glance yet he examined his countenance with attention and after a momentary silence said You are Monsieur d Artagnan I am that individual replied the officer Mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence the play of which had been nevertheless subdued by age and experience and D Artagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly sustained many a searching look very different indeed from those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant Sir resumed the cardinal you are to come with me or rather I am to go with you I am at your command my lord returned D Artagnan I wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the Palais Royal do you suppose that there is any danger in so doing Danger my lord exclaimed D Artagnan with a look of astonishment what danger I am told that there is a general insurrection The uniform of the king s musketeers carries a certain respect with it and even if that were not the case I would engage with four of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns Did you witness the injury sustained by Comminges Monsieur de Comminges is in the guards and not in the musketeers Which means I suppose that the musketeers are better soldiers than the guards The cardinal smiled as he spoke Every one likes his own uniform best my lord Myself excepted and again Mazarin smiled for you perceive that I have left off mine and put on yours Lord bless us this is modesty indeed cried D Artagnan Had I such a uniform as your eminence possesses I protest I should be mightily content and I would take an oath never to wear any other costume Yes but for to night s adventure I don t suppose my dress would have been a very safe one Give me my felt hat Bernouin The valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide brim The cardinal put it on in military style Your horses are ready saddled in their stables are they not he said turning to D Artagnan Yes my lord Well let us set out How many men does your eminence wish to escort you You say that with four men you will undertake to disperse a hundred low fellows as it may happen that we shall have to encounter two hundred take eight As many as my lord wishes I will follow you This way light us downstairs Bernouin The valet held a wax light the cardinal took a key from his bureau and opening the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the Palais Royal two A Nightly Patrol In ten minutes Mazarin and his party were traversing the street Les Bons Enfants behind the theatre built by Richelieu expressly for the play of Mirame and in which Mazarin who was an amateur of music but not of literature had introduced into France the first opera that was ever acted in that country The appearance of the town denoted the greatest agitation Numberless groups paraded the streets and whatever D Artagnan might think of it it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance in order to assume a warlike aspect From time to time noises came in the direction of the public markets The report of firearms was heard near the Rue Saint Denis and occasionally church bells began to ring indiscriminately and at the caprice of the populace D Artagnan meantime pursued his way with the indifference of a man upon whom such acts of folly made no impression When he approached a group in the middle of the street he urged his horse upon it without a word of warning and the members of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave place to the patrol The cardinal envied that composure which he attributed to the habit of meeting danger but none the less he conceived for the officer under whose orders he had for the moment placed himself that consideration which even prudence pays to careless courage On approaching an outpost near the Barriere des Sergens the sentinel cried out Who s there and D Artagnan answered having first asked the word of the cardinal Louis and Rocroy After which he inquired if Lieutenant Comminges were not the commanding officer at the outpost The soldier replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing on foot his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual to whom he was talking sat Here was the officer D Artagnan was seeking Here is Monsieur Comminges said D Artagnan returning to the cardinal He instantly retired from a feeling of respectful delicacy it was however evident that the cardinal was recognized by both Comminges and the other officers on horseback Well done Guitant cried the cardinal to the equestrian I see plainly that notwithstanding the sixty four years that have passed over your head you are still the same man active and zealous What were you saying to this youngster My lord replied Guitant I was observing that we live in troublous times and that to day s events are very like those in the days of the Ligue of which I heard so much in my youth Are you aware that the mob have even suggested throwing up barricades in the Rue Saint Denis and the Rue Saint Antoine And what was Comminges saying to you in reply my good Guitant My lord said Comminges I answered that to compose a Ligue only one ingredient was wanting in my opinion an essential one a Duc de Guise moreover no generation ever does the same thing twice No but they mean to make a Fronde as they call it said Guitant And what is a Fronde inquired Mazarin My lord Fronde is the name the discontented give to their party And what is the origin of this name It seems that some days since Councillor Bachaumont remarked at the palace that rebels and agitators reminded him of schoolboys slinging qui frondent stones from the moats round Paris young urchins who run off the moment the constable appears only to return to their diversion the instant his back is turned So they have picked up the word and the insurrectionists are called Frondeurs and yesterday every article sold was a la Fronde bread a la Fronde hats a la Fronde to say nothing of gloves pocket handkerchiefs and fans but listen At that moment a window opened and a man began to sing A tempest from the Fronde Did blow to day I think twill blow Sieur Mazarin away Insolent wretch cried Guitant My lord said Comminges who irritated by his wounds wished for revenge and longed to give back blow for blow shall I fire off a ball to punish that jester and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future And as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncle s saddle bow
2238_121415_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 Certainly 
none	none	not certainly not exclaimed Mazarin Diavolo my dear friend you are going to spoil everything everything is going on famously I know the French as well as if I had made them myself They sing let them pay the piper During the Ligue about which Guitant was speaking just now the people chanted nothing except the mass so everything went to destruction Come Guitant come along and let s see if they keep watch at the Quinze Vingts as at the Barriere des Sergens And waving his hand to Comminges he rejoined D Artagnan who instantly put himself at the head of his troop followed by the cardinal Guitant and the rest of the escort Just so muttered Comminges looking after Mazarin True I forgot provided he can get money out of the people that is all he wants The street of Saint Honore when the cardinal and his party passed through it was crowded by an assemblage who standing in groups discussed the edicts of that memorable day They pitied the young king who was unconsciously ruining his country and threw all the odium of his proceedings on Mazarin Addresses to the Duke of Orleans and to Conde were suggested Blancmesnil and Broussel seemed in the highest favor D Artagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just as if his horse and he had been made of iron Mazarin and Guitant conversed together in whispers The musketeers who had already discovered who Mazarin was followed in profound silence In the street of Saint Thomas du Louvre they stopped at the barrier distinguished by the name of Quinze Vingts Here Guitant spoke to one of the subalterns asking how matters were progressing Ah captain said the officer everything is quiet hereabout if I did not know that something is going on in yonder house And he pointed to a magnificent hotel situated on the very spot whereon the Vaudeville now stands In that hotel it is the Hotel Rambouillet cried Guitant I really don t know what hotel it is all I do know is that I observed some suspicious looking people go in there Nonsense exclaimed Guitant with a burst of laughter those men must be poets Come Guitant speak if you please respectfully of these gentlemen said Mazarin don t you know that I was in my youth a poet I wrote verses in the style of Benserade You my lord Yes I shall I repeat to you some of my verses Just as you please my lord I do not understand Italian Yes but you understand French and Mazarin laid his hand upon Guitant s shoulder My good my brave Guitant whatsoever command I may give you in that language in French whatever I may order you to do will you not perform it Certainly I have already answered that question in the affirmative but that command must come from the queen herself Yes ah yes Mazarin bit his lips as he spoke I know your devotion to her majesty I have been a captain in the queen s guards for twenty years was the reply En route Monsieur d Artagnan said the cardinal all goes well in this direction D Artagnan in the meantime had taken the head of his detachment without a word and with that ready and profound obedience which marks the character of an old soldier He led the way toward the hill of Saint Roche The Rue Richelieu and the Rue Villedot were then owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less frequented than any others in that direction for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout Who is in command here asked the cardinal Villequier said Guitant Diavolo Speak to him yourself for ever since you were deputed by me to arrest the Duc de Beaufort this officer and I have been on bad terms He laid claim to that honor as captain of the royal guards I am aware of that and I have told him a hundred times that he was wrong The king could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old Yes but I could give him the order I Guitant and I preferred to give it to you Guitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call Monsieur de Villequier Ah so you are here cried the officer in the tone of ill humor habitual to him what the devil are you doing here I wish to know can you tell me pray is anything fresh occurring in this part of the town What do you mean People cry out Long live the king down with Mazarin That s nothing new no we ve been used to those acclamations for some time And you sing chorus replied Guitant laughing Faith I ve half a mind to do it In my opinion the people are right and cheerfully would I give up five years of my pay which I am never paid by the way to make the king five years older Really And pray what would come to pass supposing the king were five years older than he is As soon as ever the king comes of age he will issue his commands himself and tis far pleasanter to obey the grandson of Henry IV than the son of Peter Mazarin Sdeath I would die willingly for the king but supposing I happened to be killed on account of Mazarin as your nephew came near being to day there could be nothing in Paradise however well placed I might be there that could console me for it Well well Monsieur de Villequier Mazarin interposed I shall make it my care the king hears of your loyalty Come gentlemen addressing the troop let us return Stop exclaimed Villequier so Mazarin was here so much the better I have been waiting for a long time to tell him what I think of him I am obliged to you Guitant although your intention was perhaps not very favorable to me for such an opportunity He turned away and went off to his post whistling a tune then popular among the party called the Fronde whilst Mazarin returned in a pensive mood toward the Palais Royal All that he had heard from these three different men Comminges Guitant and Villequier confirmed him in his conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one on his side except the queen and then Anne of Austria had so often deserted her friends that her support seemed most precarious During the whole of this nocturnal ride during the whole time that he was endeavoring to understand the various characters of Comminges Guitant and Villequier Mazarin was in truth studying more especially one man This man who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the mob not a muscle of whose face was stirred either at Mazarin s witticisms or by the jests of the multitude seemed to the cardinal a peculiar being who having participated in past events similar to those now occurring was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of taking place The name of D Artagnan was not altogether new to Mazarin who although he did not arrive in France before the year sixteen thirty four or sixteen thirty five that is to say about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in a preceding narrative fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of one who was said to be a model of courage address and loyalty The Three Musketeers Possessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about D Artagnan immediately of course he could not inquire from D Artagnan himself who he was and what had been his career he remarked however in the course of conversation that the lieutenant of musketeers spoke with a Gascon accent Now the Italians and the Gascons are too much alike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them may say of himself so in reaching the walls which surrounded the Palais Royal the cardinal knocked at a little door and after thanking D Artagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the Palais Royal he made a sign to Guitant to follow him They both dismounted consigned their horses to the lackey who had opened the door and disappeared in the garden My dear friend said the cardinal leaning as they walked through the garden on his friend s arm you told me just now that you had been twenty years in the queen s service Yes it s true I have returned Guitant Now my dear Guitant I have often remarked that in addition to your courage which is indisputable and your fidelity which is invincible you possess an admirable memory You have found that out have you my lord Deuce take it all the worse for me How There is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to know when to forget But you Guitant are not a courtier You are a brave soldier one of the few remaining veterans of the days of Henry IV Alas how few to day exist Plague on t my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me No I only brought you here to ask you returned Mazarin smiling if you have taken any particular notice of our lieutenant of musketeers Monsieur d Artagnan I have had no occasion to notice him particularly he s an old acquaintance He s a Gascon De Treville knows him and esteems him very highly and De Treville as you know is one of the queen s greatest friends As a soldier the man ranks well he did his whole duty and even more at the siege of Rochelle as at Suze and Perpignan But you know Guitant we poor ministers often want men with other qualities besides courage we want men of talent Pray was not Monsieur d Artagnan in the time of the cardinal mixed up in some intrigue from which he came out according to report quite cleverly My lord as to the report you allude to Guitant perceived that the cardinal wished to make him speak out I know nothing but what the public knows I never meddle in intrigues and if I occasionally become a confidant of the intrigues of others I am sure your eminence will approve of my keeping them secret Mazarin shook his head Ah he said some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know My lord replied Guitant such ministers do not weigh men in the same balance they get their information on war from warriors on intrigues from intriguers Consult some politician of the period of which you speak and if you pay well for it you will certainly get to know all you want Eh pardieu said Mazarin with a grimace which he always made when spoken to about money They will be paid if there is no way of getting out of it Does my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day By Bacchus rejoined Mazarin impatiently it s about an hour since I asked you for that very thing wooden head that you are There is one man for whom I can answer if he will speak out That s my concern I will make him speak Ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they don t wish to let out Pooh with patience one must succeed Well this man Who is he The Comte de Rochefort The Comte de Rochefort Unfortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and I don t know where he is I know Guitant said Mazarin Well then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information You think resumed Mazarin that Rochefort He was Cardinal Richelieu s creature my lord I warn you however his services will cost you something The cardinal was lavish to his underlings Yes yes Guitant said Mazarin Richelieu was a great man a very great man but he had that defect Thanks Guitant I shall benefit by your advice this very evening Here they separated and bidding

none	none	crime are you imprisoned in the Bastile Do you wish me to speak the truth Yes Well then I don t know Have you any suspicion of me Rochefort No on the honor of a gentleman but I cannot be imprisoned for the reason alleged it is impossible What reason asked D Artagnan For stealing For stealing you Rochefort you are laughing at me I understand You mean that this demands explanation do you not I admit it Well this is what actually took place One evening after an orgy in Reinard s apartment at the Tuileries with the Duc d Harcourt Fontrailles De Rieux and others the Duc d Harcourt proposed that we should go and pull cloaks on the Pont Neuf that is you know a diversion which the Duc d Orleans made quite the fashion Were you crazy Rochefort at your age No I was drunk And yet since the amusement seemed to me rather tame I proposed to Chevalier de Rieux that we should be spectators instead of actors and in order to see to advantage that we should mount the bronze horse No sooner said than done Thanks to the spurs which served as stirrups in a moment we were perched upon the croupe we were well placed and saw everything Four or five cloaks had already been lifted with a dexterity without parallel and not one of the victims had dared to say a word when some fool of a fellow less patient than the others took it into his head to cry out Guard and drew upon us a patrol of archers Duc d Harcourt Fontrailles and the others escaped De Rieux was inclined to do likewise but I told him they wouldn t look for us where we were He wouldn t listen put his foot on the spur to get down the spur broke he fell with a broken leg and instead of keeping quiet took to crying out like a gallows bird I then was ready to dismount but it was too late I descended into the arms of the archers They conducted me to the Chatelet where I slept soundly being very sure that on the next day I should go forth free The next day came and passed the day after a week I then wrote to the cardinal The same day they came for me and took me to the Bastile That was five years ago Do you believe it was because I committed the sacrilege of mounting en croupe behind Henry IV No you are right my dear Rochefort it couldn t be for that but you will probably learn the reason soon Ah indeed I forgot to ask you where are you taking me To the cardinal What does he want with me I do not know I did not even know that you were the person I was sent to fetch Impossible you a favorite of the minister A favorite no indeed cried D Artagnan Ah my poor friend I am just as poor a Gascon as when I saw you at Meung twenty two years ago you know alas and he concluded his speech with a deep sigh Nevertheless you come as one in authority Because I happened to be in the ante chamber when the cardinal called me by the merest chance I am still a lieutenant in the musketeers and have been so these twenty years Then no misfortune has happened to you And what misfortune could happen to me To quote some Latin verses I have forgotten or rather never knew well the thunderbolt never falls on the valleys and I am a valley dear Rochefort one of the lowliest of the low Then Mazarin is still Mazarin The same as ever my friend it is said that he is married to the queen Married If not her husband he is unquestionably her lover You surprise me Rebuff Buckingham and consent to Mazarin Just like the women replied D Artagnan coolly Like women not like queens Egad queens are the weakest of their sex when it comes to such things as these And M de Beaufort is he still in prison Yes

none	none	Oh nothing but that he might get me out of this if he were favorably inclined to me You are probably nearer freedom than he is so it will be your business to get him out And said the prisoner what talk is there of war with Spain With Spain no answered D Artagnan but Paris What do you mean cried Rochefort Do you hear the guns pray The citizens are amusing themselves in the meantime And you do you really think that anything could be done with these bourgeois Yes they might do well if they had any leader to unite them in one body How miserable not to be free Don t be downcast Since Mazarin has sent for you it is because he wants you I congratulate you Many a long year has passed since any one has wanted to employ me so you see in what a situation I am Make your complaints known that s my advice Listen Rochefort let us make a compact We are friends are we not Egad I bear the traces of our friendship three slits or slashes from your sword Well if you should be restored to favor don t forget me On the honor of a Rochefort but you must do the like for me There s my hand I promise Therefore whenever you find any opportunity of saying something in my behalf I shall say it and you I shall do the same Apropos are we to speak of your friends also Athos Porthos and Aramis or have you forgotten them Almost What has become of them I don t know we separated as you know

none	none	cried Rochefort Did we not swear friendship Ah had any one but you been there I don t say D Artagnan bowed Is it possible that Rochefort has become a better man than I am he said to himself And he caused himself to be announced to the minister Let M de Rochefort enter said Mazarin eagerly on hearing their names pronounced and beg M d Artagnan to wait I shall have further need of him These words gave great joy to D Artagnan As he had said it had been a long time since any one had needed him and that demand for his services on the part of Mazarin seemed to him an auspicious sign Rochefort rendered suspicious and cautious by these words entered the apartment where he found Mazarin sitting at the table dressed in his ordinary garb and as one of the prelates of the Church his costume being similar to that of the abbes in that day excepting that his scarf and stockings were violet As the door was closed Rochefort cast a glance toward Mazarin which was answered by one equally furtive from the minister There was little change in the cardinal still dressed with sedulous care his hair well arranged and curled his person perfumed he looked owing to his extreme taste in dress only half his age But Rochefort who had passed five years in prison had become old in the lapse of a few years the dark locks of this estimable friend of the defunct Cardinal Richelieu were now white the deep bronze of his complexion had been succeeded by a mortal pallor which betokened debility As he gazed at him Mazarin shook his head slightly as much as to say This is a man who does not appear to me fit for much After a pause which appeared an age to Rochefort Mazarin took from a bundle of papers a letter and showing it to the count he said I find here a letter in which you sue for liberty Monsieur de Rochefort You are in prison then Rochefort trembled in every limb at this question But I thought he said that your eminence knew that circumstance better than any one I Oh no There is a congestion of prisoners in the Bastile who were cooped up in the time of Monsieur de Richelieu I don t even know their names Yes but in regard to myself my lord it cannot be so for I was removed from the Chatelet to the Bastile owing to an order from your eminence You think you were I am certain of it Ah stay I fancy I remember it Did you not once refuse to undertake a journey to Brussels for the queen Ah ah exclaimed Rochefort There is the true reason Idiot that I am though I have been trying to find it out for five years I never found it out But I do not say it was the cause of your imprisonment I merely ask you did you not refuse to go to Brussels for the queen whilst you had consented to go there to do some service for the late cardinal That is the very reason I refused to go back to Brussels I was there at a fearful moment I was sent there to intercept a correspondence between Chalais and the archduke and even then when I was discovered I was nearly torn to pieces How could I then return to Brussels I should injure the queen instead of serving her Well since the best motives are liable to misconstruction the queen saw in your refusal nothing but a refusal a distinct refusal she had also much to complain of you during the lifetime of the late cardinal yes her majesty the queen Rochefort smiled contemptuously Since I was a faithful servant my lord to Cardinal Richelieu during his life it stands to reason that now after his death I should serve you well in defiance of the whole world With regard to myself Monsieur de Rochefort replied Mazarin I am not like Monsieur de Richelieu all powerful I am but a minister who wants no servants being myself nothing but a servant of the queen s Now the queen is of a sensitive nature Hearing of your refusal to obey her she looked upon it as a declaration of war and as she considers you a man of superior talent and consequently dangerous she desired me to make sure of you that is the reason of your being shut up in the Bastile But your release can be managed You are one of those men who can comprehend certain matters and having understood them can act with energy Such was Cardinal Richelieu s opinion my lord The cardinal interrupted Mazarin was a great politician and therein shone his vast superiority over me I am a straightforward simple man that s my great disadvantage I am of a frankness of character quite French Rochefort bit his lips in order to prevent a smile Now to the point I want friends I want faithful servants When I say I want I mean the queen wants them I do nothing without her commands pray understand that not like Monsieur de Richelieu who went on just as he pleased So I shall never be a great man as he was but to compensate for that I shall be a good man Monsieur de Rochefort and I hope to prove it to you Rochefort knew well the tones of that soft voice in which sounded sometimes a sort of gentle lisp like the hissing of young vipers I am disposed to believe your eminence he replied though I have had but little evidence of that good nature of which your eminence speaks Do not forget that I have been five years in the Bastile and that no medium of viewing things is so deceptive as the grating of a prison Ah Monsieur de Rochefort have I not told you already that I had nothing to do with that The queen cannot you make allowances for the pettishness of a queen and a princess But that has passed away as suddenly as it came and is forgotten I can easily suppose sir that her majesty has forgotten it amid the fetes and the courtiers of the Palais Royal but I who have passed those years in the Bastile Ah mon Dieu my dear Monsieur de Rochefort do you absolutely think that the Palais Royal is the abode of gayety No We have had great annoyances there As for me I play my game squarely fairly and above board as I always do Let us come to some conclusion Are you one of us Monsieur de Rochefort I am very desirous of being so my lord but I am totally in the dark about everything In the Bastile one talks politics only with soldiers and jailers and you have not an idea my lord how little is known of what is going on by people of that sort I am of Monsieur de Bassompierre s party Is he still one of the seventeen peers of France He is dead sir a great loss His devotion to the queen was boundless men of loyalty are scarce I think so forsooth said Rochefort and when you find any of them you march them off to the Bastile However there are plenty in the world but you don t look in the right direction for them my lord Indeed explain to me Ah my dear Monsieur de Rochefort how much you must have learned during your intimacy with the late cardinal Ah he was a great man Will your eminence be angry if I read you a lesson I never you know you may say anything to me I try to be beloved not feared Well there is on the wall of my cell scratched with a nail a proverb which says Like master like servant Pray what does that mean It means that Monsieur de Richelieu was able to find trusty servants dozens and dozens of them He the point aimed at by every poniard Richelieu who passed his life in warding off blows which were forever aimed at him But he did ward them off said De Rochefort and the reason was that though he had bitter enemies he possessed also true friends I have known persons he continued for he thought he might avail himself of the opportunity of speaking of D Artagnan who by their sagacity and address have deceived the penetration of Cardinal Richelieu who by their valor have got the better of his guards and spies persons without money without support without credit yet who have preserved to the crowned head its crown and made the cardinal crave pardon But those men you speak of said Mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing Rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against him No in that case they would have met with more fitting reward They had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking servants But how is it that you know so much of these matters I know them because the men of whom I speak were at that time my enemies because they fought against me because I did them all the harm I could and they returned it to the best of their ability because one of them with whom I had most to do gave me a pretty sword thrust now about seven years ago the third that I received from the same hand it closed an old account Ah said Mazarin with admirable suavity could I but find such men My lord there has stood for six years at your very door a man such as I describe and during those six years he has been unappreciated and unemployed by you Who is it It is Monsieur d Artagnan That Gascon cried Mazarin with well acted surprise That Gascon has saved a queen and made Monsieur de Richelieu confess that in point of talent address and political skill to him he was only a tyro Really It is as I have the honor of telling it to your excellency Tell me a little about it my dear Monsieur de Rochefort That is somewhat difficult my lord said Rochefort with a smile Then he will tell it me himself I doubt it my lord Why do you doubt it Because the secret does not belong to him because as I have told you it has to do with a great queen And he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that No my lord he had three colleagues three brave men men such as you were wishing for just now And were these four men attached to each other true in heart really united As if they had been one man as if their four hearts had pulsated in one breast You pique my curiosity dear Rochefort pray tell me the whole story That is impossible but I will tell you a true story my lord Pray do so I delight in stories cried the cardinal Listen then returned Rochefort as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinal s motive Once upon a time there lived a queen a powerful monarch who reigned over one of the greatest kingdoms of the universe and a minister and this minister wished much to injure the queen whom once he had loved too well Do not try my lord you cannot guess who it is all this happened long before you came into the country where this queen reigned There came to the court an ambassador so brave so magnificent so elegant that every woman lost her heart to him and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like them As these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his majesty to insist upon the queen s appearing in them as part of her jewels at a ball which was soon to take place There is no occasion to tell you my lord that the minister knew for a fact that these ornaments had sailed away with the ambassador who was far away beyond seas This illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her subjects fallen from her high estate Indeed Well my lord four men resolved to save her These four men were not princes neither were they dukes neither were they men in power they were not even rich They were four honest soldiers each with a good heart a good arm and a sword at the service of those who wanted it They set out The minister knew of their departure and had planted people on the road to prevent them ever reaching their destination Three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants one of them alone arrived at the port having either killed or wounded those who wished to stop him He crossed the sea and brought back the set of ornaments to the great queen who was able to wear them on her shoulder on the appointed day and this very nearly ruined the minister What do you think of that exploit my lord It is magnificent said Mazarin thoughtfully Well I know of ten such men Mazarin made no reply he reflected Five or six minutes elapsed You have nothing more to ask of me my lord said Rochefort Yes And you say that Monsieur d Artagnan was one of those four men He led the enterprise And who were the others I leave it to Monsieur d Artagnan to name them my lord They were his friends and not mine He alone would have any influence with them I do not even know them under their true names You suspect me Monsieur de Rochefort I want him and you and all to aid me Begin with me my lord for after five or six years of imprisonment it is natural to feel some curiosity as to one s destination You my dear Monsieur de Rochefort shall have the post of confidence you shall go to Vincennes where Monsieur de Beaufort is confined you will guard him well for me Well what is the matter The matter is that you have proposed to me what is impossible said Rochefort shaking his head with an air of disappointment What impossible And why is it impossible Because Monsieur de Beaufort is one of my friends or rather I am one of his Have you forgotten my lord that it is he who answered for me to the queen Since then Monsieur de Beaufort has become an enemy of the State That may be my lord but since I am neither king nor queen nor minister he is not my enemy and I cannot accept your offer This then is what you call devotion I congratulate you Your devotion does not commit you too far Monsieur de Rochefort And then my lord continued Rochefort you understand that to emerge from the Bastile in order to enter Vincennes is only to change one s prison Say at once that you are on the side of Monsieur de Beaufort that will be the most sincere line of conduct said Mazarin My lord I have been so long shut up that I am only of one party I am for fresh air Employ me in any other way employ me even actively but let it be on the high roads My dear Monsieur de Rochefort Mazarin replied in a tone of raillery you think yourself still a young man your spirit is that of the phoenix but your strength fails you Believe me you ought now to take a rest Here You decide then nothing about me my lord On the contrary I have come to a decision Bernouin came into the room Call an officer of justice he said and stay close to me he added in a low tone The officer entered Mazarin wrote a few words which he gave to this man then he bowed Adieu Monsieur de Rochefort he said Rochefort bent low I see my lord I am to be taken back to the Bastile You are sagacious I shall return thither my lord but it is a mistake on your part not to employ me You the friend of my greatest foes Don t suppose that you are the only person who can serve me Monsieur de Rochefort I shall find many men as able as you are I wish you may my lord replied De Rochefort He was then reconducted by the little staircase instead of passing through the ante chamber where D Artagnan was waiting In the courtyard the carriage and the four musketeers were ready but he looked around in vain for his friend Ah he muttered to himself this changes the situation and if there is still a crowd of people in the streets we will try to show Mazarin that we are still thank God good for something else than keeping guard over a prisoner and he jumped into the carriage with the alacrity of a man of five and twenty four Anne of Austria at the Age of Forty six When left alone with Bernouin Mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought He had gained much information but not enough Mazarin was a cheat at the card table This is a detail preserved to us by Brienne He called it using his advantages He now determined not to begin the game with D Artagnan till he knew completely all his adversary s cards My lord have you any commands asked Bernouin Yes yes replied Mazarin Light me I am going to the queen Bernouin took up a candlestick and led the way There was a secret communication between the cardinal s apartments and those of the queen and through this corridor Mazarin passed whenever he wished to visit Anne of Austria This secret passage is still to be seen in the Palais Royal In the bedroom in which this passage ended Bernouin encountered Madame de Beauvais like himself intrusted with the secret of these subterranean love affairs and Madame de Beauvais undertook to prepare Anne of Austria who was in her oratory with the young king Louis XIV to receive the cardinal Anne reclining in a large easy chair her head supported by her hand her elbow resting on a table was looking at her son who was turning over the leaves of a large book filled with pictures This celebrated woman fully understood the art of being dull with dignity It was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room without either reading or praying When Madame de Beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal the child who had been absorbed in the pages of Quintus Curtius enlivened as they were by engravings of Alexander s feats of arms frowned and looked at his mother Why he said does he enter without first asking for an audience Anne colored slightly The prime minister she said is obliged in these unsettled days to inform the queen of all that is happening from time to time without exciting the curiosity or remarks of the court But Richelieu never came in this manner said the pertinacious boy How can you remember what Monsieur de Richelieu did You were too young to know about such things I do not remember what he did but I have inquired and I have been told all about it And who told you about it asked Anne of Austria with a movement of impatience I know that I ought never to name the persons who answer my questions answered the child for if I do I shall learn nothing further At this very moment Mazarin entered The king rose immediately took his book closed it and went to lay it down on the table near which he continued standing in order that Mazarin might be obliged to stand also Mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful glance They explained what had occurred that evening He bowed respectfully to the king who gave him a somewhat cavalier reception but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which from his infancy Louis XIV had entertained toward Mazarin and he endeavored to receive the minister s homage with civility Anne of Austria sought to read in Mazarin s face the occasion of this unexpected visit since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only after every one had retired The minister made a slight sign with his head whereupon the queen said to Madame Beauvais It is time for the king to go to bed call Laporte The queen had several times already told her son that he ought to go to bed and several times Louis had coaxingly insisted on staying where he was but now he made no reply but turned pale and bit his lips with anger In a few minutes Laporte came into the room The child went directly to him without kissing his mother Well Louis said Anne why do you not kiss me I thought you were angry with me madame you sent me away I do not send you away but you have had the small pox and I am afraid that sitting up late may tire you You had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace to day to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to rebellion Sire interposed Laporte in order to turn the subject to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle To any one Laporte the child said and then added in a loud voice to any one except Mancini Now Mancini was a nephew of Mazarin s and was as much hated by Louis as the cardinal himself although placed near his person by the minister And the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the cardinal Good said Mazarin I am glad to see that his majesty has been brought up with a hatred of dissimulation Why do you say that asked the queen almost timidly Why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation Besides his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little affection he has for me That however does not hinder me from being entirely devoted to his service as I am to that of your majesty I ask your pardon for him cardinal said the queen he is a child not yet able to understand his obligations to you The cardinal smiled But continued the queen you have doubtless come for some important purpose What is it then Mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his countenance It is likely he replied that we shall soon be obliged to separate unless you love me well enough to follow me to Italy Why cried the queen

none	none	Because as they say in the opera of Thisbe The whole world conspires to break our bonds You jest sir answered the queen endeavoring to assume something of her former dignity Alas I do not madame rejoined Mazarin Mark well what I say The whole world conspires to break our bonds Now as you are one of the whole world I mean to say that you also are deserting me Cardinal Heavens did I not see you the other day smile on the Duke of Orleans or rather at what he said And what was he saying He said this madame Mazarin is a stumbling block Send him away and all will then be well What do you wish me to do Oh madame you are the queen Queen forsooth when I am at the mercy of every scribbler in the Palais Royal who covers waste paper with nonsense or of every country squire in the kingdom Nevertheless you have still the power of banishing from your presence those whom you do not like That is to say whom you do not like returned the queen I persons whom I do not like Yes indeed Who sent away Madame de Chevreuse after she had been persecuted twelve years under the last reign A woman of intrigue who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had raised against M de Richelieu Who dismissed Madame de Hautefort that friend so loyal that she refused the favor of the king that she might remain in mine A prude who told you every night as she undressed you that it was a sin to love a priest just as if one were a priest because one happens to be a cardinal Who ordered Monsieur de Beaufort to be arrested An incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate me You see cardinal replied the queen that your enemies are mine That is not enough madame it is necessary that your friends should be also mine My friends monsieur The queen shook her head Alas I have them no longer How is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity It is because in my prosperity I forgot those old friends monsieur because I have acted like Queen Marie de Medicis who returning from her first exile treated with contempt all those who had suffered for her and being proscribed a second time died at Cologne abandoned by every one even by her own son Well let us see said Mazarin isn t there still time to repair the evil Search among your friends your oldest friends What do you mean monsieur Nothing else than I say search Alas I look around me in vain I have no influence with any one Monsieur is as usual led by his favorite yesterday it was Choisy to day it is La Riviere to morrow it will be some one else Monsieur le Prince is led by the coadjutor who is led by Madame de Guemenee Therefore madame I ask you to look not among your friends of to day but among those of other times Among my friends of other times said the queen Yes among your friends of other times among those who aided you to contend against the Duc de Richelieu and even to conquer him What is he aiming at murmured the queen looking uneasily at the cardinal Yes continued his eminence under certain circumstances with that strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses aided by your friends you were able to repel the attacks of that adversary I said the queen I suffered that is all Yes said Mazarin as women suffer in avenging themselves Come let us come to the point Do you know Monsieur de Rochefort One of my bitterest enemies the faithful friend of Cardinal Richelieu I know that and we sent him to the Bastile said Mazarin Is he at liberty asked the queen No still there but I only speak of him in order that I may introduce the name of another man Do you know Monsieur d Artagnan he added looking steadfastly at the queen Anne of Austria received the blow with a beating heart Has the Gascon been indiscreet she murmured to herself then said aloud D Artagnan stop an instant the name seems certainly familiar D Artagnan there was a musketeer who was in love with one of my women Poor young creature she was poisoned on my account That s all you know of him asked Mazarin The queen looked at him surprised You seem sir she remarked to be making me undergo a course of cross examination Which you answer according to your fancy replied Mazarin Tell me your wishes and I will comply with them The queen spoke with some impatience Well madame said Mazarin bowing I desire that you give me a share in your friends as I have shared with you the little industry and talent that Heaven has given me The circumstances are grave and it will be necessary to act promptly Still said the queen I thought that we were finally quit of Monsieur de Beaufort Yes you saw only the torrent that threatened to overturn everything and you gave no attention to the still water There is however a proverb current in France relating to water which is quiet Continue said the queen Well then madame not a day passes in which I do not suffer affronts from your princes and your lordly servants all of them automata who do not perceive that I wind up the spring that makes them move nor do they see that beneath my quiet demeanor lies the still scorn of an injured irritated man who has sworn to himself to master them one of these days We have arrested Monsieur de Beaufort but he is the least dangerous among them There is the Prince de Conde The hero of Rocroy Do you think of him Yes madame often and often but pazienza as we say in Italy next after Monsieur de Conde comes the Duke of Orleans What are you saying The first prince of the blood the king s uncle No not the first prince of the blood not the king s uncle but the base conspirator the soul of every cabal who pretends to lead the brave people who are weak enough to believe in the honor of a prince of the blood not the prince nearest to the throne not the king s uncle I repeat but the murderer of Chalais of Montmorency and of Cinq Mars who is playing now the same game he played long ago and who thinks that he will win the game because he has a new adversary instead of a man who threatened a man who smiles But he is mistaken I shall not leave so near the queen that source of discord with which the deceased cardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling point Anne blushed and buried her face in her hands What am I to do she said bowed down beneath the voice of her tyrant Endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the Channel in spite of Monsieur de Richelieu tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to Buckingham Anne arose full of majesty and as if touched by a spring and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful You are insulting me she said I wish continued Mazarin finishing as it were the speech this sudden movement of the queen had cut I wish in fact that you should now do for your husband what you formerly did for your lover Again that accusation cried the queen I thought that calumny was stifled or extinct you have spared me till now but since you speak of it once for all I tell you Madame I do not ask you to tell me said Mazarin astounded by this returning courage I will tell you all replied Anne Listen there were in truth at that epoch four devoted hearts four loyal spirits four faithful swords who saved more than my life my honor Ah you confess it exclaimed Mazarin Is it only the guilty whose honor is at the sport of others sir and cannot women be dishonored by appearances Yes appearances were against me and I was about to suffer dishonor However I swear I was not guilty I swear it by The queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she could swear and taking out of a cupboard hidden in the tapestry a small coffer of rosewood set in silver and laying it on the altar I swear she said by these sacred relics that Buckingham was not my lover What relics are those by which you swear asked Mazarin smiling I am incredulous The queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there and presented it to the cardinal Open sir she said and look for yourself Mazarin opened the coffer a knife covered with rust and two letters one of which was stained with blood alone met his gaze What are these things he asked What are these things replied Anne with queen like dignity extending toward the open coffer an arm despite the lapse of years still beautiful These two letters are the only ones I ever wrote to him This knife is the knife with which Felton stabbed him Read the letters and see if I have lied or spoken the truth But Mazarin notwithstanding this permission instead of reading the letters took the knife which the dying Buckingham had snatched out of the wound and sent by Laporte to the queen The blade was red for the blood had become rust after a momentary examination during which the queen became as white as the cloth which covered the altar on which she was leaning he put it back into the coffer with an involuntary shudder It is well madame I believe your oath No no read exclaimed the queen indignantly read I command you for I am resolved that everything shall be finished to night and never will I recur to this subject again Do you think she said with a ghastly smile that I shall be inclined to reopen this coffer to answer any future accusations Mazarin overcome by this determination read the two letters In one the queen asked for the ornaments back again This letter had been conveyed by D Artagnan and had arrived in time The other was that which Laporte had placed in the hands of the Duke of Buckingham warning him that he was about to be assassinated that communication had arrived too late It is well madame said Mazarin nothing can gainsay such testimony Sir replied the queen closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon it if there is anything to be said it is that I have always been ungrateful to the brave men who saved me that I have given nothing to that gallant officer D Artagnan you were speaking of just now but my hand to kiss and this diamond As she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger It appears she resumed that he sold it he sold it in order to save me another time to be able to send a messenger to the duke to warn him of his danger he sold it to Monsieur des Essarts on whose finger I remarked it I bought it from him but it belongs to D Artagnan Give it back to him sir and since you have such a man in your service make him useful Thank you madame said Mazarin I will profit by the advice And now added the queen her voice broken by her emotion have you any other question to ask me Nothing the cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory manner except to beg of you to forgive my unworthy suspicions I love you so tenderly that I cannot help being jealous even of the past A smile which was indefinable passed over the lips of the queen Since you have no further interrogations to make leave me I beseech you she said I wish after such a scene to be alone Mazarin bent low before her I will retire madame Do you permit me to return Yes to morrow The cardinal took the queen s hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his lips Scarcely had he left her when the queen went into her son s room and inquired from Laporte if the king was in bed Laporte pointed to the child who was asleep Anne ascended the steps side of the bed and softly kissed the placid forehead of her son then she retired as silently as she had come merely saying to Laporte Try my dear Laporte to make the king more courteous to Monsieur le Cardinal to whom both he and I are under such important obligations five The Gascon and the Italian Meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room and after asking Bernouin who stood at the door whether anything had occurred during his absence and being answered in the negative he desired that he might be left alone When he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the ante chamber There D Artagnan was asleep upon a bench The cardinal went up to him and touched his shoulder D Artagnan started awakened himself and as he awoke stood up exactly like a soldier under arms Here I am said he Who calls me I said Mazarin with his most smiling expression I ask pardon of your eminence said D Artagnan but I was so fatigued Don t ask my pardon monsieur said Mazarin for you fatigued yourself in my service D Artagnan admired Mazarin s gracious manner Ah said he between his teeth is there truth in the proverb that fortune comes while one sleeps Follow me monsieur said Mazarin Come come murmured D Artagnan Rochefort has kept his promise but where in the devil is he And he searched the cabinet even to the smallest recesses but there was no sign of Rochefort Monsieur d Artagnan said the cardinal sitting down on a fauteuil you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable man Possibly thought D Artagnan but he has taken a long time to let me know his thoughts nevertheless he bowed to the very ground in gratitude for Mazarin s compliment Well continued Mazarin the time has come to put to use your talents and your valor There was a sudden gleam of joy in the officer s eyes which vanished immediately for he knew nothing of Mazarin s purpose Order my lord he said I am ready to obey your eminence Monsieur d Artagnan continued the cardinal you performed sundry superb exploits in the last reign Your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my favor It is true I fought with tolerable success I don t speak of your warlike exploits monsieur said Mazarin although they gained you much reputation they were surpassed by others D Artagnan pretended astonishment Well you do not reply resumed Mazarin I am waiting my lord till you tell me of what exploits you speak I speak of the adventure Eh you know well what I mean Alas no my lord replied D Artagnan surprised You are discreet so much the better I speak of that adventure in behalf of the queen of the ornaments of the journey you made with three of your friends Aha thought the Gascon is this a snare or not Let me be on my guard And he assumed a look of stupidity which Mendori or Bellerose two of the first actors of the day might have envied Bravo cried Mazarin they told me that you were the man I wanted Come let us see what you will do for me Everything that your eminence may please to command me was the reply You will do for me what you have done for the queen Certainly D Artagnan said to himself he wishes to make me speak out He s not more cunning than De Richelieu was Devil take him Then he said aloud The queen my lord I don t comprehend You don t comprehend that I want you and your three friends to be of use to me Which of my friends my lord Your three friends the friends of former days Of former days my lord In former days I had not only three friends I had thirty at two and twenty one calls every man one s friend Well sir returned Mazarin prudence is a fine thing but to day you might regret having been too prudent My lord Pythagoras made his disciples keep silence for five years that they might learn to hold their tongues But you have been silent for twenty years sir Speak now the queen herself releases you from your promise The queen said D Artagnan with an astonishment which this time was not pretended Yes the queen And as a proof of what I say she commanded me to show you this diamond which she thinks you know And so saying Mazarin extended his hand to the officer who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the Hotel de Ville and which she had repurchased from Monsieur des Essarts Tis true I remember well that diamond which belonged to the queen You see then that I speak to you in the queen s name Answer me without acting as if you were on the stage your interests are concerned in your so doing Faith my lord it is very necessary for me to make my fortune your eminence has so long forgotten me We need only a week to amend all that Come you are accounted for you are here but where are your friends I do not know my lord We have parted company this long time all three have left the service Where can you find them then Wherever they are that s my business Well now what are your conditions if I employ you Money my lord as much money as what you wish me to undertake will require I remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of money and but for that diamond which I was obliged to sell we should have remained on the road The devil he does Money and a large sum said Mazarin Pray are you aware that the king has no money in his treasury Do then as I did my lord Sell the crown diamonds Trust me don t let us try to do things cheaply Great undertakings come poorly off with paltry means Well returned Mazarin we will satisfy you Richelieu thought D Artagnan would have given me five hundred pistoles in advance You will then be at my service asked Mazarin Yes if my friends agree But if they refuse can I count on you I have never accomplished anything alone said D Artagnan shaking his head Go then and find them What shall I say to them by way of inducement to serve your eminence You know them better than I Adapt your promises to their respective characters What shall I promise That if they serve me as well as they served the queen my gratitude shall be magnificent But what are we to do Make your mind easy when the time for action comes you shall be put in full possession of what I require from you wait till that time arrives and find out your friends My lord perhaps they are not in Paris It is even probable that I shall have to make a journey I am only a lieutenant of musketeers very poor and journeys cost money My intention said Mazarin is not that you go with a great following my plans require secrecy and would be jeopardized by a too extravagant equipment Still my lord I can t travel on my pay for it is now three months behind and I can t travel on my savings for in my twenty two years of service I have accumulated nothing but debts Mazarin remained some moments in deep thought as if he were fighting with himself then going to a large cupboard closed with a triple lock he took from it a bag of silver and weighing it twice in his hands before he gave it to D Artagnan Take this he said with a sigh tis merely for your journey If these are Spanish doubloons or even gold crowns thought D Artagnan we shall yet be able to do business together He saluted the cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense pocket Well then all is settled you are to set off said the cardinal Yes my lord Apropos what are the names of your friends The Count de la Fere formerly styled Athos Monsieur du Vallon whom we used to call Porthos the Chevalier d Herblay now the Abbe d Herblay whom we styled Aramis The cardinal smiled Younger sons he said who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned names in order not to lower their family names Long swords but light purses Was that it If God willing these swords should be devoted to the service of your eminence said D Artagnan I shall venture to express a wish which is that in its turn the purse of your eminence may become light and theirs heavy for with these three men your eminence may rouse all Europe if you like These Gascons said the cardinal laughing almost beat the Italians in effrontery At all events answered D Artagnan with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinal s they beat them when they draw their swords He then withdrew and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of money Crown pieces only silver pieces I suspected it Ah Mazarin Mazarin thou hast no confidence in me so much the worse for thee for harm may come of it Meanwhile the cardinal was rubbing his hands in great satisfaction A hundred pistoles a hundred pistoles for a hundred pistoles I have discovered a secret for which Richelieu would have paid twenty thousand crowns without reckoning the value of that diamond he cast a complacent look at the ring which he had kept instead of restoring to D Artagnan which is worth at least ten thousand francs He returned to his room and after depositing the ring in a casket filled with brilliants of every sort for the cardinal was a connoisseur in precious stones he called to Bernouin to undress him regardless of the noises of gun fire that though it was now near midnight continued to resound through Paris In the meantime D Artagnan took his way toward the Rue Tiquetonne where he lived at the Hotel de la Chevrette We will explain in a few words how D Artagnan had been led to choose that place of residence six D Artagnan in his Fortieth Year Years have elapsed many events have happened alas since in our romance of The Three Musketeers we took leave of D Artagnan at No twelve Rue des Fossoyeurs D Artagnan had not failed in his career but circumstances had been adverse to him So long as he was surrounded by his friends he retained his youth and the poetry of his character He was one of those fine ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves easily to the dispositions of others Athos imparted to him his greatness of soul Porthos his enthusiasm Aramis his elegance Had D Artagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have become a superior character Athos was the first to leave him in order that he might retire to a little property he had inherited near Blois Porthos the second to marry an attorney s wife and lastly Aramis the third to take orders and become an abbe From that day D Artagnan felt lonely and powerless without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from Heaven Notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers D Artagnan felt completely solitary For a time the delightful remembrance of Madame Bonancieux left on his character a certain poetic tinge perishable indeed for like all other recollections in this world these impressions were by degrees effaced A garrison life is fatal even to the most aristocratic organization and imperceptibly D Artagnan always in the camp always on horseback always in garrison became I know not how in the present age one would express it a typical trooper His early refinement of character was not only not lost it grew even greater than ever but it was now applied to the little instead of to the great things of life to the martial condition of the soldier comprised under the head of a good lodging a rich table a congenial hostess These important advantages D Artagnan found to his own taste in the Rue Tiquetonne at the sign of the Roe From the time D Artagnan took quarters in that hotel the mistress of the house a pretty and fresh looking Flemish woman twenty five or twenty six years old had been singularly interested in him and after certain love passages much obstructed by an inconvenient husband to whom a dozen times D Artagnan had made a pretence of passing a sword through his body that husband had disappeared one fine morning after furtively selling certain choice lots of wine carrying away with him money and jewels He was thought to be dead his wife especially who cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow stoutly maintained that death had taken him Therefore after the connection had continued three years carefully fostered by D Artagnan who found his bed and his mistress more agreeable every year each doing credit to the other the mistress conceived the extraordinary desire of becoming a wife and proposed to D Artagnan that he should marry her Ah fie D Artagnan replied Bigamy my dear Come now you don t really wish it But he is dead I am sure of it He was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us hanged All right if he comes back you will kill him you are so skillful and so brave Peste my darling another way of getting hanged So you refuse my request To be sure I do furiously The pretty landlady was desolate She would have taken D Artagnan not only as her husband but as her God he was so handsome and had so fierce a mustache Then along toward the fourth year came the expedition of Franche Comte D Artagnan was assigned to it and made his preparations to depart There were then great griefs tears without end and solemn promises to remain faithful all of course on the part of the hostess D Artagnan was too grand to promise anything he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his name As to that we know D Artagnan s courage he exposed himself freely to danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of battle He had been seen falling from his horse and had not been seen to rise every one therefore believed him to be dead especially those to whom his death would give promotion One believes readily what he wishes to believe Now in the army from the division generals who desire the death of the general in chief to the soldiers who desire the death of the corporals all desire some one s death But D Artagnan was not a man to let himself be killed like that After he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battle field the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself He gained a village knocked at the door of the finest house and was received as the wounded are always and everywhere received in France He was petted tended cured and one fine morning in better health than ever before he set out for France Once in France he turned his course toward Paris and reaching Paris went straight to Rue Tiquetonne But D Artagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man complete except for the sword arranged along the wall He has returned said he So much the worse and so much the better It need not be said that D Artagnan was still thinking of the husband He made inquiries and discovered that the servants were new and that the mistress had gone for a walk Alone asked D Artagnan With monsieur Monsieur has returned then Of course naively replied the servant If I had any money said D Artagnan to himself I would go away but I have none I must stay and follow the advice of my hostess while thwarting the conjugal designs of this inopportune apparition He had just completed this monologue which proves that in momentous circumstances nothing is more natural than the monologue when the servant maid watching at the door suddenly cried out Ah see here is madame returning with monsieur D Artagnan looked out and at the corner of Rue Montmartre saw the hostess coming along hanging to the arm of an enormous Swiss who tiptoed in his walk with a magnificent air which pleasantly reminded him of his old friend Porthos Is that monsieur said D Artagnan to himself Oh oh he has grown a good deal it seems to me And he sat down in the hall choosing a conspicuous place The hostess as she entered saw D Artagnan and uttered a little cry whereupon D Artagnan judging that he had been recognized rose ran to her and embraced her tenderly The Swiss with an air of stupefaction looked at the hostess who turned pale Ah it is you monsieur What do you want of me she asked in great distress Is monsieur your cousin Is monsieur your brother said D Artagnan not in the slightest degree embarrassed in the role he was playing And without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the Helvetian who received him with great coldness Who is that man he asked The hostess replied only by gasps Who is that Swiss asked D Artagnan Monsieur is going to marry me replied the hostess between two gasps Your husband then is at last dead How does that concern you replied the Swiss It concerns me much said D Artagnan since you cannot marry madame without my consent and since And since asked the Swiss And since I do not give it said the musketeer The Swiss became as purple as a peony He wore his elegant uniform D Artagnan was wrapped in a sort of gray cloak the Swiss was six feet high D Artagnan was hardly more than five the Swiss considered himself on his own ground and regarded D Artagnan as an intruder Will you go away from here demanded the Swiss stamping violently like a man who begins to be seriously angry I By no means said D Artagnan Some one must go for help said a lad who could not comprehend that this little man should make a stand against that other man who was so large D Artagnan with a sudden accession of wrath seized the lad by the ear and led him apart with the injunction Stay you where you are and don t you stir or I will pull this ear off As for you illustrious descendant of William Tell you will straightway get together your clothes which are in my room and which annoy me and go out quickly to another lodging The Swiss began to laugh boisterously I go out he said And why Ah very well said D Artagnan I see that you understand French Come then and take a turn with me and I will explain The hostess who knew D Artagnan s skill with the sword began to weep and tear her hair D Artagnan turned toward her saying Then send him away madame Pooh said the Swiss who had needed a little time to take in D Artagnan s proposal pooh who are you in the first place to ask me to take a turn with you I am lieutenant in his majesty s musketeers said D Artagnan and consequently your superior in everything only as the question now is not of rank but of quarters you know the custom come and seek for yours the first to return will recover his chamber D Artagnan led away the Swiss in spite of lamentations on the part of the hostess who in reality found her heart inclining toward her former lover though she would not have been sorry to give a lesson to that haughty musketeer who had affronted her by the refusal of her hand It was night when the two adversaries reached the field of battle D Artagnan politely begged the Swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber the Swiss refused by shaking his head and drew his sword Then you will lie here said D Artagnan It is a wretched bed but that is not my fault and it is you who have chosen it With these words he drew in his turn and crossed swords with his adversary He had to contend against a strong wrist but his agility was superior to all force The Swiss received two wounds and was not aware of it by reason of the cold but suddenly feebleness occasioned by loss of blood obliged him to sit down There said D Artagnan what did I tell you Fortunately you won t be laid up more than a fortnight Remain here and I will send you your clothes by the boy Good by Oh by the way you d better take lodging in the Rue Montorgueil at the Chat Qui Pelote You will be well fed there if the hostess remains the same Adieu Thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the Swiss the things that belonged to him The boy found him sitting where D Artagnan had left him still overwhelmed by the coolness of his adversary The boy the hostess and all the house had the same regard for D Artagnan that one would have for Hercules should he return to earth to repeat his twelve labors But when he was alone with the hostess he said Now pretty Madeleine you know the difference between a Swiss and a gentleman As for you you have acted like a barmaid So much the worse for you for by such conduct you have lost my esteem and my patronage I have driven away the Swiss to humiliate you but I shall lodge here no longer I will not sleep where I must scorn Ho there boy Have my valise carried to the Muid d Amour Rue des Bourdonnais Adieu madame In saying these words D Artagnan appeared at the same time majestic and grieved The hostess threw herself at his feet asked his pardon and held him back with a sweet violence What more need be said The spit turned the stove roared the pretty Madeleine wept D Artagnan felt himself invaded by hunger cold and love He pardoned and having pardoned he remained And this explains how D Artagnan had quarters in the Rue Tiquetonne at the Hotel de la Chevrette D Artagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying Mazarin s bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the minister s finger that night Should that diamond ever fall into my hands again he reflected I would turn it at once into money I would buy with the proceeds certain lands around my father s chateau which is a pretty place well enough but with no land to it at all except a garden about the size of the Cemetery des Innocents and I should wait in all my glory till some rich heiress attracted by my good looks rode along to marry me Then I should like to have three sons I should make the first a nobleman like Athos the second a good soldier like Porthos the third an excellent abbe like Aramis Faith that would be a far better life than I lead now but Monsieur Mazarin is a mean wretch who won t dispossess himself of his diamond in my favor On entering the Rue Tiquetonne he heard a tremendous noise and found a dense crowd near the house Oho said he is the hotel on fire On approaching the hotel of the Roe he found however that it was in front of the next house the mob was collected The people were shouting and running about with torches By the light of one of these torches D Artagnan perceived men in uniform He asked what was going on He was told that twenty citizens headed by one man had attacked a carriage which was escorted by a troop of the cardinal s bodyguard but a reinforcement having come up the assailants had been put to flight and the leader had taken refuge in the hotel next to his lodgings the house was now being searched In his youth D Artagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military but he was cured of all those hot headed propensities besides he had the cardinal s hundred pistoles in his pocket so he went into the hotel without a word There he found Madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening but he cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him with it a bottle of good Burgundy He took his key and candle and went upstairs to his bedroom He had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof His first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to table Not to reflect on what had passed as one might fancy No D Artagnan considered that things are never well done when they are not reserved to their proper time He was hungry he supped he went to bed Neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings counsel with it In the night he slept but in the morning refreshed and calm he was inspired with his clearest views of everything It was long since he had any reason for his morning s inspiration but he always slept all night long At daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his room In forty three he said just before the death of the late cardinal I received a letter from Athos Where was I then Let me see Oh at the siege of Besancon I was in the trenches He told me let me think what was it That he was living on a small estate but where I was just reading the name of the place when the wind blew my letter away I suppose to the Spaniards there s no use in thinking any more about Athos Let me see with regard to Porthos I received a letter from him too He invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of September sixteen forty six Unluckily as I was then in Bearn on account of my father s death the letter followed me there I had left Bearn when it arrived and I never received it until the month of April sixteen forty seven and as the invitation was for September sixteen forty six I couldn t accept it Let me look for this letter it must be with my title deeds D Artagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room and which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of two hundred years lost to his family He uttered an exclamation of delight for the large handwriting of Porthos was discernible and underneath some lines traced by his worthy spouse D Artagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter it was dated from the Chateau du Vallon Porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary in his pride he fancied that every one must know the Chateau du Vallon Devil take the vain fellow said D Artagnan However I had better find him out first since he can t want money Athos must have become an idiot by this time from drinking Aramis must have worn himself to a shadow of his former self by constant genuflexion He cast his eyes again on the letter There was a postscript I write by the same courier to our worthy friend Aramis in his convent In his convent What convent There are about two hundred in Paris and three thousand in France and then perhaps on entering the convent he changed his name Ah if I were but learned in theology I should recollect what it was he used to dispute about with the curate of Montdidier and the superior of the Jesuits when we were at Crevecoeur I should know what doctrine he leans to and I should glean from that what saint he has adopted as his patron Well suppose I go back to the cardinal and ask him for a passport into all the convents one can find even into the nunneries It would be a curious idea and maybe I should find my friend under the name of Achilles But no I should lose myself in the cardinal s opinion Great people only thank you for doing the impossible what s possible they say they can effect themselves and they are right But let us wait a little and reflect I received a letter from him the dear fellow in which he even asked me for some small service which in fact I rendered him Yes yes but now what did I do with that letter D Artagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old clothes He looked for his doublet of the year sixteen forty eight and as he had orderly habits he found it hanging on its nail He felt in the pocket and drew from it a paper it was the letter of Aramis Monsieur D Artagnan You know that I have had a quarrel with a certain gentleman who has given me an appointment for this evening in the Place Royale As I am of the church and the affair might injure me if I should share it with any other than a sure friend like you I write to beg that you will serve me as second You will enter by the Rue Neuve Sainte Catherine under the second lamp on the right you will find your adversary I shall be with mine under the third Wholly yours Aramis D Artagnan tried to recall his remembrances He had gone to the rendezvous had encountered there the adversary indicated whose name he had never known had given him a pretty sword stroke on the arm then had gone toward Aramis who at the same time came to meet him having already finished his affair It is over Aramis had said I think I have killed the insolent fellow But dear friend if you ever need me you know that I am entirely devoted to you Thereupon Aramis had given him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arcades So then he no more knew where Aramis was than where Athos and Porthos were and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window He thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was sleeping He was not mistaken as he entered his bedroom a man was getting in by the window Ah you scoundrel cried D Artagnan taking the man for a thief and seizing his sword Sir cried the man in the name of Heaven put your sword back into the sheath and don t kill me unheard I m no thief but an honest citizen well off in the world with a house of my own My name is ah but surely you are Monsieur d Artagnan And thou Planchet cried the lieutenant At your service sir said Planchet overwhelmed with joy if I were still capable of serving you Perhaps so replied D Artagnan But why the devil dost thou run about the tops of houses at seven o clock of the morning in the month of January Sir said Planchet you must know but perhaps you ought not to know Tell us what returned D Artagnan but first put a napkin against the window and draw the curtains Sir said the prudent Planchet in the first place are you on good terms with Monsieur de Rochefort Perfectly one of my dearest friends Ah so much the better But what has De Rochefort to do with this manner you have of invading my room Ah sir I must first tell you that Monsieur de Rochefort is Planchet hesitated Egad I know where he is said D Artagnan He s in the Bastile That is to say he was there replied Planchet But in returning thither last night when fortunately you did not accompany him as his carriage was crossing the Rue de la Ferronnerie his guards insulted the people who began to abuse them The prisoner thought this a good opportunity for escape he called out his name and cried for help I was there I heard the name of Rochefort I remembered him well I said in a loud voice that he was a prisoner a friend of the Duc de Beaufort who called for help The people were infuriated they stopped the horses and cut the escort to pieces whilst I opened the doors of the carriage and Monsieur de Rochefort jumped out and soon was lost amongst the crowd At this moment a patrol passed by I was obliged to sound a retreat toward the Rue Tiquetonne I was pursued and took refuge in the house next to this where I have been concealed between two mattresses This morning I ventured to run along the gutters and Well interrupted D Artagnan I am delighted that De Rochefort is free but as for thee if thou shouldst fall into the hands of the king s servants they will hang thee without mercy Nevertheless I promise thee thou shalt be hidden here though I risk by concealing thee neither more nor less than my lieutenancy if it was found out that I gave one rebel an asylum Ah sir you know well I would risk my life for you Thou mayst add that thou hast risked it Planchet I have not forgotten all I owe thee Sit down there and eat in security I see thee cast expressive glances at the remains of my supper
274_121392_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes sir 
none	none	for all I ve had since yesterday was a slice of bread and butter with preserves on it Although I don t despise sweet things in proper time and place I found the supper rather light Poor fellow said D Artagnan Well come set to Ah sir you are going to save my life a second time cried Planchet And he seated himself at the table and ate as he did in the merry days of the Rue des Fossoyeurs whilst D Artagnan walked to and fro and thought how he could make use of Planchet under present circumstances While he turned this over in his mind Planchet did his best to make up for lost time at table At last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and paused as if he had partially appeased his hunger Come said D Artagnan who thought that it was now a convenient time to begin his interrogations dost thou know where Athos is No sir replied Planchet The devil thou dost not Dost know where Porthos is No not at all And Aramis Not in the least The devil the devil the devil But sir said Planchet with a look of shrewdness I know where Bazin is Where is he At Notre Dame What has he to do at Notre Dame He is beadle Bazin beadle at Notre Dame He must know where his master is Without a doubt he must D Artagnan thought for a moment then took his sword and put on his cloak to go out Sir said Planchet in a mournful tone do you abandon me thus to my fate Think if I am found out here the people of the house who have not seen me enter it will take me for a thief True said D Artagnan Let s see Canst thou speak any patois I can do something better than that sir I can speak Flemish Where the devil didst thou learn it In Artois where I fought for years Listen sir Goeden morgen mynheer eth teen begeeray le weeten the ge sond heets omstand Which means Good day sir I am anxious to know the state of your health He calls that a language But never mind that will do capitally D Artagnan opened the door and called out to a waiter to desire Madeleine to come upstairs When the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing Planchet My dear landlady said D Artagnan I beg to introduce to you your brother who is arrived from Flanders and whom I am going to take into my service My brother Wish your sister good morning Master Peter Wilkom suster said Planchet Goeden day broder replied the astonished landlady This is the case said D Artagnan this is your brother Madeleine you don t know him perhaps but I know him he has arrived from Amsterdam You must dress him up during my absence When I return which will be in about an hour you must offer him to me as a servant and upon your recommendation though he doesn t speak a word of French I take him into my service You understand That is to say I guess your wishes and that is all that s necessary said Madeleine You are a precious creature my pretty hostess and I am much obliged to you The next moment D Artagnan was on his way to Notre Dame seven Touches upon the Strange Effects a Half pistole may have D Artagnan as he crossed the Pont Neuf congratulated himself on having found Planchet again for at that time an intelligent servant was essential to him nor was he sorry that through Planchet and the situation which he held in Rue des Lombards a connection with the bourgeoisie might be commenced at that critical period when that class were preparing to make war with the court party It was like having a spy in the enemy s camp In this frame of mind grateful for the accidental meeting with Planchet pleased with himself D Artagnan reached Notre Dame He ran up the steps entered the church and addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel asked him if he knew Monsieur Bazin Monsieur Bazin the beadle said the verger Yes There he is attending mass in the chapel of the Virgin D Artagnan nearly jumped for joy he had despaired of finding Bazin but now he thought since he held one end of the thread he would be pretty sure to reach the other end He knelt down just opposite the chapel in order not to lose sight of his man and as he had almost forgotten his prayers and had omitted to take a book with him he made use of his time in gazing at Bazin Bazin wore his dress it may be observed with equal dignity and saintly propriety It was not difficult to understand that he had gained the crown of his ambition and that the silver mounted wand he brandished was in his eyes as honorable a distinction as the marshal s baton which Conde threw or did not throw into the enemy s line of battle at Fribourg His person had undergone a change analogous to the change in his dress his figure had grown rotund and as it were canonical The striking points of his face were effaced he had still a nose but his cheeks fattened out each took a portion of it unto themselves his chin had joined his throat his eyes were swelled up with the puffiness of his cheeks his hair cut straight in holy guise covered his forehead as far as his eyebrows The officiating priest was just finishing mass whilst D Artagnan was looking at Bazin he pronounced the words of the holy Sacrament and retired giving the benediction which was received by the kneeling communicants to the astonishment of D Artagnan who recognized in the priest the coadjutor himself the famous Jean Francois Gondy who at that time having a presentiment of the part he was to play was beginning to court popularity by almsgiving It was to this end that he performed from time to time some of those early masses which the common people generally alone attended A sacerdotal officer D Artagnan knelt as well as the rest received his share of the benediction and made the sign of the cross but when Bazin passed in his turn with his eyes raised to Heaven and walking in all humility the very last D Artagnan pulled him by the hem of his robe Bazin looked down and started as if he had seen a serpent Monsieur d Artagnan he cried Vade retro Satanas So my dear Bazin said the officer laughing this is the way you receive an old friend Sir replied Bazin the true friends of a Christian are those who aid him in working out his salvation not those who hinder him in doing so I don t understand you Bazin nor can I see how I can be a stumbling block in the way of your salvation said D Artagnan You forget sir that you very nearly ruined forever that of my master and that it was owing to you that he was very nearly being damned eternally for remaining a musketeer whilst all the time his true vocation was the church My dear Bazin you ought to perceive said D Artagnan from the place in which you find me that I am greatly changed in everything Age produces good sense and as I doubt not but that your master is on the road to salvation I want you to tell me where he is that he may help me to mine Rather say to take him back with you into the world Fortunately I don t know where he is How cried D Artagnan you don t know where Aramis is Formerly replied Bazin Aramis was his name of perdition By Aramis is meant Simara which is the name of a demon Happily for him he has ceased to bear that name And therefore said D Artagnan resolved to be patient
2010_121416_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 to the end 
none	none	it is not Aramis I seek but the Abbe d Herblay Come my dear Bazin tell me where he is Didn t you hear me tell you Monsieur d Artagnan that I don t know where he is
2010_121416_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes certainly 
none	none	but to that I answer that it is impossible It is nevertheless the truth monsieur the pure truth the truth of the good God D Artagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of Aramis but whose lies were bold and decided Well Bazin said D Artagnan since you do not know where your master lives let us speak of it no more let us part good friends Accept this half pistole to drink to my health I do not drink Bazin pushed away with dignity the officer s hand tis good only for the laity Incorruptible murmured D Artagnan I am unlucky and whilst he was lost in thought Bazin retreated toward the sacristy and even there he could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door behind him D Artagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the shoulder He turned and was about to utter an exclamation of surprise when the other made to him a sign of silence You here Rochefort he said in a low voice Hush returned Rochefort Did you know that I am at liberty I knew it from the fountain head from Planchet And what brought you here I came to thank God for my happy deliverance said Rochefort And nothing more I suppose that is not all To take my orders from the coadjutor and to see if we cannot wake up Mazarin a little A bad plan you ll be shut up again in the Bastile Oh as to that I shall take care I assure you The air the fresh free air is so good besides and Rochefort drew a deep breath as he spoke I am going into the country to make a tour Stop cried D Artagnan I too am going And if I may without impertinence ask where are you going To seek my friends What friends Those that you asked about yesterday Athos Porthos and Aramis you are looking for them Yes On honor What then is there surprising in that Nothing Queer though And in whose behalf are you looking for them You are in no doubt on that score That is true Unfortunately I have no idea where they are And you have no way to get news of them Wait a week and I myself will give you some A week is too long I must find them within three days Three days are a short time and France is large No matter you know the word must with that word great things are done And when do you set out I am now on my road Good luck to you And to you a good journey Perhaps we shall meet on our road That is not probable Who knows Chance is so capricious Adieu till we meet again Apropos should Mazarin speak to you about me tell him that I should have requested you to acquaint him that in a short time he will see whether I am as he says too old for action And Rochefort went away with one of those diabolical smiles which used formerly to make D Artagnan shudder but D Artagnan could now see it without alarm and smiling in his turn with an expression of melancholy which the recollections called up by that smile could perhaps alone give to his countenance he said Go demon do what thou wilt It matters little now to me There s no second Constance in the world On his return to the cathedral D Artagnan saw Bazin who was conversing with the sacristan Bazin was making with his spare little short arms ridiculous gestures D Artagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence with respect to himself D Artagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the Rue des Canettes it was impossible that Bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing him In five minutes Bazin made his appearance looking in every direction to see if he were observed but he saw no one Calmed by appearances he ventured to walk on through the Rue Notre Dame Then D Artagnan rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see Bazin turn down the Rue de la Juiverie and enter in the Rue de la Calandre a respectable looking house and this D Artagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of the worthy beadle Afraid of making any inquiries at this house D Artagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocras This beverage required a good half hour to prepare And D Artagnan had time therefore to watch Bazin unsuspected He perceived in the tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the guise of a chorister He questioned him and as the boy had no interest in deceiving D Artagnan learned that he exercised from six o clock in the morning until nine the office of chorister and from nine o clock till midnight that of a waiter in the tavern Whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of Bazin s house It was saddled and bridled Almost immediately Bazin came downstairs Look said the boy there s our beadle who is going a journey And where is he going asked D Artagnan Forsooth I don t know Half a pistole if you can find out said D Artagnan For me cried the boy his eyes sparkling with joy if I can find out where Bazin is going That is not difficult You are not joking are you No on the honor of an officer there is the half pistole and he showed him the seductive coin but did not give it him I shall ask him Just the very way not to know Wait till he is set out and then marry come up ask and find out The half pistole is ready and he put it back again into his pocket I understand said the child with that jeering smile which marks especially the gamin de Paris Well we must wait They had not long to wait Five minutes afterward Bazin set off on a full trot urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie which he was in the habit of using instead of a riding whip Scarcely had he turned the corner of the Rue de la Juiverie when the boy rushed after him like a bloodhound on full scent Before ten minutes had elapsed the child returned Well said D Artagnan Well answered the boy the thing is done Where is he gone The half pistole is for me Doubtless answer me I want to see it Give it me that I may see it is not false There it is The child put the piece of money into his pocket And now where is he gone inquired D Artagnan He is gone to Noisy How dost thou know Ah faith there was no great cunning necessary I knew the horse he rode it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then to M Bazin Now I thought that the butcher would not let his horse out like that without knowing where it was going And he answered that Monsieur Bazin went to Noisy Tis his custom He goes two or three times a week Dost thou know Noisy well I think so truly my nurse lives there Is there a convent at Noisy Isn t there a great and grand one the convent of Jesuits What is thy name Friquet D Artagnan wrote the child s name in his tablets Please sir said the boy do you think I can gain any more half pistoles in any way Perhaps replied D Artagnan And having got out all he wanted he paid for the hypocras which he did not drink and went quickly back to the Rue Tiquetonne eight D Artagnan Going to a Distance to discover Aramis On entering the hotel D Artagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the fire It was Planchet but so completely transformed thanks to the old clothes that the departing husband had left behind that D Artagnan himself could hardly recognize him Madeleine introduced him in presence of all the servants Planchet addressed the officer with a fine Flemish phrase the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at all and the bargain was concluded Madeleine s brother entered D Artagnan s service The plan adopted by D Artagnan was soon perfected He resolved not to reach Noisy in the day for fear of being recognized he had therefore plenty of time before him for Noisy is only three or four leagues from Paris on the road to Meaux He began his day by breakfasting substantially a bad beginning when one wants to employ the head but an excellent precaution when one wants to work the body and about two o clock he had his two horses saddled and followed by Planchet he quitted Paris by the Barriere de la Villete A most active search was still prosecuted in the house near the Hotel de la Chevrette for the discovery of Planchet At about a league and a half from the city D Artagnan finding that in his impatience he had set out too soon stopped to give the horses breathing time The inn was full of disreputable looking people who seemed as if they were on the point of commencing some nightly expedition A man wrapped in a cloak appeared at the door but seeing a stranger he beckoned to his companions and two men who were drinking in the inn went out to speak to him D Artagnan on his side went up to the landlady praised her wine which was a horrible production from the country of Montreuil and heard from her that there were only two houses of importance in the village one of these belonged to the Archbishop of Paris and was at that time the abode of his niece the Duchess of Longueville the other was a convent of Jesuits and was the property a by no means unusual circumstance of these worthy fathers At four o clock D Artagnan recommenced his journey He proceeded slowly and in deep reverie Planchet also was lost in thought but the subject of their reflections was not the same One word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn to D Artagnan s deliberations this was the name of Madame de Longueville That name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce thought Madame de Longueville was one of the highest ladies in the realm she was also one of the greatest beauties at court She had formerly been suspected of an intimacy of too tender a nature with Coligny who for her sake had been killed in a duel in the Place Royale by the Duc de Guise She was now connected by bonds of a political nature with the Prince de Marsillac the eldest son of the old Duc de Rochefoucauld whom she was trying to inspire with an enmity toward the Duc de Conde her brother in law whom she now hated mortally D Artagnan thought of all these matters He remembered how at the Louvre he had often seen as she passed by him in the full radiance of her dazzling charms the beautiful Madame de Longueville He thought of Aramis who without possessing any greater advantages than himself had formerly been the lover of Madame de Chevreuse who had been to a former court what Madame de Longueville was in that day and he wondered how it was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish some in ambition others in love whilst others either from chance or from ill luck or from some natural defect or impediment remain half way upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and expectations He was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class when Planchet approached and said I will lay a wager your honor that you and I are thinking of the same thing I doubt it Planchet replied D Artagnan but what are you thinking of I am thinking sir of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn where we rested Always cautious Planchet Tis instinct your honor Well what does your instinct tell you now Sir my instinct told me that those people were assembled there for some bad purpose and I was reflecting on what my instinct had told me in the darkest corner of the stable when a man wrapped in a cloak and followed by two other men came in Ah ah said D Artagnan Planchet s recital agreeing with his own observations Well One of these two men said He must certainly be at Noisy or be coming there this evening for I have seen his servant Art thou sure said the man in the cloak Yes my prince My prince interrupted D Artagnan Yes my prince but listen If he is here this is what the other man said let s see decidedly what to do with him What to do with him answered the prince Yes he s not a man to allow himself to be taken anyhow he ll defend himself Well we must try to take him alive Have you cords to bind him with and a gag to stop his mouth We have Remember that he will most likely be disguised as a horseman Yes yes my lord don t be uneasy Besides I shall be there You will assure us that justice Yes yes I answer for all that the prince said Well then we ll do our best Having said that they went out of the stable Well what matters all that to us said D Artagnan This is one of those attempts that happen every day Are you sure that we are not its objects We Why Just remember what they said I have seen his servant said one and that applies very well to me Well He must certainly be at Noisy or be coming there this evening said the other and that applies very well to you What else Then the prince said Take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier which seems to me to leave no room for doubt since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers Now then what do you say to that Alas my dear Planchet said D Artagnan sighing we are unfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to assassinate me Those were good old days never fear these people owe us no grudge Is your honor sure I can answer for it they do not Well we won t speak of it any more then and Planchet took his place in D Artagnan s suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in his master which even fifteen years of separation had not destroyed They had traveled onward about half a mile when Planchet came close up to D Artagnan Stop sir look yonder he whispered don t you see in the darkness something pass by like shadows I fancy I hear horses feet Impossible returned D Artagnan The ground is soaking wet yet I fancy as thou sayest that I see something At this moment the neighing of a horse struck his ear coming through darkness and space There are men somewhere about but that s of no consequence to us said D Artagnan let us ride onward At about half past eight o clock they reached the first houses in Noisy every one was in bed and not a light was to be seen in the village The obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of houses Here and there a dog barked behind a door or an affrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to take refuge behind a pile of faggots from which retreat her eyes would shine like peridores These were the only living creatures that seemed to inhabit the village Toward the middle of the town commanding the principal open space rose a dark mass separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and overshadowed in the front by enormous lime trees D Artagnan looked attentively at the building This he said to Planchet must be the archbishop s chateau the abode of the fair Madame de Longueville but the convent where is that The convent your honor is at the other end of the village I know it well Well then Planchet gallop up to it whilst I tighten my horse s girth and come back and tell me if there is a light in any of the Jesuits windows In about five minutes Planchet returned Sir he said there is one window of the convent lighted up Hem If I were a Frondeur said D Artagnan I should knock here and should be sure of a good supper If I were a monk I should knock yonder and should have a good supper there too whereas tis very possible that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds dying with hunger and thirst Yes added Planchet like the famous ass of Buridan Shall I knock Hush replied D Artagnan the light no longer burns in yonder window Do you hear nothing whispered Planchet What is that noise There came a sound like a whirlwind at the same time two troops of horsemen each composed of ten men sallied forth from each of the lanes which encompassed the house and surrounded D Artagnan and Planchet Heyday cried D Artagnan drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his horse are you not mistaken is it really for us that you mean your attack Here he is we have him cried the horsemen rushing on D Artagnan with naked swords Don t let him escape said a loud voice No my lord be assured we shall not D Artagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation Halloo gentlemen he called out in his Gascon accent what do you want what do you demand That thou shalt soon know shouted a chorus of horsemen Stop stop cried he whom they had addressed as my lord tis not his voice Ah just so gentlemen pray do people get into a passion at random at Noisy Take care for I warn you that the first man that comes within the length of my sword and my sword is long I rip him up The chieftain of the party drew near What are you doing here he asked in a lofty tone as that of one accustomed to command And you what are you doing here replied D Artagnan Be civil or I shall beat you for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself one insists on respect suitable to one s rank You don t choose to discover yourself because you are the leader of an ambuscade returned D Artagnan but with regard to myself who am traveling quietly with my own servant I have not the same reasons as you have to conceal my name Enough enough what is your name I shall tell you my name in order that you may know where to find me my lord or my prince as it may suit you best to be called said our Gascon who did not choose to seem to yield to a threat Do you know Monsieur d Artagnan Lieutenant in the king s musketeers said the voice you are Monsieur d Artagnan I am Then you came here to defend him Him whom The man we are seeking It seems said D Artagnan that whilst I thought I was coming to Noisy I have entered without suspecting it into the kingdom of mysteries Come replied the same lofty tone answer Are you waiting for him underneath these windows Did you come to Noisy to defend him I am waiting for no one replied D Artagnan who was beginning to be angry I propose to defend no one but myself and I shall defend myself vigorously I give you warning Very well said the voice go away from here and leave the place to us Go away from here said D Artagnan whose purposes were in conflict with that order that is not so easy since I am on the point of falling and my horse too through fatigue unless indeed you are disposed to offer me a supper and a bed in the neighborhood Rascal Eh monsieur said D Artagnan I beg you will have a care what you say for if you utter another word like that be you marquis duke prince or king I will thrust it down your throat do you hear Well well rejoined the leader there s no doubt tis a Gascon who is speaking and therefore not the man we are looking for Our blow has failed for to night let us withdraw We shall meet again Master d Artagnan continued the leader raising his voice Yes but never with the same advantages said D Artagnan in a tone of raillery for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be daylight
2010_121416_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 Very good 
none	none	very good said the voice En route gentlemen And the troop grumbling angrily disappeared in the darkness and took the road to Paris D Artagnan and Planchet remained for some moments still on the defensive then as the noise of the horsemen became more and more distant they sheathed their swords Thou seest simpleton said D Artagnan to his servant that they wished no harm to us But to whom then I faith I neither know nor care What I do care for now is to make my way into the Jesuits convent so to horse and let us knock at their door Happen what will the devil take them they can t eat us And he mounted his horse Planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank down Hey your honor cried Planchet I ve a man behind me D Artagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on Planchet s horse Tis then the devil that pursues he cried drawing his sword and preparing to attack the new foe No no dear D Artagnan said the figure tis not the devil tis Aramis gallop fast Planchet and when you come to the end of the village turn swiftly to the left And Planchet with Aramis behind him set off at full gallop followed by D Artagnan who began to think he was in the merry maze of some fantastic dream nine The Abbe D Herblay At the extremity of the village Planchet turned to the left in obedience to the orders of Aramis and stopped underneath the window which had light in it Aramis alighted and clapped his hands three times Immediately the window was opened and a ladder of rope was let down from it My friend said Aramis if you like to ascend I shall be delighted to receive you Ah said D Artagnan is that the way you return to your apartment After nine at night pardieu said Aramis the rule of the convent is very severe Pardon me my dear friend said D Artagnan I think you said pardieu Do you think so said Aramis smiling it is possible You have no idea my dear fellow how one acquires bad habits in these cursed convents or what evil ways all these men of the church have with whom I am obliged to live But will you not go up Pass on before me I beg of you As the late cardinal used to say to the late king only to show you the way sire And Aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant D Artagnan followed but less nimbly showing plainly that this mode of ascent was not one to which he was accustomed I beg your pardon said Aramis noticing his awkwardness if I had known that I was to have the honor of your visit I should have procured the gardener s ladder but for me alone this is good enough Sir said Planchet when he saw D Artagnan on the summit of the ladder this way is easy for Monsieur Aramis and even for you in case of necessity I might also climb up but my two horses cannot mount the ladder Take them to yonder shed my friend said Aramis pointing to a low building on the plain there you will find hay and straw for them then come back here and clap your hands three times and we will give you wine and food Marry forsooth people don t die of hunger here And Aramis drawing in the ladder closed the window D Artagnan then looked around attentively Never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more elegant At each corner were arranged trophies presenting to view swords of all sorts and on the walls hung four great pictures representing in their ordinary military costume the Cardinal de Lorraine the Cardinal de Richelieu the Cardinal de la Valette and the Archbishop of Bordeaux Exteriorly nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abbe The hangings were of damask the carpets from Alencon and the bed especially had more the look of a fine lady s couch with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered counterpane than that of a man who had made a vow that he would endeavor to gain Heaven by fasting and mortification You are examining my den said Aramis Ah my dear fellow excuse me I am lodged like a Chartreux But what are you looking for I am looking for the person who let down the ladder I see no one and yet the ladder didn t come down of itself No it is Bazin Ah ah said D Artagnan But continued Aramis Bazin is a well trained servant and seeing that I was not alone he discreetly retired Sit down my dear friend and let us talk And Aramis pushed forward a large easy chair in which D Artagnan stretched himself out In the first place you will sup with me will you not asked Aramis Yes if you really wish it said D Artagnan and even with great pleasure I confess the journey has given me a devil of an appetite Ah my poor friend said Aramis you will find meagre fare you were not expected Am I then threatened with the omelet of Crevecoeur Oh let us hope said Aramis that with the help of God and of Bazin we shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy Jesuit fathers Bazin my friend come here The door opened and Bazin entered on perceiving the musketeer he uttered an exclamation that was almost a cry of despair My dear Bazin said D Artagnan I am delighted to see with what wonderful composure you can tell a lie even in church Sir replied Bazin I have been taught by the good Jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a good cause So far well said Aramis we are dying of hunger Serve us up the best supper you can and especially give us some good wine Bazin bowed low sighed and left the room Now we are alone dear Aramis said D Artagnan tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of Planchet s horse I faith answered Aramis as you see from Heaven From Heaven replied D Artagnan shaking his head you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there My friend said Aramis with a look of imbecility on his face which D Artagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers if I did not come from Heaven at least I was leaving Paradise which is almost the same Here then is a puzzle for the learned observed D Artagnan until now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of Paradise some place it on Mount Ararat others between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates it seems that they have been looking very far away for it while it was actually very near Paradise is at Noisy le Sec upon the site of the archbishop s chateau People do not go out from it by the door but by the window one doesn t descend here by the marble steps of a peristyle but by the branches of a lime tree and the angel with a flaming sword who guards this elysium seems to have changed his celestial name of Gabriel into that of the more terrestrial one of the Prince de Marsillac Aramis burst into a fit of laughter You were always a merry companion my dear D Artagnan he said and your witty Gascon fancy has not deserted you Yes there is something in what you say nevertheless do not believe that it is Madame de Longueville with whom I am in love A plague on t I shall not do so After having been so long in love with Madame de Chevreuse you would hardly lay your heart at the feet of her mortal enemy Yes replied Aramis with an absent air yes that poor duchess I once loved her much and to do her justice she was very useful to us Eventually she was obliged to leave France He was a relentless enemy that damned cardinal continued Aramis glancing at the portrait of the old minister He had even given orders to arrest her and would have cut off her head had she not escaped with her waiting maid poor Kitty I have heard that she met with a strange adventure in I don t know what village with I don t know what cure of whom she asked hospitality and who having but one chamber and taking her for a cavalier offered to share it with her For she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man that dear Marie I know only one other woman who can do it as well So they made this song about her Laboissiere dis moi You know it don t you No sing it please Aramis immediately complied and sang the song in a very lively manner Bravo cried D Artagnan you sing charmingly dear Aramis I do not perceive that singing masses has spoiled your voice My dear D Artagnan replied Aramis you understand when I was a musketeer I mounted guard as seldom as I could now when I am an abbe I say as few masses as I can But to return to our duchess Which the Duchess de Chevreuse or the Duchess de Longueville Have I not already told you that there is nothing between me and the Duchess de Longueville Little flirtations perhaps and that s all No I spoke of the Duchess de Chevreuse did you see her after her return from Brussels after the king s death Yes she is still beautiful Yes said Aramis I saw her also at that time I gave her good advice by which she did not profit I ventured to tell her that Mazarin was the lover of Anne of Austria She wouldn t believe me saying that she knew Anne of Austria who was too proud to love such a worthless coxcomb After that she plunged into the cabal headed by the Duke of Beaufort and the coxcomb arrested De Beaufort and banished Madame de Chevreuse You know resumed D Artagnan that she has had leave to return to France Yes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or another Oh but this time perhaps she will follow your advice Oh this time returned Aramis I haven t seen her she is much changed In that respect unlike you my dear Aramis for you are still the same you have still your beautiful dark hair still your elegant figure still your feminine hands which are admirably suited to a prelate Yes replied Aramis I am extremely careful of my appearance Do you know that I am growing old I am nearly thirty seven Mind Aramis D Artagnan smiled as he spoke since we are together again let us agree on one point what age shall we be in future How Formerly I was your junior by two or three years and if I am not mistaken I am turned forty years old Indeed Then tis I who am mistaken for you have always been a good chronologist By your reckoning I must be forty three at least The devil I am Don t let it out at the Hotel Rambouillet it would ruin me replied the abbe Don t be afraid said D Artagnan I never go there Why what in the world cried Aramis is that animal Bazin doing Bazin Hurry up there you rascal we are mad with hunger and thirst Bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand At last said Aramis we are ready are we Yes monsieur quite ready said Bazin but it took me some time to bring up all the Because you always think you have on your shoulders your beadle s robe and spend all your time reading your breviary But I give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword I will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on it Bazin scandalized made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his hand D Artagnan more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the Abbe d Herblay which contrasted so strongly with those of the Musketeer Aramis remained staring with wide open eyes at the face of his friend Bazin quickly covered the table with a damask cloth and arranged upon it so many things gilded perfumed appetizing that D Artagnan was quite overcome But you expected some one then asked the officer Oh said Aramis I always try to be prepared and then I knew you were seeking me From whom From Master Bazin to be sure he took you for the devil my dear fellow and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if I should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers Oh monsieur said Bazin clasping his hands supplicatingly Come no hypocrisy you know that I don t like it You will do much better to open the window and let down some bread a chicken and a bottle of wine to your friend Planchet who has been this last hour killing himself clapping his hands Planchet in fact had bedded and fed his horses and then coming back under the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed upon Bazin obeyed fastened to the end of a cord the three articles designated and let them down to Planchet who then went satisfied to his shed Now to supper said Aramis The two friends sat down and Aramis began to cut up fowls partridges and hams with admirable skill The deuce cried D Artagnan do you live in this way always Yes pretty well The coadjutor has given me dispensations from fasting on the jours maigres on account of my health then I have engaged as my cook the cook who lived with Lafollone you know the man I mean the friend of the cardinal and the famous epicure whose grace after dinner used to be Good Lord do me the favor to cause me to digest what I have eaten Nevertheless he died of indigestion in spite of his grace said D Artagnan What can you expect replied Aramis in a tone of resignation Every man that s born must fulfil his destiny If it be not an indelicate question resumed D Artagnan have you grown rich Oh Heaven no I make about twelve thousand francs a year without counting a little benefice of a thousand crowns the prince gave me And how do you make your twelve thousand francs By your poems No I have given up poetry except now and then to write a drinking song some gay sonnet or some innocent epigram I compose sermons my friend What sermons Do you preach them No I sell them to those of my cloth who wish to become great orators Ah indeed and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation yourself I should my dear D Artagnan have been so but nature said No When I am in the pulpit if by chance a pretty woman looks at me I look at her again if she smiles I smile too Then I speak at random instead of preaching about the torments of hell I talk of the joys of Paradise An event took place in the Church of saint Louis au Marais A gentleman laughed in my face I stopped short to tell him that he was a fool the congregation went out to get stones to stone me with but whilst they were away I found means to conciliate the priests who were present so that my foe was pelted instead of me Tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do with an abbe like all other abbes And what was the end of the affair We met in the Place Royale Egad you know about it Was I not your second cried D Artagnan You were you know how I settled the matter Did he die I don t know But at all events I gave him absolution in articulo mortis Tis enough to kill the body without killing the soul Bazin made a despairing sign which meant that while perhaps he approved the moral he altogether disapproved the tone in which it was uttered Bazin my friend said Aramis you don t seem to be aware that I can see you in that mirror and you forget that once for all I have forbidden all signs of approbation or disapprobation You will do me the favor to bring us some Spanish wine and then to withdraw Besides my friend D Artagnan has something to say to me privately have you not D Artagnan D Artagnan nodded his head and Bazin retired after placing on the table the Spanish wine The two friends left alone remained silent face to face Aramis seemed to await a comfortable digestion D Artagnan to be preparing his exordium Each of them when the other was not looking hazarded a sly glance It was Aramis who broke the silence What are you thinking of D Artagnan he began I was thinking my dear old friend that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church and now that you are an abbe you are perpetually longing to be once more a musketeer Tis true man as you know said Aramis is a strange animal made up of contradictions Since I became an abbe I dream of nothing but battles That is apparent in your surroundings you have rapiers here of every form and to suit the most exacting taste Do you still fence well I I fence as well as you did in the old time better still perhaps I do nothing else all day And with whom With an excellent master at arms that we have here What here Yes here in this convent my dear fellow There is everything in a Jesuit convent Then you would have killed Monsieur de Marsillac if he had come alone to attack you instead of at the head of twenty men Undoubtedly said Aramis and even at the head of his twenty men if I could have drawn without being recognized God pardon me said D Artagnan to himself I believe he has become more Gascon than I am Then aloud Well my dear Aramis do you ask me why I came to seek you No I have not asked you that said Aramis with his subtle manner but I have expected you to tell me Well I sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to kill Monsieur de Marsillac whenever you please prince though he is Hold on wait said Aramis that is an idea Of which I invite you to take advantage my friend Let us see with your thousand crowns from the abbey and the twelve thousand francs you make by selling sermons are you rich Answer frankly I I am as poor as Job and were you to search my pockets and my boxes I don t believe you would find a hundred pistoles Peste a hundred pistoles said D Artagnan to himself he calls that being as poor as Job If I had them I should think myself as rich as Croesus Then aloud Are you ambitious As Enceladus Well my friend I bring you the means of becoming rich powerful and free to do whatever you wish The shadow of a cloud passed over Aramis s face as quickly as that which in August passes over the field of grain but quick as it was it did not escape D Artagnan s observation Speak on said Aramis One question first Do you take any interest in politics A gleam of light shone in Aramis s eyes as brief as the shadow that had passed over his face but not so brief but that it was seen by D Artagnan No Aramis replied Then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you since for the moment you have no master but God It is possible Have you my dear Aramis thought sometimes of those happy happy happy days of youth we passed laughing drinking and fighting each other for play Certainly and more than once regretted them it was indeed a glorious time Well those splendidly wild days may chance to come again I am commissioned to find out my companions and I began by you who were the very soul of our society Aramis bowed rather with respect than pleasure at the compliment To meddle in politics he exclaimed in a languid voice leaning back in his easy chair Ah dear D Artagnan see how regularly I live and how easy I am here We have experienced the ingratitude of the great as you well know Tis true replied D Artagnan Yet the great sometimes repent of their ingratitude In that case it would be quite another thing Come let s be merciful to every sinner Besides you are right in another respect which is in thinking that if we were to meddle in politics there could not be a better time than the present How can you know that You who never interest yourself in politics Ah without caring about them myself I live among those who are much occupied in them Poet as I am I am intimate with Sarazin who is devoted to the Prince de Conti and with Monsieur de Bois Robert who since the death of Cardinal Richelieu is of all parties or any party so that political discussions have not altogether been uninteresting to me I have no doubt of it said D Artagnan Now my dear friend look upon all I tell you as merely the statement of a monk of a man who resembles an echo repeating simply what he hears I understand that Mazarin is at this very moment extremely uneasy as to the state of affairs that his orders are not respected like those of our former bugbear the deceased cardinal whose portrait as you see hangs yonder for whatever may be thought of him it must be allowed that Richelieu was great I will not contradict you there said D Artagnan My first impressions were favorable to the minister I said to myself that a minister is never loved but that with the genius this one was said to have he would eventually triumph over his enemies and would make himself feared which in my opinion is much more to be desired than to be loved D Artagnan made a sign with his head which indicated that he entirely approved that doubtful maxim This then continued Aramis was my first opinion but as I am very ignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility which I profess obliges me not to rest on my own judgment but to ask the opinion of others I have inquired Eh my friend Aramis paused Well what asked his friend Well I must mortify myself I must confess that I was mistaken Monsieur de Mazarin is not a man of genius as I thought he is a man of no origin once a servant of Cardinal Bentivoglio and he got on by intrigue He is an upstart a man of no name who will only be the tool of a party in France He will amass wealth he will injure the king s revenue and pay to himself the pensions which Richelieu paid to others He is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling but a sort of buffoon a punchinello a pantaloon Do you know him I do not Hem said D Artagnan there is some truth in what you say Ah it fills me with pride to find that thanks to a common sort of penetration with which I am endowed I am approved by a man like you fresh from the court But you speak of him not of his party his resources It is true the queen is for him Something in his favor But he will never have the king A mere child A child who will be of age in four years Then he has neither the parliament nor the people with him they represent the wealth of the country nor the nobles nor the princes who are the military power of France D Artagnan scratched his ear He was forced to confess to himself that this reasoning was not only comprehensive but just You see my poor friend that I am sometimes bereft of my ordinary thoughtfulness perhaps I am wrong in speaking thus to you who have evidently a leaning to Mazarin I cried D Artagnan not in the least You spoke of a mission Did I I was wrong then no I said what you say there is a crisis at hand Well let s fly the feather before the wind let us join with that side to which the wind will carry it and resume our adventurous life We were once four valiant knights four hearts fondly united let us unite again not our hearts which have never been severed but our courage and our fortunes Here s a good opportunity for getting something better than a diamond You are right D Artagnan I held a similar project but as I had not nor ever shall have your fruitful vigorous imagination the idea was suggested to me Every one nowadays wants auxiliaries propositions have been made to me and I confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made me speak out Monsieur de Gondy the cardinal s enemy No the king s friend said Aramis the king s friend you understand Well it is a question of serving the king the gentleman s duty But the king is with Mazarin He is but not willingly in appearance not heart and that is exactly the snare the king s enemies are preparing for the poor child Ah but this is indeed civil war which you propose to me dear Aramis War for the king Yet the king will be at the head of the army on Mazarin s side But his heart will be in the army commanded by the Duc de Beaufort Monsieur de Beaufort He is at Vincennes Did I say Monsieur de Beaufort Monsieur de Beaufort or another Monsieur de Beaufort or Monsieur le Prince But Monsieur le Prince is to set out for the army he is entirely devoted to the cardinal Oh oh said Aramis there are questions between them at this very moment And besides if it is not the prince then Monsieur de Gondy But Monsieur de Gondy is to be made a cardinal they are soliciting the hat for him And are there no cardinals that can fight Come now recall the four cardinals that at the head of armies have equalled Monsieur de Guebriant and Monsieur de Gassion But a humpbacked general Under the cuirass the hump will not be seen Besides remember that Alexander was lame and Hannibal had but one eye Do you see any great advantage in adhering to this party asked D Artagnan I foresee in it the aid of powerful princes With the enmity of the government Counteracted by parliament and insurrections That may be done if they can separate the king from his mother That may be done said Aramis Never cried D Artagnan You Aramis know Anne of Austria better than I do Do you think she will ever forget that her son is her safeguard her shield the pledge for her dignity for her fortune and her life Should she forsake Mazarin she must join her son and go over to the princes side but you know better than I do that there are certain reasons why she can never abandon Mazarin Perhaps you are right said Aramis thoughtfully therefore I shall not pledge myself To them or to us do you mean Aramis To no one I am a priest resumed Aramis What have I to do with politics I am not obliged to read any breviary I have a jolly little circle of witty abbes and pretty women everything goes on smoothly so certainly dear friend I shall not meddle in politics Well listen my dear Aramis said D Artagnan your philosophy convinces me on my honor I don t know what devil of an insect stung me and made me ambitious I have a post by which I live at the death of Monsieur de Treville who is old I may be a captain which is a very snug berth for a once penniless Gascon Instead of running after adventures I shall accept an invitation from Porthos I shall go and shoot on his estate You know he has estates Porthos I should think so indeed Ten leagues of wood of marsh land and valleys he is lord of the hill and the plain and is now carrying on a suit for his feudal rights against the Bishop of Noyon Good said D Artagnan to himself That s what I wanted to know Porthos is in Picardy Then aloud And he has taken his ancient name of Vallon To which he adds that of Bracieux an estate which has been a barony by my troth So that Porthos will be a baron I don t doubt it The Baroness Porthos will sound particularly charming And the two friends began to laugh So D Artagnan resumed you will not become a partisan of Mazarin s Nor you of the Prince de Conde No let us belong to no party but remain friends let us be neither Cardinalists nor Frondists Adieu then And D Artagnan poured out a glass of wine To old times he said Yes returned Aramis Unhappily those times are past Nonsense They will return said D Artagnan At all events if you want me remember the Rue Tiquetonne Hotel de la Chevrette And I shall be at the convent of Jesuits from six in the morning to eight at night come by the door From eight in the evening until six in the morning come in by the window Adieu dear friend Oh I can t let you go so I will go with you And he took his sword and cloak He wants to be sure that I go away said D Artagnan to himself Aramis whistled for Bazin but Bazin was asleep in the ante chamber and Aramis was obliged to shake him by the ear to awake him Bazin stretched his arms rubbed his eyes and tried to go to sleep again Come come sleepy head quick the ladder But said Bazin yawning portentously the ladder is still at the window The other one the gardener s Didn t you see that Monsieur d Artagnan mounted with difficulty It will be even more difficult to descend D Artagnan was about to assure Aramis that he could descend easily when an idea came into his head which silenced him Bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the ladder Presently a good solid wooden ladder was placed against the window Now then said D Artagnan this is something like this is a means of communication A woman could go up a ladder like that Aramis s searching look seemed to seek his friend s thought even at the bottom of his heart but D Artagnan sustained the inquisition with an air of admirable simplicity Besides at that moment he put his foot on the first step of the ladder and began his descent In a moment he was on the ground Bazin remained at the window Stay there said Aramis I shall return immediately The two friends went toward the shed At their approach Planchet came out leading the two horses That is good to see said Aramis There is a servant active and vigilant not like that lazy fellow Bazin who is no longer good for anything since he became connected with the church Follow us Planchet we shall continue our conversation to the end of the village They traversed the width of the village talking of indifferent things then as they reached the last houses Go then dear friend said Aramis follow your own career Fortune lavishes her smiles upon you do not let her flee from your embrace As for me I remain in my humility and indolence Adieu Thus tis quite decided said D Artagnan that what I have to offer to you does not tempt you On the contrary it would tempt me were I any other man rejoined Aramis but I repeat I am made up of contradictions What I hate to day I adore to morrow and vice versa You see that I cannot like you for instance settle on any fixed plan Thou liest subtile one said D Artagnan to himself Thou alone on the contrary knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it stealthily The friends embraced They descended into the plain by the ladder Planchet met them hard by the shed D Artagnan jumped into the saddle then the old companions in arms again shook hands D Artagnan and Planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to Paris But after he had gone about two hundred steps D Artagnan stopped short alighted threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of Planchet and took the pistols from his saddle bow to fasten them to his girdle What s the matter asked Planchet This is the matter be he ever so cunning he shall never say I was his dupe Stand here don t stir turn your back to the road and wait for me Having thus spoken D Artagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the village He had observed between the house that Madame de Longueville inhabited and the convent of the Jesuits an open space surrounded by a hedge The moon had now risen and he could see well enough to retrace his road He reached the hedge and hid himself behind it in passing by the house where the scene which we have related took place he remarked that the window was again lighted up and he was convinced that Aramis had not yet returned to his own apartment and that when he did it would not be alone In truth in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers Close to the hedge the steps stopped D Artagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the hedge Two men to the astonishment of D Artagnan appeared shortly soon however his surprise vanished for he heard the murmurs of a soft harmonious voice one of these two men was a woman disguised as a cavalier Calm yourself dear Rene said the soft voice the same thing will never happen again I have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an outlet Oh answered another voice which D Artagnan instantly recognized as that of Aramis I swear to you princess that if your reputation did not depend on precautions and if my life alone were jeopardized Yes yes I know you are as brave and venturesome as any man in the world but you do not belong to me alone you belong to all our party Be prudent sensible I always obey madame when I am commanded by so gentle a voice He kissed her hand tenderly Ah exclaimed the cavalier with a soft voice What s the matter asked Aramis Do you not see that the wind has blown off my hat Aramis rushed after the fugitive hat D Artagnan took advantage of the circumstance to find a place in the hedge not so thick where his glance could penetrate to the supposed cavalier At that instant the moon inquisitive perhaps like D Artagnan came from behind a cloud and by her light D Artagnan recognized the large blue eyes the golden hair and the classic head of the Duchess de Longueville Aramis returned laughing one hat on his head and the other in his hand and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the convent Good said D Artagnan rising and brushing his knees now I have thee thou art a Frondeur and the lover of Madame de Longueville ten Monsieur Porthos du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds Thanks to what Aramis had told him D Artagnan who knew already that Porthos called himself Du Vallon was now aware that he styled himself from his estate De Bracieux and that he was on account of this estate engaged in a lawsuit with the Bishop of Noyon It was then in the neighborhood of Noyon that he must seek that estate His itinerary was promptly determined he would go to Dammartin from which place two roads diverge one toward Soissons the other toward Compiegne there he would inquire concerning the Bracieux estate and go to the right or to the left according to the information obtained Planchet who was still a little concerned for his safety after his recent escapade declared that he would follow D Artagnan even to the end of the world either by the road to the right or by that to the left only he begged his former master to set out in the evening for greater security to himself D Artagnan suggested that he should send word to his wife so that she might not be anxious about him but Planchet replied with much sagacity that he was very sure his wife would not die of anxiety through not knowing where he was while he Planchet remembering her incontinence of tongue would die of anxiety if she did know This reasoning seemed to D Artagnan so satisfactory that he no further insisted and about eight o clock in the evening the time when the vapors of night begin to thicken in the streets he left the Hotel de la Chevrette and followed by Planchet set forth from the capital by way of the Saint Denis gate At midnight the two travelers were at Dammartin but it was then too late to make inquiries the host of the Cygne de la Croix had gone to bed The next morning D Artagnan summoned the host one of those sly Normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct answer D Artagnan however gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take and on that uncertain information he resumed his journey At nine in the morning he reached Nanteuil and stopped for breakfast His host here was a good fellow from Picardy who gave him all the information he needed The Bracieux estate was a few leagues from Villars Cotterets D Artagnan was acquainted with Villars Cotterets having gone thither with the court on several occasions for at that time Villars Cotterets was a royal residence He therefore shaped his course toward that place and dismounted at the Dauphin d Or There he ascertained that the Bracieux estate was four leagues distant but that Porthos was not at Bracieux Porthos had in fact been involved in a dispute with the Bishop of Noyon in regard to the Pierrefonds property which adjoined his own and weary at length of a legal controversy which was beyond his comprehension he put an end to it by purchasing Pierrefonds and added that name to his others He now called himself Du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds and resided on his new estate The travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next day the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed rest It is true they might have taken others but there was a great forest to pass through and Planchet as we have seen had no liking for forests after dark There was another thing that Planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry stomach Accordingly D Artagnan on awaking found his breakfast waiting for him It need not be said that Planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by D Artagnan It was nearly eight o clock when they set out again Their course was clearly defined they were to follow the road toward Compiegne and on emerging from the forest turn to the right The morning was beautiful and in this early springtime the birds sang on the trees and the sunbeams shone through the misty glades like curtains of golden gauze In other parts of the forest the light could scarcely penetrate through the foliage and the stems of two old oak trees the refuge of the squirrel startled by the travelers were in deep shadow There came up from all nature in the dawn of day a perfume of herbs flowers and leaves which delighted the heart D Artagnan sick of the closeness of Paris thought that when a man had three names of his different estates joined one to another he ought to be very happy in such a paradise then he shook his head saying If I were Porthos and D Artagnan came to make me such a proposition as I am going to make to him I know what I should say to it As to Planchet he thought of little or nothing but was happy as a hunting hound in his old master s company At the extremity of the wood D Artagnan perceived the road that had been described to him and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an immense feudal castle Oh oh he said I fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of Orleans Can Porthos have negotiated for it with the Duc de Longueville Faith exclaimed Planchet here s land in good condition if it belongs to Monsieur Porthos I wish him joy Zounds cried D Artagnan don t call him Porthos nor even Vallon call him De Bracieux or De Pierrefonds thou wilt knell out damnation to my mission otherwise As he approached the castle which had first attracted his eye D Artagnan was convinced that it could not be there that his friend dwelt the towers though solid and as if built yesterday were open and broken One might have fancied that some giant had cleaved them with blows from a hatchet On arriving at the extremity of the castle D Artagnan found himself overlooking a beautiful valley in which at the foot of a charming little lake stood several scattered houses which humble in their aspect and covered some with tiles others with thatch seemed to acknowledge as their sovereign lord a pretty chateau built about the beginning of the reign of Henry IV and surmounted by four stately gilded weather cocks D Artagnan no longer doubted that this was Porthos s pleasant dwelling place The road led straight up to the chateau which compared to its ancestor on the hill was exactly what a fop of the coterie of the Duc d Enghein would have been beside a knight in steel armor in the time of Charles VII D Artagnan spurred his horse on and pursued his road followed by Planchet at the same pace In ten minutes D Artagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate the points and crossed bars of which were gilt In the midst of this avenue was a nobleman dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate riding on a tall horse On his right hand and his left were two footmen with the seams of their dresses laced A considerable number of clowns were assembled and rendered homage to their lord Ah said D Artagnan to himself can this be the Seigneur du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds Well a day how he has shrunk since he gave up the name of Porthos This cannot be Monsieur Porthos observed Planchet replying as it were to his master s thoughts Monsieur Porthos was six feet high this man is scarcely five Nevertheless said D Artagnan the people are bowing very low to this person As he spoke he rode toward the tall horse to the man of importance and his valets As he approached he seemed to recognize the features of this individual Jesu cried Planchet can it be At this exclamation the man on horseback turned slowly and with a lofty air and the two travelers could see displayed in all their brilliancy the large eyes the vermilion visage and the eloquent smile of Mousqueton It was indeed Mousqueton Mousqueton as fat as a pig rolling about with rude health puffed out with good living who recognizing D Artagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite Bazin slipped off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off so that the homage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun which eclipsed the former luminary Monsieur d Artagnan Monsieur d Artagnan cried Mousqueton his fat cheeks swelling out and his whole frame perspiring with joy Monsieur d Artagnan oh what joy for my lord and master Du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds Thou good Mousqueton where is thy master You stand upon his property But how handsome thou art how fat thou hast prospered and grown stout and D Artagnan could not restrain his astonishment at the change good fortune had produced on the once famished one Hey yes thank God I am pretty well said Mousqueton But hast thou nothing to say to thy friend Planchet How my friend Planchet Planchet art thou there cried Mousqueton with open arms and eyes full of tears My very self replied Planchet but I wanted first to see if thou wert grown proud Proud toward an old friend never Planchet thou wouldst not have thought so hadst thou known Mousqueton well So far so well answered Planchet alighting and extending his arms to Mousqueton the two servants embraced with an emotion which touched those who were present and made them suppose that Planchet was a great lord in disguise so highly did they estimate the position of Mousqueton And now sir resumed Mousqueton when he had rid himself of Planchet who had in vain tried to clasp his hands behind his friend s fat back now sir allow me to leave you for I could not permit my master to hear of your arrival from any but myself he would never forgive me for not having preceded you This dear friend said D Artagnan carefully avoiding to utter either the former name borne by Porthos or his new one then he has not forgotten me Forgotten he cried Mousqueton there s not a day sir that we don t expect to hear that you were made marshal either instead of Monsieur de Gassion or of Monsieur de Bassompierre On D Artagnan s lips there played one of those rare and melancholy smiles which seemed to emanate from the depth of his soul the last trace of youth and happiness that had survived life s disillusions And you fellows resumed Mousqueton stay near Monsieur le Comte d Artagnan and pay him every attention in your power whilst I go to prepare my lord for his visit And mounting his horse Mousqueton rode off down the avenue on the grass at a hand gallop Ah there there s something promising said D Artagnan No mysteries no cloak to hide one s self in no cunning policy here people laugh outright they weep for joy here I see nothing but faces a yard broad in short it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday garb and that the trees instead of leaves and flowers are covered with red and green ribbons as on gala days As for me said Planchet I seem to smell from this place even a most delectable perfume of fine roast meat and to see the scullions in a row by the hedge hailing our approach Ah sir what a cook must Monsieur Pierrefonds have when he was so fond of eating and drinking even whilst he was only called Monsieur Porthos Say no more cried D Artagnan If the reality corresponds with appearances I am lost for a man so well off will never change his happy condition and I shall fail with him as I have already done with Aramis eleven Wealth does not necessarily produce Happiness D Artagnan passed through the iron gate and arrived in front of the chateau He alighted as he saw a species of giant on the steps Let us do justice to D Artagnan Independently of every selfish wish his heart palpitated with joy when he saw that tall form and martial demeanor which recalled to him a good and brave man He ran to Porthos and threw himself into his arms the whole body of servants arranged in a semi circle at a respectful distance looked on with humble curiosity Mousqueton at the head of them wiped his eyes Porthos linked his arm in that of his friend Ah how delightful to see you again dear friend he cried in a voice which was now changed from a baritone into a bass you ve not then forgotten me Forget you oh dear Du Vallon does one forget the happiest days of flowery youth one s dearest friends the dangers we have dared together On the contrary there is not an hour we have passed together that is not present to my memory Yes yes said Porthos trying to give to his mustache a curl which it had lost whilst he had been alone Yes we did some fine things in our time and we gave that poor cardinal a few threads to unravel And he heaved a sigh Under any circumstances he resumed you are welcome my dear friend you will help me to recover my spirits to morrow we will hunt the hare on my plain which is a superb tract of land or pursue the deer in my woods which are magnificent I have four harriers which are considered the swiftest in the county and a pack of hounds which are unequalled for twenty leagues around And Porthos heaved another sigh But first interposed D Artagnan you must present me to Madame du Vallon A third sigh from Porthos I lost Madame du Vallon two years ago he said and you find me still in affliction on that account That was the reason why I left my Chateau du Vallon near Corbeil and came to my estate Bracieux Poor Madame du Vallon her temper was uncertain but she came at last to accustom herself to my little ways and understand my little wishes So you are free now and rich Alas groaned Porthos I am a widower and have forty thousand francs a year Let us go to breakfast I shall be happy to do so the morning air has made me hungry Yes said Porthos my air is excellent They went into the chateau there was nothing but gilding high and low the cornices were gilt the mouldings were gilt the legs and arms of the chairs were gilt A table ready set out awaited them You see said Porthos this is my usual style Devil take me answered D Artagnan I wish you joy of it The king has nothing like it No answered Porthos I hear it said that he is very badly fed by the cardinal Monsieur de Mazarin Taste this cutlet my dear D Artagnan tis off one of my sheep You have very tender mutton and I wish you joy of it said D Artagnan Yes the sheep are fed in my meadows which are excellent pasture Give me another cutlet No try this hare which I had killed yesterday in one of my warrens Zounds what a flavor cried D Artagnan ah they are fed on thyme only your hares And how do you like my wine asked Porthos it is pleasant isn t it Capital It is nothing however but a wine of the country Really Yes a small declivity to the south yonder on my hill gives me twenty hogsheads Quite a vineyard hey Porthos sighed for the fifth time D Artagnan had counted his sighs He became curious to solve the problem Well now he said it seems my dear friend that something vexes you you are ill perhaps That health which Excellent my dear friend better than ever I could kill an ox with a blow of my fist Well then family affairs perhaps Family I have happily only myself in the world to care for But what makes you sigh My dear fellow replied Porthos to be candid with you I am not happy You are not happy Porthos You who have chateau meadows mountains woods you who have forty thousand francs a year you are not happy My dear friend all those things I have but I am a hermit in the midst of superfluity Surrounded I suppose only by clodhoppers with whom you could not associate Porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine No but just think there are paltry country squires who have all some title or another and pretend to go back as far as Charlemagne or at least to Hugh Capet When I first came here being the last comer it was for me to make the first advances I made them but you know my dear friend Madame du Vallon Porthos in pronouncing these words seemed to gulp down something Madame du Vallon was of doubtful gentility She had in her first marriage I don t think D Artagnan I am telling you anything new married a lawyer they thought that nauseous you can understand that s a word bad enough to make one kill thirty thousand men I have killed two which has made people hold their tongues but has not made me their friend So that I have no society I live alone I am sick of it my mind preys on itself D Artagnan smiled He now saw where the breastplate was weak and prepared the blow But now he said that you are a widower your wife s connection cannot injure you Yes but understand me not being of a race of historic fame like the De Courcys who were content to be plain sirs or the Rohans who didn t wish to be dukes all these people who are all either vicomtes or comtes go before me at church in all the ceremonies and I can say nothing to them Ah If I only were a A baron don t you mean cried D Artagnan finishing his friend s sentence Ah cried Porthos would I were but a baron Well my friend I am come to give you this very title which you wish for so much Porthos gave a start that shook the room two or three bottles fell and were broken Mousqueton ran thither hearing the noise Porthos waved his hand to Mousqueton to pick up the bottles I am glad to see said D Artagnan that you have still that honest lad with you He is my steward replied Porthos he will never leave me Go away now Mouston So he s called Mouston thought D Artagnan tis too long a word to pronounce Mousqueton Well he said aloud let us resume our conversation later your people may suspect something there may be spies about You can suppose Porthos that what I have to say relates to most important matters Devil take them let us walk in the park answered Porthos for the sake of digestion Egad said D Artagnan the park is like everything else and there are as many fish in your pond as rabbits in your warren you are a happy man my friend since you have not only retained your love of the chase but acquired that of fishing My friend replied Porthos I leave fishing to Mousqueton it is a vulgar pleasure but I shoot sometimes that is to say when I am dull and I sit on one of those marble seats have my gun brought to me my favorite dog and I shoot rabbits Really how very amusing Yes replied Porthos with a sigh it is amusing D Artagnan now no longer counted the sighs They were innumerable However what had you to say to me he resumed let us return to that subject With pleasure replied D Artagnan I must however first frankly tell you that you must change your mode of life How Go into harness again gird on your sword run after adventures and leave as in old times a little of your fat on the roadside Ah hang it said Porthos I see you are spoiled dear friend you are corpulent your arm has no longer that movement of which the late cardinal s guards have so many proofs Ah my fist is strong enough I swear cried Porthos extending a hand like a shoulder of mutton So much the better Are we then to go to war By my troth yes Against whom Are you a politician friend Not in the least Are you for Mazarin or for the princes I am for no one That is to say you are for us Well I tell you that I come to you from the cardinal This speech was heard by Porthos in the same sense as if it had still been in the year sixteen forty and related to the true cardinal Ho ho What are the wishes of his eminence He wishes to have you in his service And who spoke to him of me Rochefort you remember him Yes pardieu It was he who gave us so much trouble and kept us on the road so much you gave him three sword wounds in three separate engagements But you know he is now our friend No I didn t know that So he cherishes no resentment You are mistaken Porthos said D Artagnan It is I who cherish no resentment Porthos didn t understand any too clearly but then we know that understanding was not his strong point You say then he continued that the Count de Rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal Yes and the queen too The queen do you say To inspire us with confidence she has even placed in Mazarin s hands that famous diamond you remember all about it that I once sold to Monsieur des Essarts and of which I don t know how she has regained possession But it seems to me said Porthos that she would have done much better if she had given it back to you So I think replied D Artagnan but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd fancies nevertheless since they are the ones who have riches and honors we are devoted to them Yes we are devoted to them repeated Porthos and you to whom are you devoted now To the king the queen and to the cardinal moreover I have answered for your devotion also And you say that you have made certain conditions on my behalf Magnificent my dear fellow magnificent In the first place you have plenty of money haven t you forty thousand francs income I think you said Porthos began to be suspicious Eh my friend said he one never has too much money Madame du Vallon left things in much disorder I am not much of a hand at figures so that I live almost from hand to mouth He is afraid I have come to borrow money thought D Artagnan Ah my friend said he it is all the better if you are in difficulties How is it all the better Yes for his eminence will give you all that you want land money and titles Ah ah ah said Porthos opening his eyes at that last word Under the other cardinal continued D Artagnan we didn t know enough to make our profits this however doesn t concern you with your forty thousand francs income the happiest man in the world it seems to me Porthos sighed At the same time continued D Artagnan notwithstanding your forty thousand francs a year and perhaps even for the very reason that you have forty thousand francs a year it seems to me that a little coronet would do well on your carriage hey Yes indeed said Porthos Well my dear friend win it it is at the point of your sword We shall not interfere with each other your object is a title mine money If I can get enough to rebuild Artagnan which my ancestors impoverished by the Crusades allowed to fall into ruins and to buy thirty acres of land about it that is all I wish I shall retire and die tranquilly at home For my part said Porthos I desire to be made a baron You shall be one And have you not seen any of our other friends Yes I have seen Aramis And what does he wish To be a bishop Aramis answered D Artagnan who did not wish to undeceive Porthos Aramis fancy has become a monk and a Jesuit and lives like a bear My offers did not arouse him did not even tempt him So much the worse He was a clever man And Athos I have not yet seen him Do you know where I shall find him Near Blois He is called Bragelonne Only imagine my dear friend Athos who was of as high birth as the emperor and who inherits one estate which gives him the title of comte what is he to do with all those dignities the Comte de la Fere Comte de Bragelonne And he has no children with all these titles Ah said Porthos I have heard that he had adopted a young man who resembles him greatly What Athos Our Athos who was as virtuous as Scipio Have you seen him No Well I shall see him to morrow and tell him about you but I m afraid entre nous that his liking for wine has aged and degraded him Yes he used to drink a great deal replied Porthos And then he was older than any of us added D Artagnan Some years only His gravity made him look older than he was Well then if we can get Athos all will be well If we cannot we will do without him We two are worth a dozen Yes said Porthos smiling at the remembrance of his former exploits but we four altogether would be equal to thirty six more especially as you say the work will not be child s play Will it last long By r Lady two or three years perhaps So much the better cried Porthos You have no idea my friend how my bones ache since I came here Sometimes on a Sunday I take a ride in the fields and on the property of my neighbours in order to pick up a nice little quarrel which I am really in want of but nothing happens Either they respect or they fear me which is more likely but they let me trample down the clover with my dogs insult and obstruct every one and I come back still more weary and low spirited that s all At any rate tell me there s more chance of fighting in Paris is there not In that respect my dear friend it s delightful No more edicts no more of the cardinal s guards no more De Jussacs nor other bloodhounds I Gad underneath a lamp in an inn anywhere they ask Are you one of the Fronde They unsheathe and that s all that is said The Duke de Guise killed Monsieur de Coligny in the Place Royale and nothing was said of it Ah things go on gaily then said Porthos Besides which in a short time resumed D Artagnan We shall have set battles cannonades conflagrations and there will be great variety Well then I decide I have your word then Yes tis given I shall fight heart and soul for Mazarin but But But he must make me a baron Zounds said D Artagnan that s settled already I will be responsible for the barony On this promise being given Porthos who had never doubted his friend s assurance turned back with him toward the castle twelve Porthos was Discontented with his Condition 
274_121382_000001_000000	train-clean-360	As they returned toward the castle D Artagnan thought of the miseries of poor human nature always dissatisfied with what it has ever desirous of what it has not 
274_121382_000002_000000	train-clean-360	In the position of Porthos D Artagnan would have been perfectly happy and to make Porthos contented there was wanting what five letters to put before his three names a tiny coronet to paint upon the panels of his carriage 
274_121382_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall pass all my life thought D Artagnan in seeking for a man who is really contented with his lot 
274_121382_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Whilst making this reflection chance seemed as it were to give him the lie direct 
none	none	When Porthos had left him to give some orders he saw Mousqueton approaching 
274_121382_000004_000002	train-clean-360	The face of the steward despite one slight shade of care light as a summer cloud seemed a physiognomy of absolute felicity 
274_121382_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Here is what I am looking for thought D Artagnan but alas the poor fellow does not know the purpose for which I am here 
none	none	He then made a sign for Mousqueton to come to him
274_121382_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Sir said the servant I have a favour to ask you 
274_121382_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Speak out my friend 
274_121382_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I am afraid to do so 
274_121382_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Perhaps you will think sir that prosperity has spoiled me 
274_121382_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Art thou happy friend asked D Artagnan 
274_121382_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 As happy as possible and yet sir you may make me even happier than I am 
274_121382_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Well speak if it depends on me 
none	none	Oh sir it depends on you only
274_121382_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 I listen I am waiting to hear 
none	none	Sir the favor I have to ask of you is not to call me Mousqueton but Mouston Since I have had the honor of being my lord s steward I have taken the last name as more dignified and calculated to make my inferiors respect me 
274_121382_000015_000001	train-clean-360	You sir know how necessary subordination is in any large establishment of servants 
none	none	D Artagnan smiled Porthos wanted to lengthen out his names Mousqueton to cut his short Well my dear Mouston he said rest satisfied I will call thee Mouston and if it makes thee happy I will not tutoyer you any longer Oh cried Mousqueton reddening with joy if you do me sir such honor I shall be grateful all my life it is too much to ask Alas thought D Artagnan it is very little to offset the unexpected tribulations I am bringing to this poor devil who has so warmly welcomed me
274_121382_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Will monsieur remain long with us asked Mousqueton with a serene and glowing countenance 
none	none	I go to morrow my friend replied D Artagnan Ah monsieur said Mousqueton then you have come here only to awaken our regrets
274_121382_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 I fear that is true said D Artagnan in a low tone 
none	none	D Artagnan was secretly touched with remorse not at inducing Porthos to enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy for Porthos in the title of baron had his object and reward but poor Mousqueton whose only wish was to be called Mouston was it not cruel to snatch him from the delightful state of peace and plenty in which he was 
274_121382_000025_000000	train-clean-360	He was thinking of these matters when Porthos summoned him to dinner 
274_121382_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 What to dinner said D Artagnan 
274_121382_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 What time is it then 
none	none	Eh why it is after one o clock
274_121382_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Your home is a paradise Porthos one takes no note of time 
274_121382_000028_000001	train-clean-360	I follow you though I am not hungry 
274_121382_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Come if one can t always eat one can always drink a maxim of poor Athos the truth of which I have discovered since I began to be lonely 
none	none	D Artagnan who as a Gascon was inclined to sobriety seemed not so sure as his friend of the truth of Athos s maxim but he did his best to keep up with his host 
274_121382_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Meanwhile his misgivings in regard to Mousqueton recurred to his mind and with greater force because Mousqueton though he did not himself wait on the table which would have been beneath him in his new position appeared at the door from time to time and evinced his gratitude to D Artagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be served 
274_121382_000030_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore when at dessert upon a sign from D Artagnan Porthos had sent away his servants and the two friends were alone 
none	none	Porthos said D Artagnan who will attend you in your campaigns
274_121382_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Why replied Porthos Mouston of course 
274_121382_000033_000000	train-clean-360	This was a blow to D Artagnan 
none	none	He could already see the intendant s beaming smile change to a contortion of grief But he said Mouston is not so young as he was my dear fellow besides he has grown fat and perhaps has lost his fitness for active service
274_121382_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 That may be true replied Porthos but I am used to him and besides he wouldn t be willing to let me go without him he loves me so much 
274_121382_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh blind self love thought D Artagnan 
none	none	And you asked Porthos haven t you still in your service your old lackey that good that brave that intelligent what then is his name Planchet yes I have found him again but he is lackey no longer
274_121382_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 What is he then 
274_121382_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 With his sixteen hundred francs you remember the sixteen hundred francs he earned at the siege of La Rochelle by carrying a letter to Lord de Winter he has set up a little shop in the Rue des Lombards and is now a confectioner 
none	none	Ah he is a confectioner in the Rue des Lombards 
274_121382_000040_000001	train-clean-360	How does it happen then that he is in your service 
none	none	He has been guilty of certain escapades and fears he may be disturbed And the musketeer narrated to his friend Planchet s adventure Well said Porthos if any one had told you in the old times that the day would come when Planchet would rescue Rochefort and that you would protect him in it
274_121382_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 I should not have believed him but men are changed by events 
none	none	There is nothing truer than that said Porthos but what does not change or changes for the better is wine 
274_121382_000044_000001	train-clean-360	Taste of this it is a Spanish wine which our friend Athos thought much of 
274_121382_000045_000000	train-clean-360	At that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the proceedings of the next day and also with regard to the shooting party which had been proposed 
274_121382_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Tell me Mouston said Porthos are my arms in good condition 
274_121382_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Your arms my lord what arms 
274_121382_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Zounds my weapons 
274_121382_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 What weapons 
274_121382_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 My military weapons 
274_121382_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes my lord at any rate I think so 
274_121382_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Make sure of it and if they want it have them burnished up 
274_121382_000052_000001	train-clean-360	Which is my best cavalry horse 
274_121382_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Vulcan 
none	none	And the best hack Bayard
274_121382_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 What horse dost thou choose for thyself 
none	none	I like Rustaud my lord a good animal whose paces suit me
274_121382_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Strong thinkest thou 
274_121382_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Half Norman half Mecklenburger will go night and day 
none	none	That will do for us See to these horses 
274_121382_000060_000002	train-clean-360	Polish up or make some one else polish my arms 
274_121382_000060_000003	train-clean-360	Then take pistols with thee and a hunting knife 
274_121382_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Are we then going to travel my lord asked Mousqueton rather uneasy 
274_121382_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Something better still Mouston 
none	none	An expedition sir asked the steward whose roses began to change into lilies We are going to return to the service Mouston replied Porthos still trying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long lost
274_121382_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Into the service the king s service Mousqueton trembled even his fat smooth cheeks shook as he spoke and he looked at D Artagnan with an air of reproach he staggered and his voice was almost choked 
274_121382_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes and no 
274_121382_000066_000001	train-clean-360	We shall serve in a campaign seek out all sorts of adventures return in short to our former life 
274_121382_000067_000000	train-clean-360	These last words fell on Mousqueton like a thunderbolt 
274_121382_000067_000001	train-clean-360	It was those very terrible old days that made the present so excessively delightful and the blow was so great he rushed out overcome and forgot to shut the door 
274_121382_000068_000000	train-clean-360	The two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build castles in the air 
none	none	The good wine which Mousqueton had placed before them traced out in glowing drops to D Artagnan a fine perspective shining with quadruples and pistoles and showed to Porthos a blue ribbon and a ducal mantle they were in fact asleep on the table when the servants came to light them to their bed Mousqueton was however somewhat consoled by D Artagnan who the next day told him that in all probability war would always be carried on in the heart of Paris and within reach of the Chateau du Vallon which was near Corbeil or Bracieux which was near Melun and of Pierrefonds which was between Compiegne and Villars Cotterets
274_121382_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 But formerly it appears began Mousqueton timidly 
274_121382_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh said D Artagnan we don t now make war as we did formerly 
none	none	To day it s a sort of diplomatic arrangement ask Planchet 
274_121382_000072_000000	train-clean-360	Mousqueton inquired therefore the state of the case of his old friend who confirmed the statement of D Artagnan 
274_121382_000072_000001	train-clean-360	 But he added in this war prisoners stand a chance of being hung 
none	none	The deuce they do said Mousqueton I think I should like the siege of Rochelle better than this war then 
274_121382_000074_000000	train-clean-360	Porthos meantime asked D Artagnan to give him his instructions how to proceed on his journey 
none	none	Four days replied his friend are necessary to reach Blois one day to rest there three or four days to return to Paris Set out therefore in a week with your suite and go to the Hotel de la Chevrette Rue Tiquetonne and there await me
274_121382_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 That s agreed said Porthos 
none	none	As to myself I shall go around to see Athos for though I don t think his aid worth much one must with one s friends observe all due politeness said D Artagnan 
274_121382_000078_000000	train-clean-360	The friends then took leave of each other on the very border of the estate of Pierrefonds to which Porthos escorted his friend 
none	none	At least D Artagnan said to himself as he took the road to Villars Cotterets at least I shall not be alone in my undertaking That devil Porthos is a man of prodigious strength still if Athos joins us well we shall be three of us to laugh at Aramis that little coxcomb with his too good luck At Villars Cotterets he wrote to the cardinal
274_121382_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 My Lord I have already one man to offer to your eminence and he is well worth twenty men 
274_121382_000081_000001	train-clean-360	I am just setting out for Blois 
none	none	The Comte de la Fere inhabits the Castle of Bragelonne in the environs of that city thirteen Two Angelic Faces The road was long but the horses upon which D Artagnan and Planchet rode had been refreshed in the well supplied stables of the Lord of Bracieux the master and servant rode side by side conversing as they went for D Artagnan had by degrees thrown off the master and Planchet had entirely ceased to assume the manners of a servant He had been raised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his master It was many years since D Artagnan had opened his heart to any one it happened however that these two men on meeting again assimilated perfectly Planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures he was a man of uncommonly sound sense Without courting danger he never shrank from an encounter in short he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man it was therefore on the footing of friends that D Artagnan and Planchet arrived in the neighborhood of Blois Going along D Artagnan shaking his head said I know that my going to Athos is useless and absurd but still I owe this courtesy to my old friend a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of characters Oh Monsieur Athos was a noble gentleman said Planchet was he not Scattering money round about him as Heaven sprinkles rain Do you remember sir that duel with the Englishman in the inclosure des Carmes Ah how lofty how magnificent Monsieur Athos was that day when he said to his adversary You have insisted on knowing my name sir so much the worse for you since I shall be obliged to kill you I was near him those were his exact words when he stabbed his foe as he said he would and his adversary fell without saying Oh Tis a noble gentleman Monsieur Athos Yes true as Gospel said D Artagnan but one single fault has swallowed up all these fine qualities I remember well said Planchet he was fond of drinking in truth he drank but not as other men drink One seemed as he raised the wine to his lips to hear him say Come juice of the grape and chase away my sorrows And how he used to break the stem of a glass or the neck of a bottle There was no one like him for that And now replied D Artagnan behold the sad spectacle that awaits us This noble gentleman with his lofty glance this handsome cavalier so brilliant in feats of arms that every one was surprised that he held in his hand a sword only instead of a baton of command Alas we shall find him changed into a broken down old man with garnet nose and eyes that slobber we shall find him extended on some lawn whence he will look at us with a languid eye and peradventure will not recognize us God knows Planchet that I should fly from a sight so sad if I did not wish to show my respect for the illustrious shadow of what was once the Comte de la Fere whom we loved so much Planchet shook his head and said nothing It was evident that he shared his master s apprehensions And then resumed D Artagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he must have neglected the little that he had and the dirty scoundrel Grimaud more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his master stay Planchet it breaks my heart to merely think of it I fancy myself there and that I see him staggering and hear him stammering said Planchet in a piteous tone but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things for I imagine that those lofty walls now turning ruby in the setting sun are the walls of Blois Probably and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that I have heard described at Chambord At this moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the Loire came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following A man carrying a long switch with a nail at the end of it with which he urged on his slow team was walking with the cart Ho friend cried Planchet What s your pleasure gentlemen replied the peasant with a purity of accent peculiar to the people of that district and which might have put to shame the cultured denizens of the Sorbonne and the Rue de l Universite We are looking for the house of Monsieur de la Fere said D Artagnan The peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered name Gentlemen he said the wood that I am carting is his I cut it in his copse and I am taking it to the chateau D Artagnan determined not to question this man he did not wish to hear from another what he had himself said to Planchet The chateau he said to himself what chateau Ah I understand Athos is not a man to be thwarted he like Porthos has obliged his peasantry to call him my lord and to dignify his pettifogging place by the name of chateau He had a heavy hand dear old Athos after drinking D Artagnan after asking the man the right way continued his route agitated in spite of himself at the idea of seeing once more that singular man whom he had so truly loved and who had contributed so much by advice and example to his education as a gentleman He checked by degrees the speed of his horse and went on his head drooping as if in deep thought Soon as the road turned the Chateau de la Valliere appeared in view then a quarter of a mile beyond a white house encircled in sycamores was visible at the farther end of a group of trees which spring had powdered with a snow of flowers On beholding this house D Artagnan calm as he was in general felt an unusual disturbance within his heart so powerful during the whole course of life are the recollections of youth He proceeded nevertheless and came opposite to an iron gate ornamented in the taste of the period Through the gate was seen kitchen gardens carefully attended to a spacious courtyard in which neighed several horses held by valets in various liveries and a carriage drawn by two horses of the country We are mistaken said D Artagnan This cannot be the establishment of Athos Good heavens suppose he is dead and that this property now belongs to some one who bears his name Alight Planchet and inquire for I confess that I have scarcely courage so to do Planchet alighted Thou must add said D Artagnan that a gentleman who is passing by wishes to have the honor of paying his respects to the Comte de la Fere and if thou art satisfied with what thou hearest then mention my name Planchet leading his horse by the bridle drew near to the gate and rang the bell and immediately a servant man with white hair and of erect stature notwithstanding his age presented himself Does Monsieur le Comte de la Fere live here asked Planchet Yes monsieur it is here he lives the servant replied to Planchet who was not in livery A nobleman retired from service is he not Yes And who had a lackey named Grimaud persisted Planchet who had prudently considered that he couldn t have too much information Monsieur Grimaud is absent from the chateau for the time being said the servitor who little used as he was to such inquiries began to examine Planchet from head to foot Then cried Planchet joyously I see well that it is the same Comte de la Fere whom we seek Be good enough to open to me for I wish to announce to monsieur le comte that my master one of his friends is here and wishes to greet him Why didn t you say so said the servitor opening the gate But where is your master He is following me The servitor opened the gate and walked before Planchet who made a sign to D Artagnan The latter his heart palpitating more than ever entered the courtyard without dismounting Whilst Planchet was standing on the steps before the house he heard a voice say Well where is this gentleman and why do they not bring him here This voice the sound of which reached D Artagnan reawakened in his heart a thousand sentiments a thousand recollections that he had forgotten He vaulted hastily from his horse whilst Planchet with a smile on his lips advanced toward the master of the house But I know you my lad said Athos appearing on the threshold Oh yes monsieur le comte you know me and I know you I am Planchet Planchet whom you know well But the honest servant could say no more so much was he overcome by this unexpected interview What Planchet is Monsieur d Artagnan here Here I am my friend dear Athos cried D Artagnan in a faltering voice and almost staggering from agitation At these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful countenance and calm features of Athos He rushed toward D Artagnan with eyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his arms D Artagnan equally moved pressed him also closely to him whilst tears stood in his eyes Athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawing room where there were several people Every one arose I present to you he said Monsieur le Chevalier D Artagnan lieutenant of his majesty s musketeers a devoted friend and one of the most excellent brave gentlemen that I have ever known D Artagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own way and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at Athos Strange Athos was scarcely aged at all His fine eyes no longer surrounded by that dark line which nights of dissipation pencil too infallibly seemed larger more liquid than ever His face a little elongated had gained in calm dignity what it had lost in feverish excitement His hand always wonderfully beautiful and strong was set off by a ruffle of lace like certain hands by Titian and Vandyck He was less stiff than formerly His long dark hair softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils fell elegantly over his shoulders in wavy curls his voice was still youthful as if belonging to a Hercules of twenty five and his magnificent teeth which he had preserved white and sound gave an indescribable charm to his smile Meanwhile the guests seeing that the two friends were longing to be alone prepared to depart when a noise of dogs barking resounded through the courtyard and many persons said at the same moment Ah tis Raoul who is come home Athos as the name of Raoul was pronounced looked inquisitively at D Artagnan in order to see if any curiosity was painted on his face But D Artagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when a fine young man of fifteen years of age dressed simply but in perfect taste entered the room raising as he came his hat adorned with a long plume of scarlet feathers Nevertheless D Artagnan was struck by the appearance of this new personage It seemed to explain to him the change in Athos a resemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this regenerated existence He remained listening and gazing Here you are home again Raoul said the comte Yes sir replied the youth with deep respect and I have performed the commission that you gave me But what s the matter Raoul said Athos very anxiously You are pale and agitated Sir replied the young man it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little neighbor To Mademoiselle de la Valliere asked Athos quickly What is it cried many persons present She was walking with her nurse Marceline in the place where the woodmen cut the wood when passing on horseback I stopped She saw me also and in trying to jump from the end of a pile of wood on which she had mounted the poor child fell and was not able to rise again I fear that she has badly sprained her ankle Oh heavens cried Athos And her mother Madame de Saint Remy have they yet told her of it No sir Madame de Saint Remy is at Blois with the Duchess of Orleans I am afraid that what was first done was unskillful if not worse than useless I am come sir to ask your advice Send directly to Blois Raoul or rather take horse and ride immediately yourself Raoul bowed But where is Louise asked the comte I have brought her here sir and I have deposited her in charge of Charlotte who till better advice comes has bathed the foot in cold well water The guests now all took leave of Athos excepting the old Duc de Barbe who as an old friend of the family of La Valliere went to see little Louise and offered to take her to Blois in his carriage You are right sir said Athos She will be the sooner with her mother As for you Raoul I am sure it is your fault some giddiness or folly No sir I assure you muttered Raoul it is not Oh no no I declare it is not cried the young girl while Raoul turned pale at the idea of his being perhaps the cause of her disaster Nevertheless Raoul you must go to Blois and you must make your excuses and mine to Madame de Saint Remy The youth looked pleased He again took in his strong arms the little girl whose pretty golden head and smiling face rested on his shoulder and placed her gently in the carriage then jumping on his horse with the elegance of a first rate esquire after bowing to Athos and D Artagnan he went off close by the door of the carriage on somebody inside of which his eyes were riveted fourteen The Castle of Bragelonne Whilst this scene was going on D Artagnan remained with open mouth and a confused gaze Everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with wonder Athos who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts took his arm and led him into the garden Whilst supper is being prepared he said smiling you will not my friend be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared up True monsieur le comte replied D Artagnan who felt that by degrees Athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over him 
274_121392_000065_000000	train-clean-360	Athos smiled 
none	none	First and foremost dear D Artagnan we have no title such as count here When I call you chevalier it is in presenting you to my guests that they may know who you are But to you D Artagnan I am I hope still dear Athos your comrade your friend Do you intend to stand on ceremony because you are less attached to me than you were Oh God forbid Then let us be as we used to be let us be open with each other You are surprised at what you see here Extremely But above all things I am a marvel to you I confess it I am still young am I not Should you not have known me again in spite of my eight and forty years of age On the contrary I do not find you the same person at all I understand cried Athos with a gentle blush Everything D Artagnan even folly has its limit Then your means it appears are improved you have a capital house your own I presume You have a park and horses servants Athos smiled Yes I inherited this little property when I quitted the army as I told you The park is twenty acres twenty comprising kitchen gardens and a common I have two horses I do not count my servant s bobtailed nag My sporting dogs consist of two pointers two harriers and two setters But then all this extravagance is not for myself added Athos laughing Yes I see for the young man Raoul said D Artagnan You guess aright my friend this youth is an orphan deserted by his mother who left him in the house of a poor country priest I have brought him up It is Raoul who has worked in me the change you see I was dried up like a miserable tree isolated attached to nothing on earth it was only a deep affection that could make me take root again and drag me back to life This child has caused me to recover what I had lost I had no longer any wish to live for myself I have lived for him I have corrected the vices that I had I have assumed the virtues that I had not Precept something but example more I may be mistaken but I believe that Raoul will be as accomplished a gentleman as our degenerate age could display The remembrance of Milady recurred to D Artagnan And you are happy he said to his friend As happy as it is allowed to one of God s creatures to be on this earth but say out all you think D Artagnan for you have not yet done so You are too bad Athos one can hide nothing from you answered D Artagnan I wished to ask you if you ever feel any emotions of terror resembling Remorse I finish your phrase Yes and no I do not feel remorse because that woman I profoundly hold deserved her punishment Had she one redeeming trait I doubt it I do not feel remorse because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of destruction But I do not mean my friend that we were right in what we did Perhaps all blood demands some expiation Hers had been accomplished it remains possibly for us to accomplish ours I have sometimes thought as you do Athos She had a son that unhappy woman Yes Have you ever heard of him Never He must be about twenty three years of age said Athos in a low tone I often think of that young man D Artagnan Strange for I had forgotten him said the lieutenant Athos smiled the smile was melancholy And Lord de Winter do you know anything about him I know that he is in high favor with Charles I The fortunes of that monarch now are at low water He shed the blood of Strafford that confirms what I said just now blood will have blood And the queen What queen Madame Henrietta of England daughter of Henry IV She is at the Louvre as you know Yes and I hear in bitter poverty Her daughter during the severest cold was obliged for want of fire to remain in bed Do you grasp that said Athos shrugging his shoulders the daughter of Henry IV shivering for want of a fagot Why did she not ask from any one of us a home instead of from Mazarin She should have wanted nothing Have you ever seen the queen of England inquired D Artagnan No but my mother as a child saw her Did I ever tell you that my mother was lady of honor to Marie de Medici Never You know Athos you never spoke much of such matters Ah mon Dieu yes you are right Athos replied but then there must be some occasion for speaking Porthos wouldn t have waited for it so patiently said D Artagnan with a smile Every one according to his nature my dear D Artagnan Porthos in spite of a touch of vanity has many excellent qualities Have you seen him I left him five days ago said D Artagnan and he portrayed with Gascon wit and sprightliness the magnificence of Porthos in his Chateau of Pierrefonds nor did he neglect to launch a few arrows of wit at the excellent Monsieur Mouston I sometimes wonder replied Athos smiling at that gayety which recalled the good old days that we could form an association of men who would be after twenty years of separation still so closely bound together Friendship throws out deep roots in honest hearts D Artagnan Believe me it is only the evil minded who deny friendship they cannot understand it And Aramis I have seen him also said D Artagnan but he seemed to me cold Ah you have seen Aramis said Athos turning on D Artagnan a searching look Why it is a veritable pilgrimage my dear friend that you are making to the Temple of Friendship as the poets would say Why yes replied D Artagnan with embarrassment Aramis you know continued Athos is naturally cold and then he is always involved in intrigues with women I believe he is at this moment in a very complicated one said D Artagnan Athos made no reply He is not curious thought D Artagnan Athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of conversation You see said he calling D Artagnan s attention to the fact that they had come back to the chateau after an hour s walk we have made a tour of my domains All is charming and everything savors of nobility replied D Artagnan At this instant they heard the sound of horses feet Tis Raoul who has come back said Athos and we can now hear how the poor child is In fact the young man appeared at the gate covered with dust entered the courtyard leaped from his horse which he consigned to the charge of a groom and then went to greet the count and D Artagnan Monsieur said Athos placing his hand on D Artagnan s shoulder monsieur is the Chevalier D Artagnan of whom you have often heard me speak Raoul Monsieur said the young man saluting again and more profoundly monsieur le comte has pronounced your name before me as an example whenever he wished to speak of an intrepid and generous gentleman That little compliment could not fail to move D Artagnan He extended a hand to Raoul and said My young friend all the praises that are given me should be passed on to the count here for he has educated me in everything and it is not his fault that his pupil profited so little from his instructions But he will make it up in you I am sure I like your manner Raoul and your politeness has touched me Athos was more delighted than can be told He looked at D Artagnan with an expression of gratitude and then bestowed on Raoul one of those strange smiles of which children are so proud when they receive them Now said D Artagnan to himself noticing that silent play of countenance I am sure of it I hope the accident has been of no consequence They don t yet know sir on account of the swelling but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been injured At this moment a little boy half peasant half foot boy came to announce supper Athos led his guest into a dining room of moderate size the windows of which opened on one side on a garden on the other on a hot house full of magnificent flowers D Artagnan glanced at the dinner service The plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the family D Artagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of silver That workmanship is divine he exclaimed Yes a chef d oeuvre of the great Florentine sculptor Benvenuto Cellini replied Athos What battle does it represent That of Marignan just at the point where one of my forefathers is offering his sword to Francis I who has broken his It was on that occasion that my ancestor Enguerrand de la Fere was made a knight of the Order of saint Michael besides which the king fifteen years afterward gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen formerly in my house also a lovely specimen of workmanship Men were giants in those times said Athos now we are pigmies in comparison Let us sit down to supper Call Charles he added addressing the boy who waited My good Charles I particularly recommend to your care Planchet the laquais of Monsieur D Artagnan He likes good wine now you have the key of the cellar He has slept a long time on a hard bed so he won t object to a soft one take every care of him I beg of you Charles bowed and retired You think of everything said D Artagnan and I thank you for Planchet my dear Athos Raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to be quite sure that it was he whom the lieutenant thus addressed That name sounds strange to you said Athos smiling it was my nom de guerre when Monsieur D Artagnan two other gallant friends and myself performed some feats of arms at the siege of La Rochelle under the deceased cardinal and Monsieur de Bassompierre My friend is still so kind as to address me by that old and well beloved appellation which makes my heart glad when I hear it Tis an illustrious name said the lieutenant and had one day triumphal honors paid to it What do you mean sir inquired Raoul You have not forgotten saint Gervais Athos and the napkin which was converted into a banner and he then related to Raoul the story of the bastion and Raoul fancied he was listening to one of those deeds of arms belonging to days of chivalry so gloriously recounted by Tasso and Ariosto D Artagnan does not tell you Raoul said Athos in his turn that he was reckoned one of the finest swordsmen of his time a knuckle of iron a wrist of steel a sure eye and a glance of fire that s what his adversary met with He was eighteen only three years older than you are Raoul when I saw him set to work pitted against tried men And did Monsieur D Artagnan come off the conqueror asked the young man with glistening eye I killed one man if I recollect rightly replied D Artagnan with a look of inquiry directed to Athos another I disarmed or wounded I don t remember which Wounded said Athos it was a phenomenon of skill The young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into the night but Athos pointed out to him that his guest must need repose D Artagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued but Athos insisted on his retiring to his chamber conducted thither by Raoul fifteen Athos as a Diplomatist 
1485-121385-0000	train-other-500	D Artagnan retired to bed not to sleep but to think over all he had heard that evening
none	none	 Being naturally goodhearted and having had once a liking for Athos 
1485-121385-0001	train-other-500	which had grown into a sincere friendship he was delighted at thus meeting a man full of intelligence and moral strength instead of a drunkard
none	none	 He admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of Athos over himself devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition 
1485-121385-0002	train-other-500	he was delighted also that the high qualities of Athos appeared to promise favorably for his mission
none	none	 Nevertheless it seemed to him that Athos was not in all respects sincere and frank 
1485-121385-0003	train-other-500	Who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him
none	none	 What could explain Athos s having re entered the world and the extreme sobriety he had observed at table The absence of Grimaud whose name had never once been uttered by Athos 
1485-121385-0004	train-other-500	gave D Artagnan uneasiness It was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend
none	none	 or that Athos was bound by some invisible chain 
1485-121385-0005	train-other-500	or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenant s visit He could not help thinking of M Rochefort
none	none	 whom he had seen in Notre Dame could De Rochefort have forestalled him with Athos 
1485-121385-0006	train-other-500	Again the moderate fortune which Athos possessed concealed as it was so skillfully seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a latent ambition which might be easily aroused
1485-121385-0007	train-other-500	The clear and vigorous intellect of Athos would render him more open to conviction than a less able man would be He would enter into the minister s schemes with the more ardor because his natural activity would be doubled by necessity
1485-121385-0008	train-other-500	Resolved to seek an explanation on all these points on the following day D Artagnan in spite of his fatigue prepared for an attack and determined that it should take place after breakfast He determined to cultivate the good will of the youth Raoul
1485-121385-0009	train-other-500	and either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting to extract from his simplicity some information
none	none	 which would connect the Athos of old times with the Athos of the present 
1485-121385-0010	train-other-500	But D Artagnan at the same time being a man of extreme caution was quite aware what injury he should do himself if by any indiscretion or awkwardness he should betray has manoeuvering to the experienced eye of Athos
1485-121385-0011	train-other-500	Besides to tell truth whilst D Artagnan was quite disposed to adopt a subtle course against the cunning of Aramis or the vanity of Porthos he was ashamed to equivocate with Athos
none	none	 true hearted open Athos It seemed to him that if Porthos and Aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy 
1485-121385-0012	train-other-500	they would like him all the better for it
none	none	 but that Athos on the contrary would despise him 
1485-121385-0013	train-other-500	Ah why is not Grimaud the taciturn Grimaud here thought D Artagnan there are so many things his silence would have told me with Grimaud silence was another form of eloquence
1485-121385-0014	train-other-500	There reigned a perfect stillness in the house D Artagnan had heard the door shut and the shutters barred the dogs became in their turn silent At last a nightingale lost in a thicket of shrubs in the midst of its most melodious cadences
1485-121385-0015	train-other-500	had fluted low and lower into stillness and fallen asleep Not a sound was heard in the castle except of a footstep up and down in the chamber above
none	none	 as he supposed the bedroom of Athos 
1485-121385-0016	train-other-500	He is walking about and thinking thought D Artagnan but of what It is impossible to know everything else might be guessed but not that
none	none	 At length Athos went to bed apparently 
1485-121385-0017	train-other-500	for the noise ceased Silence and fatigue together overcame D Artagnan and sleep overtook him also He was not however a good sleeper Scarcely had dawn gilded his window curtains
1485-121385-0018	train-other-500	when he sprang out of bed and opened the windows Somebody he perceived was in the courtyard moving stealthily True to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know D Artagnan looked out of the window
1485-121385-0019	train-other-500	and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of Raoul The young man was opening the door of the stable He then with noiseless haste took out the horse that he had ridden on the previous evening saddled and bridled it himself
1485-121385-0020	train-other-500	and led the animal into the alley to the right of the kitchen garden opened a side door which conducted him to a bridle road shut it after him and D Artagnan saw him pass by like a dart
1485-121385-0021	train-other-500	bending as he went beneath the pendent flowery branches of maple and acacia
none	none	 The road as D Artagnan had observed was the way to Blois 
1485-121385-0022	train-other-500	So thought the Gascon here s a young blade who has already his love affair
none	none	 who doesn t at all agree with Athos in his hatred to the fair sex 
1485-121385-0023	train-other-500	He s not going to hunt for he has neither dogs nor arms he s not going on a message for he goes secretly Why does he go in secret Is he afraid of me or of his father for I am sure the count is his father
1485-121385-0024	train-other-500	By Jove I shall know about that soon
none	none	 for I shall soon speak out to Athos 
1485-121385-0025	train-other-500	Day was now advanced all the noises that had ceased the night before reawakened one after the other The bird on the branch the dog in his kennel the sheep in the field
none	none	 the boats moored in the Loire 
1485-121385-0026	train-other-500	even became alive and vocal The latter leaving the shore abandoned themselves gaily to the current The Gascon gave a last twirl to his mustache a last turn to his hair brushed from habit the brim of his hat with the sleeve of his doublet
1485-121385-0027	train-other-500	and went downstairs Scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold
none	none	 when he saw Athos bent down toward the ground as if he were looking for a crown piece in the dust 
1485-121385-0028	train-other-500	Good morning my dear host cried D Artagnan Good day to you have you slept well
none	none	 Excellently Athos 
1485-121385-0029	train-other-500	but what are you looking for You are perhaps a tulip fancier My dear friend if I am you must not laugh at me for being so In the country people alter
1485-121385-0030	train-other-500	one gets to like without knowing it all those beautiful objects that God causes to spring from the earth which are despised in cities I was looking anxiously for some iris roots I planted here close to this reservoir
1485-121385-0031	train-other-500	and which some one has trampled upon this morning These gardeners are the most careless people in the world in bringing the horse out to the water they ve allowed him to walk over the border D Artagnan began to smile
1485-121385-0032	train-other-500	Ah you think so do you And he took his friend along the alley where a number of tracks like those which had trampled down the flowerbeds were visible
none	none	 Here are the horse s hoofs again it seems Athos he said carelessly 
1485-121385-0033	train-other-500	Yes indeed the marks are recent Quite so replied the lieutenant Who went out this morning
none	none	 Athos asked uneasily 
1485-121385-0034	train-other-500	Has any horse got loose Not likely answered the Gascon these marks are regular Where is Raoul
none	none	 asked Athos 
1485-121385-0035	train-other-500	how is it that I have not seen him Hush exclaimed D Artagnan
none	none	 putting his finger on his lips and he related what he had seen watching Athos all the while Ah he s gone to Blois the poor boy 
1485-121385-0036	train-other-500	Wherefore Ah to inquire after the little La Valliere she has sprained her foot you know You think he has I am sure of it said Athos don t you see that Raoul is in love
none	none	 Indeed 
1485-121385-0037	train-other-500	with whom with a child seven years old Dear friend at Raoul s age the heart is so expansive that it must encircle one object or another fancied or real Well his love is half real half fanciful
1485-121385-0038	train-other-500	She is the prettiest little creature in the world with flaxen hair blue eyes at once saucy and languishing
none	none	 But what say you to Raoul s fancy 
1485-121385-0039	train-other-500	Nothing I laugh at Raoul but this first desire of the heart is imperious I remember just at his age how deep in love I was with a Grecian statue which our good king
none	none	 then Henry IV gave my father insomuch that I was mad with grief when they told me that the story of Pygmalion 
1485-121385-0040	train-other-500	was nothing but a fable It is mere want of occupation You do not make Raoul work so he takes his own way of employing himself Exactly therefore I think of sending him away from here You will be wise to do so
1485-121385-0041	train-other-500	No doubt of it but it will break his heart So long as three or four years ago he used to adorn and adore his little idol whom he will some day fall in love with in right earnest if he remains here The parents of little La Valliere
1485-121385-0042	train-other-500	have for a long time perceived and been amused at it now they begin to look concerned Nonsense However Raoul must be diverted from this fancy Send him away or you will never make a man of him
1485-121385-0043	train-other-500	I think I shall send him to Paris So thought D Artagnan and it seemed to him that the moment for attack had arrived Suppose he said we roughly chalk out a career for this young man I wish to consult you about some thing
1485-121385-0044	train-other-500	Do so Do you think it is time for us to enter the service But are you not still in the service you D Artagnan I mean active service Our former life has it still no attractions for you
1485-121385-0045	train-other-500	would you not be happy to begin anew in my society and in that of Porthos the exploits of our youth Do you propose to me to do so D Artagnan Decidedly and honestly On whose side
none	none	 asked Athos fixing his clear benevolent glance on the countenance of the Gascon Ah devil take it you speak in earnest 
1485-121385-0046	train-other-500	And must have a definite answer Listen D Artagnan There is but one person or rather one cause to whom a man like me can be useful that of the king Exactly answered the musketeer
1485-121385-0047	train-other-500	Yes but let us understand each other
none	none	 returned Athos seriously 
1485-121385-0048	train-other-500	If by the cause of the king you mean that of Monsieur de Mazarin we do not understand each other I don t say exactly answered the Gascon confused Come D Artagnan don t let us play a sidelong game
1485-121385-0049	train-other-500	your hesitation your evasion tells me at once on whose side you are for that party no one dares openly to recruit and when people recruit for it it is with averted eyes and humble voice Ah
none	none	 my dear Athos 
1485-121385-0050	train-other-500	You know that I am not alluding to you you are the pearl of brave bold men I speak of that spiteful and intriguing Italian of the pedant who has tried to put on his own head a crown which he stole from under a pillow
1485-121385-0051	train-other-500	of the scoundrel who calls his party the party of the king who wants to send the princes of the blood to prison not daring to kill them as our great cardinal our cardinal did of the miser who weighs his gold pieces
1485-121385-0052	train-other-500	and keeps the clipped ones for fear though he is rich of losing them at play next morning of the impudent fellow who insults the queen as they say so much the worse for her
1485-121385-0053	train-other-500	and who is going in three months to make war upon us in order that he may retain his pensions is that the master whom you propose to me I thank you D Artagnan You are more impetuous than you were
1485-121385-0054	train-other-500	returned D Artagnan Age has warmed not chilled your blood Who informed you this was the master I propose to you Devil take it he muttered to himself don t let me betray my secrets to a man not inclined to entertain them Well then
none	none	 said Athos what are your schemes what do you propose Zounds nothing more than natural 
1485-121385-0055	train-other-500	You live on your estate happy in golden mediocrity Porthos has perhaps sixty thousand francs income Aramis has always fifty duchesses quarreling over the priest as they quarreled formerly over the musketeer but I
none	none	 what have I in the world I have worn my cuirass these twenty years 
1485-121385-0056	train-other-500	kept down in this inferior rank without going forward or backward hardly half living In fact I am dead Well when there is some idea of being resuscitated you say he s a scoundrel an impudent fellow a miser a bad master
1485-121385-0057	train-other-500	By Jove I am of your opinion but find me a better one or give me the means of living
none	none	 Athos was for a few moments thoughtful 
1485-121385-0058	train-other-500	Good D Artagnan is for Mazarin he said to himself From that moment he grew very guarded On his side D Artagnan became more cautious also You spoke to me Athos resumed of Porthos
1485-121385-0059	train-other-500	have you persuaded him to seek his fortune But he has wealth I believe already Doubtless he has But such is man we always want something more than we already have What does Porthos wish for To be a baron
none	none	 Ah true I forgot said Athos laughing 
1485-121385-0060	train-other-500	Tis true thought the Gascon where has he heard it Does he correspond with Aramis Ah if I knew that he did I should know all The conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Raoul
1485-121385-0061	train-other-500	Is our little neighbor worse asked D Artagnan seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth Ah sir replied Raoul her fall is a very serious one
1485-121385-0062	train-other-500	and without any ostensible injury the physician fears she will be lame for life This is terrible said Athos And what makes me all the more wretched sir is that I was the cause of this misfortune
1485-121385-0063	train-other-500	How so asked Athos It was to run to meet me that she leaped from that pile of wood There s only one remedy dear Raoul
1485-121385-0064	train-other-500	that is to marry her as a compensation remarked D Artagnan
none	none	 Ah sir answered Raoul 
1485-121385-0065	train-other-500	you joke about a real misfortune that is cruel indeed The good understanding between the two friends was not in the least altered by the morning s skirmish They breakfasted with a good appetite looking now and then at poor Raoul
1485-121385-0066	train-other-500	who with moist eyes and a full heart scarcely ate at all After breakfast two letters arrived for Athos who read them with profound attention whilst D Artagnan could not restrain himself from jumping up several times on seeing him read these epistles
1485-121385-0067	train-other-500	in one of which there being at the time a very strong light he perceived the fine writing of Aramis The other was in a feminine hand long and crossed Come said D Artagnan to Raoul
none	none	 seeing that Athos wished to be alone 
1485-121385-0068	train-other-500	come let us take a turn in the fencing gallery that will amuse you And they both went into a low room where there were foils gloves masks breastplates and all the accessories for a fencing match
1485-121385-0069	train-other-500	In a quarter of an hour Athos joined them and at the same moment Charles brought in a letter for D Artagnan which a messenger had just desired might be instantly delivered It was now Athos s turn to take a sly look
1485-121385-0070	train-other-500	D Artagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said shaking his head See dear friend what it is to belong to the army Faith you are indeed right not to return to it Monsieur de Treville is ill
1485-121385-0071	train-other-500	so my company can t do without me there my leave is at an end Do you return to Paris asked Athos quickly
none	none	 Egad yes but why don t you come there also Athos colored a little and answered 
1485-121385-0072	train-other-500	Should I go I shall be delighted to see you there
none	none	 Halloo Planchet 
1485-121385-0073	train-other-500	cried the Gascon from the door we must set out in ten minutes give the horses some hay Then turning to Athos he added I seem to miss something here I am really sorry to go away without having seen Grimaud Grimaud
none	none	 replied Athos 
1485-121385-0074	train-other-500	I m surprised you have never so much as asked after him I have lent him to a friend Who will understand the signs he makes returned D Artagnan I hope so The friends embraced cordially D Artagnan pressed Raoul s hand
2010_121416_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 I hope so 
none	none	The friends embraced cordially D Artagnan pressed Raoul s hand 
1485-121385-0075	train-other-500	Will you not come with me he said
none	none	 I shall pass by Blois Raoul turned toward Athos 
1485-121385-0076	train-other-500	who showed him by a secret sign that he did not wish him to go
none	none	 No monsieur replied the young man I will remain with monsieur le comte 
1485-121385-0077	train-other-500	Adieu then to both my good friends said D Artagnan may God preserve you as we used to say when we said good bye to each other in the late cardinal s time
none	none	 Athos waved his hand 
1485-121385-0078	train-other-500	Raoul bowed and D Artagnan and Planchet set out The count followed them with his eyes his hands resting on the shoulders of the youth whose height was almost equal to his own but as soon as they were out of sight he said
1485-121385-0079	train-other-500	Raoul we set out to night for Paris Eh cried the young man turning pale
none	none	 You may go and offer your adieux and mine to Madame de Saint Remy 
1485-121385-0080	train-other-500	I shall wait for you here till seven The young man bent low with an expression of sorrow and gratitude mingled and retired in order to saddle his horse As to D Artagnan scarcely on his side was he out of sight when he drew from his pocket a letter
1485-121385-0081	train-other-500	which he read over again Return immediately to Paris J M The epistle is laconic said D Artagnan and if there had not been a postscript probably I should not have understood it
1485-121385-0082	train-other-500	but happily there is a postscript And he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the abruptness of the letter
none	none	 P S Go to the king s treasurer at Blois 
1485-121385-0083	train-other-500	tell him your name and show him this letter
none	none	 you will receive two hundred pistoles Assuredly said D Artagnan I admire this piece of prose The cardinal writes better than I thought 
1485-121385-0084	train-other-500	Come Planchet let us pay a visit to the king s treasurer and then set off Toward Paris sir Toward Paris
none	none	 And they set out at as hard a canter as their horses could maintain sixteen The Duc de Beaufort The circumstances that had hastened the return of D Artagnan to Paris were as follows One evening when Mazarin according to custom went to visit the queen in passing the guard chamber he heard loud voices wishing to know on what topic the soldiers were conversing he approached with his wonted wolf like step pushed open the door and put his head close to the chink There was a dispute among the guards I tell you one of them was saying that if Coysel predicted that tis as good as true I know nothing about it but I have heard say that he s not only an astrologer but a magician Deuce take it friend if he s one of thy friends thou wilt ruin him in saying so Why Because he may be tried for it Ah absurd they don t burn sorcerers nowadays No Tis not a long time since the late cardinal burnt Urban Grandier though My friend Urban Grandier wasn t a sorcerer he was a learned man He didn t predict the future he knew the past often a more dangerous thing Mazarin nodded an assent but wishing to know what this prediction was about which they disputed he remained in the same place I don t say resumed the guard that Coysel is not a sorcerer but I say that if his prophecy gets wind it s a sure way to prevent it s coming true How so Why in this way if Coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear him on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape tis plain that the cardinal will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will not escape Good Lord said another guard who might have been thought asleep on a bench but who had lost not a syllable of the conversation do you suppose that men can escape their destiny If it is written yonder in Heaven that the Duc de Beaufort is to escape he will escape and all the precautions of the cardinal will not prevent it Mazarin started He was an Italian and therefore superstitious He walked straight into the midst of the guards who on seeing him were silent What were you saying he asked with his flattering manner that Monsieur de Beaufort had escaped were you not Oh no my lord said the incredulous soldier He s well guarded now we only said he would escape Who said so Repeat your story Saint Laurent replied the man turning to the originator of the tale My lord said the guard I have simply mentioned the prophecy I heard from a man named Coysel who believes that be he ever so closely watched and guarded the Duke of Beaufort will escape before Whitsuntide Coysel is a madman returned the cardinal No replied the soldier tenacious in his credulity he has foretold many things which have come to pass for instance that the queen would have a son that Monsieur Coligny would be killed in a duel with the Duc de Guise and finally that the coadjutor would be made cardinal Well the queen has not only one son but two then Monsieur de Coligny was killed and Yes said Mazarin but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal No my lord but he will be answered the guard Mazarin made a grimace as if he meant to say But he does not wear the cardinal s cap then he added So my friend it s your opinion that Monsieur de Beaufort will escape That s my idea my lord and if your eminence were to offer to make me at this moment governor of the castle of Vincennes I should refuse it After Whitsuntide it would be another thing There is nothing so convincing as a firm conviction It has its own effect upon the most incredulous and far from being incredulous Mazarin was superstitious He went away thoughtful and anxious and returned to his own room where he summoned Bernouin and desired him to fetch thither in the morning the special guard he had placed over Monsieur de Beaufort and to awaken him whenever he should arrive The guard had in fact touched the cardinal in the tenderest point During the whole five years in which the Duc de Beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret dread of his escape It was not possible as he knew well to confine for the whole of his life the grandson of Henry IV especially when this young prince was scarcely thirty years of age But however and whensoever he did escape what hatred he must cherish against him to whom he owed his long imprisonment who had taken him rich brave glorious beloved by women feared by men to cut off his life s best happiest years for it is not life it is merely existence in prison Meantime Mazarin redoubled his surveillance over the duke But like the miser in the fable he could not sleep for thinking of his treasure Often he awoke in the night suddenly dreaming that he had been robbed of Monsieur de Beaufort Then he inquired about him and had the vexation of hearing that the prisoner played drank sang but that whilst playing drinking singing he often stopped short to vow that Mazarin should pay dear for all the amusements he had forced him to enter into at Vincennes So much did this one idea haunt the cardinal even in his sleep that when at seven in the morning Bernouin came to arouse him his first words were Well what s the matter Has Monsieur de Beaufort escaped from Vincennes I do not think so my lord said Bernouin but you will hear about him for La Ramee is here and awaits the commands of your eminence Tell him to come in said Mazarin arranging his pillows so that he might receive the visitor sitting up in bed The officer entered a large fat man with an open physiognomy His air of perfect serenity made Mazarin uneasy Approach sir said the cardinal The officer obeyed Do you know what they are saying here No your eminence Well they say that Monsieur de Beaufort is going to escape from Vincennes if he has not done so already The officer s face expressed complete stupefaction He opened at once his little eyes and his great mouth to inhale better the joke his eminence deigned to address to him and ended by a burst of laughter so violent that his great limbs shook in hilarity as they would have done in an ague Escape my lord escape Your eminence does not then know where Monsieur de Beaufort is Yes I do sir in the donjon of Vincennes Yes sir in a room the walls of which are seven feet thick with grated windows each bar as thick as my arm Sir replied Mazarin with perseverance one may penetrate through a wall with a watch spring one may saw through an iron bar Then my lord does not know that there are eight guards about him four in his chamber four in the antechamber and that they never leave him But he leaves his room he plays at tennis at the Mall Sir those amusements are allowed but if your eminence wishes it we will discontinue the permission No no cried Mazarin fearing that should his prisoner ever leave his prison he would be the more exasperated against him if he thus retrenched his amusement He then asked with whom he played My lord either with the officers of the guard with the other prisoners or with me But does he not approach the walls while playing Your eminence doesn t know those walls they are sixty feet high and I doubt if Monsieur de Beaufort is sufficiently weary of life to risk his neck by jumping off Hum said the cardinal beginning to feel more comfortable You mean to say then my dear Monsieur la Ramee That unless Monsieur de Beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself into a little bird I will continue answerable for him Take care you assert a great deal said Mazarin Monsieur de Beaufort told the guards who took him to Vincennes that he had often thought what he should do in case he were put into prison and that he had found out forty ways of escaping My lord if among these forty there had been one good way he would have been out long ago Come come not such a fool as I fancied thought Mazarin Besides my lord must remember that Monsieur de Chavigny is governor of Vincennes continued La Ramee and that Monsieur de Chavigny is not friendly to Monsieur de Beaufort Yes but Monsieur de Chavigny is sometimes absent When he is absent I am there But when you leave him for instance Oh when I leave him I place in my stead a bold fellow who aspires to be his majesty s special guard I promise you he keeps a good watch over the prisoner During the three weeks that he has been with me I have only had to reproach him with one thing being too severe with the prisoners And who is this Cerberus A certain Monsieur Grimaud my lord And what was he before he went to Vincennes He was in the country as I was told by the person who recommended him to me And who recommended this man to you The steward of the Duc de Grammont He is not a gossip I hope Lord a mercy my lord I thought for a long time that he was dumb he answers only by signs It seems his former master accustomed him to that Well dear Monsieur la Ramee replied the cardinal let him prove a true and thankful keeper and we will shut our eyes upon his rural misdeeds and put on his back a uniform to make him respectable and in the pockets of that uniform some pistoles to drink to the king s health Mazarin was large in promises quite unlike the virtuous Monsieur Grimaud so bepraised by La Ramee for he said nothing and did much It was now nine o clock The cardinal therefore got up perfumed himself dressed and went to the queen to tell her what had detained him The queen who was scarcely less afraid of Monsieur de Beaufort than the cardinal himself and who was almost as superstitious as he was made him repeat word for word all La Ramee s praises of his deputy Then when the cardinal had ended Alas sir why have we not a Grimaud near every prince Patience replied Mazarin with his Italian smile that may happen one day but in the meantime Well in the meantime I shall still take precautions And he wrote to D Artagnan to hasten his return seventeen Duc de Beaufort amused his Leisure Hours in the Donjon of Vincennes The captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court was wholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the Palais Royal He had found himself so strictly guarded that he soon perceived the fruitlessness of any attempt at escape His vengeance therefore consisted in coining curses on the head of Mazarin he even tried to make some verses on him but soon gave up the attempt for Monsieur de Beaufort had not only not received from Heaven the gift of versifying he had the greatest difficulty in expressing himself in prose The duke was the grandson of Henry VI and Gabrielle d Estrees as good natured as brave as proud and above all as Gascon as his ancestor but less elaborately educated After having been for some time after the death of Louis XIII the favorite the confidant the first man in short at the court he had been obliged to yield his place to Mazarin and so became the second in influence and favor and eventually as he was stupid enough to be vexed at this change of position the queen had had him arrested and sent to Vincennes in charge of Guitant who made his appearance in these pages in the beginning of this history and whom we shall see again It is understood of course that when we say the queen Mazarin is meant During the five years of this seclusion which would have improved and matured the intellect of any other man M de Beaufort had he not affected to brave the cardinal despise princes and walk alone without adherents or disciples would either have regained his liberty or made partisans But these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the minister After having failed in poetry Monsieur de Beaufort tried drawing He drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original Portrait of the Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin Monsieur de Chavigny the governor of Vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath them The next day the prisoner s room was full of pictures and mottoes Monsieur de Beaufort in common with many other prisoners was bent upon doing things that were prohibited and the only resource the governor had was one day when the duke was playing at tennis to efface all these drawings consisting chiefly of profiles M de Beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinal s fat face The duke thanked Monsieur de Chavigny for having as he said cleaned his drawing paper for him he then divided the walls of his room into compartments and dedicated each of these compartments to some incident in Mazarin s life In one was depicted the Illustrious Coxcomb receiving a shower of blows from Cardinal Bentivoglio whose servant he had been another the Illustrious Mazarin acting the part of Ignatius Loyola in a tragedy of that name a third the Illustrious Mazarin stealing the portfolio of prime minister from Monsieur de Chavigny who had expected to have it a fourth the Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin refusing to give Laporte the young king s valet clean sheets and saving that it was quite enough for the king of France to have clean sheets every three months The governor of course thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive him of all the means of amusing himself in that manner To this Monsieur de Beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing himself in arms was taken from him he wished to make himself celebrated in the arts since he could not be a Bayard he would become a Raphael or a Michael Angelo Nevertheless one day when Monsieur de Beaufort was walking in the meadow his fire was put out his charcoal all removed taken away and thus his means of drawing utterly destroyed The poor duke swore fell into a rage yelled and declared that they wished to starve him to death as they had starved the Marechal Ornano and the Grand Prior of Vendome but he refused to promise that he would not make any more drawings and remained without any fire in the room all the winter His next act was to purchase a dog from one of his keepers With this animal which he called Pistache he was often shut up for hours alone superintending as every one supposed its education At last when Pistache was sufficiently well trained Monsieur de Beaufort invited the governor and officers of Vincennes to attend a representation which he was going to have in his apartment The party assembled the room was lighted with waxlights and the prisoner with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his room had traced a long white line representing a cord on the floor Pistache on a signal from his master placed himself on this line raised himself on his hind paws and holding in his front paws a wand with which clothes used to be beaten he began to dance upon the line with as many contortions as a rope dancer Having been several times up and down it he gave the wand back to his master and began without hesitation to perform the same evolutions over again The intelligent creature was received with loud applause The first part of the entertainment being concluded Pistache was desired to say what o clock it was he was shown Monsieur de Chavigny s watch it was then half past six the dog raised and dropped his paw six times the seventh he let it remain upraised Nothing could be better done a sun dial could not have shown the hour with greater precision Then the question was put to him who was the best jailer in all the prisons in France The dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself with the deepest respect at the feet of Monsieur de Chavigny who at first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud but a frown succeeded and he bit his lips with vexation Then the duke put to Pistache this difficult question who was the greatest thief in the world Pistache went again around the circle but stopped at no one and at last went to the door and began to scratch and bark See gentlemen said M de Beaufort this wonderful animal not finding here what I ask for seeks it out of doors you shall however have his answer Pistache my friend come here Is not the greatest thief in the world Monsieur the king s secretary Le Camus who came to Paris with twenty francs in his pocket and who now possesses ten millions The dog shook his head Then is it not resumed the duke the Superintendent Emery who gave his son when he was married three hundred thousand francs and a house compared to which the Tuileries are a heap of ruins and the Louvre a paltry building The dog again shook his head as if to say no Then said the prisoner let s think who it can be Can it be can it possibly be the Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin de Piscina hey Pistache made violent signs that it was by raising and lowering his head eight or ten times successively Gentlemen you see said the duke to those present who dared not even smile that it is the Illustrious Coxcomb who is the greatest thief in the world at least according to Pistache Let us go on to another of his exercises Gentlemen there was a profound silence in the room when the duke again addressed them do you not remember that the Duc de Guise taught all the dogs in Paris to jump for Mademoiselle de Pons whom he styled the fairest of the fair Pistache is going to show you how superior he is to all other dogs Monsieur de Chavigny be so good as to lend me your cane Monsieur de Chavigny handed his cane to Monsieur de Beaufort Monsieur de Beaufort placed it horizontally at the height of one foot Now Pistache my good dog jump the height of this cane for Madame de Montbazon But interposed Monsieur de Chavigny it seems to me that Pistache is only doing what other dogs have done when they jumped for Mademoiselle de Pons Stop said the duke Pistache jump for the queen And he raised his cane six inches higher The dog sprang and in spite of the height jumped lightly over it And now said the duke raising it still six inches higher jump for the king The dog obeyed and jumped quickly over the cane Now then said the duke and as he spoke lowered the cane almost level with the ground Pistache my friend jump for the Illustrious Coxcomb Mazarin de Piscina The dog turned his back to the cane What asked the duke what do you mean and he gave him the cane again first making a semicircle from the head to the tail of Pistache Jump then Monsieur Pistache But Pistache as at first turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the cane Monsieur de Beaufort made the experiment a third time but by this time Pistache s patience was exhausted he threw himself furiously upon the cane wrested it from the hands of the prince and broke it with his teeth Monsieur de Beaufort took the pieces out of his mouth and presented them with great formality to Monsieur de Chavigny saying that for that evening the entertainment was ended but in three months it should be repeated when Pistache would have learned a few new tricks Three days afterward Pistache was found dead poisoned Then the duke said openly that his dog had been killed by a drug with which they meant to poison him and one day after dinner he went to bed calling out that he had pains in his stomach and that Mazarin had poisoned him This fresh impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed him greatly The donjon of Vincennes was considered very unhealthy and Madame de Rambouillet had said that the room in which the Marechal Ornano and the Grand Prior de Vendome had died was worth its weight in arsenic a bon mot which had great success So it was ordered the prisoner was henceforth to eat nothing that had not previously been tasted and La Ramee was in consequence placed near him as taster Every kind of revenge was practiced upon the duke by the governor in return for the insults of the innocent Pistache De Chavigny who according to report was a son of Richelieu s and had been a creature of the late cardinal s understood tyranny He took from the duke all the steel knives and silver forks and replaced them with silver knives and wooden forks pretending that as he had been informed that the duke was to pass all his life at Vincennes he was afraid of his prisoner attempting suicide A fortnight afterward the duke going to the tennis court found two rows of trees about the size of his little finger planted by the roadside he asked what they were for and was told that they were to shade him from the sun on some future day One morning the gardener went to him and told him as if to please him that he was going to plant a bed of asparagus for his especial use Now since as every one knows asparagus takes four years in coming to perfection this civility infuriated Monsieur de Beaufort At last his patience was exhausted He assembled his keepers and notwithstanding his well known difficulty of utterance addressed them as follows Gentlemen will you permit a grandson of Henry IV to be overwhelmed with insults and ignominy Odds fish as my grandfather used to say I once reigned in Paris do you know that I had the king and Monsieur the whole of one day in my care The queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man in the kingdom Gentlemen and citizens set me free I shall go to the Louvre and strangle Mazarin You shall be my body guard I will make you all captains with good pensions Odds fish On march forward But eloquent as he might be the eloquence of the grandson of Henry IV did not touch those hearts of stone not one man stirred so Monsieur de Beaufort was obliged to be satisfied with calling them all kinds of rascals underneath the sun Sometimes when Monsieur de Chavigny paid him a visit the duke used to ask him what he should think if he saw an army of Parisians all fully armed appear at Vincennes to deliver him from prison My lord answered De Chavigny with a low bow I have on the ramparts twenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates thirty thousand guns I should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was unexploded Yes but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the donjon the donjon being taken I should be obliged to let them hang you at which I should be most unhappy certainly And in his turn the duke bowed low to Monsieur de Chavigny For myself on the other hand my lord returned the governor when the first rebel should pass the threshold of my postern doors I should be obliged to kill you with my own hand since you were confided peculiarly to my care and as I am obliged to give you up dead or alive And once more he bowed low before his highness These bitter sweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always finished thus Monsieur de Chavigny turning toward the door used to call out Halloo La Ramee La Ramee came into the room La Ramee I recommend Monsieur le Duc to you particularly treat him as a man of his rank and family ought to be treated that is never leave him alone an instant La Ramee became therefore the duke s dinner guest by compulsion an eternal keeper the shadow of his person but La Ramee gay frank convivial fond of play a great hand at tennis had one defect in the duke s eyes his incorruptibility Now although La Ramee appreciated as of a certain value the honor of being shut up with a prisoner of so great importance still the pleasure of living in intimacy with the grandson of Henry IV hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his family One may be a jailer or a keeper and at the same time a good father and husband La Ramee adored his wife and children whom now he could only catch a glimpse of from the top of the wall when in order to please him they used to walk on the opposite side of the moat Twas too brief an enjoyment and La Ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as the cause of health of which it was perhaps rather the result would not long survive such a mode of life He accepted therefore with delight an offer made to him by his friend the steward of the Duc de Grammont to give him a substitute he also spoke of it to Monsieur de Chavigny who promised that he would not oppose it in any way that is if he approved of the person proposed We consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of Grimaud if as we hope our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part of this work they must have preserved a clear idea of that estimable individual who is wholly unchanged except that he is twenty years older an advance in life that has made him only more silent although since the change that had been working in himself Athos had given Grimaud permission to speak But Grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence and a habit of fifteen or twenty years duration becomes second nature eighteen Grimaud begins his Functions Grimaud thereupon presented himself with his smooth exterior at the donjon of Vincennes Now Monsieur de Chavigny piqued himself on his infallible penetration for that which almost proved that he was the son of Richelieu was his everlasting pretension he examined attentively the countenance of the applicant for place and fancied that the contracted eyebrows thin lips hooked nose and prominent cheek bones of Grimaud were favorable signs He addressed about twelve words to him Grimaud answered in four Here s a promising fellow and it is I who have found out his merits said Monsieur de Chavigny Go he added and make yourself agreeable to Monsieur la Ramee and tell him that you suit me in all respects Grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a deputy So after a thousand questions which met with only a word in reply La Ramee fascinated by this sobriety in speech rubbed his hands and engaged Grimaud My orders asked Grimaud They are these never to leave the prisoner alone to keep away from him every pointed or cutting instrument and to prevent his conversing any length of time with the keepers Those are all asked Grimaud All now replied La Ramee Good answered Grimaud and he went right to the prisoner The duke was in the act of combing his beard which he had allowed to grow as well as his hair in order to reproach Mazarin with his wretched appearance and condition But having some days previously seen from the top of the donjon Madame de Montbazon pass in her carriage and still cherishing an affection for that beautiful woman he did not wish to be to her what he wished to be to Mazarin and in the hope of seeing her again had asked for a leaden comb which was allowed him The comb was to be a leaden one because his beard like that of most fair people was rather red he therefore dyed it thus whilst combing it As Grimaud entered he saw this comb on the tea table he took it up and as he took it he made a low bow The duke looked at this strange figure with surprise The figure put the comb in its pocket Ho hey what s that cried the duke Who is this creature Grimaud did not answer but bowed a second time Art thou dumb cried the duke Grimaud made a sign that he was not What art thou then Answer I command thee said the duke A keeper replied Grimaud A keeper reiterated the duke there was nothing wanting in my collection except this gallows bird Halloo La Ramee some one La Ramee ran in haste to obey the call Who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket asked the duke One of your guards my prince a man of talent and merit whom you will like as I and Monsieur de Chavigny do I am sure Why does he take my comb Why do you take my lord s comb asked La Ramee Grimaud drew the comb from his pocket and passing his fingers over the largest teeth pronounced this one word Pointed True said La Ramee What does the animal say asked the duke That the king has forbidden your lordship to have any pointed instrument Are you mad La Ramee You yourself gave me this comb I was very wrong my lord for in giving it to you I acted in opposition to my orders The duke looked furiously at Grimaud I perceive that this creature will be my particular aversion he muttered Grimaud nevertheless was resolved for certain reasons not at once to come to a full rupture with the prisoner he wanted to inspire not a sudden repugnance but a good sound steady hatred he retired therefore and gave place to four guards who having breakfasted could attend on the prisoner A fresh practical joke now occurred to the duke He had asked for crawfish for his breakfast on the following morning he intended to pass the day in making a small gallows and hang one of the finest of these fish in the middle of his room the red color evidently conveying an allusion to the cardinal so that he might have the pleasure of hanging Mazarin in effigy without being accused of having hung anything more significant than a crawfish The day was employed in preparations for the execution Every one grows childish in prison but the character of Monsieur de Beaufort was particularly disposed to become so In the course of his morning s walk he collected two or three small branches from a tree and found a small piece of broken glass a discovery that quite delighted him When he came home he formed his handkerchief into a loop Nothing of all this escaped Grimaud but La Ramee looked on with the curiosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea concerning a new toy for his children The guards looked on it with indifference When everything was ready the gallows hung in the middle of the room the loop made and when the duke had cast a glance upon the plate of crawfish in order to select the finest specimen among them he looked around for his piece of glass it had disappeared Who has taken my piece of glass asked the duke frowning Grimaud made a sign to denote that he had done so What thou again Why didst thou take it Yes why asked La Ramee Grimaud who held the piece of glass in his hand said Sharp True my lord exclaimed La Ramee Ah deuce take it we have a precious fellow here Monsieur Grimaud said the duke for your sake I beg of you never come within the reach of my fist Hush hush cried La Ramee give me your gibbet my lord I will shape it out for you with my knife And he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as possible That s it said the duke now make me a little hole in the floor whilst I go and fetch the culprit La Ramee knelt down and made a hole in the floor meanwhile the duke hung the crawfish up by a thread Then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room bursting with laughter La Ramee laughed also and the guards laughed in chorus Grimaud however did not even smile He approached La Ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread Cardinal he said Hung by order of his Highness the Duc de Beaufort cried the prisoner laughing violently and by Master Jacques Chrysostom La Ramee the king s commissioner La Ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet which he broke at once and threw the pieces out of the window He was going to throw the crawfish out also when Grimaud snatched it from his hands Good to eat he said and put it in his pocket This scene so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave Grimaud for his part in it but on reflection he hated him more and more being convinced he had some evil motive for his conduct But the story of the crab made a great noise through the interior of the donjon and even outside Monsieur de Chavigny who at heart detested the cardinal took pains to tell the story to two or three friends who put it into immediate circulation The prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very good countenance and he favored this man the more as Grimaud became the more and more odious to him One morning he took this man on one side and had succeeded in speaking to him when Grimaud entered and seeing what was going on approached the duke respectfully but took the guard by the arm Go away he said The guard obeyed You are insupportable cried the duke I shall beat you Grimaud bowed I will break every bone in your body cried the duke Grimaud bowed but stepped back mister Spy cried the duke more and more enraged I will strangle you with my own hands And he extended his hands toward Grimaud who merely thrust the guard out and shut the door behind him At the same time he felt the duke s arms on his shoulders like two iron claws but instead either of calling out or defending himself he placed his forefinger on his lips and said in a low tone Hush smiling as he uttered the word A gesture a smile and a word from Grimaud all at once were so unusual that his highness stopped short astounded Grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal and presented it to the duke without a word The duke more and more bewildered let Grimaud loose and took the note From Madame de Montbazon he cried Grimaud nodded assent The duke tore open the note passed his hands over his eyes for he was dazzled and confused and read My Dear Duke You may entirely confide in the brave lad who will give you this note he has consented to enter the service of your keeper and to shut himself up at Vincennes with you in order to prepare and assist your escape which we are contriving The moment of your deliverance is at hand have patience and courage and remember that in spite of time and absence all your friends continue to cherish for you the sentiments they have so long professed and truly entertained Yours wholly and most affectionately Marie de Montbazon P S I sign my full name for I should be vain if I could suppose that after five years of absence you would remember my initials The poor duke became perfectly giddy What for five years he had been wanting a faithful servant a friend a helping hand seemed to have fallen from Heaven just when he expected it the least Oh dearest Marie she thinks of me then after five years of separation Heavens there is constancy Then turning to Grimaud he said And thou my brave fellow thou consentest thus to aid me Grimaud signified his assent And you have come here with that purpose Grimaud repeated the sign And I was ready to strangle you cried the duke Grimaud smiled Wait then said the duke fumbling in his pocket Wait he continued renewing his fruitless search it shall not be said that such devotion to a grandson of Henry IV went without recompense The duke s endeavors evinced the best intention in the world but one of the precautions taken at Vincennes was that of allowing prisoners to keep no money Whereupon Grimaud observing the duke s disappointment drew from his pocket a purse filled with gold and handed it to him Here is what you are looking for he said The duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into Grimaud s hands but Grimaud shook his head Thank you monseigneur he said drawing back I am paid The duke went from one surprise to another He held out his hand Grimaud drew near and kissed it respectfully The grand manner of Athos had left its mark on Grimaud What shall we do and when and how proceed It is now eleven answered Grimaud Let my lord at two o clock ask leave to make up a game at tennis with La Ramee and let him send two or three balls over the ramparts And then Your highness will approach the walls and call out to a man who works in the moat to send them back again I understand said the duke Grimaud made a sign that he was going away Ah cried the duke will you not accept any money from me I wish my lord would make me one promise What speak Tis this when we escape together that I shall go everywhere and be always first for if my lord should be overtaken and caught there s every chance of his being brought back to prison whereas if I am caught the least that can befall me is to be hung True on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost suggest Now resumed Grimaud I ve only one thing more to ask that your highness will continue to detest me I ll try said the duke At this moment La Ramee after the interview we have described with the cardinal entered the room The duke had thrown himself as he was wont to do in moments of dullness and vexation on his bed La Ramee cast an inquiring look around him and observing the same signs of antipathy between the prisoner and his guardian he smiled in token of his inward satisfaction Then turning to Grimaud Very good my friend very good You have been spoken of in a promising quarter and you will soon I hope have news that will be agreeable to you Grimaud saluted in his politest manner and withdrew as was his custom on the entrance of his superior Well my lord said La Ramee with his rude laugh you still set yourself against this poor fellow So tis you La Ramee in faith tis time you came back again I threw myself on the bed and turned my nose to the wall that I mightn t break my promise and strangle Grimaud I doubt however said La Ramee in sprightly allusion to the silence of his subordinate if he has said anything disagreeable to your highness Pardieu you are right a mute from the East I swear it was time for you to come back La Ramee and I was eager to see you again Monseigneur is too good said La Ramee flattered by the compliment Yes continued the duke really I feel bored today beyond the power of description Then let us have a match in the tennis court exclaimed La Ramee If you wish it I am at your service my lord I protest my dear La Ramee said the duke that you are a charming fellow and that I would stay forever at Vincennes to have the pleasure of your society My lord replied La Ramee I think if it depended on the cardinal your wishes would be fulfilled What do you mean Have you seen him lately He sent for me to day Really to speak to you about me Of what else do you imagine he would speak to me Really my lord you are his nightmare The duke smiled with bitterness Ah La Ramee if you would but accept my offers I would make your fortune How you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be confiscated I shall no sooner be out of prison than I shall be master of Paris Pshaw pshaw I cannot hear such things said as that this is a fine conversation with an officer of the king I see my lord I shall be obliged to fetch a second Grimaud Very well let us say no more about it So you and the cardinal have been talking about me La Ramee some day when he sends for you you must let me put on your clothes I will go in your stead I will strangle him and upon my honor if that is made a condition I will return to prison Monseigneur I see well that I must call Grimaud Well I am wrong And what did the cuistre pettifogger say about me I admit the word monseigneur because it rhymes with ministre minister What did he say to me He told me to watch you And why so why watch me asked the duke uneasily Because an astrologer had predicted that you would escape Ah an astrologer predicted that said the duke starting in spite of himself Oh mon Dieu yes those imbeciles of magicians can only imagine things to torment honest people And what did you reply to his most illustrious eminence That if the astrologer in question made almanacs I would advise him not to buy one Why not Because before you could escape you would have to be turned into a bird Unfortunately that is true Let us go and have a game at tennis La Ramee My lord I beg your highness s pardon but I must beg for half an hour s leave of absence Why Because Monseigneur Mazarin is a prouder man than his highness though not of such high birth he forgot to ask me to breakfast Well shall I send for some breakfast here No my lord I must tell you that the confectioner who lived opposite the castle Daddy Marteau as they called him Well Well he sold his business a week ago to a confectioner from Paris an invalid ordered country air for his health Well what have I to do with that Why good Lord this man your highness when he saw me stop before his shop where he has a display of things which would make your mouth water my lord asked me to get him the custom of the prisoners in the donjon I bought said he the business of my predecessor on the strength of his assurance that he supplied the castle whereas on my honor Monsieur de Chavigny though I ve been here a week has not ordered so much as a tartlet But I then replied probably Monsieur de Chavigny is afraid your pastry is not good My pastry not good Well Monsieur La Ramee you shall judge of it yourself and at once I cannot I replied it is absolutely necessary for me to return to the chateau Very well said he go and attend to your affairs since you seem to be in a hurry but come back in half an hour In half an hour Yes have you breakfasted Faith no Well here is a pate that will be ready for you with a bottle of old Burgundy So you see my lord since I am hungry I would with your highness s leave And La Ramee bent low Go then animal said the duke but remember I only allow you half an hour May I promise your custom to the successor of Father Marteau my lord Yes if he does not put mushrooms in his pies thou knowest that mushrooms from the wood of Vincennes are fatal to my family La Ramee went out but in five minutes one of the officers of the guard entered in compliance with the strict orders of the cardinal that the prisoner should never be left alone a moment But during these five minutes the duke had had time to read again the note from Madame de Montbazon which proved to the prisoner that his friends were concerting plans for his deliverance but in what way he knew not But his confidence in Grimaud whose petty persecutions he now perceived were only a blind increased and he conceived the highest opinion of his intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his guidance nineteen Pates made by the Successor of Father Marteau are described In half an hour La Ramee returned full of glee like most men who have eaten and more especially drank to their heart s content The pates were excellent the wine delicious The weather was fine and the game at tennis took place in the open air At two o clock the tennis balls began according to Grimaud s directions to take the direction of the moat much to the joy of La Ramee who marked fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat and very soon balls were wanting so many had gone over La Ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up but the duke remarked that it would be losing time and going near the rampart himself and looking over he saw a man working in one of the numerous little gardens cleared out by the peasants on the opposite side of the moat Hey friend cried the duke The man raised his head and the duke was about to utter a cry of surprise The peasant the gardener was Rochefort whom he believed to be in the Bastile Well Who s up there said the man Be so good as to collect and throw us back our balls said the duke The gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls which were picked up by La Ramee and the guard One however fell at the duke s feet and seeing that it was intended for him he put it into his pocket La Ramee was in ecstasies at having beaten a prince of the blood The duke went indoors and retired to bed where he spent indeed the greater part of every day as they had taken his books away La Ramee carried off all his clothes in order to be certain that the duke would not stir However the duke contrived to hide the ball under his bolster and as soon as the door was closed he tore off the cover of the ball with his teeth and found underneath the following letter My Lord Your friends are watching over you and the hour of your deliverance is at hand Ask day after to morrow to have a pie supplied you by the new confectioner opposite the castle and who is no other than Noirmont your former maitre d hotel Do not open the pie till you are alone I hope you will be satisfied with its contents Your highness s most devoted servant In the Bastile as elsewhere Comte de Rochefort The duke who had latterly been allowed a fire burned the letter but kept the ball and went to bed hiding the ball under his bolster La Ramee entered he smiled kindly on the prisoner for he was an excellent man and had taken a great liking for the captive prince He endeavored to cheer him up in his solitude Ah my friend cried the duke you are so good if I could but do as you do and eat pates and drink Burgundy at the house of Father Marteau s successor Tis true my lord answered La Ramee that his pates are famous and his wine magnificent In any case said the duke his cellar and kitchen might easily excel those of Monsieur de Chavigny Well my lord said La Ramee falling into the trap what is there to prevent your trying them Besides I have promised him your patronage You are right said the duke If I am to remain here permanently as Monsieur Mazarin has kindly given me to understand I must provide myself with a diversion for my old age I must turn gourmand My lord said La Ramee if you will take a bit of good advice don t put that off till you are old Good said the Duc de Beaufort to himself every man in order that he may lose his heart and soul must receive from celestial bounty one of the seven capital sins perhaps two it seems that Master La Ramee s is gluttony Let us then take advantage of it Then aloud Well my dear La Ramee the day after to morrow is a holiday Yes my lord Pentecost Will you give me a lesson the day after to morrow In what In gastronomy Willingly my lord But tete a tete Send the guards to take their meal in the canteen of Monsieur de Chavigny we ll have a supper here under your direction Hum said La Ramee The proposal was seductive but La Ramee was an old stager acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to set Monsieur de Beaufort had said that he had forty ways of getting out of prison Did this proposed breakfast cover some stratagem He reflected but he remembered that he himself would have charge of the food and the wine and therefore that no powder could be mixed with the food no drug with the wine As to getting him drunk the duke couldn t hope to do that and he laughed at the mere thought of it Then an idea came to him which harmonized everything The duke had followed with anxiety La Ramee s unspoken soliloquy reading it from point to point upon his face But presently the exempt s face suddenly brightened Well he asked that will do will it not Yes my lord on one condition What That Grimaud shall wait on us at table Nothing could be more agreeable to the duke however he had presence of mind enough to exclaim To the devil with your Grimaud He will spoil the feast I will direct him to stand behind your chair and since he doesn t speak your highness will neither see nor hear him and with a little effort can imagine him a hundred miles away Do you know my friend I find one thing very evident in all this you distrust me My lord the day after to morrow is Pentecost Well what is Pentecost to me Are you afraid that the Holy Spirit will come as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison No my lord but I have already told you what that damned magician predicted And what was it That the day of Pentecost would not pass without your highness being out of Vincennes You believe in sorcerers then you fool I I mind them no more than that and he snapped his fingers but it is my Lord Giulio who cares about them as an Italian he is superstitious The duke shrugged his shoulders Well then with well acted good humor I allow Grimaud but no one else you must manage it all Order whatever you like for supper the only thing I specify is one of those pies and tell the confectioner that I will promise him my custom if he excels this time in his pies not only now but when I leave my prison Then you think you will some day leave it said La Ramee The devil replied the prince surely at the death of Mazarin I am fifteen years younger than he is At Vincennes tis true one lives faster My lord replied La Ramee my lord Or dies sooner for it comes to the same thing La Ramee was going out He stopped however at the door for an instant Whom does your highness wish me to send to you Any one except Grimaud The officer of the guard then with his chessboard Yes Five minutes afterward the officer entered and the duke seemed to be immersed in the sublime combinations of chess A strange thing is the mind and it is wonderful what revolutions may be wrought in it by a sign a word a hope The duke had been five years in prison and now to him looking back upon them those five years which had passed so slowly seemed not so long a time as were the two days the forty eight hours which still parted him from the time fixed for his escape Besides there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thought in what way was the escape to be effected They had told him to hope for it but had not told him what was to be hidden in the mysterious pate And what friends awaited him without He had friends then after five years in prison If that were so he was indeed a highly favored prince He forgot that besides his friends of his own sex a woman strange to say had remembered him It is true that she had not perhaps been scrupulously faithful to him but she had remembered him that was something So the duke had more than enough to think about accordingly he fared at chess as he had fared at tennis he made blunder upon blunder and the officer with whom he played found him easy game But his successive defeats did service to the duke in one way they killed time for him till eight o clock in the evening then would come night and with night sleep So at least the duke believed but sleep is a capricious fairy and it is precisely when one invokes her presence that she is most likely to keep him waiting The duke waited until midnight turning on his mattress like saint Laurence on his gridiron Finally he slept But at daybreak he awoke Wild dreams had disturbed his repose He dreamed that he was endowed with wings he wished to fly away For a time these wings supported him but when he reached a certain height this new aid failed him His wings were broken and he seemed to sink into a bottomless abyss whence he awoke bathed in perspiration and nearly as much overcome as if he had really fallen He fell asleep again and another vision appeared He was in a subterranean passage by which he was to leave Vincennes Grimaud was walking before him with a lantern By degrees the passage narrowed yet the duke continued his course At last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to proceed The sides of the walls seem to close in even to press against him He made fruitless efforts to go on it was impossible Nevertheless he still saw Grimaud with his lantern in front advancing He wished to call out to him but could not utter a word Then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him These steps came on came fast He was discovered all hope of flight was gone Still the walls seemed to be closing on him they appeared to be in concert with his enemies At last he heard the voice of La Ramee La Ramee took his hand and laughed aloud He was captured again and conducted to the low and vaulted chamber in which Ornano Puylaurens and his uncle had died Their three graves were there rising above the ground and a fourth was also there yawning for its ghastly tenant The duke was obliged to make as many efforts to awake as he had done to go to sleep and La Ramee found him so pale and fatigued that he inquired whether he was ill In fact said one of the guards who had remained in the chamber and had been kept awake by a toothache brought on by the dampness of the atmosphere my lord has had a very restless night and two or three times while dreaming he called for help What is the matter with your highness asked La Ramee Tis your fault you simpleton answered the duke With your idle nonsense yesterday about escaping you worried me so that I dreamed that I was trying to escape and broke my neck in doing so La Ramee laughed Come he said tis a warning from Heaven Never commit such an imprudence as to try to escape except in your dreams And you are right my dear La Ramee said the duke wiping away the sweat that stood on his brow wide awake though he was after this I will think of nothing but eating and drinking Hush said La Ramee and one by one he sent away the guards on various pretexts Well asked the duke when they were alone Well replied La Ramee your supper is ordered Ah and what is it to be Monsieur my majordomo will there be a pie I should think so indeed almost as high as a tower You told him it was for me Yes and he said he would do his best to please your highness Good exclaimed the duke rubbing his hands Devil take it my lord what a gourmand you are growing I haven t seen you with so cheerful a face these five years The duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought but at that moment as if he had listened at the door and comprehended the urgent need of diverting La Ramee s ideas Grimaud entered and made a sign to La Ramee that he had something to say to him La Ramee drew near to Grimaud who spoke to him in a low voice The duke meanwhile recovered his self control I have already forbidden that man he said to come in here without my permission You must pardon him my lord said La Ramee for I directed him to come And why did you so direct when you know that he displeases me My lord will remember that it was agreed between us that he should wait upon us at that famous supper My lord has forgotten the supper No but I have forgotten Monsieur Grimaud My lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to be present Go on then have it your own way Come here my lad said La Ramee and hear what I have to say Grimaud approached with a very sullen expression on his face La Ramee continued My lord has done me the honor to invite me to a supper to morrow en tete a tete Grimaud made a sign which meant that he didn t see what that had to do with him Yes yes said La Ramee the matter concerns you for you will have the honor to serve us and besides however good an appetite we may have and however great our thirst there will be something left on the plates and in the bottles and that something will be yours Grimaud bowed in thanks And now said La Ramee I must ask your highness s pardon but it seems that Monsieur de Chavigny is to be away for a few days and he has sent me word that he has certain directions to give me before his departure The duke tried to exchange a glance with Grimaud but there was no glance in Grimaud s eyes Go then said the duke and return as soon as possible Does your highness wish to take revenge for the game of tennis yesterday Grimaud intimated by a scarcely perceptible nod that he should consent Yes said the duke but take care my dear La Ramee for I propose to beat you badly La Ramee went out Grimaud looked after him and when the door was closed he drew out of his pocket a pencil and a sheet of paper Write my lord he said And what Grimaud dictated All is ready for to morrow evening Keep watch from seven to nine Have two riding horses ready We shall descend by the first window in the gallery What next Sign your name my lord The duke signed Now my lord give me if you have not lost it the ball that which contained the letter The duke took it from under his pillow and gave it to Grimaud Grimaud gave a grim smile Well asked the duke Well my lord I sew up the paper in the ball and you in your game of tennis will send the ball into the ditch But will it not be lost Oh no there will be some one at hand to pick it up A gardener Grimaud nodded The same as yesterday Another nod on the part of Grimaud The Count de Rochefort Grimaud nodded the third time Come now said the duke give some particulars of the plan for our escape That is forbidden me said Grimaud until the last moment Who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch I know nothing about it my lord But at least if you don t want to see me turn crazy tell what that famous pate will contain Two poniards a knotted rope and a poire d angoisse This poire d angoisse was a famous gag in the form of a pear which being thrust into the mouth by the aid of a spring dilated so as to distend the jaws to their greatest width Yes I understand My lord observes that there will be enough to go around We shall take to ourselves the poniards and the rope replied the duke And make La Ramee eat the pear answered Grimaud My dear Grimaud thou speakest seldom but when thou dost one must do thee justice thy words are words of gold twenty One of Marie Michon s Adventures Whilst these projects were being formed by the Duc de Beaufort and Grimaud the Comte de la Fere and the Vicomte de Bragelonne were entering Paris by the Rue du Faubourg Saint Marcel They stopped at the sign of the Fox in the Rue du Vieux Colombier a tavern known for many years by Athos and asked for two bedrooms You must dress yourself Raoul said Athos I am going to present you to some one To day monsieur asked the young man In half an hour The young man bowed Perhaps not being endowed with the endurance of Athos who seemed to be made of iron he would have preferred a bath in the river Seine of which he had heard so much and afterward his bed but the Comte de la Fere had spoken and he had no thought but to obey By the way said Athos take some pains with your toilet Raoul I want you to be approved I hope sir replied the youth smiling that there s no idea of a marriage for me you know of my engagement to Louise Athos in his turn smiled also No don t be alarmed although it is to a lady that I am going to present you and I am anxious that you should love her The young man looked at the count with a certain uneasiness but at a smile from Athos he was quickly reassured How old is she inquired the Vicomte de Bragelonne My dear Raoul learn once for all that that is a question which is never asked When you can find out a woman s age by her face it is useless to ask it when you cannot do so it is indiscreet Is she beautiful Sixteen years ago she was deemed not only the prettiest but the most graceful woman in France This reply reassured the vicomte A woman who had been a reigning beauty a year before he was born could not be the subject of any scheme for him He retired to his toilet When he reappeared Athos received him with the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on D Artagnan but a more profound tenderness for Raoul was now visibly impressed upon his face Athos cast a glance at his feet hands and hair those three marks of race The youth s dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls forming a sort of dark frame around his face such was the fashion of the day Gloves of gray kid matching the hat well displayed the form of a slender and elegant hand whilst his boots similar in color to the hat and gloves confined feet small as those of a boy twelve years old Come murmured Athos if she is not proud of him she must be hard to please It was three o clock in the afternoon The two travelers proceeded to the Rue Saint Dominique and stopped at the door of a magnificent hotel surmounted with the arms of De Luynes Tis here said Athos He entered the hotel and ascended the front steps and addressing a footman who waited there in a grand livery asked if the Duchess de Chevreuse was visible and if she could receive the Comte de la Fere The servant returned with a message to say that though the duchess had not the honor of knowing Monsieur de la Fere she would receive him Athos followed the footman who led him through a long succession of apartments and paused at length before a closed door Athos made a sign to the Vicomte de Bragelonne to remain where he was The footman opened the door and announced Monsieur le Comte de la Fere Madame de Chevreuse whose name appears so often in our story The Three Musketeers without her actually having appeared in any scene was still a beautiful woman Although about forty four or forty five years old she might have passed for thirty five She still had her rich fair hair her large animated intelligent eyes so often opened by intrigue so often closed by the blindness of love She had still her nymph like form so that when her back was turned she still was not unlike the girl who had jumped with Anne of Austria over the moat of the Tuileries in fifteen sixty three In all other respects she was the same mad creature who threw over her amours such an air of originality as to make them proverbial for eccentricity in her family She was in a little boudoir hung with blue damask adorned by red flowers with a foliage of gold looking upon a garden and reclined upon a sofa her head supported on the rich tapestry which covered it She held a book in her hand and her arm was supported by a cushion At the footman s announcement she raised herself a little and peeped out with some curiosity Athos appeared He was dressed in violet tinted velvet trimmed with silk of the same color His shoulder knots were of burnished silver his mantle had no gold nor embroidery on it a simple plume of violet feathers adorned his hat his boots were of black leather and at his girdle hung that sword with a magnificent hilt that Porthos had so often admired in the Rue Feron Splendid lace adorned the falling collar of his shirt and lace fell also over the top of his boots In his whole person he bore such an impress of high degree that Madame de Chevreuse half rose from her seat when she saw him and made him a sign to sit down near her Athos bowed and obeyed The footman was withdrawing but Athos stopped him by a sign Madame he said to the duchess I have had the boldness to present myself at your hotel without being known to you it has succeeded since you deign to receive me I have now the boldness to ask you for an interview of half an hour I grant it monsieur replied Madame de Chevreuse with her most gracious smile But that is not all madame Oh I am very presuming I am aware The interview for which I ask is of us two alone and I very earnestly wish that it may not be interrupted I am not at home to any one said the Duchess de Chevreuse to the footman You may go The footman went out There ensued a brief silence during which these two persons who at first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race examined each other without embarrassment on either side The duchess was the first to speak Well sir I am waiting with impatience to hear what you wish to say to me And I madame replied Athos am looking with admiration Sir said Madame de Chevreuse you must excuse me but I long to know to whom I am talking You belong to the court doubtless yet I have never seen you at court Have you by any chance been in the Bastile No madame I have not but very likely I am on the road to it Ah then tell me who you are and get along with you upon your journey replied the duchess with the gayety which made her so charming for I am sufficiently in bad odor already without compromising myself still more Who I am madame My name has been mentioned to you the Comte de la Fere you do not know that name I once bore another which you knew but you have certainly forgotten it Tell it me sir Formerly said the count I was Athos Madame de Chevreuse looked astonished The name was not wholly forgotten but mixed up and confused with ancient recollections Athos said she wait a moment And she placed her hands on her brow as if to force the fugitive ideas it contained to concentration in a moment Shall I help you madame asked Athos Yes do said the duchess This Athos was connected with three young musketeers named Porthos D Artagnan and He stopped short And Aramis said the duchess quickly And Aramis I see you have not forgotten the name No she said poor Aramis a charming man elegant discreet and a writer of poetical verses I am afraid he has turned out ill she added He has he is an abbe Ah what a misfortune exclaimed the duchess playing carelessly with her fan Indeed sir I thank you you have recalled one of the most agreeable recollections of my youth Will you permit me then to recall another to you Relating to him Yes and no Faith said Madame de Chevreuse say on With a man like you I fear nothing Athos bowed Aramis he continued was intimate with a young needlewoman from Tours a cousin of his named Marie Michon Ah I knew her cried the duchess It was to her he wrote from the siege of Rochelle to warn her of a plot against the Duke of Buckingham Exactly so will you allow me to speak to you of her If replied the duchess with a meaning look you do not say too much against her I should be ungrateful said Athos and I regard ingratitude not as a fault or a crime but as a vice which is much worse You ungrateful to Marie Michon monsieur said Madame de Chevreuse trying to read in Athos s eyes But how can that be You never knew her Eh madame who knows said Athos There is a popular proverb to the effect that it is only mountains that never meet and popular proverbs contain sometimes a wonderful amount of truth Oh go on monsieur go on said Madame de Chevreuse eagerly you can t imagine how much this conversation interests me You encourage me said Athos I will continue then That cousin of Aramis that Marie Michon that needlewoman notwithstanding her low condition had acquaintances in the highest rank she called the grandest ladies of the court her friend and the queen proud as she is in her double character as Austrian and as Spaniard called her her sister Alas said Madame de Chevreuse with a slight sigh and a little movement of her eyebrows that was peculiarly her own since that time everything has changed And the queen had reason for her affection for Marie was devoted to her devoted to that degree that she served her as medium of intercourse with her brother the king of Spain Which interrupted the duchess is now brought up against her as a great crime And therefore continued Athos the cardinal the true cardinal the other one determined one fine morning to arrest poor Marie Michon and send her to the Chateau de Loches Fortunately the affair was not managed so secretly but that it became known to the queen The case had been provided for if Marie Michon should be threatened with any danger the queen was to send her a prayer book bound in green velvet That is true monsieur you are well informed One morning the green book was brought to her by the Prince de Marsillac There was no time to lose Happily Marie and a follower of hers named Kitty could disguise themselves admirably in men s clothes The prince procured for Marie Michon the dress of a cavalier and for Kitty that of a lackey he sent them two excellent horses and the fugitives went out hastily from Tours shaping their course toward Spain trembling at the least noise following unfrequented roads and asking for hospitality when they found themselves where there was no inn Why really it was all exactly as you say cried Madame de Chevreuse clapping her hands It would indeed be strange if she checked herself If I should follow the two fugitives to the end of their journey said Athos No madame I will not thus waste your time We will accompany them only to a little village in Limousin lying between Tulle and Angouleme a little village called Roche l Abeille Madame de Chevreuse uttered a cry of surprise and looked at Athos with an expression of astonishment that made the old musketeer smile Wait madame continued Athos what remains for me to tell you is even more strange than what I have narrated Monsieur said Madame de Chevreuse I believe you are a sorcerer I am prepared for anything But really No matter go on The journey of that day had been long and wearing it was a cold day the eleventh of October there was no inn or chateau in the village and the homes of the peasants were poor and unattractive Marie Michon was a very aristocratic person like her sister the queen she had been accustomed to pleasing perfumes and fine linen she resolved therefore to seek hospitality of the priest Athos paused Oh continue said the duchess I have told you that I am prepared for anything The two travelers knocked at the door It was late the priest who had gone to bed cried out to them to come in They entered for the door was not locked there is much confidence among villagers A lamp burned in the chamber occupied by the priest Marie Michon who made the most charming cavalier in the world pushed open the door put her head in and asked for hospitality Willingly my young cavalier said the priest if you will be content with the remains of my supper and with half my chamber The two travelers consulted for a moment The priest heard a burst of laughter and then the master or rather the mistress replied Thank you monsieur le cure I accept Sup then and make as little noise as possible said the priest for I too have been on the go all day and shall not be sorry to sleep to night Madame de Chevreuse evidently went from surprise to astonishment and from astonishment to stupefaction Her face as she looked at Athos had taken on an expression that cannot be described It could be seen that she had wished to speak but she had remained silent through fear of losing one of her companion s words What happened then she asked Then said Athos Ah I have come now to what is most difficult Speak speak One can say anything to me Besides it doesn t concern me it relates to Mademoiselle Marie Michon Ah that is true said Athos Well then Marie Michon had supper with her follower and then in accordance with the permission given her she entered the chamber of her host Kitty meanwhile taking possession of an armchair in the room first entered where they had taken their supper Really monsieur said Madame de Chevreuse unless you are the devil in person I don t know how you could become acquainted with all these details A charming woman was that Marie Michon resumed Athos one of those wild creatures who are constantly conceiving the strangest ideas Now thinking that her host was a priest that coquette took it into her head that it would be a happy souvenir for her old age among the many happy souvenirs she already possessed if she could win that of having damned an abbe Count said the duchess upon my word you frighten me Alas continued Athos the poor abbe was not a saint Ambroise and I repeat Marie Michon was an adorable creature Monsieur cried the duchess seizing Athos s hands tell me this moment how you know all these details or I will send to the convent of the Vieux Augustins for a monk to come and exorcise you Athos laughed Nothing is easier madame A cavalier charged with an important mission had come an hour before your arrival seeking hospitality at the very moment that the cure summoned to the bedside of a dying person left not only his house but the village for the entire night The priest having all confidence in his guest who besides was a nobleman had left to him his house his supper and his chamber And therefore Marie came seeking hospitality from the guest of the good abbe and not from the good abbe himself And that cavalier that guest that nobleman who arrived before she came It was I the Comte de la Fere said Athos rising and bowing respectfully to the Duchess de Chevreuse The duchess remained a moment stupefied then suddenly bursting into laughter Ah upon my word said she it is very droll and that mad Marie Michon fared better than she expected Sit down dear count and go on with your story At this point I have to accuse myself of a fault madame I have told you that I was traveling on an important mission At daybreak I left the chamber without noise leaving my charming companion asleep In the front room the follower was also still asleep her head leaning back on the chair in all respects worthy of her mistress Her pretty face arrested my attention I approached and recognized that little Kitty whom our friend Aramis had placed with her In that way I discovered that the charming traveler was Marie Michon said Madame de Chevreuse hastily Marie Michon continued Athos Then I went out of the house I proceeded to the stable and found my horse saddled and my lackey ready We set forth on our journey And have you never revisited that village eagerly asked Madame de Chevreuse A year after madame Well I wanted to see the good cure again I found him much preoccupied with an event that he could not at all comprehend A week before he had received in a cradle a beautiful little boy three months old with a purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words eleven October sixteen thirty three It was the date of that strange adventure interrupted Madame de Chevreuse Yes but he couldn t understand what it meant for he had spent that night with a dying person and Marie Michon had left his house before his return You must know monsieur that Marie Michon when she returned to France in sixteen forty three immediately sought for information about that child as a fugitive she could not take care of it but on her return she wished to have it near her And what said the abbe asked Athos That a nobleman whom he did not know had wished to take charge of it had answered for its future and had taken it away That was true Ah I see That nobleman was you it was his father Hush do not speak so loud madame he is there He is there my son the son of Marie Michon But I must see him instantly Take care madame said Athos for he knows neither his father nor his mother You have kept the secret you have brought him to see me thinking to make me happy Oh thanks sir thanks cried Madame de Chevreuse seizing his hand and trying to put it to her lips you have a noble heart I bring him to you madame said Athos withdrawing his hand hoping that in your turn you will do something for him till now I have watched over his education and I have made him I hope an accomplished gentleman but I am now obliged to return to the dangerous and wandering life of party faction To morrow I plunge into an adventurous affair in which I may be killed Then it will devolve on you to push him on in that world where he is called on to occupy a place Rest assured cried the duchess I shall do what I can I have but little influence now but all that I have shall most assuredly be his As to his title and fortune As to that madame I have made over to him the estate of Bragelonne my inheritance which will give him ten thousand francs a year and the title of vicomte Upon my soul monsieur said the duchess you are a true nobleman But I am eager to see our young vicomte Where is he There in the salon I will have him come in if you really wish it Athos moved toward the door the duchess held him back Is he handsome she asked Athos smiled He resembles his mother So he opened the door and beckoned the young man in The duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavalier so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been able to conceive Vicomte come here said Athos the duchess permits you to kiss her hand The youth approached with his charming smile and his head bare and kneeling down kissed the hand of the Duchess de Chevreuse Sir he said turning to Athos was it not in compassion to my timidity that you told me that this lady was the Duchess de Chevreuse and is she not the queen No vicomte said Madame de Chevreuse taking his hand and making him sit near her while she looked at him with eyes sparkling with pleasure no unhappily I am not the queen If I were I should do for you at once the most that you deserve But let us see whatever I may be she added hardly restraining herself from kissing that pure brow let us see what profession you wish to follow Athos standing looked at them both with indescribable pleasure Madame answered the youth in his sweet voice it seems to me that there is only one career for a gentleman that of the army I have been brought up by monsieur le comte with the intention I believe of making me a soldier and he gave me reason to hope that at Paris he would present me to some one who would recommend me to the favor of the prince Yes I understand it well Personally I am on bad terms with him on account of the quarrels between Madame de Montbazon my mother in law and Madame de Longueville But the Prince de Marsillac Yes indeed that s the right thing The Prince de Marsillac my old friend will recommend our young friend to Madame de Longueville who will give him a letter to her brother the prince who loves her too tenderly not to do what she wishes immediately Well that will do charmingly said the count but may I beg that the greatest haste may be made for I have reasons for wishing the vicomte not to sleep longer than to morrow night in Paris Do you wish it known that you are interested about him monsieur le comte Better for him in future that he should be supposed never to have seen me Oh sir cried Raoul You know Bragelonne said Athos I never speak without reflection Well comte I am going instantly interrupted the duchess to send for the Prince de Marsillac who is happily in Paris just now What are you going to do this evening We intend to visit the Abbe Scarron for whom I have a letter of introduction and at whose house I expect to meet some of my friends Tis well I will go there also for a few minutes said the duchess do not quit his salon until you have seen me Athos bowed and prepared to leave Well monsieur le comte said the duchess smiling does one leave so solemnly his old friends Ah murmured Athos kissing her hand had I only sooner known that Marie Michon was so charming a creature And he withdrew sighing twenty one The Abbe Scarron There was once in the Rue des Tournelles a house known by all the sedan chairmen and footmen of Paris and yet nevertheless this house was neither that of a great lord nor of a rich man There was neither dining nor playing at cards nor dancing in that house Nevertheless it was the rendezvous of the great world and all Paris went there It was the abode of the little Abbe Scarron In the home of the witty abbe dwelt incessant laughter there all the items of the day had their source and were so quickly transformed misrepresented metamorphosed some into epigrams some into falsehoods that every one was anxious to pass an hour with little Scarron listening to what he said reporting it to others The diminutive Abbe Scarron who however was an abbe only because he owned an abbey and not because he was in orders had formerly been one of the gayest prebendaries in the town of Mans which he inhabited On a day of the carnival he had taken a notion to provide an unusual entertainment for that good town of which he was the life and soul He had made his valet cover him with honey then opening a feather bed he had rolled in it and had thus become the most grotesque fowl it is possible to imagine He then began to visit his friends of both sexes in that strange costume At first he had been followed through astonishment then with derisive shouts then the porters had insulted him then children had thrown stones at him and finally he was obliged to run to escape the missiles As soon as he took to flight every one pursued him until pressed on all sides Scarron found no way of escaping his escort except by throwing himself into the river but the water was icy cold Scarron was heated the cold seized on him and when he reached the farther bank he found himself crippled Every means had been employed in vain to restore the use of his limbs He had been subjected to a severe disciplinary course of medicine at length he sent away all his doctors declaring that he preferred the disease to the treatment and came to Paris where the fame of his wit had preceded him There he had a chair made on his own plan and one day visiting Anne of Austria in this chair she asked him charmed as she was with his wit if he did not wish for a title Yes your majesty there is a title which I covet much replied Scarron And what is that That of being your invalid answered Scarron So he was called the queen s invalid with a pension of fifteen hundred francs From that lucky moment Scarron led a happy life spending both income and principal One day however an emissary of the cardinal s gave him to understand that he was wrong in receiving the coadjutor so often And why asked Scarron is he not a man of good birth Certainly Agreeable Undeniably Witty He has unfortunately too much wit Well then why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man Because he is an enemy Of whom Of the cardinal What answered Scarron I continue to receive Monsieur Gilles Despreaux who thinks ill of me and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor because he thinks ill of another man Impossible The conversation had rested there and Scarron through sheer obstinacy had seen Monsieur de Gondy only the more frequently Now the very morning of which we speak was that of his quarter day payment and Scarron as usual had sent his servant to get his money at the pension office but the man had returned and said that the government had no more money to give Monsieur Scarron It was on Thursday the abbe s reception day people went there in crowds The cardinal s refusal to pay the pension was known about the town in half an hour and he was abused with wit and vehemence In the Rue Saint Honore Athos fell in with two gentlemen whom he did not know on horseback like himself followed by a lackey like himself and going in the same direction that he was One of them hat in hand said to him Would you believe it monsieur that contemptible Mazarin has stopped poor Scarron s pension That is unreasonable said Athos saluting in his turn the two cavaliers And they separated with courteous gestures It happens well that we are going there this evening said Athos to the vicomte we will pay our compliments to that poor man What then is this Monsieur Scarron who thus puts all Paris in commotion Is he some minister out of office Oh no not at all vicomte Athos replied he is simply a gentleman of great genius who has fallen into disgrace with the cardinal through having written certain verses against him Do gentlemen then make verses asked Raoul naively I thought it was derogatory So it is my dear vicomte said Athos laughing to make bad ones but to make good ones increases fame witness Monsieur de Rotrou Nevertheless he continued in the tone of one who gives wholesome advice I think it is better not to make them Then said Raoul this Monsieur Scarron is a poet Yes you are warned vicomte Consider well what you do in that house Talk only by gestures or rather always listen Yes monsieur replied Raoul You will see me talking with one of my friends the Abbe d Herblay of whom you have often heard me speak I remember him monsieur Come near to us from time to time as if to speak but do not speak and do not listen That little stratagem may serve to keep off interlopers Very well monsieur I will obey you at all points Athos made two visits in Paris at seven o clock he and Raoul directed their steps to the Rue des Tournelles it was stopped by porters horses and footmen Athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young man The first person that struck him on his entrance was Aramis planted near a great chair on castors very large covered with a canopy of tapestry under which there moved enveloped in a quilt of brocade a little face youngish very merry somewhat pallid whilst its eyes never ceased to express a sentiment at once lively intellectual and amiable This was the Abbe Scarron always laughing joking complimenting yet suffering and toying nervously with a small switch Around this kind of rolling tent pressed a crowd of gentlemen and ladies The room was neatly comfortably furnished Large valances of silk embroidered with flowers of gay colors which were rather faded fell from the wide windows the fittings of the room were simple but in excellent taste Two well trained servingmen were in attendance on the company On perceiving Athos Aramis advanced toward him took him by the hand and presented him to Scarron Raoul remained silent for he was not prepared for the dignity of the bel esprit After some minutes the door opened and a footman announced Mademoiselle Paulet Athos touched the shoulder of the vicomte Look at this lady Raoul she is an historic personage it was to visit her King Henry IV was going when he was assassinated Every one thronged around Mademoiselle Paulet for she was always very much the fashion She was a tall woman with a slender figure and a forest of golden curls such as Raphael was fond of and Titian has painted all his Magdalens with This fawn colored hair or perhaps the sort of ascendancy which she had over other women gave her the name of La Lionne Mademoiselle Paulet took her accustomed seat but before sitting down she cast in all her queen like grandeur a look around the room and her eyes rested on Raoul Athos smiled Mademoiselle Paulet has observed you vicomte go and bow to her don t try to appear anything but what you are a true country youth on no account speak to her of Henry IV When shall we two walk together Athos then said to Aramis Presently there are not a sufficient number of people here yet we shall be remarked At this moment the door opened and in walked the coadjutor At this name every one looked around for his was already a very celebrated name Athos did the same He knew the Abbe de Gondy only by report He saw a little dark man ill made and awkward with his hands in everything except drawing a sword and firing a pistol with something haughty and contemptuous in his face Scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair Well said the coadjutor on seeing him you are in disgrace then abbe This was the orthodox phrase It had been said that evening a hundred times and Scarron was at his hundredth bon mot on the subject he was very nearly at the end of his humoristic tether but one despairing effort saved him Monsieur the Cardinal Mazarin has been so kind as to think of me he said But how can you continue to receive us asked the coadjutor if your income is lessened I shall be obliged to make you a canon of Notre Dame Oh no cried Scarron I should compromise you too much Perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant I shall borrow from the queen But her majesty has no property interposed Aramis At this moment the door opened and Madame de Chevreuse was announced Every one arose Scarron turned his chair toward the door Raoul blushed Athos made a sign to Aramis who went and hid himself in the enclosure of a window In the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance the duchess seemed to be looking for some one at last she found out Raoul and her eyes sparkled she perceived Athos and became thoughtful she saw Aramis in the seclusion of the window and gave a start of surprise behind her fan Apropos she said as if to drive away thoughts that pursued her in spite of herself how is poor Voiture do you know Scarron What is Monsieur Voiture ill inquired a gentleman who had spoken to Athos in the Rue Saint Honore what is the matter with him He was acting but forgot to take the precaution to have a change of linen ready after the performance said the coadjutor so he took cold and is about to die Is he then so ill dear Voiture asked Aramis half hidden by the window curtain Die cried Mademoiselle Paulet bitterly he Why he is surrounded by sultanas like a Turk Madame de Saintot has hastened to him with broth La Renaudot warms his sheets the Marquise de Rambouillet sends him his tisanes You don t like him my dear Parthenie said Scarron What an injustice my dear invalid I hate him so little that I should be delighted to order masses for the repose of his soul You are not called Lionne for nothing observed Madame de Chevreuse your teeth are terrible You are unjust to a great poet it seems to me Raoul ventured to say A great poet come one may easily see vicomte that you are lately from the provinces and have never so much as seen him A great poet he is scarcely five feet high Bravo bravo cried a tall man with an enormous mustache and a long rapier bravo fair Paulet it is high time to put little Voiture in his right place For my part I always thought his poetry detestable and I think I know something about poetry Who is this officer inquired Raoul of Athos who is speaking Monsieur de Scudery the author of Clelie and of Le Grand Cyrus which were composed partly by him and partly by his sister who is now talking to that pretty person yonder near Monsieur Scarron Raoul turned and saw two faces just arrived One was perfectly charming delicate pensive shaded by beautiful dark hair and eyes soft as velvet like those lovely flowers the heartsease in which shine out the golden petals The other of mature age seemed to have the former one under her charge and was cold dry and yellow the true type of a duenna or a devotee Raoul resolved not to quit the room without having spoken to the beautiful girl with the soft eyes who by a strange fancy although she bore no resemblance reminded him of his poor little Louise whom he had left in the Chateau de la Valliere and whom in the midst of all the party he had never for one moment quite forgotten Meantime Aramis had drawn near to the coadjutor who smiling all the while contrived to drop some words into his ear Aramis notwithstanding his self control could not refrain from a slight movement of surprise Laugh then said Monsieur de Retz they are looking at us And leaving Aramis he went to talk with Madame de Chevreuse who was in the midst of a large group Aramis affected a laugh to divert the attention of certain curious listeners and perceiving that Athos had betaken himself to the embrasure of a window and remained there he proceeded to join him throwing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room As soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by frequent gesticulation Raoul then approached them as Athos had directed him to do Tis a rondeau by Monsieur Voiture that monsieur l abbe is repeating to me said Athos in a loud voice and I confess I think it incomparable Raoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the group round Madame de Chevreuse Well then asked Athos in a low tone It is to be to morrow said Aramis hastily At what time Six o clock Where At Saint Mande Who told you The Count de Rochefort Some one drew near And then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in Voiture s works but I am of the same opinion as the coadjutor he is a poet a true poet Aramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody And I too murmured the young lady with the velvet eyes I have the misfortune also to admire his poetry exceedingly Monsieur Scarron do me the honor said Raoul blushing to tell me the name of that young lady whose opinion seems so different from that of others of the company Ah my young vicomte replied Scarron I suppose you wish to propose to her an alliance offensive and defensive Raoul blushed again You asked the name of that young lady She is called the fair Indian Excuse me sir returned Raoul blushing still more deeply I know no more than I did before Alas I am from the country Which means that you know very little about the nonsense which here flows down our streets So much the better young man so much the better Don t try to understand it you will only lose your time You forgive me then sir said Raoul and you will deign to tell me who is the person that you call the young Indian Certainly one of the most charming persons that lives Mademoiselle Frances d Aubigne Does she belong to the family of the celebrated Agrippa the friend of Henry IV His granddaughter She comes from Martinique so I call her the beautiful Indian Raoul looked surprised and his eyes met those of the young lady who smiled The company went on speaking of the poet Voiture Monsieur said Mademoiselle d Aubigne to Scarron as if she wished to join in the conversation he was engaged in with Raoul do you not admire Monsieur Voiture s friends Listen how they pull him to pieces even whilst they praise him one takes away from him all claim to good sense another robs him of his poetry a third of his originality another of his humor another of his independence of character a sixth but good heavens what will they leave him as Mademoiselle de Scudery remarks Scarron and Raoul laughed The fair Indian astonished at the sensation her observation produced looked down and resumed her air of naivete Athos still within the inclosure of the window watched this scene with a smile of disdain on his lips Tell the Comte de la Fere to come to me said Madame de Chevreuse I want to speak to him And I said the coadjutor want it to be thought that I do not speak to him I admire I love him for I know his former adventures but I shall not speak to him until the day after to morrow And why day after to morrow asked Madame de Chevreuse You will know that to morrow evening said the coadjutor smiling Really my dear Gondy said the duchess you remind one of the Apocalypse Monsieur d Herblay she added turning toward Aramis will you be my servant once more this evening How can you doubt it replied Aramis this evening to morrow always command me I will then Go and look for the Comte de la Fere I wish to speak with him Aramis found Athos and brought him Monsieur le comte said the duchess giving him a letter here is what I promised you our young friend will be extremely well received Madame he is very happy in owing any obligation to you You have no reason to envy him on that score for I owe to you the pleasure of knowing him replied the witty woman with a smile which recalled Marie Michon to Aramis and to Athos As she uttered that bon mot she arose and asked for her carriage Mademoiselle Paulet had already gone Mademoiselle de Scudery was going Vicomte said Athos to Raoul follow the duchess beg her to do you the favor to take your arm in going downstairs and thank her as you descend The fair Indian approached Scarron You are going already he said One of the last as you see if you hear anything of Monsieur Voiture be so kind as to send me word to morrow Oh said Scarron he may die now Why asked the young girl with the velvet eyes Certainly his panegyric has been uttered They parted laughing she turning back to gaze at the poor paralytic man with interest he looking after her with eyes of love One by one the several groups broke up Scarron seemed not to observe that certain of his guests had talked mysteriously that letters had passed from hand to hand and that the assembly had seemed to have a secret purpose quite apart from the literary discussion carried on with so much ostentation What was all that to Scarron At his house rebellion could be planned with impunity for as we have said since that morning he had ceased to be the queen s invalid As to Raoul he had attended the duchess to her carriage where as she took her seat she gave him her hand to kiss then by one of those wild caprices which made her so adorable and at the same time so dangerous she had suddenly put her arm around his neck and kissed his forehead saying Vicomte may my good wishes and this kiss bring you good fortune Then she had pushed him away and directed the coachman to stop at the Hotel de Luynes The carriage had started Madame de Chevreuse had made a parting gesture to the young man and Raoul had returned in a state of stupefaction Athos surmised what had taken place and smiled Come vicomte he said it is time for you to go to bed you will start in the morning for the army of monsieur le prince Sleep well your last night as citizen I am to be a soldier then said the young man Oh monsieur I thank you with all my heart Adieu count said the Abbe d Herblay I return to my convent Adieu abbe said the coadjutor I am to preach to morrow and have twenty texts to examine this evening Adieu gentlemen said the count I am going to sleep twenty four hours I am just falling down with fatigue The three men saluted one another whilst exchanging a last look Scarron followed their movements with a glance from the corner of his eye Not one of them will do as he says he murmured with his little monkey smile but they may do as they please the brave gentlemen Who knows if they will not manage to restore to me my pension They can move their arms they can and that is much Alas I have only my tongue but I will try to show that it is good for something Ho there Champenois here it is eleven o clock Come and roll me to bed Really that Demoiselle d Aubigne is very charming So the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his sleeping room and one by one the lights in the salon of the Rue des Tournelles were extinguished twenty two Saint Denis The day had begun to break when Athos arose and dressed himself It was plain by a paleness still greater than usual and by those traces which loss of sleep leaves on the face that he must have passed almost the whole of the night without sleeping Contrary to the custom of a man so firm and decided there was this morning in his personal appearance something tardy and irresolute He was occupied with the preparations for Raoul s departure and was seeking to gain time 
274_121392_000003_000001	train-clean-360	In the first place he himself furbished a sword which he drew from its perfumed leather sheath he examined it to see if its hilt was well guarded and if the blade was firmly attached to the hilt 
none	none	Then he placed at the bottom of the valise belonging to the young man a small bag of louis called Olivain the lackey who had followed him from Blois and made him pack the valise under his own eyes watchful to see that everything should be put in which might be useful to a young man entering on his first campaign 
274_121392_000004_000000	train-clean-360	At length after occupying about an hour in these preparations he opened the door of the room in which the vicomte slept and entered 
274_121392_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The sun already high penetrated into the room through the window the curtains of which Raoul had neglected to close on the previous evening He was still sleeping his head gracefully reposing on his arm 
none	none	Athos approached and hung over the youth in an attitude full of tender melancholy he looked long on this young man whose smiling mouth and half closed eyes bespoke soft dreams and lightest slumber as if his guardian angel watched over him with solicitude and affection By degrees Athos gave himself up to the charms of his reverie in the proximity of youth so pure so fresh His own youth seemed to reappear bringing with it all those savoury remembrances which are like perfumes more than thoughts 
274_121392_000006_000003	train-clean-360	Between the past and the present was an ineffable abyss 
none	none	But imagination has the wings of an angel of light and travels safely through or over the seas where we have been almost shipwrecked the darkness in which our illusions are lost the precipice whence our happiness has been hurled and swallowed up He remembered that all the first part of his life had been embittered by a woman and he thought with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine and at the same time so vigorous an organization as that of Raoul 
274_121392_000007_000000	train-clean-360	In recalling all he had been through he foresaw all that Raoul might suffer and the expression of the deep and tender compassion which throbbed in his heart was pictured in the moist eye with which he gazed on the young man 
274_121392_000008_000000	train-clean-360	At this moment Raoul awoke without a cloud on his face without weariness or lassitude his eyes were fixed on those of Athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress for his glance in return had all the tenderness of love 
274_121392_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 You are there sir he said respectfully 
none	none	Yes Raoul replied the count
274_121392_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 And you did not awaken me 
none	none	I wished to leave you still to enjoy some moments of sleep my child you must be fatigued from yesterday Oh sir how good you are Athos smiled How do you feel this morning he inquired
274_121392_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Perfectly well quite rested sir 
none	none	You are still growing Athos continued with that charming and paternal interest felt by a grown man for a youth Oh sir I beg your pardon exclaimed Raoul ashamed of so much attention in an instant I shall be dressed Athos then called Olivain Everything said Olivain to Athos has been done according to your directions the horses are waiting
274_121392_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 And I was asleep cried Raoul whilst you sir you had the kindness to attend to all these details 
none	none	Truly sir you overwhelm me with benefits Therefore you love me a little I hope replied Athos in a tone of emotion Oh sir God knows how much I love revere you See that you forget nothing said Athos appearing to look about him that he might hide his emotion No indeed sir answered Raoul The servant then approached Athos and said hesitatingly
274_121392_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Monsieur le vicomte has no sword 
274_121392_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Tis well said Athos I will take care of that 
none	none	They went downstairs Raoul looking every now and then at the count to see if the moment of farewell was at hand but Athos was silent 
274_121392_000029_000001	train-clean-360	When they reached the steps Raoul saw three horses 
none	none	Oh sir then you are going with me I will accompany you a portion of the way said Athos Joy shone in Raoul s eyes and he leaped lightly to his saddle 
274_121392_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Athos mounted more slowly after speaking in a low voice to the lackey who instead of following them immediately returned to their rooms Raoul delighted at the count s companionship perceived or affected to perceive nothing of this byplay 
274_121392_000034_000000	train-clean-360	They set out passing over the Pont Neuf they pursued their way along the quay then called L Abreuvoir Pepin and went along by the walls of the Grand Chatelet 
none	none	They proceeded to the Rue Saint Denis 
274_121392_000035_000000	train-clean-360	After passing through the Porte Saint Denis Athos looked at Raoul s way of riding and observed 
274_121392_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Take care Raoul 
none	none	I have already often told you of this you must not forget it for it is a great defect in a rider 
274_121392_000036_000002	train-clean-360	See your horse is tired already he froths at the mouth whilst mine looks as if he had only just left the stable 
274_121392_000036_000003	train-clean-360	You hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth hard so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre quickly 
none	none	The safety of a cavalier often depends on the prompt obedience of his horse In a week remember you will no longer be performing your manoeuvres for practice but on a field of battle Then suddenly in order not to give too uncomfortable an importance to this observation See Raoul he resumed what a fine plain for partridge shooting 
274_121392_000039_000000	train-clean-360	The young man stored in his mind the admonition whilst he admired the delicate tenderness with which it was bestowed 
274_121392_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 I have remarked also another thing said Athos which is that in firing off your pistol you hold your arm too far outstretched 
none	none	This tension lessens the accuracy of the aim 
274_121392_000040_000002	train-clean-360	So in twelve times you thrice missed the mark 
none	none	Which you sir struck twelve times answered Raoul smiling
274_121392_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Because I bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbow so do you understand what I mean 
none	none	Yes sir 
274_121392_000043_000001	train-clean-360	I have fired since in that manner and have been quite successful 
none	none	What a cold wind resumed Athos a wintry blast 
274_121392_000044_000001	train-clean-360	Apropos if you fire and you will do so for you are recommended to a young general who is very fond of powder remember that in single combat which often takes place in the cavalry never to fire the first shot 
274_121392_000044_000002	train-clean-360	He who fires the first shot rarely hits his man for he fires with the apprehension of being disarmed before an armed foe then whilst he fires make your horse rear that manoeuvre has saved my life several times 
none	none	I shall do so if only in gratitude Eh cried Athos are not those fellows poachers they have arrested yonder They are 
274_121392_000046_000002	train-clean-360	Then another important thing Raoul should you be wounded in a battle and fall from your horse if you have any strength left disentangle yourself from the line that your regiment has formed otherwise it may be driven back and you will be trampled to death by the horses 
none	none	At all events should you be wounded write to me that very instant or get some one at once to write to me We are judges of wounds we old soldiers Athos added smiling Thank you sir answered the young man much moved 
274_121392_000048_000000	train-clean-360	They arrived that very moment at the gate of the town guarded by two sentinels 
none	none	Here comes a young gentleman said one of them who seems as if he were going to join the army
274_121392_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 How do you make that out inquired Athos 
274_121392_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 By his manner sir and his age he s the second to day 
none	none	Has a young man such as I am gone through this morning then asked Raoul
274_121392_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Faith yes with a haughty presence a fine equipage such as the son of a noble house would have 
none	none	He will be my companion on the journey sir cried Raoul Alas he cannot make me forget what I shall have lost Thus talking they traversed the streets full of people on account of the fete and arrived opposite the old cathedral where first mass was going on Let us alight Raoul said Athos Olivain take care of our horses and give me my sword 
274_121392_000057_000000	train-clean-360	The two gentlemen then went into the church 
none	none	Athos gave Raoul some of the holy water 
274_121392_000057_000002	train-clean-360	A love as tender as that of a lover for his mistress dwells undoubtedly in some paternal hearts toward a son 
none	none	Athos said a word to one of the vergers who bowed and proceeded toward the basement Come Raoul he said let us follow this man The verger opened the iron grating that guarded the royal tombs and stood on the topmost step whilst Athos and Raoul descended 
274_121392_000060_000001	train-clean-360	The sepulchral depths of the descent were dimly lighted by a silver lamp on the lowest step and just below this lamp there was laid wrapped in a flowing mantle of violet velvet worked with fleurs de lis of gold a catafalque resting on trestles of oak 
none	none	The young man prepared for this scene by the state of his own feelings which were mournful and by the majesty of the cathedral which he had passed through descended in a slow and solemn manner and stood with head uncovered before these mortal spoils of the last king who was not to be placed by the side of his forefathers until his successor should take his place there and who appeared to abide on that spot that he might thus address human pride so sure to be exalted by the glories of a throne Dust of the earth Here I await thee 
274_121392_000061_000000	train-clean-360	There was profound silence 
274_121392_000062_000000	train-clean-360	Then Athos raised his hand and pointing to the coffin 
none	none	This temporary sepulture is he said that of a man who was of feeble mind yet one whose reign was full of great events because over this king watched the spirit of another man even as this lamp keeps vigil over this coffin and illumines it He whose intellect was thus supreme Raoul was the actual sovereign the other nothing but a phantom to whom he lent a soul and yet so powerful is majesty amongst us this man has not even the honor of a tomb at the feet of him in whose service his life was worn away Remember Raoul this 
274_121392_000063_000003	train-clean-360	If Richelieu made the king by comparison seem small he made royalty great 
274_121392_000063_000004	train-clean-360	The Palace of the Louvre contains two things the king who must die and royalty which never dies 
274_121392_000063_000005	train-clean-360	The minister so feared so hated by his master has descended into the tomb drawing after him the king whom he would not leave alone on earth lest his work should be destroyed 
274_121392_000063_000006	train-clean-360	So blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinal s death as a deliverance and I even I opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of France within the hollow of his hand 
274_121392_000063_000007	train-clean-360	Raoul learn how to distinguish the king from royalty the king is but a man royalty is the gift of God 
274_121392_000063_000008	train-clean-360	Whenever you hesitate as to whom you ought to serve abandon the exterior the material appearance for the invisible principle for the invisible principle is everything 
274_121392_000063_000009	train-clean-360	Raoul I seem to read your future destiny as through a cloud 
none	none	It will be happier I think than ours has been 
274_121392_000063_000011	train-clean-360	Different in your fate from us you will have a king without a minister whom you may serve love respect 
274_121392_000063_000012	train-clean-360	Should the king prove a tyrant for power begets tyranny serve love respect royalty that Divine right that celestial spark which makes this dust still powerful and holy so that we gentlemen nevertheless of rank and condition are as nothing in comparison with the cold corpse there extended 
274_121392_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall adore God sir said Raoul respect royalty and ever serve the king 
274_121392_000064_000001	train-clean-360	And if death be my lot I hope to die for the king for royalty and for God 
274_121392_000064_000002	train-clean-360	Have I sir comprehended your instructions 
none	none	Athos smiled
274_121392_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 Yours is a noble nature he said here is your sword 
274_121392_000067_000000	train-clean-360	Raoul bent his knee to the ground 
274_121392_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 It was worn by my father a loyal gentleman 
none	none	I have worn it in my turn and it has sometimes not been disgraced when the hilt was in my hand and the sheath at my side 
274_121392_000068_000002	train-clean-360	Should your hand still be too weak to use this sword Raoul so much the better 
274_121392_000068_000003	train-clean-360	You will have the more time to learn to draw it only when it ought to be used 
none	none	Sir replied Raoul putting the sword to his lips as he received it from the count I owe you everything and yet this sword is the most precious gift you have yet made me 
274_121392_000069_000001	train-clean-360	I will wear it I swear to you as a grateful man should do 
none	none	Tis well arise vicomte embrace me Raoul arose and threw himself with emotion into the count s arms
274_121392_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 Adieu faltered the count who felt his heart die away within him adieu and think of me 
274_121392_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh for ever and ever cried the youth oh 
none	none	I swear to you sir should any harm befall me your name will be the last name that I shall utter the remembrance of you my last thought Athos hastened upstairs to conceal his emotion and regained with hurried steps the porch where Olivain was waiting with the horses Olivain said Athos showing the servant Raoul s shoulder belt tighten the buckle of the sword it falls too low You will accompany monsieur le vicomte till Grimaud rejoins you You know Raoul Grimaud is an old and zealous servant he will follow you Yes sir answered Raoul Now to horse that I may see you depart 
274_121392_000078_000000	train-clean-360	Raoul obeyed 
274_121392_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 Adieu Raoul said the count adieu my dearest boy 
274_121392_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 Adieu sir adieu my beloved protector 
274_121392_000081_000000	train-clean-360	Athos waved his hand he dared not trust himself to speak and Raoul went away his head uncovered 
274_121392_000081_000001	train-clean-360	Athos remained motionless looking after him until he turned the corner of the street 
274_121392_000082_000000	train-clean-360	Then the count threw the bridle of his horse into the hands of a peasant remounted the steps went into the cathedral there to kneel down in the darkest corner and pray 
none	none	twenty three One of the Forty Methods of Escape of the Duc de Beaufort Meanwhile time was passing on for the prisoner as well as for those who were preparing his escape only for him it passed more slowly Unlike other men who enter with ardor upon a perilous resolution and grow cold as the moment of execution approaches the Duc de Beaufort whose buoyant courage had become a proverb seemed to push time before him and sought most eagerly to hasten the hour of action In his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitted were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart In the first place his escape would be a serious misfortune to Monsieur de Chavigny whom he hated for the petty persecutions he owed to him It would be a still worse affair for Mazarin whom he execrated for the greater offences he had committed It may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments toward the governor of the prison and the minister toward the subordinate and the master Then Monsieur de Beaufort who was so familiar with the interior of the Palais Royal though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal pictured to himself in his prison all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the minister s cabinet to the chamber of Anne of Austria Monsieur de Beaufort has escaped Whilst saying that to himself Monsieur de Beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside breathing the air of the plains and the forests pressing a strong horse between his knees and crying out in a loud voice I am free It is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls he saw La Ramee twirling his thumbs ten feet from him and his guards laughing and drinking in the ante chamber The only thing that was pleasant to him in that odious tableau such is the instability of the human mind was the sullen face of Grimaud for whom he had at first conceived such a hatred and who now was all his hope Grimaud seemed to him an Antinous It is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoner s feverish imagination Grimaud was still the same and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior La Ramee who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself for as we have said La Ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for Monsieur de Beaufort And so the good La Ramee made a festivity of the little supper with his prisoner He had but one fault he was a gourmand he had found the pates good the wine excellent Now the successor of Pere Marteau had promised him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl and Chambertin wine instead of Macon All this set off by the presence of that excellent prince who was so good natured who invented so droll tricks against Monsieur de Chavigny and so fine jokes against Mazarin made for La Ramee the approaching Pentecost one of the four great feasts of the year He therefore looked forward to six o clock with as much impatience as the duke himself Since daybreak La Ramee had been occupied with the preparations and trusting no one but himself he had visited personally the successor of Pere Marteau The latter had surpassed himself he showed La Ramee a monstrous pate ornamented with Monsieur de Beaufort s coat of arms It was empty as yet but a pheasant and two partridges were lying near it La Ramee s mouth watered and he returned to the duke s chamber rubbing his hands To crown his happiness Monsieur de Chavigny had started on a journey that morning and in his absence La Ramee was deputy governor of the chateau As for Grimaud he seemed more sullen than ever In the course of the forenoon Monsieur de Beaufort had a game of tennis with La Ramee a sign from Grimaud put him on the alert Grimaud going in advance followed the course which they were to take in the evening The game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau a place quite deserted except when Monsieur de Beaufort was playing and even then the precaution seemed superfluous the wall was so high There were three gates to open before reaching the inclosure each by a different key When they arrived Grimaud went carelessly and sat down by a loophole in the wall letting his legs dangle outside It was evident that there the rope ladder was to be attached This manoeuvre transparent to the Duc de Beaufort was quite unintelligible to La Ramee The game at tennis which upon a sign from Grimaud Monsieur de Beaufort had consented to play began in the afternoon The duke was in full strength and beat La Ramee completely Four of the guards who were constantly near the prisoner assisted in picking up the tennis balls When the game was over the duke laughing at La Ramee for his bad play offered these men two louis d or to go and drink his health with their four other comrades The guards asked permission of La Ramee who gave it to them but not till the evening however until then he had business and the prisoner was not to be left alone Six o clock came and although they were not to sit down to table until seven o clock dinner was ready and served up Upon a sideboard appeared the colossal pie with the duke s arms on it and seemingly cooked to a turn as far as one could judge by the golden color which illuminated the crust The rest of the dinner was to come Every one was impatient La Ramee to sit down to table the guards to go and drink the duke to escape Grimaud alone was calm as ever One might have fancied that Athos had educated him with the express forethought of such a great event There were moments when looking at Grimaud the duke asked himself if he was not dreaming and if that marble figure was really at his service and would grow animated when the moment came for action La Ramee sent away the guards desiring them to drink to the duke s health and as soon as they were gone shut all the doors put the keys in his pocket and showed the table to the prince with an air that signified Whenever my lord pleases The prince looked at Grimaud Grimaud looked at the clock it was hardly a quarter past six The escape was fixed to take place at seven o clock there was therefore three quarters of an hour to wait The duke in order to pass away another quarter of an hour pretended to be reading something that interested him and muttered that he wished they would allow him to finish his chapter La Ramee went up to him and looked over his shoulder to see what sort of a book it was that had so singular an influence over the prisoner as to make him put off taking his dinner It was Caesar s Commentaries which La Ramee had lent him contrary to the orders of the governor and La Ramee resolved never again to disobey these injunctions Meantime he uncorked the bottles and went to smell if the pie was good At half past six the duke arose and said very gravely Certainly Caesar was the greatest man of ancient times You think so my lord answered La Ramee Yes Well as for me I prefer Hannibal And why pray Master La Ramee asked the duke Because he left no Commentaries replied La Ramee with his coarse laugh The duke vouchsafed no reply but sitting down at the table made a sign that La Ramee should seat himself opposite There is nothing so expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a well spread table so La Ramee when receiving his plate of soup from Grimaud presented a type of perfect bliss The duke smiled Zounds he said I don t suppose there is a more contented man at this moment in all the kingdom than yourself You are right my lord duke answered the officer I don t know any pleasanter sight on earth than a well covered table and when added to that he who does the honors is the grandson of Henry IV you will my lord duke easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasure one enjoys The duke in his turn bowed and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of Grimaud who kept behind La Ramee My dear La Ramee said the duke you are the only man to turn such faultless compliments No my lord duke replied La Ramee in the fullness of his heart I say what I think there is no compliment in what I say to you Then you are attached to me asked the duke To own the truth I should be inconsolable if you were to leave Vincennes A droll way of showing your affliction The duke meant to say affection But my lord returned La Ramee what would you do if you got out Every folly you committed would embroil you with the court and they would put you into the Bastile instead of Vincennes Now Monsieur de Chavigny is not amiable I allow but Monsieur du Tremblay is considerably worse Indeed exclaimed the duke who from time to time looked at the clock the fingers of which seemed to move with sickening slowness But what can you expect from the brother of a capuchin monk brought up in the school of Cardinal Richelieu Ah my lord it is a great happiness that the queen who always wished you well had a fancy to send you here where there s a promenade and a tennis court good air and a good table In short answered the duke if I comprehend you aright La Ramee I am ungrateful for having ever thought of leaving this place Oh my lord duke tis the height of ingratitude but your highness has never seriously thought of it Yes returned the duke I must confess I sometimes think of it Still by one of your forty methods your highness Yes yes indeed My lord said La Ramee now we are quite at our ease and enjoying ourselves pray tell me one of those forty ways invented by your highness Willingly answered the duke give me the pie I am listening said La Ramee leaning back in his armchair and raising his glass of Madeira to his lips and winking his eye that he might see the sun through the rich liquid that he was about to taste The duke glanced at the clock In ten minutes it would strike seven Grimaud placed the pie before the duke who took a knife with a silver blade to raise the upper crust but La Ramee who was afraid of any harm happening to this fine work of art passed his knife which had an iron blade to the duke Thank you La Ramee said the prisoner Well my lord this famous invention of yours Must I tell you replied the duke on what I most reckon and what I determine to try first Yes that s the thing my lord cried his custodian gaily Well I should hope in the first instance to have for keeper an honest fellow like you And you have me my lord Well Having then a keeper like La Ramee I should try also to have introduced to him by some friend or other a man who would be devoted to me who would assist me in my flight Come come said La Ramee that s not a bad idea Capital isn t it for instance the former servingman of some brave gentleman an enemy himself to Mazarin as every gentleman ought to be Hush don t let us talk politics my lord Then my keeper would begin to trust this man and to depend upon him and I should have news from those without the prison walls Ah yes but how can the news be brought to you Nothing easier in a game of tennis for example In a game of tennis asked La Ramee giving more serious attention to the duke s words Yes see I send a ball into the moat a man is there who picks it up the ball contains a letter Instead of returning the ball to me when I call for it from the top of the wall he throws me another that other ball contains a letter Thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen us do it The devil it does The devil it does said La Ramee scratching his head you are in the wrong to tell me that my lord I shall have to watch the men who pick up balls The duke smiled But resumed La Ramee that is only a way of corresponding And that is a great deal it seems to me But not enough Pardon me for instance I say to my friends Be on a certain day on a certain hour at the other side of the moat with two horses Well what then La Ramee began to be uneasy unless the horses have wings to mount the ramparts and come and fetch you That s not needed I have replied the duke a way of descending from the ramparts What A rope ladder Yes but answered La Ramee trying to laugh a ladder of ropes can t be sent around a ball like a letter No but it may be sent in something else In something else in something else In what In a pate for example In a pate said La Ramee Yes Let us suppose one thing replied the duke let us suppose for instance that my maitre d hotel Noirmont has purchased the shop of Pere Marteau Well said La Ramee shuddering Well La Ramee who is a gourmand sees his pates thinks them more attractive than those of Pere Marteau and proposes to me that I shall try them I consent on condition that La Ramee tries them with me That we may be more at our ease La Ramee removes the guards keeping only Grimaud to wait on us Grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to second me in everything The moment for my escape is fixed seven o clock Well at a few minutes to seven At a few minutes to seven cried La Ramee cold sweat upon his brow At a few minutes to seven returned the duke suiting the action to the words I raise the crust of the pie I find in it two poniards a ladder of rope and a gag I point one of the poniards at La Ramee s breast and I say to him My friend I am sorry for it but if thou stirrest if thou utterest one cry thou art a dead man The duke in pronouncing these words suited as we have said the action to the words He was standing near the officer and he directed the point of the poniard in such a manner close to La Ramee s heart that there could be no doubt in the mind of that individual as to his determination Meanwhile Grimaud still mute as ever drew from the pie the other poniard the rope ladder and the gag La Ramee followed all these objects with his eyes his alarm every moment increasing Oh my lord he cried with an expression of stupefaction in his face you haven t the heart to kill me No not if thou dost not oppose my flight But my lord if I allow you to escape I am a ruined man I will compensate thee for the loss of thy place You are determined to leave the chateau By Heaven and earth This night I am determined to be free And if I defend myself or call or cry out I will kill thee on the honor of a gentleman At this moment the clock struck Seven o clock said Grimaud who had not spoken a word La Ramee made one movement in order to satisfy his conscience The duke frowned the officer felt the point of the poniard which having penetrated through his clothes was close to his heart Let us dispatch said the duke My lord one last favor What speak make haste Bind my arms my lord fast Why bind thee That I may not be considered as your accomplice Your hands asked Grimaud Not before me behind me But with what asked the duke With your belt my lord replied La Ramee The duke undid his belt and gave it to Grimaud who tied La Ramee in such a way as to satisfy him Your feet too said Grimaud La Ramee stretched out his legs Grimaud took a table cloth tore it into strips and tied La Ramee s feet together Now my lord said the poor man let me have the poire d angoisse I ask for it without it I should be tried in a court of justice because I did not raise the alarm Thrust it into my mouth my lord thrust it in Grimaud prepared to comply with this request when the officer made a sign as if he had something to say Speak said the duke Now my lord do not forget if any harm happens to me on your account that I have a wife and four children Rest assured put the gag in Grimaud In a second La Ramee was gagged and laid prostrate Two or three chairs were thrown down as if there had been a struggle Grimaud then took from the pocket of the officer all the keys it contained and first opened the door of the room in which they were then shut it and double locked it and both he and the duke proceeded rapidly down the gallery which led to the little inclosure At last they reached the tennis court It was completely deserted No sentinels no one at any of the windows The duke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch three cavaliers with two riding horses The duke exchanged a signal with them It was indeed for him that they were there Grimaud meantime undid the means of escape This was not however a rope ladder but a ball of silk cord with a narrow board which was to pass between the legs the ball to unwind itself by the weight of the person who sat astride upon the board Go said the duke First my lord inquired Grimaud Certainly If I am caught I risk nothing but being taken back again to prison If they catch thee thou wilt be hung True replied Grimaud And instantly Grimaud sitting upon the board as if on horseback commenced his perilous descent The duke followed him with his eyes with involuntary terror He had gone down about three quarters of the length of the wall when the cord broke Grimaud fell precipitated into the moat The duke uttered a cry but Grimaud did not give a single moan He must have been dreadfully hurt for he did not stir from the place where he fell Immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied under Grimaud s shoulders the end of a cord and the remaining two who held the other end drew Grimaud to them Descend my lord said the man in the moat There are only fifteen feet more from the top down here and the grass is soft The duke had already begun to descend His task was the more difficult as there was no board to support him He was obliged to let himself down by his hands and from a height of fifty feet But as we have said he was active strong and full of presence of mind In less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the cord He was then only fifteen feet from the ground as the gentlemen below had told him He let go the rope and fell upon his feet without receiving any injury He instantly began to climb up the slope of the moat on the top of which he met De Rochefort The other two gentlemen were unknown to him Grimaud in a swoon was tied securely to a horse Gentlemen said the duke I will thank you later now we have not a moment to lose On then on those who love me follow me And he jumped on his horse and set off at full gallop snuffing the fresh air in his triumph and shouting out with an expression of face which it would be impossible to describe Free free free twenty four The timely Arrival of D Artagnan in Paris At Blois D Artagnan received the money paid to him by Mazarin for any future service he might render the cardinal From Blois to Paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers but D Artagnan arrived on the third day at the Barriere Saint Denis In turning the corner of the Rue Montmartre in order to reach the Rue Tiquetonne and the Hotel de la Chevrette where he had appointed Porthos to meet him he saw at one of the windows of the hotel that friend himself dressed in a sky blue waistcoat embroidered with silver and gaping till he showed every one of his white teeth whilst the people passing by admiringly gazed at this gentleman so handsome and so rich who seemed to weary of his riches and his greatness D Artagnan and Planchet had hardly turned the corner when Porthos recognized them Eh D Artagnan he cried Thank God you have come Eh good day dear friend replied D Artagnan Porthos came down at once to the threshold of the hotel Ah my dear friend he cried what bad stabling for my horses here Indeed said D Artagnan I am most unhappy to hear it on account of those fine animals And I also I was also wretchedly off he answered moving backward and forward as he spoke and had it not been for the hostess he added with his air of vulgar self complacency who is very agreeable and understands a joke I should have got a lodging elsewhere The pretty Madeleine who had approached during this colloquy stepped back and turned pale as death on hearing Porthos s words for she thought the scene with the Swiss was about to be repeated But to her great surprise D Artagnan remained perfectly calm and instead of being angry he laughed and said to Porthos Yes I understand the air of La Rue Tiquetonne is not like that of Pierrefonds but console yourself I will soon conduct you to one much better When will you do that Immediately I hope Ah so much the better To that exclamation of Porthos s succeeded a groaning low and profound which seemed to come from behind a door D Artagnan who had just dismounted then saw outlined against the wall the enormous stomach of Mousqueton whose down drawn mouth emitted sounds of distress And you too my poor Monsieur Mouston are out of place in this poor hotel are you not asked D Artagnan in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or mockery He finds the cooking detestable replied Porthos Why then doesn t he attend to it himself as at Chantilly Ah monsieur I have not here as I had there the ponds of monsieur le prince where I could catch those beautiful carp nor the forests of his highness to provide me with partridges As for the cellar I have searched every part and poor stuff I found Monsieur Mouston said D Artagnan I should indeed condole with you had I not at this moment something very pressing to attend to Then taking Porthos aside My dear Du Vallon he said here you are in full dress most fortunately for I am going to take you to the cardinal s Gracious me really exclaimed Porthos opening his great wondering eyes Yes my friend A presentation indeed Does that alarm you No but it agitates me Oh don t be distressed you have to deal with a cardinal of another kind This one will not oppress you by his dignity Tis the same thing you understand me D Artagnan a court There s no court now Alas The queen I was going to say there s no longer a queen The queen Rest assured we shall not see her And you say that we are going from here to the Palais Royal Immediately Only that there may be no delay I shall borrow one of your horses Certainly all the four are at your service Oh I need only one of them for the time being Shall we take our valets Yes you may as well take Mousqueton As to Planchet he has certain reasons for not going to court And what are they Oh he doesn t stand well with his eminence Mouston said Porthos saddle Vulcan and Bayard And for myself monsieur shall I saddle Rustaud No take a more stylish horse Phoebus or Superbe we are going with some ceremony Ah said Mousqueton breathing more freely you are only going then to make a visit Oh yes of course Mouston nothing else But to avoid risk put the pistols in the holsters You will find mine on my saddle already loaded Mouston breathed a sigh he couldn t understand visits of ceremony made under arms Indeed said Porthos looking complacently at his old lackey as he went away you are right D Artagnan Mouston will do Mouston has a very fine appearance D Artagnan smiled But you my friend are you not going to change your dress No I shall go as I am This traveling dress will serve to show the cardinal my haste to obey his commands They set out on Vulcan and Bayard followed by Mousqueton on Phoebus and arrived at the Palais Royal at about a quarter to seven The streets were crowded for it was the day of Pentecost and the crowd looked in wonder at these two cavaliers one as fresh as if he had come out of a bandbox the other so covered with dust that he looked as if he had but just come off a field of battle Mousqueton also attracted attention and as the romance of Don Quixote was then the fashion they said that he was Sancho who after having lost one master had found two On reaching the palace D Artagnan sent to his eminence the letter in which he had been ordered to return without delay He was soon ordered to the presence of the cardinal Courage he whispered to Porthos as they proceeded Do not be intimidated Believe me the eye of the eagle is closed forever We have only the vulture to deal with Hold yourself as bolt upright as on the day of the bastion of saint Gervais and do not bow too low to this Italian that might give him a poor idea of you Good answered Porthos Good Mazarin was in his study working at a list of pensions and benefices of which he was trying to reduce the number He saw D Artagnan and Porthos enter with internal pleasure yet showed no joy in his countenance Ah you is it Monsieur le lieutenant you have been very prompt Tis well Welcome to ye Thanks my lord Here I am at your eminence s service as well as Monsieur du Vallon one of my old friends who used to conceal his nobility under the name of Porthos 
2238_121415_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Porthos bowed 
none	none	to the cardinal A magnificent cavalier remarked Mazarin Porthos turned his head to the right and to the left and drew himself up with a movement full of dignity The best swordsman in the kingdom my lord said D Artagnan Porthos bowed to his friend Mazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as in later times Frederick of Prussia used to be He admired the strong hands the broad shoulders and the steady eye of Porthos He seemed to see before him the salvation of his administration and of the kingdom sculptured in flesh and bone He remembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four persons And your two other friends he asked Porthos opened his mouth thinking it a good opportunity to put in a word in his turn D Artagnan checked him by a glance from the corner of his eye They are prevented at this moment but will join us later Mazarin coughed a little And this gentleman being disengaged takes to the service willingly he asked Yes my lord and from pure devotion to the cause for Monsieur de Bracieux is rich Rich said Mazarin whom that single word always inspired with a great respect Fifty thousand francs a year said Porthos These were the first words he had spoken From pure zeal resumed Mazarin with his artful smile from pure zeal and devotion then My lord has perhaps no faith in those words said D Artagnan Have you Monsieur le Gascon asked Mazarin supporting his elbows on his desk and his chin on his hands I replied the Gascon I believe in devotion as a word at one s baptism for instance which naturally comes before one s proper name every one is naturally more or less devout certainly but there should be at the end of one s devotion something to gain And your friend for instance what does he expect to have at the end of his devotion Well my lord my friend has three magnificent estates that of Vallon at Corbeil that of Bracieux in the Soissonais and that of Pierrefonds in the Valois Now my lord he would like to have one of his three estates erected into a barony Only that said Mazarin his eyes twinkling with joy on seeing that he could pay for Porthos s devotion without opening his purse only that That can be managed I shall be baron explained Porthos stepping forward I told you so said D Artagnan checking him with his hand and now his eminence confirms it And you Monsieur D Artagnan what do you want My lord said D Artagnan it is twenty years since Cardinal de Richelieu made me lieutenant Yes and you would be gratified if Cardinal Mazarin should make you captain D Artagnan bowed Well that is not impossible We will see gentlemen we will see Now Monsieur de Vallon said Mazarin what service do you prefer in the town or in the country Porthos opened his mouth to reply My lord said D Artagnan Monsieur de Vallon is like me he prefers service extraordinary that is to say enterprises that are considered mad and impossible That boastfulness was not displeasing to Mazarin he fell into meditation And yet he said I must admit that I sent for you to appoint you to quiet service I have certain apprehensions well what is the meaning of that In fact a great noise was heard in the ante chamber at the same time the door of the study was burst open and a man covered with dust rushed into it exclaiming My lord the cardinal my lord the cardinal Mazarin thought that some one was going to assassinate him and he drew back pushing his chair on the castors D Artagnan and Porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person entering and the cardinal Well sir exclaimed Mazarin what s the matter and why do you rush in here as if you were about to penetrate a crowded market place My lord replied the messenger I wish to speak to your eminence in secret I am Monsieur du Poins an officer in the guards on duty at the donjon of Vincennes Mazarin perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that he had something of importance to say made a sign that D Artagnan and Porthos should give place D Artagnan and Porthos withdrew to a corner of the cabinet Speak monsieur speak at once said Mazarin What is the matter The matter is my lord that the Duc de Beaufort has contrived to escape from the Chateau of Vincennes Mazarin uttered a cry and became paler than the man who had brought the news He fell back almost fainting in his chair Escaped Monsieur de Beaufort escaped My lord I saw him run off from the top of the terrace And you did not fire on him He was out of range Monsieur de Chavigny where was he Absent And La Ramee Was found locked up in the prisoner s room a gag in his mouth and a poniard near him But the man who was under him Was an accomplice of the duke s and escaped along with him Mazarin groaned My lord said D Artagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious time It may still be possible to overtake the prisoner France is large the nearest frontier is sixty leagues distant And who is to pursue him cried Mazarin I pardieu And you would arrest him Why not You would arrest the Duc de Beaufort armed in the field If your eminence should order me to arrest the devil I would seize him by the horns and would bring him in So would I said Porthos So would you said Mazarin looking with astonishment at those two men But the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle Very well said D Artagnan his eyes aflame battle It is a long time since we have had a battle eh Porthos Battle cried Porthos And you think you can catch him Yes if we are better mounted than he Go then take what guards you find here and pursue him You command us my lord to do so And I sign my orders said Mazarin taking a piece of paper and writing some lines Monsieur du Vallon your barony is on the back of the Duc de Beaufort s horse you have nothing to do but to overtake it As for you my dear lieutenant I promise you nothing but if you bring him back to me dead or alive you may ask all you wish To horse Porthos said D Artagnan taking his friend by the hand Here I am smiled Porthos with his sublime composure They descended the great staircase taking with them all the guards they found on their road and crying out To arms To arms and immediately put spur to horse which set off along the Rue Saint Honore with the speed of the whirlwind Well baron I promise you some good exercise said the Gascon Yes my captain As they went the citizens awakened left their doors and the street dogs followed the cavaliers barking At the corner of the Cimetiere Saint Jean D Artagnan upset a man it was too insignificant an occurrence to delay people so eager to get on The troop continued its course as though their steeds had wings Alas there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the monarchy twenty five An Adventure on the High Road The musketeers rode the whole length of the Faubourg Saint Antoine and of the road to Vincennes and soon found themselves out of the town then in a forest and then within sight of a village The horses seemed to become more lively with each successive step their nostrils reddened like glowing furnaces D Artagnan freely applying his spurs was in advance of Porthos two feet at the most Mousqueton followed two lengths behind the guards were scattered according to the varying excellence of their respective mounts From the top of an eminence D Artagnan perceived a group of people collected on the other side of the moat in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward Saint Maur He rode on convinced that in this direction he would gain intelligence of the fugitive In five minutes he had arrived at the place where the guards joined him coming up one by one The several members of that group were much excited They looked at the cord still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty feet from the ground Their eyes measured the height and they exchanged conjectures On the top of the wall sentinels went and came with a frightened air A few soldiers commanded by a sergeant drove away idlers from the place where the duke had mounted his horse D Artagnan went straight to the sergeant My officer said the sergeant it is not permitted to stop here That prohibition is not for me said D Artagnan Have the fugitives been pursued Yes my officer unfortunately they are well mounted How many are there Four and a fifth whom they carried away wounded Four said D Artagnan looking at Porthos Do you hear baron They are only four A joyous smile lighted Porthos s face How long a start have they Two hours and a quarter my officer Two hours and a quarter that is nothing we are well mounted are we not Porthos Porthos breathed a sigh he thought of what was in store for his poor horses Very good said D Artagnan and now in what direction did they set out That I am forbidden to tell D Artagnan drew from his pocket a paper Order of the king he said Speak to the governor then And where is the governor In the country Anger mounted to D Artagnan s face he frowned and his cheeks were colored Ah you scoundrel he said to the sergeant I believe you are impudent to me Wait He unfolded the paper presented it to the sergeant with one hand and with the other took a pistol from his holsters and cocked it Order of the king I tell you Read and answer or I will blow out your brains The sergeant saw that D Artagnan was in earnest The Vendomois road he replied And by what gate did they go out By the Saint Maur gate If you are deceiving me rascal you will be hanged to morrow And if you catch up with them you won t come back to hang me murmured the sergeant D Artagnan shrugged his shoulders made a sign to his escort and started This way gentlemen this way he cried directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed out But now that the duke had escaped the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double lock It was necessary to compel him to open it as the sergeant had been compelled to speak and this took another ten minutes This last obstacle having been overcome the troop pursued their course with their accustomed ardor but some of the horses could no longer sustain this pace three of them stopped after an hour s gallop and one fell down D Artagnan who never turned his head did not perceive it Porthos told him of it in his calm manner If only we two arrive said D Artagnan it will be enough since the duke s troop are only four in number That is true said Porthos And he spurred his courser on At the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues without stopping their legs began to tremble and the foam they shed whitened the doublets of their masters Let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing time said Porthos Let us rather kill them yes kill them cried D Artagnan I see fresh tracks tis not a quarter of an hour since they passed this place In fact the road was trodden by horses feet visible even in the approaching gloom of evening They set out after a run of two leagues Mousqueton s horse sank Gracious me said Porthos there s Phoebus ruined The cardinal will pay you a hundred pistoles I m above that Let us set out again at full gallop Yes if we can But at last the lieutenant s horse refused to go on he could not breathe one last spur instead of making him advance made him fall The devil exclaimed Porthos there s Vulcan foundered Zounds cried D Artagnan then we must stop Give me your horse Porthos What the devil are you doing By Jove I am falling or rather Bayard is falling answered Porthos All three then cried All s over Hush said D Artagnan What is it I hear a horse It belongs to one of our companions who is overtaking us No said D Artagnan it is in advance That is another thing said Porthos and he listened toward the quarter indicated by D Artagnan Monsieur said Mousqueton who abandoning his horse on the high road had come on foot to rejoin his master Phoebus could no longer hold out and Silence said Porthos In fact at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night wind It is five hundred feet from here in advance said D Artagnan True monsieur said Mousqueton and five hundred feet from here is a small hunting house Mousqueton thy pistols said D Artagnan I have them at hand monsieur Porthos take yours from your holsters I have them Good said D Artagnan seizing his own now you understand Porthos Not too well We are out on the king s service Well For the king s service we need horses That is true said Porthos Then not a word but set to work They went on through the darkness silent as phantoms they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some trees Yonder is the house Porthos said the Gascon let me do what I please and do you what I do They glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the house unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut four fine horses A groom was rubbing them down near them were saddles and bridles D Artagnan approached quickly making a sign to his two companions to remain a few steps behind I buy those horses he said to the groom The groom turned toward him with a look of surprise but made no reply Didn t you hear fellow Yes I heard Why then didn t you reply Because these horses are not to be sold was the reply I take them then said the lieutenant And he took hold of one within his reach his two companions did the same thing Sir cried the groom they have traversed six leagues and have only been unsaddled half an hour Half an hour s rest is enough replied the Gascon The groom cried aloud for help A kind of steward appeared just as D Artagnan and his companions were prepared to mount The steward attempted to expostulate My dear friend cried the lieutenant if you say a word I will blow out your brains But sir answered the steward do you know that these horses belong to Monsieur de Montbazon So much the better they must be good animals then Sir I shall call my people And I mine I ve ten guards behind me don t you hear them gallop and I m one of the king s musketeers Come Porthos come Mousqueton They all mounted the horses as quickly as possible Halloo hi hi cried the steward the house servants with the carbines On on cried D Artagnan there ll be firing on They all set off swift as the wind Here cried the steward here whilst the groom ran to a neighboring building Take care of your horses cried D Artagnan to him Fire replied the steward A gleam like a flash of lightning illumined the road and with the flash was heard the whistling of balls which were fired wildly in the air They fire like grooms said Porthos In the time of the cardinal people fired better than that do you remember the road to Crevecoeur Mousqueton Ah sir my left side still pains me Are you sure we are on the right track lieutenant Egad didn t you hear these horses belong to Monsieur de Montbazon well Monsieur de Montbazon is the husband of Madame de Montbazon And And Madame de Montbazon is the mistress of the Duc de Beaufort Ah I understand replied Porthos she has ordered relays of horses Exactly so And we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left My dear Porthos you are really a man of most superior understanding said D Artagnan with a look as if he spoke against his conviction Pooh replied Porthos I am what I am They rode on for an hour till the horses were covered with foam and dust Zounds what is yonder cried D Artagnan You are very lucky if you see anything such a night as this said Porthos Something bright I too cried Mousqueton saw them also Ah ah have we overtaken them Good a dead horse said D Artagnan pulling up his horse which shied it seems their horses too are breaking down as well as ours I seem to hear the noise of a troop of horsemen exclaimed Porthos leaning over his horse s mane Impossible They appear to be numerous Then tis something else Another horse said Porthos Dead No dying Saddled Yes saddled and bridled Then we are upon the fugitives Courage we have them But if they are numerous observed Mousqueton tis not we who have them but they who have us Nonsense cried D Artagnan they ll suppose us to be stronger than themselves as we re in pursuit they ll be afraid and will disperse Certainly remarked Porthos Ah do you see cried the lieutenant The lights again this time I too saw them said Porthos On on forward forward cried D Artagnan in his stentorian voice we shall laugh over all this in five minutes And they darted on anew The horses excited by pain and emulation raced over the dark road in the midst of which was now seen a moving mass denser and more obscure than the rest of the horizon twenty six The Rencontre They rode on in this way for ten minutes Suddenly two dark forms seemed to separate from the mass advanced grew in size and as they loomed up larger and larger assumed the appearance of two horsemen Aha cried D Artagnan they re coming toward us So much the worse for them said Porthos Who goes there cried a hoarse voice The three horsemen made no reply stopped not and all that was heard was the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards and the cocking of the pistols with which the two phantoms were armed Bridle in mouth said D Artagnan Porthos understood him and he and the lieutenant each drew with the left hand a pistol from their bolsters and cocked it in their turn Who goes there was asked a second time Not a step forward or you re dead men Stuff cried Porthos almost choked with dust and chewing his bridle as a horse chews his bit Stuff and nonsense we have seen plenty of dead men in our time Hearing these words the two shadows blockaded the road and by the light of the stars might be seen the shining of their arms Back shouted D Artagnan or you are dead Two shots were the reply to this threat but the assailants attacked their foes with such velocity that in a moment they were upon them a third pistol shot was heard aimed by D Artagnan and one of his adversaries fell As for Porthos he assaulted the foe with such violence that although his sword was thrust aside the enemy was thrown off his horse and fell about ten steps from it Finish Mouston finish the work cried Porthos And he darted on beside his friend who had already begun a fresh pursuit Well said Porthos I ve broken my man s skull cried D Artagnan And you I ve only thrown the fellow down but hark Another shot of a carbine was heard It was Mousqueton who was obeying his master s command On on cried D Artagnan all goes well we have the first throw Ha ha answered Porthos behold other players appear And in fact two other cavaliers made their appearance detached as it seemed from the principal group they again disputed the road This time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak Stand aside he cried stand off the road What do you want asked a voice The duke Porthos and D Artagnan roared out both at once A burst of laughter was the answer but finished with a groan D Artagnan had with his sword cut in two the poor wretch who had laughed At the same time Porthos and his adversary fired on each other and D Artagnan turned to him Bravo you ve killed him I think No wounded his horse only What would you have my dear fellow One doesn t hit the bull s eye every time it is something to hit inside the ring Ho parbleau what is the matter with my horse Your horse is falling said Porthos reining in his own In truth the lieutenant s horse stumbled and fell on his knees then a rattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to die He had received in the chest the bullet of D Artagnan s first adversary D Artagnan swore loud enough to be heard in the skies Does your honor want a horse asked Mousqueton Zounds want one cried the Gascon Here s one your honor How the devil hast thou two horses asked D Artagnan jumping on one of them Their masters are dead I thought they might be useful so I took them Meantime Porthos had reloaded his pistols Be on the qui vive cried D Artagnan Here are two other cavaliers As he spoke two horsemen advanced at full speed Ho your honor cried Mousqueton the man you upset is getting up Why didn t thou do as thou didst to the first man said Porthos I held the horses my hands were full your honor A shot was fired that moment Mousqueton shrieked with pain Ah sir I m hit in the other side exactly opposite the other This hurt is just the fellow of the one I had on the road to Amiens Porthos turned around like a lion plunged on the dismounted cavalier who tried to draw his sword but before it was out of the scabbard Porthos with the hilt of his had struck him such a terrible blow on the head that he fell like an ox beneath the butcher s knife Mousqueton groaning slipped from his horse his wound not allowing him to keep the saddle On perceiving the cavaliers D Artagnan had stopped and charged his pistol afresh besides his horse he found had a carbine on the bow of the saddle Here I am exclaimed Porthos Shall we wait or shall we charge Let us charge them answered the Gascon Charge cried Porthos They spurred on their horses the other cavaliers were only twenty steps from them For the king cried D Artagnan The king has no authority here answered a deep voice which seemed to proceed from a cloud so enveloped was the cavalier in a whirlwind of dust Tis well we will see if the king s name is not a passport everywhere replied the Gascon See answered the voice Two shots were fired at once one by D Artagnan the other by the adversary of Porthos D Artagnan s ball took off his enemy s hat The ball fired by Porthos s foe went through the throat of his horse which fell groaning For the last time where are you going To the devil answered D Artagnan Good you may be easy then you ll get there D Artagnan then saw a musket barrel leveled at him he had no time to draw from his holsters He recalled a bit of advice which Athos had once given him and made his horse rear The ball struck the animal full in front D Artagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one side Ah this cried the voice the tone of which was at once polished and jeering this is nothing but a butchery of horses and not a combat between men To the sword sir the sword And he jumped off his horse To the swords be it so replied D Artagnan that is exactly what I want D Artagnan in two steps was engaged with the foe whom according to custom he attacked impetuously but he met this time with a skill and a strength of arm that gave him pause Twice he was obliged to step back his opponent stirred not one inch D Artagnan returned and again attacked him Twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides without effect sparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting forth At last D Artagnan thought it was time to try one of his favorite feints in fencing He brought it to bear skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning and struck the blow with a force which he fancied would prove irresistible The blow was parried Sdeath he cried with his Gascon accent At this exclamation his adversary bounded back and bending his bare head tried to distinguish in the gloom the features of the lieutenant As to D Artagnan afraid of some feint he still stood on the defensive Have a care cried Porthos to his opponent I ve still two pistols charged The more reason you should fire the first cried his foe Porthos fired the flash threw a gleam of light over the field of battle As the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two combatants Athos exclaimed D Artagnan D Artagnan ejaculated Athos Athos raised his sword D Artagnan lowered his Aramis cried Athos don t fire Ah ha is it you Aramis said Porthos And he threw away his pistol Aramis pushed his back into his saddle bags and sheathed his sword My son exclaimed Athos extending his hand to D Artagnan This was the name which he gave him in former days in their moments of tender intimacy Athos cried D Artagnan wringing his hands So you defend him And I who have sworn to take him dead or alive I am dishonored and by you Kill me replied Athos uncovering his breast if your honor requires my death Oh woe is me woe is me cried the lieutenant there s only one man in the world who could stay my hand by a fatality that very man bars my way What shall I say to the cardinal You can tell him sir answered a voice which was the voice of high command in the battle field that he sent against me the only two men capable of getting the better of four men of fighting man to man without discomfiture against the Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier d Herblay and of surrendering only to fifty men The prince exclaimed at the same moment Athos and Aramis unmasking as they addressed the Duc de Beaufort whilst D Artagnan and Porthos stepped backward Fifty cavaliers cried the Gascon and Porthos Look around you gentlemen if you doubt the fact said the duke The two friends looked to the right to the left they were encompassed by a troop of horsemen Hearing the noise of the fight resumed the duke I fancied you had about twenty men with you so I came back with those around me tired of always running away and wishing to draw my sword in my own cause but you are only two Yes my lord but as you have said two that are a match for twenty said Athos Come gentlemen your swords said the duke Our swords cried D Artagnan raising his head and regaining his self possession Never Never added Porthos Some of the men moved toward them One moment my lord whispered Athos and he said something in a low voice As you will replied the duke I am too much indebted to you to refuse your first request Gentlemen he said to his escort withdraw Monsieur d Artagnan Monsieur du Vallon you are free The order was obeyed D Artagnan and Porthos then found themselves in the centre of a large circle Now D Herblay said Athos dismount and come here Aramis dismounted and went to Porthos whilst Athos approached D Artagnan All four once more together Friends said Athos do you regret you have not shed our blood No replied D Artagnan I regret to see that we hitherto united are opposed to each other Ah nothing will ever go well with us hereafter Oh Heaven No all is over said Porthos Well be on our side now resumed Aramis Silence D Herblay cried Athos such proposals are not to be made to gentlemen such as these Tis a matter of conscience with them as with us Meantime here we are enemies said Porthos Gramercy who would ever have thought it D Artagnan only sighed Athos looked at them both and took their hands in his Gentlemen he said this is a serious business and my heart bleeds as if you had pierced it through and through Yes we are severed there is the great the distressing truth But we have not as yet declared war perhaps we shall have to make certain conditions therefore a solemn conference is indispensable For my own part I demand it said Aramis I accept it interposed D Artagnan proudly Porthos bowed as if in assent Let us choose a place of rendezvous continued Athos and in a last interview arrange our mutual position and the conduct we are to maintain toward each other Good the other three exclaimed Well then the place Will the Place Royale suit you asked D Artagnan In Paris Yes Athos and Aramis looked at each other The Place Royale be it so replied Athos When To morrow evening if you like At what hour At ten in the evening if that suits you by that time we shall have returned Good There continued Athos either peace or war will be decided honor at all events will be maintained Alas murmured D Artagnan our honor as soldiers is lost to us forever D Artagnan said Athos gravely I assure you that you do me wrong in dwelling so upon that What I think of is that we have crossed swords as enemies Yes he continued sadly shaking his head Yes it is as you said misfortune indeed has overtaken us Come Aramis And we Porthos said D Artagnan will return carrying our shame to the cardinal And tell him cried a voice that I am not too old yet for a man of action D Artagnan recognized the voice of De Rochefort Can I do anything for you gentlemen asked the duke Bear witness that we have done all that we could That shall be testified to rest assured Adieu we shall meet soon I trust in Paris where you shall have your revenge The duke as he spoke kissed his hand spurred his horse into a gallop and disappeared followed by his troop who were soon lost in distance and darkness D Artagnan and Porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses they thought it was Mousqueton and went up to him What do I see cried the lieutenant Grimaud is it thou Grimaud signified that he was not mistaken And whose horses are these cried D Artagnan Who has given them to us said Porthos The Comte de la Fere Athos Athos muttered D Artagnan you think of every one you are indeed a nobleman Whither art thou going Grimaud To join the Vicomte de Bragelonne in Flanders your honor They were taking the road toward Paris when groans which seemed to proceed from a ditch attracted their attention What is that asked D Artagnan It is I Mousqueton said a mournful voice whilst a sort of shadow arose out of the side of the road Porthos ran to him Art thou dangerously wounded my dear Mousqueton he said No sir but I am severely What can we do said D Artagnan we must return to Paris I will take care of Mousqueton said Grimaud and he gave his arm to his old comrade whose eyes were full of tears nor could Grimaud tell whether the tears were caused by wounds or by the pleasure of seeing him again D Artagnan and Porthos went on meantime to Paris They were passed by a sort of courier covered with dust the bearer of a letter from the duke to the cardinal giving testimony to the valor of D Artagnan and Porthos Mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him announcing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up mortal strife against him What consoles me said the cardinal after reading the letter is that at least in this chase D Artagnan has done me one good turn he has destroyed Broussel This Gascon is a precious fellow even his misadventures are of use The cardinal referred to that man whom D Artagnan upset at the corner of the Cimetiere Saint Jean in Paris and who was no other than the Councillor Broussel twenty seven The four old Friends prepare to meet again 
1353-121397-0000	train-other-500	Well said Porthos seated in the courtyard of the Hotel de la Chevrette to D Artagnan who with a long and melancholy face had returned from the Palais Royal did he receive you ungraciously my dear friend

1353-121397-0004	train-other-500	Yes I know that he said but give me the particulars You know Porthos I could not give him the particulars without naming our friends to name them would be to commit them to ruin so I merely said they were fifty
1353-121397-0005	train-other-500	and we were two There was firing nevertheless I heard he said and your swords they saw the light of day I presume That is the night my lord I answered Ah cried the cardinal

none	none	 for if they had been able to keep up with you and if each one of them had done as much as you and your friend you would have kept your word and would have brought him back to me dead or alive Well there s nothing bad in that it seems to me said Porthos Oh mon Dieu no nothing at all It was the way in which he spoke 
1353-121397-0007	train-other-500	It is incredible how these biscuit soak up wine They are veritable sponges

1353-121397-0008	train-other-500	The bottle was brought with a promptness which showed the degree of consideration D Artagnan enjoyed in the establishment He continued So I was going away but he called me back
none	none	 You have had three horses foundered or killed he asked me Yes my lord How much were they worth Why said Porthos that was very good of him it seems to me A thousand pistoles I said A thousand pistoles Porthos exclaimed Oh oh that is a large sum If he knew anything about horses he would dispute the price Faith he was very much inclined to do so the contemptible fellow He made a great start and looked at me I also looked at him 
1353-121397-0009	train-other-500	then he understood and putting his hand into a drawer
none	none	 he took from it a quantity of notes on a bank in Lyons 
1353-121397-0010	train-other-500	For a thousand pistoles For a thousand pistoles just that amount the beggar not one too many And you have them They are here Upon my word I think he acted very generously
1353-121397-0011	train-other-500	Generously to men who had risked their lives for him and besides had done him a great service A great service what was that Why it seems that I crushed for him a parliament councillor What
none	none	 that little man in black that you upset at the corner of Saint Jean Cemetery 
1353-121397-0012	train-other-500	That s the man my dear fellow he was an annoyance to the cardinal Unfortunately I didn t crush him flat It seems that he came to himself and that he will continue to be an annoyance
1353-121397-0013	train-other-500	See that now said Porthos and I turned my horse aside from going plump on to him That will be for another time He owed me for the councillor the pettifogger
1353-121397-0014	train-other-500	But said Porthos if he was not crushed completely Ah Monsieur de Richelieu would have said Five hundred crowns for the councillor
none	none	 Well let s say no more about it 
1353-121397-0015	train-other-500	How much were your animals worth Porthos
none	none	 Ah if poor Mousqueton were here he could tell you to a fraction No matter you can tell within ten crowns 
1353-121397-0016	train-other-500	Why Vulcan and Bayard cost me each about two hundred pistoles and putting Phoebus at a hundred and fifty we should be pretty near the amount
1353-121397-0017	train-other-500	There will remain then four hundred and fifty pistoles said D Artagnan contentedly Yes said Porthos but there are the equipments
none	none	 That is very true Well how much for the equipments 
1353-121397-0018	train-other-500	If we say one hundred pistoles for the three Good for the hundred pistoles there remains then three hundred and fifty Porthos made a sign of assent
none	none	 We will give the fifty pistoles to the hostess for our expenses said D Artagnan and share the three hundred We will share said Porthos A paltry piece of business murmured D Artagnan crumpling his note Pooh said Porthos 
1353-121397-0019	train-other-500	it is always that But tell me What Didn t he speak of me in any way Ah yes indeed cried D Artagnan who was afraid of disheartening his friend by telling him that the cardinal had not breathed a word about him
none	none	 yes surely he said He said resumed Porthos 
1353-121397-0020	train-other-500	Stop I want to remember his exact words He said As to your friend tell him he may sleep in peace Good very good said Porthos that signified as clear as daylight that he still intends to make me a baron
1353-121397-0021	train-other-500	At this moment nine o clock struck D Artagnan started Ah yes said Porthos there is nine o clock We have a rendezvous you remember at the Place Royale Ah stop hold your peace Porthos don t remind me of it
1353-121397-0022	train-other-500	tis that which has made me so cross since yesterday I shall not go Why asked Porthos Because it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who caused the failure of our enterprise And yet said Porthos
1353-121397-0023	train-other-500	neither of them had any advantage over us I still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight sword in hand Yes said D Artagnan but what if this rendezvous had some hidden purpose
1353-121397-0024	train-other-500	Oh said Porthos you can t think that D Artagnan D Artagnan did not believe Athos to be capable of a deception but he sought an excuse for not going to the rendezvous We must go said the superb lord of Bracieux
1353-121397-0025	train-other-500	lest they should say we were afraid We who have faced fifty foes on the high road can well meet two in the Place Royale Yes yes but they took part with the princes without apprising us of it
none	none	 Athos and Aramis have played a game with me which alarms me 
1353-121397-0026	train-other-500	We discovered yesterday the truth what is the use of going to day to learn something else You really have some distrust then said Porthos Of Aramis yes since he has become an abbe
1353-121397-0027	train-other-500	You can t imagine my dear fellow the sort of man he is He sees us on the road which leads him to a bishopric and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his way
none	none	 Ah as regards Aramis that is another thing said Porthos 
1353-121397-0028	train-other-500	and it wouldn t surprise me at all Perhaps Monsieur de Beaufort will try in his turn to lay hands on us Nonsense
none	none	 He had us in his power and he let us go Besides we can be on our guard let us take arms let Planchet post himself behind us with his carbine Planchet is a Frondeur answered D Artagnan Devil take these civil wars 
1353-121397-0029	train-other-500	one can no more now reckon on one s friends than on one s footmen said Porthos Ah if Mousqueton were here there s a fellow who will never desert me So long as you are rich
1353-121397-0030	train-other-500	Ah my friend tis not civil war that disunites us It is that we are each of us twenty years older it is that the honest emotions of youth have given place to suggestions of interest
1353-121397-0031	train-other-500	whispers of ambition counsels of selfishness Yes you are right let us go Porthos but let us go well armed were we not to keep the rendezvous they would declare we were afraid
none	none	 Halloo Planchet 
1353-121397-0032	train-other-500	here saddle our horses take your carbine Whom are we going to attack sir No one a mere matter of precaution answered the Gascon
1353-121397-0033	train-other-500	You know sir that they wished to murder that good councillor Broussel the father of the people Really did they said D Artagnan Yes but he has been avenged
none	none	 He was carried home in the arms of the people 
1353-121397-0034	train-other-500	His house has been full ever since He has received visits from the coadjutor from Madame de Longueville and the Prince de Conti Madame de Chevreuse and Madame de Vendome have left their names at his door
1353-121397-0035	train-other-500	And now whenever he wishes Well whenever he wishes
none	none	 Planchet began to sing Un vent de fronde S est leve ce matin Je crois qu il gronde Contre le Mazarin Un vent de fronde S est leve ce matin 
1353-121397-0036	train-other-500	It doesn t surprise me said D Artagnan in a low tone to Porthos that Mazarin would have been much better satisfied had I crushed the life out of his councillor
none	none	 You understand then monsieur resumed Planchet 
1353-121397-0037	train-other-500	that if it were for some enterprise like that undertaken against Monsieur Broussel that you should ask me to take my carbine
none	none	 No don t be alarmed but where did you get all these details From a good source sir I heard it from Friquet From Friquet I know that name A son of Monsieur de Broussel s servant and a lad that 
1353-121397-0038	train-other-500	I promise you in a revolt will not give away his share to the dogs Is he not a singing boy
none	none	 at Notre Dame asked D Artagnan Yes that is the very boy he s patronized by Bazin 
1353-121397-0039	train-other-500	Ah yes I know Of what importance is this little reptile to you asked Porthos Gad replied D Artagnan he has already given me good information and he may do the same again Whilst all this was going on
none	none	 Athos and Aramis were entering Paris by the Faubourg saint Antoine 
1353-121397-0040	train-other-500	They had taken some refreshment on the road and hastened on that they might not fail at the appointed place Bazin was their only attendant for Grimaud had stayed behind to take care of Mousqueton
none	none	 As they were passing onward Athos proposed that they should lay aside their arms and military costume 
1353-121397-0041	train-other-500	and assume a dress more suited to the city Oh no dear count cried Aramis is it not a warlike encounter that we are going to What do you mean Aramis
none	none	 That the Place Royale is the termination to the main road to Vendomois and nothing else What our friends Are become our most dangerous enemies Athos Let us be on our guard Oh my dear D Herblay Who can say whether D Artagnan may not have betrayed us to the cardinal who can tell whether Mazarin may not take advantage of this rendezvous to seize us What Aramis you think that D Artagnan that Porthos would lend their hands to such an infamy Among friends my dear Athos no you are right but among enemies it would be only a stratagem Athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble head 
1353-121397-0042	train-other-500	What can you expect Athos Men are so made and we are not always twenty years old We have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which D Artagnan is blindly governed He has been beaten
1353-121397-0043	train-other-500	Did you not observe his despair on the journey As to Porthos his barony was perhaps dependent on that affair Well he found us on his road and will not be baron this time Perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this evening
none	none	 Let us take our precautions Athos But suppose they come unarmed What a disgrace to us 
1353-121397-0044	train-other-500	Oh never fear besides if they do we can easily make an excuse we came straight off a journey and are insurgents too An excuse for us to meet D Artagnan with a false excuse
none	none	 to have to make a false excuse to Porthos Oh Aramis continued Athos shaking his head mournfully upon my soul you make me the most miserable of men you disenchant a heart not wholly dead to friendship 
1353-121397-0045	train-other-500	Go in whatever guise you choose for my part I shall go unarmed No for I will not allow you to do so
none	none	 Tis not one man not Athos only not the Comte de la Fere 
1353-121397-0046	train-other-500	whom you will ruin by this amiable weakness but a whole party to whom you belong and who depend upon you
none	none	 Be it so then replied Athos sorrowfully 
1353-121397-0047	train-other-500	And they pursued their road in mournful silence Scarcely had they reached by the Rue de la Mule the iron gate of the Place Royale when they perceived three cavaliers D Artagnan
1353-121397-0048	train-other-500	Porthos and Planchet the two former wrapped up in their military cloaks under which their swords were hidden and Planchet his musket by his side
none	none	 They were waiting at the entrance of the Rue Sainte Catharine and their horses were fastened to the rings of the arcade Athos therefore commanded Bazin to fasten up his horse 
1353-121397-0049	train-other-500	and that of Aramis in the same manner
none	none	 They then advanced two and two and saluted each other politely Now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference inquired Aramis perceiving that people were stopping to look at them supposing that they were going to engage in one of those far famed duels still extant in the memory of the Parisians 
1353-121397-0050	train-other-500	and especially the inhabitants of the Place Royale The gate is shut said Aramis but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under the trees and perfect seclusion I will get the key from the Hotel de Rohan and we shall be well suited
1353-121397-0051	train-other-500	D Artagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the Place Porthos ventured to put his head between the railings to try if his glance could penetrate the gloom
none	none	 If you prefer any other place said Athos in his persuasive voice 
1353-121397-0052	train-other-500	choose for yourselves This place if Monsieur d Herblay can procure the key is the best that we can have was the answer
none	none	 Aramis went off at once begging Athos not to remain alone within reach of D Artagnan and Porthos 
1353-121397-0053	train-other-500	a piece of advice which was received with a contemptuous smile
none	none	 Aramis returned soon with a man from the Hotel de Rohan who was saying to him You swear sir that it is not so 
1353-121397-0054	train-other-500	Stop and Aramis gave him a louis d or
none	none	 Ah you will not swear my master said the concierge shaking his head Well one can never say what may happen at present we and these gentlemen are excellent friends Yes certainly added Athos and the other two 
1353-121397-0055	train-other-500	D Artagnan had heard the conversation and had understood it You see he said to Porthos What do I see That he wouldn t swear Swear what
1353-121397-0056	train-other-500	That man wanted Aramis to swear that we are not going to the Place Royale to fight And Aramis wouldn t swear No Attention then
none	none	 Athos did not lose sight of the two speakers 
1353-121397-0057	train-other-500	Aramis opened the gate and faced around in order that D Artagnan and Porthos might enter In passing through the gate the hilt of the lieutenant s sword was caught in the grating
none	none	 and he was obliged to pull off his cloak 
1353-121397-0058	train-other-500	in doing so he showed the butt end of his pistols and a ray of the moon was reflected on the shining metal
none	none	 Do you see whispered Aramis to Athos touching his shoulder with one hand and pointing with the other 
1353-121397-0059	train-other-500	to the arms which the Gascon wore under his belt
none	none	 Alas I do replied Athos with a deep sigh 
1353-121397-0060	train-other-500	He entered third and Aramis who shut the gate after him last The two serving men waited without
none	none	 but as if they likewise mistrusted each other they kept their respective distances twenty eight The Place Royale 
274_121398_000001_000000	train-clean-360	They proceeded silently to the centre of the Place but as at this very moment the moon had just emerged from behind a cloud they thought they might be observed if they remained on that spot and therefore regained the shade of the lime trees 
none	none	There were benches here and there the four gentlemen stopped near them at a sign from Athos Porthos and D Artagnan sat down the two others stood in front of them 
274_121398_000003_000000	train-clean-360	After a few minutes of silent embarrassment Athos spoke 
none	none	Gentlemen he said our presence here is the best proof of former friendship not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous not one has therefore to reproach himself
274_121398_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Hear me count replied D Artagnan instead of making compliments to each other let us explain our conduct to each other like men of right and honest hearts 
274_121398_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 I wish for nothing more have you any cause of complaint against me or Monsieur d Herblay 
274_121398_000006_000001	train-clean-360	If so speak out answered Athos 
274_121398_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 I have replied D Artagnan 
274_121398_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 When I saw you at your chateau at Bragelonne I made certain proposals to you which you perfectly understood instead of answering me as a friend you played with me as a child the friendship therefore that you boast of was not broken yesterday by the shock of swords but by your dissimulation at your castle 
none	none	D Artagnan said Athos reproachfully You asked for candor and you have it 
274_121398_000009_000001	train-clean-360	You ask what I have against you I tell you 
274_121398_000009_000002	train-clean-360	And I have the same sincerity to show you if you wish Monsieur d Herblay I acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived me 
none	none	Really monsieur you say strange things said Aramis
274_121398_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 You came seeking me to make to me certain proposals but did you make them 
274_121398_000010_000002	train-clean-360	No you sounded me nothing more 
none	none	Very well what did I say to you that Mazarin was contemptible and that I wouldn t serve Mazarin 
274_121398_000010_000005	train-clean-360	But that is all 
none	none	Did I tell you that I wouldn t serve any other On the contrary I gave you to understand I think that I adhered to the princes We even joked very pleasantly if I remember rightly on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my arrest 
274_121398_000010_000009	train-clean-360	Were you a party man 
274_121398_000010_000010	train-clean-360	There is no doubt of that 
274_121398_000010_000011	train-clean-360	Well why should not we too belong to a party 
274_121398_000010_000012	train-clean-360	You had your secret and we had ours we didn t exchange them 
274_121398_000010_000013	train-clean-360	So much the better it proves that we know how to keep our secrets 
none	none	I do not reproach you monsieur said D Artagnan tis only because Monsieur de la Fere has spoken of friendship that I question your conduct
274_121398_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 And what do you find in it that is worthy of blame asked Aramis haughtily 
274_121398_000013_000000	train-clean-360	The blood mounted instantly to the temples of D Artagnan who arose and replied 
274_121398_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 I consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of Jesuits 
274_121398_000015_000000	train-clean-360	On seeing D Artagnan rise Porthos rose also these four men were therefore all standing at the same time with a menacing aspect opposite to each other 
274_121398_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Upon hearing D Artagnan s reply Aramis seemed about to draw his sword when Athos prevented him 
274_121398_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 D Artagnan he said you are here to night still infuriated by yesterday s adventure 
none	none	I believed your heart noble enough to enable a friendship of twenty years to overcome an affront of a quarter of an hour Come do you really think you have anything to say against me Say it then if I am in fault I will avow the error The grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence whilst that of Aramis which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of ill humor irritated him He answered therefore I think monsieur le comte that you had something to communicate to me at your chateau of Bragelonne and that gentleman he pointed to Aramis had also something to tell me when I was in his convent At that time I was not concerned in the adventure in the course of which you have so successfully estopped me 
274_121398_000019_000002	train-clean-360	However because I was prudent you must not take me for a fool 
none	none	If I had wished to widen the breach between those whom Monsieur d Herblay chooses to receive with a rope ladder and those whom he receives with a wooden ladder I could have spoken out
274_121398_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 What are you meddling with cried Aramis pale with anger suspecting that D Artagnan had acted as a spy on him and had seen him with Madame de Longueville 
none	none	I never meddle save with what concerns me and I know how to make believe that I haven t seen what does not concern me but I hate hypocrites and among that number I place musketeers who are abbes and abbes who are musketeers and he added turning to Porthos here s a gentleman who s of the same opinion as myself 
274_121398_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Porthos who had not spoken one word answered merely by a word and a gesture 
none	none	He said yes and he put his hand on his sword 
274_121398_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Aramis started back and drew his 
274_121398_000024_000001	train-clean-360	D Artagnan bent forward ready either to attack or to stand on his defense 
274_121398_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command which characterized him alone drew out his sword and the scabbard at the same time broke the blade in the sheath on his knee and threw the pieces to his right 
274_121398_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Then turning to Aramis 
274_121398_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Aramis he said break your sword 
274_121398_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Aramis hesitated 
274_121398_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 It must be done said Athos then in a lower and more gentle voice he added 
274_121398_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 I wish it 
274_121398_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Then Aramis paler than before but subdued by these words snapped the serpent blade between his hands and then folding his arms stood trembling with rage 
274_121398_000030_000000	train-clean-360	These proceedings made D Artagnan and Porthos draw back 
274_121398_000030_000001	train-clean-360	D Artagnan did not draw his sword Porthos put his back into the sheath 
274_121398_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Never exclaimed Athos raising his right hand to Heaven never 
274_121398_000031_000001	train-clean-360	I swear before God who seeth us and who in the darkness of this night heareth us never shall my sword cross yours never my eye express a glance of anger nor my heart a throb of hatred at you 
none	none	We lived together we loved we hated together we shed we mingled our blood together and too probably I may still add that there may be yet a bond between us closer even than that of friendship perhaps there may be the bond of crime for we four we once did condemn judge and slay a human being whom we had not any right to cut off from this world although apparently fitter for hell than for this life 
274_121398_000031_000003	train-clean-360	D Artagnan I have always loved you as my son Porthos we slept six years side by side Aramis is your brother as well as mine and Aramis has once loved you as I love you now and as I have ever loved you 
none	none	What can Cardinal Mazarin be to us to four men who compelled such a man as Richelieu to act as we pleased What is such or such a prince to us who fixed the diadem upon a great queen s head D Artagnan I ask your pardon for having yesterday crossed swords with you Aramis does the same to Porthos now hate me if you can but for my own part I shall ever even if you do hate me retain esteem and friendship for you 
274_121398_000031_000007	train-clean-360	I repeat my words Aramis and then if you desire it and if they desire it let us separate forever from our old friends 
none	none	There was a solemn though momentary silence which was broken by Aramis
274_121398_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I swear he said with a calm brow and kindly glance but in a voice still trembling with recent emotion I swear that I no longer bear animosity to those who were once my friends 
274_121398_000033_000001	train-clean-360	I regret that I ever crossed swords with you Porthos I swear not only that it shall never again be pointed at your breast but that in the bottom of my heart there will never in future be the slightest hostile sentiment now Athos come 
274_121398_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Athos was about to retire 
none	none	Oh no no do not go away exclaimed D Artagnan impelled by one of those irresistible impulses which showed the nobility of his nature the native brightness of his character I swear that I would give the last drop of my blood and the last fragment of my limbs to preserve the friendship of such a friend as you Athos of such a man as you Aramis And he threw himself into the arms of Athos My son exclaimed Athos pressing him in his arms
274_121398_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 And as for me said Porthos I swear nothing but I m choked Forsooth 
none	none	If I were obliged to fight against you I think I should allow myself to be pierced through and through for I never loved any one but you in the wide world and honest Porthos burst into tears as he embraced Athos
274_121398_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 My friends said Athos this is what I expected from such hearts as yours 
274_121398_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Yes I have said it and I now repeat it our destinies are irrevocably united although we now pursue divergent roads 
274_121398_000038_000002	train-clean-360	I respect your convictions and whilst we fight for opposite sides let us remain friends 
274_121398_000038_000003	train-clean-360	Ministers princes kings will pass away like mountain torrents civil war like a forest flame but we we shall remain I have a presentiment that we shall 
none	none	Yes replied D Artagnan let us still be musketeers and let us retain as our battle standard that famous napkin of the bastion saint Gervais on which the great cardinal had three fleurs de lis embroidered Be it so cried Aramis Cardinalists or Frondeurs what matters it Let us meet again as capital seconds in a duel devoted friends in business merry companions in our ancient pleasures And whenever added Athos we meet in battle at this word Place Royale let us put our swords into our left hands and shake hands with the right even in the very lust and music of the hottest carnage
274_121398_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 You speak charmingly said Porthos 
274_121398_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 And are the first of men added D Artagnan 
274_121398_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 You excel us all 
274_121398_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Athos smiled with ineffable pleasure 
none	none	Tis then all settled 
274_121398_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Gentlemen your hands are we not pretty good Christians 
274_121398_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Egad said D Artagnan by Heaven yes 
274_121398_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 We should be so on this occasion if only to be faithful to our oath said Aramis 
none	none	Ah I m ready to do what you will cried Porthos even to swear by Mahomet 
274_121398_000048_000001	train-clean-360	Devil take me if I ve ever been so happy as at this moment 
274_121398_000049_000000	train-clean-360	And he wiped his eyes still moist 
none	none	Has not one of you a cross asked Athos 
274_121398_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Aramis smiled and drew from his vest a cross of diamonds which was hung around his neck by a chain of pearls 
none	none	Here is one he said
274_121398_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Well resumed Athos swear on this cross which in spite of its magnificent material is still a cross swear to be united in spite of everything and forever and may this oath bind us to each other and even also our descendants 
none	none	Does this oath satisfy you Yes said they all with one accord Ah traitor muttered D Artagnan leaning toward Aramis and whispering in his ear you have made us swear on the crucifix of a Frondeuse twenty nine The Ferry across the Oise We hope that the reader has not quite forgotten the young traveler whom we left on the road to Flanders In losing sight of his guardian whom he had quitted gazing after him in front of the royal basilican Raoul spurred on his horse in order not only to escape from his own melancholy reflections but also to hide from Olivain the emotion his face might betray One hour s rapid progress however sufficed to disperse the gloomy fancies that had clouded the young man s bright anticipations and the hitherto unfelt pleasure of freedom a pleasure which is sweet even to those who have never known dependence seemed to Raoul to gild not only Heaven and earth but especially that blue but dim horizon of life we call the future Nevertheless after several attempts at conversation with Olivain he foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull and the count s agreeable voice his gentle and persuasive eloquence recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from Athos the most amusing and the best informed of guides Another recollection contributed also to sadden Raoul on their arrival at Sonores he had perceived hidden behind a screen of poplars a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of La Valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to Olivain s respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention The aspect of external objects is often a mysterious guide communicating with the fibres of memory which in spite of us will arouse them at times this thread like that of Ariadne when once unraveled will conduct one through a labyrinth of thought in which one loses one s self in endeavoring to follow that phantom of the past which is called recollection Now the sight of this chateau had taken Raoul back fifty leagues westward and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he had taken leave of little Louise to that in which he had seen her for the first time and every branch of oak every gilded weathercock on roof of slates reminded him that instead of returning to the friends of his childhood every instant estranged him further and that perhaps he had even left them forever With a full heart and burning head he desired Olivain to lead on the horses to a wayside inn which he observed within gunshot range a little in advance of the place they had reached As for himself he dismounted and remained under a beautiful group of chestnuts in flower amidst which were murmuring a multitude of happy bees and bade Olivain send the host to him with writing paper and ink to be placed on a table which he found there conveniently ready Olivain obeyed and continued on his way whilst Raoul remained sitting with his elbow leaning on the table from time to time gently shaking the flowers from his head which fell upon him like snow and gazing vaguely on the charming landscape spread out before him dotted over with green fields and groups of trees Raoul had been there about ten minutes during five of which he was lost in reverie when there appeared within the circle comprised in his rolling gaze a man with a rubicund face who with a napkin around his body another under his arm and a white cap upon his head approached him holding paper pen and ink in hand Ha ha laughed the apparition every gentleman seems to have the same fancy for not a quarter of an hour ago a young lad well mounted like you as tall as you and of about your age halted before this clump of trees and had this table and this chair brought here and dined here with an old gentleman who seemed to be his tutor upon a pie of which they haven t left a mouthful and two bottles of Macon wine of which they haven t left a drop but fortunately we have still some of the same wine and some of the same pies left and if your worship will but give your orders No friend replied Raoul smiling I am obliged to you but at this moment I want nothing but the things for which I have asked only I shall be very glad if the ink prove black and the pen good upon these conditions I will pay for the pen the price of the bottle and for the ink the price of the pie Very well sir said the host I ll give the pie and the bottle of wine to your servant and in this way you will have the pen and ink into the bargain Do as you like said Raoul who was beginning his apprenticeship with that particular class of society who when there were robbers on the highroads were connected with them and who since highwaymen no longer exist have advantageously and aptly filled their vacant place The host his mind at ease about his bill placed pen ink and paper upon the table By a lucky chance the pen was tolerably good and Raoul began to write The host remained standing in front of him looking with a kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face combining both gravity and sweetness of expression Beauty has always been and always will be all powerful He s not a guest like the other one here just now observed mine host to Olivain who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything and your young master has no appetite My master had appetite enough three days ago but what can one do he lost it the day before yesterday And Olivain and the host took their way together toward the inn Olivain according to the custom of serving men well pleased with their place relating to the tavern keeper all that he could say in favor of the young gentleman whilst Raoul wrote on thus Sir After a four hours march I stop to write to you for I miss you every moment and I am always on the point of turning my head as if to reply when you speak to me I was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at our separation that I am sure I was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude I feel toward you You will forgive me sir for your heart is of such a generous nature that you can well understand all that has passed in mine I entreat you to write to me for you form a part of my existence and if I may venture to tell you so I also feel anxious It seemed to me as if you were yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking about which I did not dare to question you since you told me nothing I have therefore as you see great need of hearing from you Now that you are no longer beside me I am afraid every moment of erring You sustained me powerfully sir and I protest to you that to day I feel very lonely Will you have the goodness sir should you receive news from Blois to send me a few lines about my little friend Mademoiselle de la Valliere about whose health when we left so much anxiety was felt You can understand honored and dear guardian how precious and indispensable to me is the remembrance of the years that I have passed with you I hope that you will sometimes too think of me and if at certain hours you should miss me if you should feel any slight regret at my absence I shall be overwhelmed with joy at the thought that you appreciate my affection for and my devotion to yourself and that I have been able to prove them to you whilst I had the happiness of living with you After finishing this letter Raoul felt more composed he looked well around him to see if Olivain and the host might not be watching him whilst he impressed a kiss upon the paper a mute and touching caress which the heart of Athos might well divine on opening the letter During this time Olivain had finished his bottle and eaten his pie the horses were also refreshed Raoul motioned to the host to approach threw a crown upon the table mounted his horse and posted his letter at Senlis The rest that had been thus afforded to men and horses enabled them to continue their journey at a good round pace At Verberie Raoul desired Olivain to make some inquiry about the young man who was preceding them he had been observed to pass only three quarters of an hour previously but he was well mounted as the tavern keeper had already said and rode at a rapid pace Let us try and overtake this gentleman said Raoul to Olivain like ourselves he is on his way to join the army and may prove agreeable company It was about four o clock in the afternoon when Raoul arrived at Compiegne there he dined heartily and again inquired about the young gentleman who was in advance of them He had stopped like Raoul at the Hotel of the Bell and Bottle the best at Compiegne and had started again on his journey saying that he should sleep at Noyon Well let us sleep at Noyon said Raoul Sir replied Olivain respectfully allow me to remark that we have already much fatigued the horses this morning I think it would be well to sleep here and to start again very early to morrow Eighteen leagues is enough for the first stage The Comte de la Fere wished me to hasten on replied Raoul that I might rejoin the prince on the morning of the fourth day let us push on then to Noyon it will be a stage similar to those we traveled from Blois to Paris We shall arrive at eight o clock The horses will have a long night s rest and at five o clock to morrow morning we can be again on the road Olivain dared offer no opposition to this determination but he followed his master grumbling Go on go on said he between his teeth expend your ardor the first day to morrow instead of journeying twenty leagues you will travel ten the day after to morrow five and in three days you will be in bed There you must rest young people are such braggarts It was easy to see that Olivain had not been taught in the school of the Planchets and the Grimauds Raoul really felt tired but he was desirous of testing his strength and brought up in the principles of Athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of twenty five leagues he did not wish to fall far short of his model D Artagnan that man of iron who seemed to be made of nerve and muscle only had struck him with admiration Therefore in spite of Olivain s remarks he continued to urge his steed more and more and following a pleasant little path leading to a ferry and which he had been assured shortened the journey by the distance of one league he arrived at the summit of a hill and perceived the river flowing before him A little troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream ready to embark Raoul did not doubt this was the gentleman and his escort he called out to him but they were too distant to be heard then in spite of the weariness of his beast he made it gallop but the rising ground soon deprived him of all sight of the travelers and when he had again attained a new height the ferryboat had left the shore and was making for the opposite bank Raoul seeing that he could not arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travelers halted to wait for Olivain At this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the river Raoul turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded and shaded his eyes from the glare of the setting sun with his hand Olivain he exclaimed what do I see below there A second scream more piercing than the first now sounded Oh sir cried Olivain the rope which holds the ferryboat has broken and the boat is drifting But what do I see in the water something struggling Oh yes exclaimed Raoul fixing his glance on one point in the stream splendidly illumined by the setting sun a horse a rider They are sinking cried Olivain in his turn It was true and Raoul was convinced that some accident had happened and that a man was drowning he gave his horse its head struck his spurs into its sides and the animal urged by pain and feeling that he had space open before him bounded over a kind of paling which inclosed the landing place and fell into the river scattering to a distance waves of white froth Ah sir cried Olivain what are you doing Good God Raoul was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in danger This was in fact a custom familiar to him Having been brought up on the banks of the Loire he might have been said to have been cradled on its waves a hundred times he had crossed it on horseback a thousand times had swum across Athos foreseeing the period when he should make a soldier of the viscount had inured him to all kinds of arduous undertakings Oh heavens continued Olivain in despair what would the count say if he only saw you now The count would do as I do replied Raoul urging his horse vigorously forward But I but I cried Olivain pale and disconsolate rushing about on the shore how shall I cross Leap coward cried Raoul swimming on then addressing the traveler who was struggling twenty yards in front of him Courage sir said he courage we are coming to your aid Olivain advanced retired then made his horse rear turned it and then struck to the core by shame leaped as Raoul had done only repeating I am a dead man we are lost In the meantime the ferryboat had floated away carried down by the stream and the shrieks of those whom it contained resounded more and more A man with gray hair had thrown himself from the boat into the river and was swimming vigorously toward the person who was drowning but being obliged to go against the current he advanced but slowly Raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground but the horse and its rider of whom he did not lose sight were evidently sinking The nostrils of the horse were no longer above water and the rider who had lost the reins in struggling fell with his head back and his arms extended One moment longer and all would disappear Courage cried Raoul courage Too late murmured the young man too late The water closed above his head and stifled his voice Raoul sprang from his horse to which he left the charge of its own preservation and in three or four strokes was at the gentleman s side he seized the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water the animal began to breathe again and as if he comprehended that they had come to his aid redoubled his efforts Raoul at the same time seized one of the young man s hands and placed it on the mane which it grasped with the tenacity of a drowning man Thus sure that the rider would not release his hold Raoul now only directed his attention to the horse which he guided to the opposite bank helping it to cut through the water and encouraging it with words All at once the horse stumbled against a ridge and then placed its foot on the sand Saved exclaimed the man with gray hair who also touched bottom Saved mechanically repeated the young gentleman releasing the mane and sliding from the saddle into Raoul s arms Raoul was but ten yards from the shore there he bore the fainting man and laying him down upon the grass unfastened the buttons of his collar and unhooked his doublet A moment later the gray headed man was beside him Olivain managed in his turn to land after crossing himself repeatedly and the people in the ferryboat guided themselves as well as they were able toward the bank with the aid of a pole which chanced to be in the boat Thanks to the attentions of Raoul and the man who accompanied the young gentleman the color gradually returned to the pale cheeks of the dying man who opened his eyes at first entirely bewildered but who soon fixed his gaze upon the person who had saved him Ah sir he exclaimed it was you Without you I was a dead man thrice dead But one recovers sir as you perceive replied Raoul and we have but had a little bath Oh sir what gratitude I feel exclaimed the man with gray hair Ah there you are my good D Arminges I have given you a great fright have I not but it is your own fault You were my tutor why did you not teach me to swim Oh monsieur le comte replied the old man had any misfortune happened to you I should never have dared to show myself to the marshal again But how did the accident happen asked Raoul Oh sir in the most natural way possible replied he to whom they had given the title of count We were about a third of the way across the river when the cord of the ferryboat broke Alarmed by the cries and gestures of the boatmen my horse sprang into the water I cannot swim and dared not throw myself into the river Instead of aiding the movements of my horse I paralyzed them and I was just going to drown myself with the best grace in the world when you arrived just in time to pull me out of the water therefore sir if you will agree henceforward we are friends until death Sir replied Raoul bowing I am entirely at your service I assure you I am called the Count de Guiche continued the young man my father is the Marechal de Grammont and now that you know who I am do me the honor to inform me who you are I am the Viscount de Bragelonne answered Raoul blushing at being unable to name his father as the Count de Guiche had done Viscount your countenance your goodness and your courage incline me toward you my gratitude is already due Shake hands I crave your friendship Sir said Raoul returning the count s pressure of the hand I like you already from my heart pray regard me as a devoted friend I beseech you And now where are you going viscount inquired De Guiche To join the army under the prince count And I too exclaimed the young man in a transport of joy Oh so much the better we will fire the first shot together It is well be friends said the tutor young as you both are you were perhaps born under the same star and were destined to meet And now continued he you must change your clothes your servants to whom I gave directions the moment they had left the ferryboat ought to be already at the inn Linen and wine are both being warmed come The young men had no objection to this proposition on the contrary they thought it very timely They mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between them They were indeed two elegant horsemen with figures slight and upright noble faces bright and proud looks loyal and intelligent smiles De Guiche might have been about eighteen years of age but he was scarcely taller than Raoul who was only fifteen thirty Skirmishing The halt at Noyon was but brief 
3285-121400-0000	train-other-500	every one there being wrapped in profound sleep Raoul had desired to be awakened should Grimaud arrive but Grimaud did not arrive Doubtless too the horses on their part
3285-121400-0001	train-other-500	appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which was granted them The Count de Guiche was awakened at five o clock in the morning by Raoul who came to wish him good day
3285-121400-0002	train-other-500	They breakfasted in haste and at six o clock had already gone ten miles The young count s conversation was most interesting to Raoul therefore he listened much
3285-121400-0003	train-other-500	whilst the count talked well and long Brought up in Paris where Raoul had been but once at the court which Raoul had never seen his follies as page
3285-121400-0004	train-other-500	two duels which he had already found the means of fighting in spite of the edicts against them and more especially in spite of his tutor s vigilance these things excited the greatest curiosity in Raoul
none	none	 Raoul had only been at M Scarron s house 
3285-121400-0005	train-other-500	he named to Guiche the people whom he had seen there Guiche knew everybody Madame de Neuillan Mademoiselle d Aubigne
none	none	 Mademoiselle de Scudery 
3285-121400-0006	train-other-500	Mademoiselle Paulet Madame de Chevreuse He criticised everybody humorously Raoul trembled
none	none	 lest he should laugh among the rest at Madame de Chevreuse for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy but either instinctively or from affection for the duchess he said everything in her favor His praises increased Raoul s friendship twofold 
3285-121400-0007	train-other-500	Then came the question of gallantry and love affairs Under this head also Bragelonne had much more to hear than to tell He listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through
3285-121400-0008	train-other-500	three or four rather frivolous adventures that the count like himself had a secret to hide in the depths of his heart De Guiche as we have said before had been educated at the court
3285-121400-0009	train-other-500	and the intrigues of this court were not unknown to him It was the same court of which Raoul had so often heard the Comte de la Fere speak
none	none	 except that its aspect had much changed since the period when Athos had himself been part of it 
3285-121400-0010	train-other-500	therefore everything which the Count de Guiche related was new to his traveling companion The young count witty and caustic passed all the world in review the queen herself was not spared
none	none	 and Cardinal Mazarin came in for his share of ridicule The day passed away as rapidly as an hour The count s tutor a man of the world and a bon vivant up to his eyes in learning as his pupil described him often recalled the profound erudition the witty and caustic satire of Athos to Raoul but as regarded grace delicacy and nobility of external appearance no one in these points was to be compared to the Comte de la Fere The horses which were more kindly used than on the previous day stopped at Arras at four o clock in the evening 
3285-121400-0011	train-other-500	They were approaching the scene of war and as bands of Spaniards sometimes took advantage of the night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood of Arras they determined to remain in the town until the morrow
3285-121400-0012	train-other-500	The French army held all between Pont a Marc as far as Valenciennes
none	none	 falling back upon Douai 
3285-121400-0013	train-other-500	The prince was said to be in person at Bethune The enemy s army extended from Cassel to Courtray and as there was no species of violence or pillage it did not commit
3285-121400-0014	train-other-500	the poor people on the frontier quitted their isolated dwellings and fled for refuge into the strong cities which held out a shelter to them Arras was encumbered with fugitives An approaching battle was much spoken of
none	none	 the prince having manoeuvred until that movement 
3285-121400-0015	train-other-500	only in order to await a reinforcement that had just reached him The young men congratulated themselves on having arrived so opportunely The evening was employed in discussing the war
3285-121400-0016	train-other-500	the grooms polished their arms the young men loaded the pistols in case of a skirmish and they awoke in despair having both dreamed that they had arrived too late to participate in the battle In the morning it was rumored
none	none	 that Prince de Conde had evacuated Bethune 
3285-121400-0017	train-other-500	and fallen back on Carvin leaving however a strong garrison in the former city But as there was nothing positively certain in this report the young warriors decided to continue their way toward Bethune
none	none	 free on the road to diverge to the right and march to Carvin if necessary 
3285-121400-0018	train-other-500	The count s tutor was well acquainted with the country he consequently proposed to take a crossroad
none	none	 which lay between that of Lens and that of Bethune They obtained information at Ablain 
3285-121400-0019	train-other-500	and a statement of their route was left for Grimaud About seven o clock in the morning they set out De Guiche who was young and impulsive said to Raoul Here we are three masters and three servants
3285-121400-0020	train-other-500	Our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough enough
none	none	 I have never seen him put to the test replied Raoul but he is a Breton which promises something 
3285-121400-0021	train-other-500	Yes yes resumed De Guiche I am sure he can fire a musket when required On my side I have two sure men who have been in action with my father We therefore represent six fighting men
none	none	 if we should meet a little troop of enemies equal or even superior in number to our own shall we charge them Raoul Certainly sir replied the viscount 
3285-121400-0022	train-other-500	Holloa young people stop there said the tutor joining in the conversation
none	none	 Zounds how you manoeuvre my instructions count 
3285-121400-0023	train-other-500	You seem to forget the orders I received to conduct you safe and sound to his highness the prince Once with the army you may be killed at your good pleasure but until that time I warn you that in my capacity of general of the army
3285-121400-0024	train-other-500	I shall order a retreat and turn my back on the first red coat we come across De Guiche and Raoul glanced at each other smiling They arrived at Ablain without accident
3285-121400-0025	train-other-500	There they inquired and learned that the prince had in reality quitted Bethune and stationed himself between Cambria and La Venthie Therefore leaving directions at every place for Grimaud
3285-121400-0026	train-other-500	they took a crossroad which conducted the little troop by the bank of a small stream
none	none	 flowing into the Lys The country was beautiful 
3285-121400-0027	train-other-500	intersected by valleys as green as the emerald Here and there they passed little copses crossing the path which they were following
none	none	 In anticipation of some ambuscade 
3285-121400-0028	train-other-500	in each of these little woods the tutor placed his two servants at the head of the band thus forming the advance guard Himself and the two young men represented the body of the army whilst Olivain with his rifle upon his knee
3285-121400-0029	train-other-500	and his eyes upon the watch protected the rear
none	none	 They had observed for some time before them on the horizon 
3285-121400-0030	train-other-500	a rather thick wood and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it Monsieur d Arminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the count s two grooms
3285-121400-0031	train-other-500	The servants had just disappeared under the trees followed by the tutor and the young men were laughing and talking about a hundred yards off Olivain was at the same distance in the rear when suddenly there resounded five or six musket shots
none	none	 The tutor cried halt the young men obeyed pulling up their steeds and at the same moment the two valets were seen returning at a gallop The young men impatient to learn the cause of the firing spurred on toward the servants 
3285-121400-0032	train-other-500	The tutor followed them Were you stopped eagerly inquired the two youths No replied the servants it is even probable that we have not been seen the shots were fired about a hundred paces in advance of us in the thickest part of the wood
3285-121400-0033	train-other-500	and we returned to ask your advice My advice is this said Monsieur d Arminges and if needs be my will that we beat a retreat
none	none	 There may be an ambuscade concealed in this wood 
3285-121400-0034	train-other-500	Did you see nothing there asked the count I thought I saw said one of the servants horsemen dressed in yellow creeping along the bed of the stream That s it said the tutor
3285-121400-0035	train-other-500	We have fallen in with a party of Spaniards Come back sirs back The two youths looked at each other and at this moment a pistol shot and cries for help were heard Another glance between the young men
3285-121400-0036	train-other-500	convinced them both that neither had any wish to go back and as the tutor had already turned his horse s head they both spurred forward Raoul crying Follow me Olivain and the Count de Guiche
none	none	 Follow Urban and Planchet 
3285-121400-0037	train-other-500	And before the tutor could recover from his surprise they had both disappeared into the forest Whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready also
3285-121400-0038	train-other-500	In five minutes they arrived at the spot whence the noise had proceeded and then restraining their horses they advanced cautiously Hush whispered De Guiche these are cavaliers Yes three on horseback
3285-121400-0039	train-other-500	and three who have dismounted Can you see what they are doing Yes they appear to be searching a wounded or dead man It is some cowardly assassination said De Guiche They are soldiers though resumed De Bragelonne
3285-121400-0040	train-other-500	Yes skirmishers that is to say highway robbers At them cried Raoul At them echoed De Guiche Oh gentlemen gentlemen in the name of Heaven cried the poor tutor
3285-121400-0041	train-other-500	But he was not listened to and his cries only served to arouse the attention of the Spaniards The men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths leaving the three others to complete the plunder of the dead or wounded travelers
3285-121400-0042	train-other-500	for on approaching nearer instead of one extended figure the young men discovered two De Guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man and the Spaniard who had advanced to meet Raoul aimed in his turn
3285-121400-0043	train-other-500	and Raoul felt a pain in the left arm similar to that of a blow from a whip He let off his fire at but four paces Struck in the breast and extending his arms the Spaniard fell back on the crupper
3285-121400-0044	train-other-500	and the terrified horse turning around carried him off Raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him and remembering the recommendation of Athos he with the rapidity of lightning
3285-121400-0045	train-other-500	made his horse rear as the shot was fired His horse bounded to one side losing its footing and fell entangling Raoul s leg under its body The Spaniard sprang forward and seized the gun by its muzzle
3285-121400-0046	train-other-500	in order to strike Raoul on the head with the butt In the position in which Raoul lay unfortunately he could neither draw his sword from the scabbard nor his pistols from their holsters The butt end of the musket hovered over his head
3285-121400-0047	train-other-500	and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes when with one bound Guiche reached the Spaniard and placed a pistol at his throat Yield he cried or you are a dead man
3285-121400-0048	train-other-500	The musket fell from the soldier s hands who yielded on the instant Guiche summoned one of his grooms and delivering the prisoner into his charge with orders to shoot him through the head if he attempted to escape he leaped from his horse and approached Raoul
3285-121400-0049	train-other-500	Faith sir said Raoul smiling although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on a first affair you are in a great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to me Without your aid continued he
3285-121400-0050	train-other-500	repeating the count s words I should have been a dead man thrice dead My antagonist took flight replied De Guiche and left me at liberty to come to your assistance But are you seriously wounded I see you are covered with blood
none	none	 I believe said Raoul that I have got something like a scratch on the arm If you will help me to drag myself from under my horse 
3285-121400-0051	train-other-500	I hope nothing need prevent us continuing our journey Monsieur d Arminges and Olivain had already dismounted and were attempting to raise the struggling horse At last Raoul succeeded in drawing his foot from the stirrup
3285-121400-0052	train-other-500	and his leg from under the animal and in a second he was on his feet again Nothing broken asked De Guiche Faith no thank Heaven replied Raoul
none	none	 but what has become of the poor wretches whom these scoundrels were murdering I fear we arrived too late They have killed them I think and taken flight carrying off their booty My servants are examining the bodies Let us go and see whether they are quite dead 
3285-121400-0053	train-other-500	or if they can still be helped suggested Raoul Olivain we have come into possession of two horses but I have lost my own Take for yourself the better of the two and give me yours
none	none	 They approached the spot where the unfortunate victims lay thirty one 
3285-121401-0000	train-other-500	The Monk Two men lay prone upon the ground one bathed in blood and motionless with his face toward the earth this one was dead The other leaned against a tree
3285-121401-0001	train-other-500	supported there by the two valets and was praying fervently with clasped hands and eyes raised to Heaven He had received a ball in his thigh which had broken the bone The young men first approached the dead man
3285-121401-0002	train-other-500	He is a priest said Bragelonne he has worn the tonsure Oh the scoundrels to lift their hands against a minister of God Come here sir said Urban an old soldier
3285-121401-0003	train-other-500	who had served under the cardinal duke in all his campaigns
none	none	 come here there is nothing to be done with him 
3285-121401-0004	train-other-500	whilst we may perhaps be able to save the other The wounded man smiled sadly Save me Oh no said he but help me to die if you can Are you a priest asked Raoul
3285-121401-0005	train-other-500	No sir I ask as your unfortunate companion appeared to me to belong to the church He is the curate of Bethune sir and was carrying the holy vessels belonging to his church
3285-121401-0006	train-other-500	and the treasure of the chapter to a safe place
none	none	 the prince having abandoned our town yesterday 
3285-121401-0007	train-other-500	and as it was known that bands of the enemy were prowling about the country no one dared to accompany the good man so I offered to do so And sir continued the wounded man I suffer much
3285-121401-0008	train-other-500	and would like if possible to be carried to some house Where you can be relieved asked De Guiche No where I can confess But perhaps you are not so dangerously wounded as you think said Raoul
3285-121401-0009	train-other-500	Sir replied the wounded man believe me there is no time to lose the ball has broken the thigh bone and entered the intestines Are you a surgeon asked De Guiche No
3285-121401-0010	train-other-500	but I know a little about wounds and mine I know is mortal Try therefore either to carry me to some place where I may see a priest or take the trouble to send one to me here
3285-121401-0011	train-other-500	It is my soul that must be saved as for my body it is lost To die whilst doing a good deed It is impossible God will help you Gentlemen in the name of Heaven
3285-121401-0012	train-other-500	said the wounded man collecting all his forces as if to get up let us not lose time in useless words Either help me to gain the nearest village or swear to me on your salvation that you will send me the first monk
none	none	 the first cure 
3285-121401-0013	train-other-500	the first priest you may meet But he added in a despairing tone perhaps no one will dare to come for it is known that the Spaniards are ranging through the country and I shall die without absolution
3285-121401-0014	train-other-500	My God my God Good God good God added the wounded man in an accent of terror which made the young men shudder you will not allow that that would be too terrible
3285-121401-0015	train-other-500	Calm yourself sir replied De Guiche I swear to you you shall receive the consolation that you ask Only tell us where we shall find a house at which we can demand aid and a village from which we can fetch a priest
3285-121401-0016	train-other-500	Thank you and God reward you About half a mile from this on the same road there is an inn and about a mile further on after leaving the inn you will reach the village of Greney
3285-121401-0017	train-other-500	There you must find the curate or if he is not at home go to the convent of the Augustines which is the last house on the right and bring me one of the brothers Monk or priest it matters not
3285-121401-0018	train-other-500	provided only that he has received from holy church the power of absolving
none	none	 in articulo mortis 
3285-121401-0019	train-other-500	Monsieur d Arminges said De Guiche remain beside this unfortunate man and see that he is removed as gently as possible The vicomte and myself will go and find a priest Go sir replied the tutor
3285-121401-0020	train-other-500	but in Heaven s name do not expose yourself to danger Do not fear Besides we are safe for to day you know the axiom Non bis in idem Courage sir said Raoul to the wounded man
3285-121401-0021	train-other-500	We are going to execute your wishes May Heaven prosper you replied the dying man with an accent of gratitude impossible to describe The two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten minutes reached the inn
3285-121401-0022	train-other-500	Raoul without dismounting called to the host and announced that a wounded man was about to be brought to his house and begged him in the meantime to prepare everything needful He desired him also should he know in the neighborhood
none	none	 any doctor or chirurgeon 
3285-121401-0023	train-other-500	to fetch him taking on himself the payment of the messenger The host who saw two young noblemen richly clad promised everything they required and our two cavaliers
none	none	 after seeing that preparations for the reception were actually begun started off again and proceeded rapidly toward Greney They had gone rather more than a league and had begun to descry the first houses of the village 
3285-121401-0024	train-other-500	the red tiled roofs of which stood out from the green trees which surrounded them when coming toward them mounted on a mule they perceived a poor monk
none	none	 whose large hat and gray worsted dress 
3285-121401-0025	train-other-500	made them take him for an Augustine brother Chance for once seemed to favor them in sending what they were so assiduously seeking He was a man about twenty two or twenty three years old
3285-121401-0026	train-other-500	but who appeared much older from ascetic exercises His complexion was pale not of that deadly pallor which is a kind of neutral beauty but of a bilious yellow hue his colorless hair was short
none	none	 and scarcely extended beyond the circle formed by the hat around his head and his light blue eyes seemed destitute of any expression Sir began Raoul with his usual politeness are you an ecclesiastic 
3285-121401-0027	train-other-500	Why do you ask me that replied the stranger with a coolness which was barely civil Because we want to know said De Guiche haughtily The stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his way
3285-121401-0028	train-other-500	In a second De Guiche had sprung before him and barred his passage Answer sir exclaimed he
none	none	 you have been asked politely and every question is worth an answer 
3285-121401-0029	train-other-500	I suppose I am free to say or not to say who I am to two strangers who take a fancy to ask me It was with difficulty that De Guiche restrained the intense desire he had of breaking the monk s bones
3285-121401-0030	train-other-500	In the first place he said making an effort to control himself we are not people who may be treated anyhow
none	none	 my friend there is the Viscount of Bragelonne 
3285-121401-0031	train-other-500	and I am the Count de Guiche Nor was it from caprice we asked the question for there is a wounded and dying man who demands the succor of the church If you be a priest I conjure you in the name of humanity to follow me to aid this man
none	none	 if you be not it is a different matter and I warn you in the name of courtesy of which you appear profoundly ignorant that I shall chastise you for your insolence The pale face of the monk became so livid and his smile so strange that Raoul whose eyes were still fixed upon him 
3285-121401-0032	train-other-500	felt as if this smile had struck to his heart like an insult
none	none	 He is some Spanish or Flemish spy said he putting his hand to his pistol 
3285-121401-0033	train-other-500	A glance threatening and transient as lightning replied to Raoul Well sir said De Guiche are you going to reply I am a priest said the young man Then father said Raoul
3285-121401-0034	train-other-500	forcing himself to convey a respect by speech that did not come from his heart if you are a priest you have an opportunity as my friend has told you of exercising your vocation At the next inn you will find a wounded man
3285-121401-0035	train-other-500	now being attended by our servants who has asked the assistance of a minister of God I will go said the monk And he touched his mule If you do not go sir said De Guiche
3285-121401-0036	train-other-500	remember that we have two steeds able to catch your mule and the power of having you seized wherever you may be and then I swear your trial will be summary one can always find a tree and a cord
3285-121401-0037	train-other-500	The monk s eye again flashed but that was all he merely repeated his phrase I will go and he went Let us follow him said De Guiche it will be the surest plan
3285-121401-0038	train-other-500	I was about to propose so doing answered De Bragelonne In the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether he was followed or not You see said Raoul we have done wisely
3285-121401-0039	train-other-500	What a horrible face that monk has said De Guiche Horrible replied Raoul especially in expression Yes yes said De Guiche a strange face but these monks are subject to such degrading practices
3285-121401-0040	train-other-500	their fasts make them pale the blows of the discipline make them hypocrites and their eyes become inflamed through weeping for the good things of this life we common folk enjoy but they have lost Well said Raoul
3285-121401-0041	train-other-500	the poor man will get his priest but by Heaven the penitent appears to me to have a better conscience than the confessor I confess I am accustomed to priests of a very different appearance Ah exclaimed De Guiche you must understand
3285-121401-0042	train-other-500	that this is one of those wandering brothers who go begging on the high road until some day a benefice falls down from Heaven on them they are mostly foreigners Scotch Irish or Danish
none	none	 I have seen them before 
3285-121401-0043	train-other-500	As ugly No but reasonably hideous What a misfortune for the wounded man to die under the hands of such a friar Pshaw said De Guiche Absolution comes not from him who administers it but from God
none	none	 However for my part I would rather die unshriven than have anything to say to such a confessor You are of my opinion are you not viscount 
3285-121401-0044	train-other-500	and I see you playing with the pommel of your sword as if you had a great inclination to break the holy father s head
none	none	 Yes count it is a strange thing and one which might astonish you 
3285-121401-0045	train-other-500	but I feel an indescribable horror at the sight of yonder man Have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path Never answered De Guiche Well it has happened to me to do so in our Blaisois forests
3285-121401-0046	train-other-500	and I remember that the first time I encountered one with its eyes fixed upon me curled up swinging its head and pointing its tongue I remained fixed pale and as though fascinated until the moment when the Comte de la Fere
3285-121401-0047	train-other-500	Your father asked De Guiche No my guardian replied Raoul blushing Very well Until the moment when the Comte de la Fere resumed Raoul said Come Bragelonne draw your sword
3285-121401-0048	train-other-500	then only I rushed upon the reptile and cut it in two just at the moment when it was rising on its tail and hissing ere it sprang upon me Well I vow I felt exactly the same sensation at sight of that man when he said
none	none	 Why do you ask me that and looked so strangely at me Then you regret that you did not cut your serpent in two morsels Faith yes almost said Raoul They had now arrived within sight of the little inn and could see on the opposite side 
3285-121401-0049	train-other-500	the procession bearing the wounded man and guided by Monsieur d Arminges The youths spurred on There is the wounded man said De Guiche passing close to the Augustine brother Be good enough to hurry yourself a little monsieur monk
none	none	 As for Raoul he avoided the monk 
3285-121401-0050	train-other-500	by the whole width of the road and passed him turning his head away in repulsion The young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were followed by the priest He raised himself to glance in the direction which they pointed out
3285-121401-0051	train-other-500	saw the monk and fell back upon the litter his face illumined by joy And now said the youths we have done all we can for you and as we are in haste to rejoin the prince s army we must continue our journey
3285-121401-0052	train-other-500	You will excuse us sir but we are told that a battle is expected and we do not wish to arrive the day after it Go my young sirs said the sick man and may
none	none	 you both be blessed 
3285-121401-0053	train-other-500	for your piety You have done for me as you promised all that you could do As for me I can only repeat may God protect you and all dear to you Sir said De Guiche to his tutor we will precede you
none	none	 and you can rejoin us on the road to Cambrin 
3285-121401-0054	train-other-500	The host was at his door and everything was prepared bed bandages and lint and a groom had gone to Lens the nearest village for a doctor Everything said he to Raoul shall be done as you desire
none	none	 but you will not stop to have your wound dressed Oh my wound mine tis nothing replied the viscount 
3285-121401-0055	train-other-500	it will be time to think about it when we next halt only have the goodness should you see a cavalier who makes inquiries about a young man on a chestnut horse followed by a servant to tell him in fact that you have seen me
3285-121401-0056	train-other-500	but that I have continued my journey and intend to dine at Mazingarbe
none	none	 and to stop at Cambrin 
3285-121401-0057	train-other-500	This cavalier is my attendant Would it not be safer and more certain
none	none	 if I should ask him his name and tell him yours demanded the host There is no harm in over precaution I am the Viscount de Bragelonne 
3285-121401-0058	train-other-500	and he is called Grimaud At this moment the wounded man arrived from one direction and the monk from the other the latter dismounting from his mule and desiring that it should be taken to the stables without being unharnessed
3285-121401-0059	train-other-500	Sir monk said De Guiche confess well that brave man and be not concerned for your expenses or for those of your mule all is paid
none	none	 Thanks monsieur 
3285-121401-0060	train-other-500	said the monk with one of those smiles that made Bragelonne shudder Come count said Raoul who seemed instinctively to dislike the vicinity of the Augustine come I feel ill here and the two young men spurred on
none	none	 The litter borne by two servants 
3285-121401-0061	train-other-500	now entered the house The host and his wife were standing on the steps whilst the unhappy man seemed to suffer dreadful pain and yet to be concerned only to know if he was followed by the monk At sight of this pale bleeding man
3285-121401-0062	train-other-500	the wife grasped her husband s arm Well what s the matter asked the latter are you going to be ill just now No but look replied the hostess pointing to the wounded man I ask you if you recognize him That man
3285-121401-0063	train-other-500	wait a bit Ah I see you know him exclaimed the wife for you have become pale in your turn Truly cried the host misfortune is coming on our house it is the former executioner of Bethune
3285-121401-0064	train-other-500	The former executioner of Bethune murmured the young monk shrinking back and showing on his countenance the feeling of repugnance which his penitent inspired Monsieur d Arminges
3285-121401-0065	train-other-500	who was at the door perceived his hesitation Sir monk said he whether he is now or has been an executioner this unfortunate being is none the less a man Render to him then the last service he can
3285-121401-0066	train-other-500	by any possibility ask of you and your work will be all the more meritorious The monk made no reply but silently wended his way to the room where the two valets had deposited the dying man on a bed
none	none	 D Arminges and Olivain 
3285-121401-0067	train-other-500	and the two grooms then mounted their horses and all four started off at a quick trot to rejoin Raoul and his companion Just as the tutor and his escort disappeared in their turn a new traveler stopped on the threshold of the inn
3285-121401-0068	train-other-500	What does your worship want demanded the host pale and trembling from the discovery he had just made The traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink and then pointed to his horse and gesticulated like a man
3285-121401-0069	train-other-500	who is brushing something Ah diable said the host to himself this man seems dumb And where will your worship drink There answered the traveler pointing to the table I was mistaken said the host
none	none	 he s not quite dumb And what else does your worship wish for 
3285-121401-0070	train-other-500	To know if you have seen a young man pass fifteen years of age mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom
none	none	 The Viscount de Bragelonne 
3285-121401-0071	train-other-500	Just so Then you are called Monsieur Grimaud The traveler made a sign of assent Well then said the host
none	none	 your young master was here a quarter of an hour ago he will dine at Mazingarbe and sleep at Cambrin 
3285-121401-0072	train-other-500	How far is Mazingarbe
none	none	 Two miles and a half Thank you 
3285-121401-0073	train-other-500	Grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on the table to be filled a second time when a terrific scream resounded from the room occupied by the monk and the dying man Grimaud sprang up
3285-121401-0074	train-other-500	What is that said he whence comes that cry From the wounded man s room replied the host What wounded man The former executioner of Bethune who has just been brought in here
3285-121401-0075	train-other-500	assassinated by Spaniards and who is now being confessed by an Augustine friar The old executioner of Bethune muttered Grimaud a man between fifty five and sixty tall strong swarthy black hair and beard
none	none	 That is he except that his beard has turned gray and his hair is white do you know him 
3285-121401-0076	train-other-500	asked the host I have seen him once replied Grimaud a cloud darkening his countenance at the picture so suddenly summoned to the bar of recollection At this instant a second cry less piercing than the first
3285-121401-0077	train-other-500	but followed by prolonged groaning was heard The three listeners looked at one another in alarm We must see what it is said Grimaud It sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered murmured the host
3285-121401-0078	train-other-500	Mon Dieu said the woman crossing herself If Grimaud was slow in speaking we know that he was quick to act he sprang to the door and shook it violently but it was bolted on the other side Open the door cried the host
none	none	 open it instantly sir monk No reply Unfasten it or I will break it in said Grimaud The same silence and then ere the host could oppose his design Grimaud seized a pair of pincers he perceived in a corner 
3285-121401-0079	train-other-500	and forced the bolt The room was inundated with blood dripping from the mattresses upon which lay the wounded man speechless the monk had disappeared The monk cried the host where is the monk
3285-121401-0080	train-other-500	Grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the courtyard He has escaped by this means exclaimed he Do you think so said the host bewildered boy
none	none	 see if the mule belonging to the monk is still in the stable 
3285-121401-0081	train-other-500	There is no mule cried he to whom this question was addressed The host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously whilst Grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man
3285-121401-0082	train-other-500	whose worn hard features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the past
none	none	 There can be no longer any doubt 
3285-121401-0083	train-other-500	but that it is himself said he Does he still live inquired the innkeeper Making no reply Grimaud opened the poor man s jacket to feel if the heart beat whilst the host approached in his turn
none	none	 but in a moment they both fell back the host uttering a cry of horror and Grimaud becoming pallid The blade of a dagger was buried up to the hilt in the left side of the executioner Run run for help 
3285-121401-0084	train-other-500	cried Grimaud and I will remain beside him here The host quitted the room in agitation and as for his wife
none	none	 she had fled at the sound of her husband s cries thirty two The Absolution This is what had taken place We have seen that it was not of his own free will but on the contrary very reluctantly that the monk attended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange a manner Perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of doing so He was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants who doubtless had received their instructions 
1544-121402-0000	train-other-500	And besides he considered it most expedient without exhibiting too much ill will to follow to the end his role as confessor The monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded man
1544-121402-0001	train-other-500	The executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to lose He made a movement of surprise and said Father you are very young
1544-121402-0002	train-other-500	Men who bear my robe have no age replied the monk dryly Alas speak to me more gently father in my last moments I need a friend Do you suffer much asked the monk Yes
1544-121402-0003	train-other-500	but in my soul much more than in my body We will save your soul said the young man but are you really the executioner of Bethune as these people say That is to say eagerly replied the wounded man
none	none	 who doubtless feared that the name of executioner would take from him the last help that he could claim 
1544-121402-0004	train-other-500	that is to say I was but am no longer it is fifteen years since I gave up the office
none	none	 I still assist at executions but no longer strike the blow myself 
1544-121402-0005	train-other-500	no indeed You have then a repugnance to your profession So long as I struck in the name of the law and of justice my profession allowed me to sleep quietly sheltered as I was by justice and law
1544-121402-0006	train-other-500	but since that terrible night when I became an instrument of private vengeance and when with personal hatred I raised the sword over one of God s creatures since that day The executioner paused and shook his head with an expression of despair
1544-121402-0007	train-other-500	Tell me about it said the monk who sitting on the foot of the bed
none	none	 began to be interested in a story so strangely introduced 
1544-121402-0008	train-other-500	Ah cried the dying man
none	none	 with all the effusiveness of a grief declared after long suppression ah I have sought to stifle remorse by twenty years of good deeds I have assuaged the natural ferocity of those who shed blood on every occasion I have exposed my life to save those who were in danger 
1544-121402-0009	train-other-500	and I have preserved lives in exchange for that I took away That is not all the money gained in the exercise of my profession I have distributed to the poor I have been assiduous in attending church and those who formerly fled from me
1544-121402-0010	train-other-500	have become accustomed to seeing me All have forgiven me some have even loved me but I think that God has not pardoned me for the memory of that execution pursues me constantly and every night I see that woman s ghost rising before me
1544-121402-0011	train-other-500	A woman You have assassinated a woman then cried the monk You also exclaimed the executioner
none	none	 you use that word which sounds ever in my ears assassinated I have assassinated then 
1544-121402-0012	train-other-500	and not executed I am an assassin then and not an officer of justice and he closed his eyes with a groan The monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more for he exclaimed eagerly Go on I know nothing as yet
none	none	 when you have finished your story 
1544-121402-0013	train-other-500	God and I will judge Oh father continued the executioner without opening his eyes
none	none	 as if he feared on opening them to see some frightful object 
1544-121402-0014	train-other-500	it is especially when night comes on and when I have to cross a river that this terror which I have been unable to conquer comes upon me it then seems as if my hand grew heavy as if the cutlass was still in its grasp
1544-121402-0015	train-other-500	as if the water had the color of blood and all the voices of nature the whispering of the trees the murmur of the wind the lapping of the wave united in a voice tearful despairing terrible crying to me
1544-121402-0016	train-other-500	Place for the justice of God Delirium murmured the monk shaking his head The executioner opened his eyes turned toward the young man and grasped his arm Delirium he repeated delirium do you say Oh no
1544-121402-0017	train-other-500	I remember too well It was evening I had thrown the body into the river and those words which my remorse repeats to me are those which I in my pride pronounced After being the instrument of human justice I aspired to be that of the justice of God
1544-121402-0018	train-other-500	But let me see how was it done Speak said the monk It was at night A man came to me and showed me an order and I followed him Four other noblemen awaited me They led me away masked
1544-121402-0019	train-other-500	I reserved the right of refusing if the office they required of me should seem unjust We traveled five or six leagues serious silent and almost without speaking At length through the window of a little hut
1544-121402-0020	train-other-500	they showed me a woman sitting leaning on a table and said
none	none	 there is the person to be executed Horrible said the monk And you obeyed 
1544-121402-0021	train-other-500	Father that woman was a monster It was said that she had poisoned her second husband she had tried to assassinate her brother in law she had just poisoned a young woman who was her rival and before leaving England she had it was believed
1544-121402-0022	train-other-500	caused the favorite of the king to be murdered Buckingham cried the monk Yes Buckingham The woman was English then No she was French but she had married in England The monk turned pale
1544-121402-0023	train-other-500	wiped his brow and went and bolted the door The executioner thought that he had abandoned him and fell back groaning upon his bed No no I am here said the monk quickly coming back to him Go on who were those men
1544-121402-0024	train-other-500	One of them was a foreigner English I think
none	none	 The four others were French and wore the uniform of musketeers

1544-121402-0027	train-other-500	with her head thrown back she begged for life I have never understood how I could have laid low a head so beautiful with a face so pale The monk seemed agitated by a strange emotion he trembled all over he seemed eager to put a question
1544-121402-0028	train-other-500	which yet he dared not ask At length with a violent effort at self control The name of that woman he said I don t know what it was
none	none	 As I have said she was twice married once in France the second time in England 
1544-121402-0029	train-other-500	She was young you say Twenty five years old Beautiful Ravishingly Blond Yes Abundance of hair falling over her shoulders Yes Eyes of an admirable
none	none	 expression When she chose Oh yes it is she A voice of strange sweetness How do you know it The executioner raised himself on his elbow and gazed with a frightened air at the monk who became livid 
1544-121402-0030	train-other-500	And you killed her the monk exclaimed
none	none	 You were the tool of those cowards who dared not kill her themselves 
1544-121402-0031	train-other-500	You had no pity for that youthfulness that beauty that weakness you killed that woman Alas I have already told you father that woman
none	none	 under that angelic appearance had an infernal soul and when I saw her 
1544-121402-0032	train-other-500	when I recalled all the evil she had done to me To you What could she have done to you Come tell me She had seduced and ruined my brother
none	none	 a priest She had fled with him from her convent 
1544-121402-0033	train-other-500	With your brother Yes my brother was her first lover and she caused his death Oh father do not look in that way at me Oh I am guilty then you will not pardon me The monk recovered his usual expression Yes yes he said

1544-121402-0034	train-other-500	Oh cried the executioner all all all Answer then If she seduced your brother you said she seduced him did you not Yes If she caused his death you said that she caused his death
1544-121402-0035	train-other-500	Yes repeated the executioner
none	none	 Then you must know what her name was as a young girl Oh mon Dieu cried the executioner I think I am dying Absolution father absolution Tell me her name and I will give it Her name was My God have pity on me murmured the executioner and he fell back on the bed pale 
1544-121402-0036	train-other-500	trembling and apparently about to die Her name repeated the monk bending over him as if to tear from him the name if he would not utter it her name Speak or no absolution The dying man collected all his forces
1544-121402-0037	train-other-500	The monk s eyes glittered Anne de Bueil murmured the wounded man
none	none	 Anne de Bueil cried the monk standing up and lifting his hands to Heaven Anne de Bueil You said Anne de Bueil did you not Yes yes that was her name and now absolve me for I am dying 
1544-121402-0038	train-other-500	I absolve you cried the priest with a laugh which made the dying man s hair stand on end I absolve you I am not a priest You are not a priest cried the executioner
none	none	 What then are you 
1544-121402-0039	train-other-500	I am about to tell you wretched man Oh mon Dieu I am John Francis de Winter I do not know you said the executioner
none	none	 Wait wait you are going to know me I am John Francis de Winter he repeated 
1544-121402-0040	train-other-500	and that woman Well that woman Was my mother The executioner uttered the first cry that terrible cry which had been first heard Oh pardon me pardon me he murmured if not in the name of God
1544-121402-0041	train-other-500	at least in your own name if not as priest then as son Pardon you cried the pretended monk pardon you Perhaps God will pardon you but I never For pity s sake said the executioner extending his arms
1544-121402-0042	train-other-500	No pity for him who had no pity
none	none	 Die impenitent die in despair die and be damned 
1544-121402-0043	train-other-500	And drawing a poniard from beneath his robe he thrust it into the breast of the wounded man saying Here is my absolution Then was heard that second cry not so loud as the first and followed by a long groan
none	none	 The executioner who had lifted himself up fell back upon his bed As to the monk without withdrawing the poniard from the wound he ran to the window opened it leaped out into the flowers of a small garden 
1544-121402-0044	train-other-500	glided onward to the stable took out his mule went out by a back gate ran to a neighbouring thicket threw off his monkish garb took from his valise the complete habiliment of a cavalier
none	none	 clothed himself in it went on foot to the first post secured there a horse and continued with a loose rein his journey to Paris thirty three Grimaud Speaks Grimaud was left alone with the executioner who in a few moments opened his eyes Help help he murmured oh God have I not a single friend in the world who will aid me either to live or to die Take courage said Grimaud they are gone to find assistance Who are you asked the wounded man fixing his half opened eyes on Grimaud An old acquaintance replied Grimaud You and the wounded man sought to recall the features of the person now before him Under what circumstances did we meet he asked again One night twenty years ago my master fetched you from Bethune and conducted you to Armentieres I know you well now said the executioner you were one of the four grooms Just so Where do you come from now I was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my horse They told me the executioner of Bethune was here and wounded when you uttered two piercing cries At the first we ran to the door and at the second forced it open And the monk exclaimed the executioner did you see the monk What monk The monk that was shut in with me No he was no longer here he appears to have fled by the window Was he the man that stabbed you Yes said the executioner Grimaud moved as if to leave the room What are you going to do asked the wounded man He must be apprehended Do not attempt it he has revenged himself and has done well Now I may hope that God will forgive me since my crime is expiated Explain yourself said Grimaud The woman whom you and your masters commanded me to kill Milady Yes Milady it is true you called her thus What has the monk to do with this Milady She was his mother Grimaud trembled and stared at the dying man in a dull and leaden manner His mother he repeated Yes his mother But does he know this secret then I mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in confession Unhappy man cried Grimaud whose face was covered with sweat at the bare idea of the evil results such a revelation might cause unhappy man you named no one I hope I pronounced no name for I knew none except his mother s as a young girl and it was by this name that he recognized her but he knows that his uncle was among her judges Thus speaking he fell back exhausted Grimaud wishing to relieve him advanced his hand toward the hilt of the dagger Touch me not said the executioner if this dagger is withdrawn I shall die Grimaud remained with his hand extended then striking his forehead he exclaimed Oh if this man should ever discover the names of the others my master is lost Haste haste to him and warn him cried the wounded man if he still lives warn his friends too My death believe me will not be the end of this atrocious misadventure Where was the monk going asked Grimaud Toward Paris Who stopped him Two young gentlemen who were on their way to join the army and the name of one of whom I heard his companion mention the Viscount de Bragelonne And it was this young man who brought the monk to you Then it was the will of God that it should be so and this it is which makes it all so awful continued Grimaud And yet that woman deserved her fate do you not think so On one s death bed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison with one s own said the executioner and falling back exhausted he closed his eyes Grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the Comte de la Fere Whilst he thus hesitated the host re entered the room followed not only by a surgeon but by many other persons whom curiosity had attracted to the spot The surgeon approached the dying man who seemed to have fainted We must first extract the steel from the side said he shaking his head in a significant manner The prophecy which the wounded man had just uttered recurred to Grimaud who turned away his head The weapon as we have already stated was plunged into the body to the hilt and as the surgeon taking it by the end drew it forth the wounded man opened his eyes and fixed them on him in a manner truly frightful When at last the blade had been entirely withdrawn a red froth issued from the mouth of the wounded man and a stream of blood spouted afresh from the wound when he at length drew breath then fixing his eyes upon Grimaud with a singular expression the dying man uttered the last death rattle and expired Then Grimaud lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was gliding along the room to the horror of all present made a sign to the host to follow him paid him with a generosity worthy of his master and again mounted his horse Grimaud s first intention had been to return to Paris but he remembered the anxiety which his prolonged absence might occasion Raoul and reflecting that there were now only two miles between the vicomte and himself and a quarter of an hour s riding would unite them and that the going returning and explanation would not occupy an hour he put spurs to his horse and a few minutes after had reached the only inn of Mazingarbe Raoul was seated at table with the Count de Guiche and his tutor when all at once the door opened and Grimaud presented himself travel stained dirty and sprinkled with the blood of the unhappy executioner Grimaud my good Grimaud exclaimed Raoul here you are at last Excuse me sirs this is not a servant but a friend How did you leave the count continued he Does he regret me a little Have you seen him since I left him Answer for I have many things to tell you too indeed the last three days some odd adventures have happened but what is the matter how pale you are and blood too What is this It is the blood of the unfortunate man whom you left at the inn and who died in my arms In your arms that man but know you who he was He used to be the headsman of Bethune You knew him and he is dead Yes Well sir said D Arminges it is the common lot even an executioner is not exempted I had a bad opinion of him the moment I saw his wound and since he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion too that death would follow At the mention of the monk Grimaud became pale Come come continued D Arminges to dinner for like most men of his age and generation he did not allow sentiment or sensibility to interfere with a repast You are right sir said Raoul Come Grimaud order dinner for yourself and when you have rested a little we can talk No sir no said Grimaud I cannot stop a moment I must start for Paris again immediately What You start for Paris You are mistaken it is Olivain who leaves me you are to remain On the contrary Olivain is to stay and I am to go I have come for nothing else but to tell you so But what is the meaning of this change I cannot tell you Explain yourself I cannot explain myself Come tell me what is the joke Monsieur le vicomte knows that I never joke Yes but I know also that Monsieur le Comte de la Fere arranged that you were to remain with me and that Olivain should return to Paris I shall follow the count s directions Not under present circumstances monsieur Perhaps you mean to disobey me Yes monsieur I must You persist then Yes I am going may you be happy monsieur and Grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go out Raoul angry and at the same time uneasy ran after him and seized him by the arm Grimaud he cried remain I wish it Then replied Grimaud you wish me to allow monsieur le comte to be killed He saluted and made a movement to depart Grimaud my friend said the viscount will you leave me thus in such anxiety Speak speak in Heaven s name And Raoul fell back trembling upon his chair I can tell you but one thing sir for the secret you wish to know is not my own You met a monk did you not Yes The young men looked at each other with an expression of fear You conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him and perhaps you would know him again were you to meet him Yes yes cried both young men Very well if ever you meet him again wherever it may be whether on the high road or in the street or in a church anywhere that he or you may be put your foot on his neck and crush him without pity without mercy as you would crush a viper or a scorpion destroy him utterly and quit him not until he is dead the lives of five men are not safe in my opinion as long as he is on the earth And without adding another word Grimaud profiting by the astonishment and terror into which he had thrown his auditors rushed from the room Two minutes later the thunder of a horse s hoofs was heard upon the road it was Grimaud on his way to Paris When once in the saddle Grimaud reflected on two things first that at the pace he was going his horse would not carry him ten miles and secondly that he had no money But Grimaud s ingenuity was more prolific than his speech and therefore at the first halt he sold his steed and with the money obtained from the purchase took post horses thirty four On the Eve of Battle Raoul was aroused from his sombre reflections by his host who rushed into the apartment crying out The Spaniards the Spaniards That cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccupation The young men made inquiries and ascertained that the enemy was advancing by way of Houdin and Bethune While Monsieur d Arminges gave orders for the horses to be made ready for departure the two young men ascended to the upper windows of the house and saw in the direction of Marsin and of Lens a large body of infantry and cavalry This time it was not a wandering troop of partisans it was an entire army There was therefore nothing for them to do but to follow the prudent advice of Monsieur d Arminges and beat a retreat They quickly went downstairs Monsieur d Arminges was already mounted Olivain had ready the horses of the young men and the lackeys of the Count de Guiche guarded carefully between them the Spanish prisoner mounted on a pony which had been bought for his use As a further precaution they had bound his hands The little company started off at a trot on the road to Cambrin where they expected to find the prince But he was no longer there having withdrawn on the previous evening to La Bassee misled by false intelligence of the enemy s movements Deceived by this intelligence he had concentrated his forces between Vieille Chapelle and La Venthie and after a reconnoissance along the entire line in company with Marshal de Grammont he had returned and seated himself before a table with his officers around him He questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain but nothing positive had been learned The hostile army had disappeared two days before and seemed to have gone out of existence Now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening as when he has completely disappeared The prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an officer entered and announced to Marshal de Grammont that some one wished to see him The Duc de Grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and went out The prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door no one ventured to speak for fear of disturbing him Suddenly a dull and heavy noise was heard The prince leaped to his feet extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound there was no mistaking it it was the noise of cannon Every one stood up At that moment the door opened Monseigneur said Marshal de Grammont with a radiant face will your highness permit my son Count de Guiche and his traveling companion Viscount de Bragelonne to come in and give news of the enemy whom they have found while we were looking for him What eagerly replied the prince will I permit I not only permit I desire let them come in The marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the prince Speak gentlemen said the prince saluting them first speak we shall have time afterward for the usual compliments The most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing It fell naturally to the Count de Guiche to make reply not only was he the elder but he had been presented to the prince by his father Besides he had long known the prince whilst Raoul now saw him for the first time He therefore narrated to the prince what they had seen from the inn at Mazingarbe Meanwhile Raoul closely observed the young general already made so famous by the battles of Rocroy Fribourg and Nordlingen Louis de Bourbon Prince de Conde who since the death of his father Henri de Bourbon was called in accordance with the custom of that period Monsieur le Prince was a young man not more than twenty six or twenty seven years old with the eye of an eagle agl occhi grifani as Dante says aquiline nose long waving hair of medium height well formed possessed of all the qualities essential to the successful soldier that is to say the rapid glance quick decision fabulous courage At the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong mind so that in addition to the revolution he had made in war by his new contributions to its methods he had also made a revolution at Paris among the young noblemen of the court whose natural chief he was and who in distinction from the social leaders of the ancient court modeled after Bassompierre Bellegarde and the Duke d Angouleme were called the petits maitres At the first words of the Count de Guiche the prince having in mind the direction whence came the sound of cannon had understood everything The enemy was marching upon Lens with the intention doubtless of securing possession of that town and separating from France the army of France But in what force was the enemy Was it a corps sent out to make a diversion Was it an entire army To this question De Guiche could not respond Now as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer exact precise positive Raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approaching the prince My lord he said will you permit me to hazard a few words on that subject which will perhaps relieve you of your uncertainty The prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a single glance he smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen years old Certainly monsieur speak he said softening his stern accented tones as if he were speaking to a woman My lord said Raoul blushing might examine the Spanish prisoner Have you a Spanish prisoner cried the prince Yes my lord Ah that is true said De Guiche I had forgotten it That is easily understood it was you who took him count said Raoul smiling The old marshal turned toward the viscount grateful for that praise of his son whilst the prince exclaimed The young man is right let the prisoner be brought in Meanwhile the prince took De Guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner had been taken and who this young man was Monsieur said the prince turning toward Raoul I know that you have a letter from my sister Madame de Longueville but I see that you have preferred commending yourself to me by giving me good counsel My lord said Raoul coloring up I did not wish to interrupt your highness in a conversation so important as that in which you were engaged with the count But here is the letter Very well said the prince give it to me later Here is the prisoner let us attend to what is most pressing The prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood to whoever would buy and grew old in stratagems and spoils Since he had been taken he had not uttered a word so that it was not known to what country he belonged The prince looked at him with unspeakable distrust Of what country are you asked the prince The prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue Ah ah it seems that he is a Spaniard Do you speak Spanish Grammont Faith my lord but indifferently And I not at all said the prince laughing Gentlemen he said turning to those who were near him can any one of you speak Spanish and serve me as interpreter I can my lord said Raoul Ah you speak Spanish Enough I think to fulfill your highness s wishes on this occasion Meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no understanding of what was taking place My lord asks of what country you are said the young man in the purest Castilian Ich bin ein Deutscher replied the prisoner What in the devil does he say asked the prince What new gibberish is that He says he is German my lord replied Raoul but I doubt it for his accent is bad and his pronunciation defective Then you speak German also asked the prince Yes my lord Well enough to question him in that language Yes my lord Question him then Raoul began the examination but the result justified his opinion The prisoner did not understand or seemed not to understand what Raoul said to him and Raoul could hardly understand his replies containing a mixture of Flemish and Alsatian However amidst all the prisoner s efforts to elude a systematic examination Raoul had recognized his natural accent Non siete Spagnuolo he said non siete Tedesco siete Italiano The prisoner started and bit his lips Ah that said the prince I understand that language thoroughly and since he is Italian I will myself continue the examination Thank you viscount continued the prince laughing and I appoint you from this moment my interpreter But the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in Italian than in the other languages his aim was to elude the examination Therefore he knew nothing either of the enemy s numbers or of those in command or of the purpose of the army Very good said the prince understanding the reason of that ignorance the man was caught in the act of assassination and robbery he might have purchased his life by speaking he doesn t wish to speak Take him out and shoot him The prisoner turned pale The two soldiers who had brought him in took him each by one arm and led him toward the door whilst the prince turning to Marshal de Grammont seemed to have already forgotten the order he had given When he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner stopped The soldiers who knew only their orders attempted to force him along One moment said the prisoner in French I am ready to speak my lord Ah ah said the prince laughing I thought we should come to that I have a sure method of limbering tongues Young men take advantage of it against the time when you may be in command But on condition continued the prisoner that your highness will swear that my life shall be safe Upon my honor said the prince Question then my lord Where did the army cross the Lys Between Saint Venant and Aire By whom is it commanded By Count de Fuonsaldagna General Beck and the archduke Of how many does it consist Eighteen thousand men and thirty six cannon And its aim is Lens You see gentlemen said the prince turning with a triumphant air toward Marshal de Grammont and the other officers Yes my lord said the marshal you have divined all that was possible to human genius Recall Le Plessis Bellievre Villequier and D Erlac said the prince recall all the troops that are on this side of the Lys Let them hold themselves in readiness to march to night To morrow according to all probability we shall attack the enemy But my lord said Marshal de Grammont consider that when we have collected all our forces we shall have hardly thirteen thousand men Monsieur le marechal said the prince with that wonderful glance that was peculiar to him it is with small armies that great battles are won Then turning toward the prisoner Take away that man he said and keep him carefully in sight His life is dependent on the information he has given us if it is true he shall be free if false let him be shot The prisoner was led away Count de Guiche said the prince it is a long time since you saw your father remain here with him Monsieur he continued addressing Raoul if you are not too tired follow me To the end of the world my lord cried Raoul feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general who seemed to him so worthy of his renown The prince smiled he despised flatterers but he appreciated enthusiasts Come monsieur he said you are good in council as we have already discovered to morrow we shall know if you are good in action And I said the marshal what am I to do Wait here to receive the troops I shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to me Twenty guards well mounted are all that I shall need for my escort That is very few said the marshal It is enough replied the prince Have you a good horse Monsieur de Bragelonne My horse was killed this morning my lord and I am mounted provisionally on my lackey s Choose for yourself in my stables the horse you like best No false modesty take the best horse you can find You will need it this evening perhaps you will certainly need it to morrow Raoul didn t wait to be told twice he knew that with superiors especially when those superiors are princes the highest politeness is to obey without delay or argument he went down to the stables picked out a pie bald Andalusian horse saddled and bridled it himself for Athos had advised him to trust no one with those important offices at a time of danger and went to rejoin the prince who at that moment mounted his horse Now monsieur he said to Raoul will you give me the letter you have brought Raoul handed the letter to the prince Keep near me said the latter The prince threw his bridle over the pommel of the saddle as he was wont to do when he wished to have both hands free unsealed the letter of Madame de Longueville and started at a gallop on the road to Lens attended by Raoul and his small escort whilst messengers sent to recall the troops set out with a loose rein in other directions The prince read as he hastened on Monsieur he said after a moment they tell me great things of you I have only to say after the little that I have seen and heard that I think even better of you than I have been told Raoul bowed Meanwhile as the little troop drew nearer to Lens the noise of the cannon sounded louder The prince kept his gaze fixed in the direction of the sound with the steadfastness of a bird of prey One would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his horizon From time to time his nostrils dilated as if eager for the smell of powder and he panted like a horse At length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were within a league of the field of battle and at a turn of the road they perceived the little village of Aunay The peasants were in great commotion The report of Spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was frightened The women had already fled taking refuge in Vitry only a few men remained On seeing the prince they hastened to meet him One of them recognized him Ah my lord he said have you come to drive away those rascal Spaniards and those Lorraine robbers Yes said the prince if you will serve me as guide Willingly my lord Where does your highness wish to go To some elevated spot whence I can look down on Lens and the surrounding country In that case I m your man I can trust you you are a true Frenchman I am an old soldier of Rocroy my lord Here said the prince handing him a purse here is for Rocroy Now do you want a horse or will you go afoot Afoot my lord I have served always in the infantry Besides I expect to lead your highness into places where you will have to walk Come then said the prince let us lose no time The peasant started off running before the prince s horse then a hundred steps from the village he took a narrow road hidden at the bottom of the valley For a half league they proceeded thus the cannon shot sounding so near that they expected at each discharge to hear the hum of the balls At length they entered a path which going out from the road skirted the mountainside The prince dismounted ordered one of his aids and Raoul to follow his example and directed the others to await his orders keeping themselves meanwhile on the alert He then began to ascend the path In about ten minutes they reached the ruins of an old chateau those ruins crowned the summit of a hill which overlooked the surrounding country At a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down on Lens at bay and before Lens the enemy s entire army With a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him from Lens as far as Vimy In a moment the plan of the battle which on the following day was to save France the second time from invasion was unrolled in his mind He took a pencil tore a page from his tablets and wrote My Dear Marshal In an hour Lens will be in the enemy s possession Come and rejoin me bring with you the whole army I shall be at Vendin to place it in position To morrow we shall retake Lens and beat the enemy Then turning toward Raoul Go monsieur he said ride fast and give this letter to Monsieur de Grammont Raoul bowed took the letter went hastily down the mountain leaped on his horse and set out at a gallop A quarter of an hour later he was with the marshal A portion of the troops had already arrived and the remainder was expected from moment to moment Marshal de Grammont put himself at the head of all the available cavalry and infantry and took the road to Vendin leaving the Duc de Chatillon to await and bring on the rest All the artillery was ready to move and started off at a moment s notice It was seven o clock in the evening when the marshal arrived at the appointed place The prince awaited him there As he had foreseen Lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after Raoul s departure The event was announced by the cessation of the firing As the shadows of night deepened the troops summoned by the prince arrived in successive detachments Orders were given that no drum should be beaten no trumpet sounded At nine o clock the night had fully come Still a last ray of twilight lighted the plain The army marched silently the prince at the head of the column Presently the army came in sight of Lens two or three houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what suffering was endured by a town taken by assault The prince assigned to every one his post Marshal de Grammont was to hold the extreme left resting on Mericourt The Duc de Chatillon commanded the centre Finally the prince led the right wing resting on Aunay The order of battle on the morrow was to be that of the positions taken in the evening Each one on awaking would find himself on the field of battle The movement was executed in silence and with precision At ten o clock every one was in his appointed position at half past ten the prince visited the posts and gave his final orders for the following day Three things were especially urged upon the officers who were to see that the soldiers observed them scrupulously the first that the different corps should so march that cavalry and infantry should be on the same line and that each body should protect its gaps the second to go to the charge no faster than a walk the third to let the enemy fire first The prince assigned the Count de Guiche to his father and kept Bragelonne near his own person but the two young men sought the privilege of passing the night together and it was accorded them A tent was erected for them near that of the marshal Although the day had been fatiguing neither of them was inclined to sleep And besides even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle On the evening before a battle one thinks of a thousand things forgotten till then those who are indifferent to one another become friends and those who are friends become brothers It need not be said that if in the depths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender it reaches then quite naturally the highest exaltation of which it is capable Some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to write The letters were long the four pages were covered with closely written words The writers sometimes looked up at each other and smiled they understood without speaking their organizations were so delicate and sympathetic The letters being finished each put his own into two envelopes so that no one without tearing the first envelope could discover to whom the second was addressed then they drew near to each other and smilingly exchanged their letters In case any evil should happen to me said Bragelonne In case I should be killed said De Guiche They then embraced each other like two brothers and each wrapping himself in his cloak they soon passed into that kindly sleep of youth which is the prerogative of birds flowers and infants thirty five A Dinner in the Old Style The second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and threatening as the first Athos with his superior understanding wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory point of reunion and at the moment when his friends in deference to his deportment and sobriety 
1544-121405-0000	train-other-500	dared scarcely speak of some of their former good dinners he was the first to propose that they should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and manners
1544-121405-0001	train-other-500	a freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them which gave them the name of the inseparables For different reasons this was an agreeable proposition to them all
1544-121405-0002	train-other-500	and it was therefore agreed that each should leave a very exact address and that upon the request of any of the associates
none	none	 a meeting should be convoked at a famous eating house in the Rue de la Monnaie 
1544-121405-0003	train-other-500	of the sign of the Hermitage The first rendezvous was fixed for the following Wednesday at eight o clock in the evening precisely
none	none	 On that day in fact the four friends arrived punctually at the hour 
1544-121405-0004	train-other-500	each from his own abode or occupation Porthos had been trying a new horse D Artagnan was on guard at the Louvre Aramis had been to visit one of his penitents in the neighborhood
none	none	 and Athos whose domicile was established in the Rue Guenegaud found himself close at hand They were therefore somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the Hermitage Athos starting out from the Pont Neuf Porthos by the Rue de la Roule D Artagnan by the Rue des Fosse Saint Germain l Auxerrois and Aramis by the Rue de Bethisy 
1544-121405-0005	train-other-500	The first words exchanged between the four friends on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness Athos perceived this embarrassment
none	none	 and by way of supplying an effectual remedy called for four bottles of champagne At this order given in Athos s habitually calm manner 
1544-121405-0006	train-other-500	the face of the Gascon relaxed and Porthos s brow grew smooth
none	none	 Aramis was astonished He knew that Athos not only never drank but more that he had a kind of repugnance to wine 
1544-121405-0007	train-other-500	This astonishment was doubled when Aramis saw Athos fill a bumper and toss it off with all his former enthusiasm His companions followed his example In a very few minutes the four bottles were empty
none	none	 and this excellent specific succeeded in dissipating even the slightest cloud 
1544-121405-0008	train-other-500	that might have rested on their spirits Now the four friends began to speak loud scarcely waiting till one had finished before another began and each assumed his favorite attitude
none	none	 on or at the table 
1544-121405-0009	train-other-500	Soon strange fact Aramis undid two buttons of his doublet seeing which Porthos unfastened his entirely Battles long journeys blows given and received sufficed for the first themes of conversation
none	none	 which turned upon the silent struggles sustained against him who was now called the great cardinal 
1544-121405-0010	train-other-500	Faith said Aramis laughing we have praised the dead enough
none	none	 let us revile the living a little I should like to say something evil of Mazarin is it permissible Go on go on replied D Artagnan laughing heartily relate your story and I will applaud it if it is a good one A great prince said Aramis with whom Mazarin sought an alliance 
1544-121405-0011	train-other-500	was invited by him to send him a list of the conditions on which he would do him the honor to negotiate with him
none	none	 The prince who had a great repugnance to treat 
1544-121405-0012	train-other-500	with such an ill bred fellow made out a list against the grain and sent it In this list there were three conditions which displeased Mazarin
none	none	 and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns to renounce them Ah ha ha laughed the three friends not a bad bargain and there was no fear of being taken at his word what did the prince do then The prince immediately sent fifty thousand francs to Mazarin begging him never to write to him again and offered twenty thousand francs more on condition that he would never speak to him What did Mazarin do Stormed suggested Athos Beat the messenger cried Porthos Accepted the money said D Artagnan You have guessed it answered Aramis and they all laughed so heartily that the host appeared in order to inquire whether the gentlemen wanted anything he thought they were fighting 
1544-121405-0013	train-other-500	At last their hilarity calmed down and Faith exclaimed D Artagnan to the two friends you may well wish ill to Mazarin for I assure you on his side he wishes you no good Pooh really asked Athos
1544-121405-0014	train-other-500	If I thought the fellow knew me by my name
none	none	 I would be rebaptized for fear it might be thought I knew him He knows you better by your actions than your name 
1544-121405-0015	train-other-500	he is quite aware that there are two gentlemen who greatly aided the escape of Monsieur de Beaufort
none	none	 and he has instigated an active search for them I can answer for it By whom By me 
1544-121405-0016	train-other-500	and this morning he sent for me to ask me if I had obtained any information And what did you reply That I had none as yet
none	none	 but that I was to dine to day with two gentlemen who would be able to give me some You told him that said Porthos 
1544-121405-0017	train-other-500	a broad smile spreading over his honest face Bravo
none	none	 and you are not afraid of that Athos No replied Athos it is not the search of Mazarin that I fear 
1544-121405-0018	train-other-500	Now said Aramis tell me a little what you do fear Nothing for the present at least nothing in good earnest And with regard to the past asked Porthos Oh the past is another thing said Athos sighing the past and the future
none	none	 Are you afraid for your young Raoul asked Aramis Well said D Artagnan 
1544-121405-0019	train-other-500	one is never killed in a first engagement Nor in the second said Aramis Nor in the third returned Porthos
none	none	 and even when one is killed one rises again 
1544-121405-0020	train-other-500	the proof of which is that here we are
none	none	 No said Athos 
1544-121405-0021	train-other-500	it is not Raoul about whom I am anxious for I trust he will conduct himself like a gentleman and if he is killed well he will die bravely but hold should such a misfortune happen well Athos passed his hand across his pale brow
none	none	 Well asked Aramis Well I shall look upon it as an expiation Ah said D Artagnan I know what you mean And I too added Aramis but you must not think of that Athos what is past is past I don t understand said Porthos 
1544-121405-0022	train-other-500	The affair at Armentieres whispered D Artagnan The affair at Armentieres asked he again Milady Oh yes said Porthos true I had forgotten it Athos looked at him intently
1544-121405-0023	train-other-500	You have forgotten it Porthos said he Faith yes it is so long ago answered Porthos
none	none	 This affair does not then weigh upon your conscience Faith no 
1544-121405-0024	train-other-500	And you D Artagnan I
none	none	 I own that when my mind returns to that terrible period I have no recollection of anything but the rigid corpse of poor Madame Bonancieux 
1544-121405-0025	train-other-500	Yes yes murmured he I have often felt regret for the victim but never the very slightest remorse for the assassin
none	none	 Athos shook his dead doubtfully 
1544-121405-0026	train-other-500	Consider said Aramis if you admit divine justice and its participation in the things of this world that woman was punished by the will of heaven We were but the instruments that is all But as to free will Aramis
none	none	 How acts the judge He has a free will yet he fearlessly condemns 
1544-121405-0027	train-other-500	What does the executioner He is master of his arm yet he strikes without remorse The executioner muttered
none	none	 Athos as if arrested by some recollection 
1544-121405-0028	train-other-500	I know that it is terrible said D Artagnan but when I reflect that we have killed English
none	none	 Rochellais Spaniards nay even French who never did us any other harm but to aim at and to miss us whose only fault was to cross swords 
1544-121405-0029	train-other-500	with us and to be unable to ward off our blows I can on my honor find an excuse for my share in the murder of that woman As for me said Porthos
none	none	 now that you have reminded me of it Athos 
1544-121405-0030	train-other-500	I have the scene again before me as if I now were there Milady was there as it were where you sit Athos changed color
none	none	 I I was where D Artagnan stands 
1544-121405-0031	train-other-500	I wore a long sword which cut like a Damascus you remember it Aramis for you always called it Balizarde Well I swear to you all three that had the executioner of Bethune was he not of Bethune yes egad of Bethune
none	none	 not been there 
1544-121405-0032	train-other-500	I would have cut off the head of that infamous being without thinking of it or even after thinking of it She was a most atrocious woman And then said Aramis with the tone of philosophical indifference which he had assumed since he had belonged to the church
none	none	 and in which there was more atheism than confidence in God what is the use of thinking of it all At the last hour we must confess this action and God knows better than we can whether it is a crime a fault or a meritorious deed I repent of it Egad no Upon my honor and by the holy cross I only regret it because she was a woman The most satisfactory part of the 
1544-121405-0033	train-other-500	matter said D Artagnan is that there remains no trace of it
none	none	 She had a son observed Athos 
1544-121405-0034	train-other-500	Oh yes I know that said D Artagnan
none	none	 and you mentioned it to me but who knows what has become of him If the serpent be dead why not its brood Do you think his uncle De Winter would have brought up that young viper De Winter probably condemned the son as he had done the mother Then said Athos 
1544-121405-0035	train-other-500	woe to De Winter for the child had done no harm May the devil take me if the child be not dead said Porthos There is so much fog in that detestable country at least so D Artagnan declares
none	none	 Just as the quaint conclusion reached by Porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces 
1544-121405-0036	train-other-500	now more or less clouded hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the door
none	none	 Come in cried Athos Please your honors said the host a person in a great hurry wishes to speak to one of you To which of us asked all the four friends 
1544-121405-0037	train-other-500	To him who is called the Comte de la Fere It is I said Athos and what is the name of the person Grimaud Ah exclaimed Athos turning pale
none	none	 Back already What can have happened then to Bragelonne Let him enter cried D Artagnan let him come up But Grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the last step so springing into the room he motioned the host to leave it The door being closed 
1544-121405-0038	train-other-500	the four friends waited in expectation Grimaud s agitation his pallor the sweat which covered his face the dust which soiled his clothes all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible news
none	none	 Your honors said he that woman had a child that child has become a man the tigress had a little one the tiger has roused himself he is ready to spring upon you beware Athos 
1544-121405-0039	train-other-500	glanced around at his friends with a melancholy smile Porthos turned to look at his sword which was hanging on the wall Aramis seized his knife D Artagnan arose What do you mean Grimaud he exclaimed
1544-121405-0040	train-other-500	That Milady s son has left England that he is in France on his road to Paris if he be not here already The devil he is said Porthos Are you sure of it Certain replied Grimaud
none	none	 This announcement was received in silence Grimaud was so breathless so exhausted that he had fallen back upon a chair Athos filled a beaker with champagne and gave it to him Well after all said D Artagnan supposing that he lives that he comes to Paris we have seen many other such Let him come 
1544-121405-0041	train-other-500	Yes echoed Porthos glancing affectionately at his sword
none	none	 still hanging on the wall we can wait for him let him come Moreover he is but a child said Aramis Grimaud rose A child he exclaimed Do you know what he has done this child Disguised as a monk he discovered the whole history in confession from the executioner of Bethune and having confessed him after having learned everything from him 
1544-121405-0042	train-other-500	he gave him absolution by planting this dagger into his heart See it is on fire yet with his hot blood for it is not thirty hours since it was drawn from the wound And Grimaud threw the dagger on the table D Artagnan Porthos and Aramis
1544-121405-0043	train-other-500	rose and in one spontaneous motion rushed to their swords
none	none	 Athos alone remained seated 
1544-121405-0044	train-other-500	calm and thoughtful And you say he is dressed as a monk
none	none	 Grimaud Yes as an Augustine monk What sized man is he About my height thin pale with light blue eyes and tawny flaxen hair And he did not see Raoul asked Athos Yes on the contrary they met and it was the viscount himself who conducted him to the bed of the dying man Athos in his turn rising without speaking went and unhooked his sword Heigh sir said D Artagnan trying to laugh do you know we look very much like a flock of silly mouse evading women How is it that we four men who have faced armies without blinking begin to tremble at the mention of a child It is true said Athos but this child comes in the name of Heaven And very soon they left the inn thirty six A Letter from Charles the First 
1646-121406-0000	train-other-500	The reader must now cross the Seine with us and follow us to the door of the Carmelite Convent in the Rue Saint Jacques
none	none	 It is eleven o clock in the morning and the pious sisters have just finished saying mass for the success of the armies of King Charles I 
1646-121406-0001	train-other-500	Leaving the church a woman and a young girl dressed in black the one as a widow and the other as an orphan have re entered their cell
none	none	 The woman kneels on a prie dieu of painted wood 
1646-121406-0002	train-other-500	and at a short distance from her stands the young girl leaning against a chair weeping The woman must have once been handsome but traces of sorrow have aged her The young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her
1646-121406-0003	train-other-500	the lady appears to be about forty years of age the girl about fourteen Oh God prayed the kneeling suppliant protect my husband guard my son and take my wretched life instead Oh God murmured the girl leave me my mother
1646-121406-0004	train-other-500	Your mother can be of no use to you in this world Henrietta said the lady turning around Your mother has no longer either throne or husband she has neither son money nor friends the whole world my poor child has abandoned your mother
1646-121406-0005	train-other-500	And she fell back weeping into her daughter s arms Courage take courage my dear mother said the girl Ah tis an unfortunate year for kings said the mother And no one thinks of us in this country for each must think about his own affairs
1646-121406-0006	train-other-500	As long as your brother was with me he kept me up but he is gone and can no longer send us news of himself either to me or to your father I have pledged my last jewels sold your clothes and my own to pay his servants
1646-121406-0007	train-other-500	who refused to accompany him unless I made this sacrifice We are now reduced to live at the expense of these daughters of Heaven we are the poor succored by God But why not address yourself to your sister the queen asked the girl
1646-121406-0008	train-other-500	Alas the queen my sister is no longer queen my child Another reigns in her name One day you will be able to understand how all this is Well then to the king your nephew Shall I speak to him
1646-121406-0009	train-other-500	You know how much he loves me my mother Alas my nephew is not yet king and you know Laporte has told us twenty times that he himself is in need of almost everything Then let us pray to Heaven said the girl
none	none	 The two women who thus knelt in united prayer were the daughter and grand daughter of Henry IV the wife and daughter of Charles I 
1646-121406-0010	train-other-500	They had just finished their double prayer when a nun softly tapped at the door of the cell Enter my sister said the queen I trust your majesty will pardon this intrusion on her meditations
1646-121406-0011	train-other-500	but a foreign lord has arrived from England and waits in the parlor demanding the honor of presenting a letter to your majesty Oh a letter a letter from the king perhaps News from your father do you hear Henrietta And the name of this lord
1646-121406-0012	train-other-500	Lord de Winter Lord de Winter exclaimed the queen the friend of my husband Oh bid him enter
1646-121406-0013	train-other-500	And the queen advanced to meet the messenger whose hand she seized affectionately whilst he knelt down and presented a letter to her contained in a case of gold Ah my lord said the queen you bring us three things which we have not seen for a long time
1646-121406-0014	train-other-500	Gold a devoted friend and a letter from the king our husband and master De Winter bowed again unable to reply from excess of emotion On their side the mother and daughter retired into the embrasure of a window
1646-121406-0015	train-other-500	to read eagerly the following letter Dear Wife We have now reached the moment of decision I have concentrated here at Naseby camp all the resources Heaven has left me and I write to you in haste from thence
1646-121406-0016	train-other-500	Here I await the army of my rebellious subjects I am about to struggle for the last time with them If victorious I shall continue the struggle if beaten I am lost I shall try in the latter case alas in our position one must provide for everything
2010_121416_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 for everything 
1646-121406-0017	train-other-500	I shall try to gain the coast of France But can they will they receive an unhappy king who will bring such a sad story into a country already agitated by civil discord Your wisdom and your affection must serve me as guides
1646-121406-0018	train-other-500	The bearer of this letter will tell you madame what I dare not trust to pen and paper and the risks of transit He will explain to you the steps that I expect you to pursue I charge him also with my blessing
1646-121406-0019	train-other-500	for my children and with the sentiments of my soul for yourself my dearest sweetheart The letter bore the signature not of Charles King but of Charles still king
1646-121406-0020	train-other-500	And let him be no longer king cried the queen Let him be conquered exiled proscribed provided he still lives Alas in these days the throne is too dangerous a place for me to wish him to retain it
1646-121406-0021	train-other-500	But my lord tell me she continued hide nothing from me what is in truth the king s position Is it as hopeless as he thinks Alas madame more hopeless than he thinks His majesty has so good a heart that he cannot understand hatred
1646-121406-0022	train-other-500	is so loyal that he does not suspect treason England is torn in twain by a spirit of disturbance which I greatly fear blood alone can exorcise But Lord Montrose replied the queen I have heard of his great and rapid successes of battles gained
1646-121406-0023	train-other-500	I heard it said that he was marching to the frontier to join the king Yes madame but on the frontier he was met by Lesly he had tried victory by means of superhuman undertakings Now victory has abandoned him Montrose beaten at Philiphaugh
1646-121406-0024	train-other-500	was obliged to disperse the remains of his army and to fly disguised as a servant He is at Bergen in Norway Heaven preserve him said the queen It is at least a consolation to know that some who have so often risked their lives for us are safe
1646-121406-0025	train-other-500	And now my lord that I see how hopeless the position of the king is tell me with what you are charged on the part of my royal husband Well then madame said De Winter the king wishes you to try and discover the dispositions of the king and queen toward him
1646-121406-0026	train-other-500	Alas you know that even now the king is but a child and the queen a woman weak enough Here Monsieur Mazarin is everything Does he desire to play the part in France that Cromwell plays in England
1646-121406-0027	train-other-500	Oh no He is a subtle conscienceless Italian who though he very likely dreams of crime dares not commit it and unlike Cromwell who disposes of both Houses Mazarin has had the queen to support him in his struggle with the parliament
1646-121406-0028	train-other-500	More reason then he should protect a king pursued by parliament The queen shook her head despairingly If I judge for myself my lord she said the cardinal will do nothing and will even perhaps act against us
none	none	 The presence of my daughter and myself in France is already irksome to him 
1646-121406-0029	train-other-500	much more so would be that of the king My lord added Henrietta with a melancholy smile it is sad and almost shameful to be obliged to say that we have passed the winter in the Louvre without money without linen almost without bread and often not rising from bed because we wanted fire
none	none	 Horrible cried De Winter the daughter of Henry IV and the wife of King Charles 
1646-121406-0030	train-other-500	Wherefore did you not apply then madame to the first person you saw from us Such is the hospitality shown to a queen by the minister from whom a king demands it But I heard that a marriage between the Prince of Wales and Mademoiselle d Orleans was spoken of said De Winter
1646-121406-0031	train-other-500	Yes for an instant I hoped it was so The young people felt a mutual esteem but the queen who at first sanctioned their affection changed her mind
none	none	 and Monsieur the Duc d Orleans who had encouraged the familiarity between them has forbidden his daughter to think any more about the union 
1646-121406-0032	train-other-500	Oh my lord continued the queen without restraining her tears it is better to fight as the king has done and to die as perhaps he will than live in beggary like me Courage madame courage Do not despair
1646-121406-0033	train-other-500	The interests of the French crown endangered at this moment are to discountenance rebellion in a neighboring nation Mazarin as a statesman will understand the politic necessity Are you sure said the queen doubtfully that you have not been forestalled
1646-121406-0034	train-other-500	By whom By the Joices the Prinns the Cromwells By a tailor a coachmaker a brewer Ah I hope madame that the cardinal will not enter into negotiations with such men Ah what is he himself asked Madame Henrietta
1646-121406-0035	train-other-500	But for the honor of the king of the queen Well let us hope he will do something for the sake of their honor said the queen A true friend s eloquence is so powerful my lord that you have reassured me Give me your hand and let us go to the minister and yet she added
1646-121406-0036	train-other-500	suppose he should refuse and that the king loses the battle His majesty will then take refuge in Holland where I hear his highness the Prince of Wales now is And can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight Alas no madame
none	none	 answered De Winter but the case is provided for and I am come to France to seek allies 
1646-121406-0037	train-other-500	Allies said the queen shaking her head
none	none	 Madame replied De Winter provided I can find some of my good old friends of former times I will answer for anything Come then my lord said the queen with the painful doubt that is felt by those who have suffered much come and may Heaven hear you thirty seven Cromwell s Letter At the very moment when the queen quitted the convent to go to the Palais Royal a young man dismounted at the gate of this royal abode and announced to the guards that he had something of importance to communicate to Cardinal Mazarin Although the cardinal was often tormented by fear he was more often in need of counsel and information and he was therefore sufficiently accessible The true difficulty of being admitted was not to be found at the first door and even the second was passed easily enough but at the third watched besides the guard and the doorkeepers the faithful Bernouin a Cerberus whom no speech could soften no wand even of gold could charm It was therefore at the third door that those who solicited or were bidden to an audience underwent their formal interrogatory The young man having left his horse tied to the gate in the court mounted the great staircase and addressed the guard in the first chamber Cardinal Mazarin said he Pass on replied the guard The cavalier entered the second hall which was guarded by the musketeers and doorkeepers Have you a letter of audience asked a porter advancing to the new arrival I have one but not one from Cardinal Mazarin Enter and ask for Monsieur Bernouin said the porter opening the door of the third room Whether he only held his usual post or whether it was by accident Monsieur Bernouin was found standing behind the door and must have heard all that had passed You seek me sir said he From whom may the letter be you bear to his eminence From General Oliver Cromwell said the new comer Be so good as to mention this name to his eminence and to bring me word whether he will receive me yes or no Saying which he resumed the proud and sombre bearing peculiar at that time to Puritans Bernouin cast an inquisitorial glance at the person of the young man and entered the cabinet of the cardinal to whom he transmitted the messenger s words A man bringing a letter from Oliver Cromwell said Mazarin And what kind of a man A genuine Englishman your eminence Hair sandy red more red than sandy gray blue eyes more gray than blue and for the rest stiff and proud Let him give in his letter His eminence asks for the letter said Bernouin passing back into the ante chamber His eminence cannot see the letter without the bearer of it replied the young man but to convince you that I am really the bearer of a letter see here it is and kindly add continued he that I am not a simple messenger but an envoy extraordinary Bernouin re entered the cabinet returning in a few seconds Enter sir said he The young man appeared on the threshold of the minister s closet in one hand holding his hat in the other the letter Mazarin rose Have you sir asked he a letter accrediting you to me There it is my lord said the young man Mazarin took the letter and read it thus mister Mordaunt one of my secretaries will remit this letter of introduction to His Eminence the Cardinal Mazarin in Paris He is also the bearer of a second confidential epistle for his eminence Oliver Cromwell Very well Monsieur Mordaunt said Mazarin give me this second letter and sit down The young man drew from his pocket a second letter presented it to the cardinal and took his seat The cardinal however did not unseal the letter at once but continued to turn it again and again in his hand then in accordance with his usual custom and judging from experience that few people could hide anything from him when he began to question them fixing his eyes upon them at the same time he thus addressed the messenger You are very young Monsieur Mordaunt for this difficult task of ambassador in which the oldest diplomatists often fail My lord I am twenty three years of age but your eminence is mistaken in saying that I am young I am older than your eminence although I possess not your wisdom Years of suffering in my opinion count double and I have suffered for twenty years Ah yes I understand said Mazarin want of fortune perhaps You are poor are you not Then he added to himself These English Revolutionists are all beggars and ill bred My lord I ought to have a fortune of six millions but it has been taken from me You are not then a man of the people said Mazarin astonished If I bore my proper title I should be a lord If I bore my name you would have heard one of the most illustrious names of England What is your name then asked Mazarin My name is Mordaunt replied the young man bowing Mazarin now understood that Cromwell s envoy desired to retain his incognito He was silent for an instant and during that time he scanned the young man even more attentively than he had done at first The messenger was unmoved Devil take these Puritans said Mazarin aside they are carved from granite Then he added aloud But you have relations left you I have one remaining Three times I presented myself to ask his support and three times he ordered his servants to turn me away Oh mon Dieu my dear mister Mordaunt said Mazarin hoping by a display of affected pity to catch the young man in a snare how extremely your history interests me You know not then anything of your birth you have never seen your mother Yes my lord she came three times whilst I was a child to my nurse s house I remember the last time she came as well as if it were to day You have a good memory said Mazarin Oh yes my lord said the young man with such peculiar emphasis that the cardinal felt a shudder run through every vein And who brought you up he asked again A French nurse who sent me away when I was five years old because no one paid her for me telling me the name of a relation of whom she had heard my mother often speak What became of you As I was weeping and begging on the high road a minister from Kingston took me in instructed me in the Calvinistic faith taught me all he knew himself and aided me in my researches after my family And these researches Were fruitless chance did everything You discovered what had become of your mother I learned that she had been assassinated by my relation aided by four friends but I was already aware that I had been robbed of my wealth and degraded from my nobility by King Charles I Oh I now understand why you are in the service of Cromwell you hate the king Yes my lord I hate him said the young man Mazarin marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the young man uttered these words Just as ordinarily faces are colored by blood his face seemed dyed by hatred and became livid Your history is a terrible one mister Mordaunt and touches me keenly but happily for you you serve an all powerful master he ought to aid you in your search we have so many means of gaining information My lord to a well bred dog it is only necessary to show one end of a track he is certain to reach the other But this relation you mentioned do you wish me to speak to him said Mazarin who was anxious to make a friend about Cromwell s person Thanks my lord I will speak to him myself He will treat me better the next time I see him You have the means then of touching him I have the means of making myself feared Mazarin looked at the young man but at the fire which shot from his glance he bent his head then embarrassed how to continue such a conversation he opened Cromwell s letter The young man s eyes gradually resumed their dull and glassy appearance and he fell into a profound reverie After reading the first lines of the letter Mazarin gave a side glance at him to see if he was watching the expression of his face as he read Observing his indifference he shrugged his shoulders saying Send on your business those who do theirs at the same time Let us see what this letter contains We here present the letter verbatim To his Eminence Monseigneur le Cardinal Mazarini I have wished monseigneur to learn your intentions relating to the existing state of affairs in England The two kingdoms are so near that France must be interested in our situation as we are interested in that of France The English are almost of one mind in contending against the tyranny of Charles and his adherents Placed by popular confidence at the head of that movement I can appreciate better than any other its significance and its probable results I am at present in the midst of war and am about to deliver a decisive battle against King Charles I shall gain it for the hope of the nation and the Spirit of the Lord are with me This battle won by me the king will have no further resources in England or in Scotland and if he is not captured or killed he will endeavor to pass over into France to recruit soldiers and to refurnish himself with arms and money France has already received Queen Henrietta and unintentionally doubtless has maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my country But Madame Henrietta is a daughter of France and was entitled to the hospitality of France As to King Charles the question must be viewed differently in receiving and aiding him France will censure the acts of the English nation and thus so essentially harm England and especially the well being of the government that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced hostilities At this moment Mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was taking and paused to glance under his eyes at the young man The latter continued in thought Mazarin resumed his reading It is important therefore monseigneur that I should be informed as to the intentions of France The interests of that kingdom and those of England though taking now diverse directions are very nearly the same England needs tranquillity at home in order to consummate the expulsion of her king France needs tranquillity to establish on solid foundations the throne of her young monarch You need as much as we do that interior condition of repose which thanks to the energy of our government we are about to attain Your quarrels with the parliament your noisy dissensions with the princes who fight for you to day and to morrow will fight against you the popular following directed by the coadjutor President Blancmesnil and Councillor Broussel all that disorder in short which pervades the several departments of the state must lead you to view with uneasiness the possibility of a foreign war for in that event England exalted by the enthusiasm of new ideas will ally herself with Spain already seeking that alliance I have therefore believed monseigneur knowing your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present time that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the interior of the French kingdom and leave to her own the new government of England That neutrality consists simply in excluding King Charles from the territory of France and in refraining from helping him a stranger to your country with arms with money or with troops My letter is private and confidential and for that reason I send it to you by a man who shares my most intimate counsels It anticipates through a sentiment which your eminence will appreciate measures to be taken after the events Oliver Cromwell considered it more expedient to declare himself to a mind as intelligent as Mazarin s than to a queen admirable for firmness without doubt but too much guided by vain prejudices of birth and of divine right Farewell monseigneur should I not receive a reply in the space of fifteen days I shall presume my letter will have miscarried Oliver Cromwell mister Mordaunt said the cardinal raising his voice as if to arouse the dreamer my reply to this letter will be more satisfactory to General Cromwell if I am convinced that all are ignorant of my having given one go therefore and await it at Boulogne sur Mer and promise me to set out to morrow morning I promise my lord replied Mordaunt but how many days does your eminence expect me to await your reply If you do not receive it in ten days you can leave Mordaunt bowed That is not all sir continued Mazarin your private adventures have touched me to the quick besides the letter from mister Cromwell makes you an important person as ambassador come tell me what can I do for you Mordaunt reflected a moment and after some hesitation was about to speak when Bernouin entered hastily and bending down to the ear of the cardinal whispered My lord the Queen Henrietta Maria accompanied by an English noble is entering the Palais Royal at this moment Mazarin made a bound from his chair which did not escape the attention of the young man and suppressed the confidence he was about to make Sir said the cardinal you have heard me I fix on Boulogne because I presume that every town in France is indifferent to you if you prefer another name it but you can easily conceive that surrounded as I am by influences I can only muzzle by discretion I desire your presence in Paris to be unknown I go sir said Mordaunt advancing a few steps to the door by which he had entered No not that way I beg sir quickly exclaimed the cardinal be so good as to pass by yonder gallery by which you can regain the hall I do not wish you to be seen leaving our interview must be kept secret Mordaunt followed Bernouin who led him through the adjacent chamber and left him with a doorkeeper showing him the way out thirty eight 
1646-121408-0000	train-other-500	Henrietta Maria and Mazarin The cardinal rose and advanced in haste to receive the queen of England He showed the more respect to this queen deprived of every mark of pomp and stripped of followers
1646-121408-0001	train-other-500	as he felt some self reproach for his own want of heart and his avarice But supplicants for favor know how to accommodate the expression of their features
none	none	 and the daughter of Henry IV smiled as she advanced to meet a man she hated and despised 
1646-121408-0002	train-other-500	Ah said Mazarin to himself what a sweet face does she come to borrow money of me And he threw an uneasy glance at his strong box he even turned inside the bevel of the magnificent diamond ring
1646-121408-0003	train-other-500	the brilliancy of which drew every eye upon his hand which indeed was white and handsome Your eminence said the august visitor it was my first intention to speak of the matters that have brought me here to the queen my sister
1646-121408-0004	train-other-500	but I have reflected that political affairs are more especially the concern of men Madame said Mazarin your majesty overwhelms me with flattering distinction He is very gracious thought the queen
1646-121408-0005	train-other-500	can he have guessed my errand Give continued the cardinal your commands to the most respectful of your servants Alas sir replied the queen
1646-121408-0006	train-other-500	I have lost the habit of commanding and have adopted instead that of making petitions I am here to petition you too happy should my prayer be favorably heard
none	none	 I am listening madame with the greatest interest said Mazarin 
1646-121408-0007	train-other-500	Your eminence it concerns the war which the king my husband is now sustaining against his rebellious subjects You are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in England added she with a melancholy smile
1646-121408-0008	train-other-500	and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done hitherto I am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders
1646-121408-0009	train-other-500	alas our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor incapable infirm old minister like me Well then your eminence said the queen
none	none	 I must inform you that Charles I my husband is on the eve of a decisive engagement 
1646-121408-0010	train-other-500	In case of a check Mazarin made a slight movement one must foresee everything in the case of a check he desires to retire into France and to live here as a private individual What do you say to this project
1646-121408-0011	train-other-500	The cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face to betray what he felt and his smile remained as it ever was false and flattering and when the queen finished speaking he said
1646-121408-0012	train-other-500	Do you think madame that France agitated and disturbed as it is would be a safe retreat for a dethroned king
none	none	 How will the crown which is scarce firmly set on the head of Louis XIV support a double weight 
1646-121408-0013	train-other-500	The weight was not so heavy when I was in peril interrupted the queen with a sad smile and I ask no more for my husband than has been done for me you see that we are very humble monarchs sir
1646-121408-0014	train-other-500	Oh you madame the cardinal hastened to say in order to cut short the explanation he foresaw was coming with regard to you that is another thing
none	none	 A daughter of Henry IV of that great that sublime sovereign 
1646-121408-0015	train-other-500	All which does not prevent you refusing hospitality to his son in law sir Nevertheless
none	none	 you ought to remember 
1646-121408-0016	train-other-500	that that great that sublime monarch when proscribed at one time as my husband may be demanded aid from England and England accorded it to him and it is but just to say that Queen Elizabeth was not his niece
1646-121408-0017	train-other-500	Peccato said Mazarin writhing beneath this simple eloquence your majesty does not understand me
none	none	 you judge my intentions wrongly and that is 
1646-121408-0018	train-other-500	partly because doubtless I explain myself in French Speak Italian sir
none	none	 Ere the cardinal your predecessor sent our mother Marie de Medicis to die in exile she taught us that language If anything yet remains of that great that sublime king Henry of whom you have just spoken he would be much surprised at so little pity for his family being united to such a profound admiration of himself 
1646-121408-0019	train-other-500	The perspiration stood in large drops on Mazarin s brow That admiration is on the contrary so great so real madame returned Mazarin without noticing the change of language offered to him by the queen
none	none	 that if the king Charles I whom Heaven protect from evil 
1646-121408-0020	train-other-500	came into France I would offer him my house my own house but alas it would be but an unsafe retreat Some day the people will burn that house as they burned that of the Marechal
none	none	 d Ancre 
1646-121408-0021	train-other-500	Poor Concino Concini And yet he but desired the good of the people Yes my lord like yourself said the queen ironically Mazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his own sentence
1646-121408-0022	train-other-500	but continued to compassionate the fate of Concino Concini Well then your eminence said the queen becoming impatient what is your answer
none	none	 Madame cried Mazarin more and more moved 
1646-121408-0023	train-other-500	will your majesty permit me to give you counsel Speak sir replied the queen the counsels of so prudent a man as yourself ought certainly to be available Madame believe me the king ought to defend himself to the last He has done so sir and this last battle
1914_121446_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 Speak sir 
none	none	replied the queen the counsels of so prudent a man as yourself ought certainly to be available Madame believe me the king ought to defend himself to the last He has done so sir and this last battle which he encounters with resources much inferior to those of the enemy 
1646-121408-0024	train-other-500	proves that he will not yield without a struggle but in case he is beaten Well madame in that case my advice
none	none	 I know that I am very bold to offer advice to your majesty 
1646-121408-0025	train-other-500	my advice is that the king should not leave his kingdom Absent kings are very soon forgotten if he passes over into France his cause is lost But persisted the queen if such be your advice and you have his interest at heart
1646-121408-0026	train-other-500	send him help of men and money for I can do nothing for him I have sold even to my last diamond to aid him If I had had a single ornament left
none	none	 I should have bought wood this winter to make a fire for my daughter and myself 
1646-121408-0027	train-other-500	Oh madame said Mazarin your majesty knows not what you ask On the day when foreign succor follows in the train of a king to replace him on his throne it is an avowal that he no longer possesses the help and love of his own subjects
1646-121408-0028	train-other-500	To the point sir said the queen to the point and answer me yes or no if the king persists in remaining in England will you send him succor If he comes to France will you accord him hospitality
none	none	 What do you intend to do 
1646-121408-0029	train-other-500	Speak Madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech
none	none	 I shall convince your majesty I trust of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have 
1646-121408-0030	train-other-500	so much at heart After which your majesty will I think no longer doubt my zeal in your behalf The queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her chair Well what do you propose to do she said at length come speak
1646-121408-0031	train-other-500	I will go this instant and consult the queen and we will refer the affair at once to parliament With which you are at war is it not so You will charge Broussel to report it Enough sir enough
1646-121408-0032	train-other-500	I understand you or rather I am wrong Go to the parliament for it was from this parliament the enemy of monarchs that the daughter of the great
none	none	 the sublime Henry IV whom you so much admire 
1646-121408-0033	train-other-500	received the only relief this winter which prevented her from dying of hunger and cold And with these words Henrietta rose in majestic indignation whilst the cardinal raising his hands clasped toward her
1646-121408-0034	train-other-500	exclaimed Ah madame madame how little you know me mon Dieu But Queen Henrietta without even turning toward him who made these hypocritical pretensions crossed the cabinet opened the door for herself and passing through the midst
1646-121408-0035	train-other-500	of the cardinal s numerous guards courtiers eager to pay homage the luxurious show of a competing royalty she went and took the hand of De Winter who stood apart in isolation Poor queen already fallen
1646-121408-0036	train-other-500	Though all bowed before her as etiquette required she had now but a single arm on which she could lean It signifies little said Mazarin when he was alone It gave me pain and it was an ungracious part to play
none	none	 but I have said nothing either to the one or to the other 
1646-121408-0037	train-other-500	Bernouin Bernouin entered See if the young man with the black doublet and the short hair who was with me just now is still in the palace Bernouin went out and soon returned with Comminges who was on guard
none	none	 Your eminence said Comminges 
1646-121408-0038	train-other-500	as I was re conducting the young man for whom you have asked he approached the glass door of the gallery and gazed intently upon some object doubtless the picture by Raphael which is opposite the door He reflected for a second and then descended the stairs
1646-121408-0039	train-other-500	I believe I saw him mount a gray horse and leave the palace court But is not your eminence going to the queen For what purpose Monsieur de Guitant my uncle has just told me that her majesty had received news of the army
1914_121449_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 For what purpose 
none	none	Monsieur de Guitant my uncle has just told me that her majesty had received news of the army 
1646-121408-0040	train-other-500	It is well I will go
none	none	 Comminges had seen rightly and Mordaunt 
1646-121408-0041	train-other-500	had really acted as he had related In crossing the gallery parallel to the large glass gallery he perceived De Winter who was waiting until the queen had finished her negotiation At this sight the young man stopped short
none	none	 not in admiration of Raphael s picture 
1646-121408-0042	train-other-500	but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible object His eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body One would have said that he longed to break through the wall of glass which separated him from his enemy
none	none	 for if Comminges had seen 
1646-121408-0043	train-other-500	with what an expression of hatred the eyes of this young man were fixed upon De Winter he would not have doubted for an instant that the Englishman was his eternal foe But he stopped doubtless to reflect for instead of allowing his first impulse which had been to go straight
1646-121408-0044	train-other-500	to Lord de Winter to carry him away he leisurely descended the staircase left the palace with his head down mounted his horse which he reined in at the corner of the Rue Richelieu and with his eyes fixed on the gate waited until the queen s carriage had left the court
1646-121408-0045	train-other-500	He had not long to wait for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with Mazarin but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a century to him At last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out
1646-121408-0046	train-other-500	rumbling against the gates and De Winter still on horseback bent again to the door to converse with her majesty The horses started on a trot and took the road to the Louvre which they entered
1646-121408-0047	train-other-500	Before leaving the convent of the Carmelites Henrietta had desired her daughter to attend her at the palace
none	none	 which she had inhabited for a long time and which she had only left because their poverty seemed to them 
1646-121408-0048	train-other-500	more difficult to bear in gilded chambers Mordaunt followed the carriage and when he had watched it drive beneath the sombre arches he went and stationed himself under a wall over which the shadow was extended and remained motionless
1646-121408-0049	train-other-500	amidst the moldings of Jean Goujon
none	none	 like a bas relievo representing an equestrian statue thirty nine How sometimes the Unhappy mistake Chance for Providence 
1646-121409-0000	train-other-500	Well madame said De Winter when the queen had dismissed her attendants Well my lord what I foresaw has come to pass What does the cardinal refuse to receive the king France refuse hospitality to an unfortunate prince
1646-121409-0001	train-other-500	Ay but it is for the first time madame I did not say France my lord I said the cardinal and the cardinal is not even a Frenchman But did you see the queen It is useless replied Henrietta the queen will not say yes when the cardinal says no
1646-121409-0002	train-other-500	Are you not aware that this Italian directs everything both indoors and out And moreover I should not be surprised had we been forestalled by Cromwell He was embarrassed whilst speaking to me and yet quite firm in his determination to refuse
1646-121409-0003	train-other-500	Then did you not observe the agitation in the Palais Royal the passing to and fro of busy people Can they have received any news my lord Not from England madame I made such haste that I am certain of not having been forestalled
1646-121409-0004	train-other-500	I set out three days ago passing miraculously through the Puritan army and I took post horses with my servant Tony the horses upon which we were mounted were bought in Paris Besides the king I am certain awaits your majesty s reply before risking anything
1646-121409-0005	train-other-500	You will tell him my lord resumed the queen despairingly that I can do nothing that I have suffered as much as himself more than he has obliged as I am to eat the bread of exile and to ask hospitality from false friends who smile at my tears
1646-121409-0006	train-other-500	and as regards his royal person he must sacrifice it generously and die like a king I shall go and die by his side Madame madame exclaimed De Winter your majesty abandons yourself to despair and yet perhaps there still remains some hope
none	none	 No friends left my lord no other friends left in the wide world but yourself Oh God exclaimed the poor queen raising her eyes to Heaven have You indeed taken back all the generous hearts that once existed in the world I hope not madame replied De Winter thoughtfully I once spoke to you of four men 
1646-121409-0007	train-other-500	What can be done with four Four devoted resolute men can do much assure yourself madame and those of whom I speak performed great things at one time And where are these four men Ah that is what I do not know
none	none	 It is twenty years since I saw them and yet whenever I have seen the king in danger I have thought of them 
1646-121409-0008	train-other-500	And these men were your friends One of them held my life in his hands and gave it to me I know not whether he is still my friend but since that time I have remained his And these men are in France my lord I believe so
none	none	 Tell me their names perhaps I may have heard them mentioned and might be able to aid you in finding them 
1646-121409-0009	train-other-500	One of them was called the Chevalier d Artagnan Ah my lord if I mistake not the Chevalier d Artagnan is lieutenant of royal guards but take care for I fear that this man is entirely devoted to the cardinal
1646-121409-0010	train-other-500	That would be a misfortune said De Winter and I shall begin to think that we are really doomed But the others said the queen who clung to this last hope as a shipwrecked man clings to the hull of his vessel The others my lord
1646-121409-0011	train-other-500	The second I heard his name by chance for before fighting us these four gentlemen told us their names the second was called the Comte de la Fere
none	none	 As for the two others I had so much the habit of calling them by nicknames that I have forgotten their real ones 
1646-121409-0012	train-other-500	Oh mon Dieu it is a matter of the greatest urgency to find them out said the queen since you think these worthy gentlemen might be so useful to the king Oh yes said De Winter for they are the same men Listen madame and recall your remembrances
1646-121409-0013	train-other-500	Have you never heard that Queen Anne of Austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by a queen Yes at the time of her relations with Monsieur de Buckingham it had to do in some way with certain studs and diamonds Well it was that affair madame
1646-121409-0014	train-other-500	these men are the ones who saved her and I smile with pity when I reflect that if the names of those gentlemen are unknown to you it is because the queen has forgotten them who ought to have made them the first noblemen of the realm
1646-121409-0015	train-other-500	Well then my lord they must be found but what can four men or rather three men do for I tell you you must not count on Monsieur d Artagnan It will be one valiant sword the less but there will remain still three without reckoning my own
1646-121409-0016	train-other-500	now four devoted men around the king to protect him from his enemies to be at his side in battle to aid him with counsel to escort him in flight are sufficient not to make the king a conqueror but to save him if conquered and whatever Mazarin may say once on the shores of France your royal husband
1646-121409-0017	train-other-500	may find as many retreats and asylums as the seabird finds in a storm Seek then my lord seek these gentlemen and if they will consent to go with you to England I will give to each a duchy the day that we reascend the throne besides as much gold as would pave Whitehall
1646-121409-0018	train-other-500	Seek them my lord and find them I conjure you I will search for them madame said De Winter and doubtless I shall find them but time fails me Has your majesty forgotten that the king expects your reply and awaits it in agony
1646-121409-0019	train-other-500	Then indeed we are lost cried the queen in the fullness of a broken heart At this moment the door opened and the young Henrietta appeared then the queen with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents repressed her tears and motioned to De Winter to change the subject
1646-121409-0020	train-other-500	But that act of self control effective as it was did not escape the eyes of the young princess She stopped on the threshold breathed a sigh and addressing the queen Why then do you always weep mother when I am away from you she said
1646-121409-0021	train-other-500	The queen smiled but instead of answering See De Winter she said I have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame Then turning toward her daughter
none	none	 What do you want Henrietta she demanded 
1646-121409-0022	train-other-500	My mother replied the young princess a cavalier has just entered the Louvre and wishes to present his respects to your majesty he arrives from the army and has he says a letter to remit to you on the part of the Marechal de Grammont I think
1646-121409-0023	train-other-500	Ah said the queen to De Winter he is one of my faithful adherents but do you not observe my dear lord that we are so poorly served that it is left to my daughter to fill the office of doorkeeper Madame have pity on me exclaimed De Winter you wring my heart
1646-121409-0024	train-other-500	And who is this cavalier Henrietta asked the queen
none	none	 I saw him from the window madame he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age and is called the Viscount de Bragelonne 
1646-121409-0025	train-other-500	The queen smiling made a sign with her head the young princess opened the door and Raoul appeared on the threshold Advancing a few steps toward the queen he knelt down Madame said he I bear to your majesty a letter from my friend the Count de Guiche
1646-121409-0026	train-other-500	who told me he had the honor of being your servant this letter contains important news and the expression of his respect At the name of the Count de Guiche a blush spread over the cheeks of the young princess and the queen glanced at her with some degree of severity
1646-121409-0027	train-other-500	You told me that the letter was from the Marechal de Grammont Henrietta said the queen
none	none	 I thought so madame stammered the young girl 
1646-121409-0028	train-other-500	It is my fault madame said Raoul I did announce myself in truth as coming on the part of the Marechal de Grammont but being wounded in the right arm he was unable to write and therefore the Count de Guiche acted as his secretary There has been fighting then asked the queen motioning to Raoul to rise
1646-121409-0029	train-other-500	Yes madame said the young man At this announcement of a battle having taken place the princess opened her mouth as though to ask a question of interest but her lips closed again without articulating a word while the color gradually faded from her cheeks
1646-121409-0030	train-other-500	The queen saw this and doubtless her maternal heart translated the emotion for addressing Raoul again And no evil has happened to the young Count de Guiche she asked for not only is he our servant as you say sir but more he is one of our friends
1646-121409-0031	train-other-500	No madame replied Raoul on the contrary he gained great glory and had the honor of being embraced by his highness the prince on the field of battle The young princess clapped her hands and then ashamed of having been betrayed into such a demonstration of joy
1646-121409-0032	train-other-500	she half turned away and bent over a vase of roses as if to inhale their odor Let us see said the queen what the count says And she opened the letter and read Madame
none	none	 Being unable to have the honor of writing to you myself by reason of a wound I have received in my right hand 
1646-121409-0033	train-other-500	I have commanded my son the Count de Guiche who with his father is equally your humble servant
none	none	 to write to tell you that we have just gained the battle of Lens 
1646-121409-0034	train-other-500	and that this victory cannot fail to give great power to Cardinal Mazarin and to the queen over the affairs of Europe
none	none	 If her majesty will have faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address at this moment in favor of her august husband the court of France The Vicomte de Bragelonne who will have the honor of remitting this letter to your majesty 
1646-121409-0035	train-other-500	is the friend of my son who owes to him his life he is a gentleman in whom your majesty may confide entirely in case your majesty may have some verbal or written order to remit to me I have the honor to be with respect et cetera Marechal de Grammont
1646-121409-0036	train-other-500	At the moment mention occurred of his having rendered a service to the count Raoul could not help turning his glance toward the young princess and then he saw in her eyes an expression of infinite gratitude to the young man
none	none	 he no longer doubted that the daughter of King Charles I loved his friend The battle of Lens gained said the queen they are lucky here indeed 
1646-121409-0037	train-other-500	they can gain battles Yes the Marechal de Grammont is right
none	none	 this will change the aspect of French affairs but I much fear 
1646-121409-0038	train-other-500	it will do nothing for English even if it does not harm them This is recent news sir continued she and I thank you for having made such haste to bring it to me without this letter I should not have heard till to morrow perhaps after to morrow the last of all Paris

1646-121409-0047	train-other-500	but the precaution was needless she was in deep converse with her own thoughts Then when De Winter rose to take leave

none	none	 brushing away tears which blase as he was by fifty years spent as a courtier he could not withhold at the spectacle of royal distress so dignified yet so intense forty Uncle and Nephew The horse and servant belonging to De Winter were waiting for him at the door he proceeded toward his abode very thoughtfully looking behind him from time to him to contemplate the dark and silent frontage of the Louvre It was then that he saw a horseman as it were detach himself from the wall and follow him at a little distance In leaving the Palais Royal he remembered to have observed a similar shadow Tony he said motioning to his groom to approach Here I am my lord Did you remark that man who is following us Yes my lord Who is he I do not know only he has followed your grace from the Palais Royal stopped at the Louvre to wait for you and now leaves the Louvre with you Some spy of the cardinal said De Winter to him aside Let us pretend not to notice that he is watching us And spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to his hotel situated near the Marais for having for so long a time lived near the Place Royale Lord de Winter naturally returned to lodge near his ancient dwelling The unknown spurred his horse to a gallop De Winter dismounted at his hotel and went up into his apartment intending to watch the spy but as he was about to place his gloves and hat on a table he saw reflected in a glass opposite to him a figure which stood on the threshold of the room He turned around and Mordaunt stood before him There was a moment of frozen silence between these two Sir said De Winter I thought I had already made you aware that I am weary of this persecution withdraw then or I shall call and have you turned out as you were in London I am not your uncle I know you not My uncle replied Mordaunt with his harsh and bantering tone you are mistaken you will not have me turned out this time as you did in London you dare not As for denying that I am your nephew you will think twice about it now that I have learned some things of which I was ignorant a year ago And how does it concern me what you have learned said De Winter Oh it concerns you very closely my uncle I am sure and you will soon be of my opinion added he with a smile which sent a shudder through the veins of him he thus addressed When I presented myself before you for the first time in London it was to ask you what had become of my fortune the second time it was to demand who had sullied my name and this time I come before you to ask a question far more terrible than any other to say to you as God said to the first murderer Cain what hast thou done to thy brother Abel My lord what have you done with your sister your sister who was my mother De Winter shrank back from the fire of those scorching eyes Your mother he said Yes my lord my mother replied the young man advancing into the room until he was face to face with Lord de Winter and crossing his arms I have asked the headsman of Bethune he said his voice hoarse and his face livid with passion and grief And the headsman of Bethune gave me a reply De Winter fell back in a chair as though struck by a thunderbolt and in vain attempted a reply Yes continued the young man all is now explained with this key I open the abyss My mother inherited an estate from her husband you have assassinated her my name would have secured me the paternal estate you have deprived me of it you have despoiled me of my fortune I am no longer astonished that you knew me not I am not surprised that you refused to recognize me When a man is a robber it is hard to call him nephew whom he has impoverished when one is a murderer to recognize the man whom one has made an orphan These words produced a contrary effect to that which Mordaunt had anticipated De Winter remembered the monster that Milady had been he rose dignified and calm restraining by the severity of his look the wild glance of the young man You desire to fathom this horrible secret said De Winter well then so be it Know then what manner of woman it was for whom to day you call me to account That woman had in all probability poisoned my brother and in order to inherit from me she was about to assassinate me in my turn I have proof of it What say you to that I say that she was my mother She caused the unfortunate Duke of Buckingham to be stabbed by a man who was ere that honest good and pure What say you to that crime of which I have the proof She was my mother On our return to France she had a young woman who was attached to one of her opponents poisoned in the convent of the Augustines at Bethune Will this crime persuade you of the justice of her punishment for of all this I have the proofs She was my mother cried the young man who uttered these three successive exclamations with constantly increasing force At last charged with murders with debauchery hated by every one and yet threatening still like a panther thirsting for blood she fell under the blows of men whom she had rendered desperate though they had never done her the least injury she met with judges whom her hideous crimes had evoked and that executioner you saw that executioner who you say told you everything that executioner if he told you everything told you that he leaped with joy in avenging on her his brother s shame and suicide Depraved as a girl adulterous as a wife an unnatural sister homicide poisoner execrated by all who knew her by every nation that had been visited by her she died accursed by Heaven and earth A sob which Mordaunt could not repress burst from his throat and his livid face became suffused with blood he clenched his fists sweat covered his face his hair like Hamlet s stood on end and racked with fury he cried out Silence sir she was my mother Her crimes I know them not her disorders I know them not her vices I know them not But this I know that I had a mother that five men leagued against one woman murdered her clandestinely by night silently like cowards I know that you were one of them my uncle and that you cried louder than the others She must die Therefore I warn you and listen well to my words that they may be engraved upon your memory never to be forgotten this murder which has robbed me of everything this murder which has deprived me of my name this murder which has impoverished me this murder which has made me corrupt wicked implacable I shall summon you to account for it first and then those who were your accomplices when I discover them With hatred in his eyes foaming at his mouth and his fist extended Mordaunt had advanced one more step a threatening terrible step toward De Winter The latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death Would you assassinate me sir Then I shall recognize you as my nephew for you would be a worthy son of such a mother No replied Mordaunt forcing his features and the muscles of his body to resume their usual places and be calm no I shall not kill you at least not at this moment for without you I could not discover the others But when I have found them then tremble sir I stabbed to the heart the headsman of Bethune without mercy or pity and he was the least guilty of you all With these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved then upon the lowest landing place he passed Tony leaning over the balustrade waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his room But De Winter did not call crushed enfeebled he remained standing and with listening ear then only when he had heard the step of the horse going away he fell back on a chair saying My God I thank Thee that he knows me only forty one Paternal Affection Whilst this terrible scene was passing at Lord de Winter s Athos seated near his window his elbow on the table and his head supported on his hand was listening intently to Raoul s account of the adventures he met with on his journey and the details of the battle Listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure the fine noble face of Athos betrayed indescribable pleasure he inhaled the tones of that young voice as harmonious music He forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the future It almost seemed as if the return of this much loved boy had changed his fears to hopes Athos was happy happy as he had never been before And you assisted and took part in this great battle Bragelonne cried the former musketeer Yes sir And it was a fierce one His highness the prince charged eleven times in person He is a great commander Bragelonne He is a hero sir I did not lose sight of him for an instant Oh how fine it is to be called Conde and to be so worthy of such a name He was calm and radiant was he not As calm as at parade radiant as at a fete When we went up to the enemy it was slowly we were forbidden to draw first and we were marching toward the Spaniards who were on a height with lowered muskets When we arrived about thirty paces from them the prince turned around to the soldiers Comrades he said you are about to suffer a furious discharge but after that you will make short work with those fellows There was such dead silence that friends and enemies could have heard these words then raising his sword Sound trumpets he cried Well very good you will do as much when the opportunity occurs will you Raoul I know not sir but I thought it really very fine and grand Were you afraid Raoul asked the count Yes sir replied the young man naively I felt a great chill at my heart and at the word fire which resounded in Spanish from the enemy s ranks I closed my eyes and thought of you In honest truth Raoul said Athos pressing his hand Yes sir at that instant there was such a rataplan of musketry that one might have imagined the infernal regions had opened Those who were not killed felt the heat of the flames I opened my eyes astonished to find myself alive and even unhurt a third of the squadron were lying on the ground wounded dead or dying At that moment I encountered the eye of the prince I had but one thought and that was that he was observing me I spurred on and found myself in the enemy s ranks And the prince was pleased with you He told me so at least sir when he desired me to return to Paris with Monsieur de Chatillon who was charged to carry the news to the queen and to bring the colors we had taken Go said he the enemy will not rally for fifteen days and until that time I have no need of your service Go and see those whom you love and who love you and tell my sister De Longueville that I thank her for the present that she made me of you And I came sir added Raoul gazing at the count with a smile of real affection for I thought you would be glad to see me again Athos drew the young man toward him and pressed his lips to his brow as he would have done to a young daughter And now Raoul said he you are launched you have dukes for friends a marshal of France for godfather a prince of the blood as commander and on the day of your return you have been received by two queens it is not so bad for a novice Oh sir said Raoul suddenly you recall something which in my haste to relate my exploits I had forgotten it is that there was with Her Majesty the Queen of England a gentleman who when I pronounced your name uttered a cry of surprise and joy he said he was a friend of yours asked your address and is coming to see you What is his name I did not venture to ask sir he spoke elegantly although I thought from his accent he was an Englishman Ah said Athos leaning down his head as if to remember who it could be Then when he raised it again he was struck by the presence of a man who was standing at the open door and was gazing at him with a compassionate air Lord de Winter exclaimed the count Athos my friend And the two gentlemen were for an instant locked in each other s arms then Athos looking into his friend s face and taking him by both hands said What ails you my lord you appear as unhappy as I am the reverse Yes truly dear friend and I may even say the sight of you increases my dismay And De Winter glancing around him Raoul quickly understood that the two friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room unaffectedly Come now that we are alone said Athos let us talk of yourself Whilst we are alone let us speak of ourselves replied De Winter He is here Who Milady s son Athos again struck by this name which seemed to pursue him like an echo hesitated for a moment then slightly knitting his brows he calmly said I know it Grimaud met him between Bethune and Arras and then came here to warn me of his presence Does Grimaud know him then No but he was present at the deathbed of a man who knew him The headsman of Bethune exclaimed De Winter You know about that cried Athos astonished He has just left me replied De Winter after telling me all Ah my friend what a horrible scene Why did we not destroy the child with the mother What need you fear said Athos recovering from the instinctive fear he had at first experienced by the aid of reason are we not men accustomed to defend ourselves Is this young man an assassin by profession a murderer in cold blood He has killed the executioner of Bethune in an access of passion but now his fury is assuaged De Winter smiled sorrowfully and shook his head Do you not know the race said he Pooh said Athos trying to smile in his turn It must have lost its ferocity in the second generation Besides my friend Providence has warned us that we may be on our guard All we can now do is to wait Let us wait and as I said before let us speak of yourself What brings you to Paris Affairs of importance which you shall know later But what is this that I hear from Her Majesty the Queen of England Monsieur d Artagnan sides with Mazarin Pardon my frankness dear friend I neither hate nor blame the cardinal and your opinions will be held ever sacred by me But do you happen to belong to him Monsieur d Artagnan replied Athos is in the service he is a soldier and obeys all constitutional authority Monsieur d Artagnan is not rich and has need of his position as lieutenant to enable him to live Millionaires like yourself my lord are rare in France Alas said De Winter I am at this moment as poor as he is if not poorer But to return to our subject Well then you wish to know if I am of Mazarin s party No Pardon my frankness too my lord I am obliged to you count for this pleasing intelligence You make me young and happy again by it Ah so you are not a Mazarinist Delightful Indeed you could not belong to him But pardon me are you free I mean to ask if you are married Ah as to that no replied Athos laughing Because that young man so handsome so elegant so polished Is a child I have adopted and who does not even know who was his father Very well you are always the same Athos great and generous Are you still friends with Monsieur Porthos and Monsieur Aramis Add Monsieur d Artagnan my lord We still remain four friends devoted to each other but when it becomes a question of serving the cardinal or of fighting him of being Mazarinists or Frondists then we are only two Is Monsieur Aramis with D Artagnan asked Lord de Winter No said Athos Monsieur Aramis does me the honor to share my opinions Could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend Is he much changed He has become an abbe that is all You alarm me his profession must have made him renounce any great undertakings On the contrary said Athos smiling he has never been so much a musketeer as since he became an abbe and you will find him a veritable soldier Could you engage to bring him to me to morrow morning at ten o clock on the Pont du Louvre Oh oh exclaimed Athos smiling you have a duel in prospect Yes count and a splendid duel too a duel in which I hope you will take your part Where are we to go my lord To Her Majesty the Queen of England who has desired me to present you to her This is an enigma said Athos but it matters not since you know the solution of it I ask no further Will your lordship do me the honor to sup with me Thanks count no replied De Winter I own to you that that young man s visit has subdued my appetite and probably will rob me of my sleep What undertaking can have brought him to Paris It was not to meet me that he came for he was ignorant of my journey This young man terrifies me my lord there lies in him a sanguinary predisposition What occupies him in England He is one of Cromwell s most enthusiastic disciples But what attached him to the cause His father and mother were Catholics I believe His hatred of the king who deprived him of his estates and forbade him to bear the name of De Winter And what name does he now bear Mordaunt A Puritan yet disguised as a monk he travels alone in France Do you say as a monk It was thus and by mere accident may God pardon me if I blaspheme that he heard the confession of the executioner of Bethune Then I understand it all he has been sent by Cromwell to Mazarin and the queen guessed rightly we have been forestalled Everything is clear to me now Adieu count till to morrow But the night is dark said Athos perceiving that Lord de Winter seemed more uneasy than he wished to appear and you have no servant I have Tony a safe if simple youth Halloo there Grimaud Olivain and Blaisois call the viscount and take the musket with you Blaisois was the tall youth half groom half peasant whom we saw at the Chateau de Bragelonne whom Athos had christened by the name of his province Viscount said Athos to Raoul as he entered you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach him Oh count said De Winter for whom do you take me For a stranger who does not know Paris said Athos and to whom the viscount will show the way De Winter shook him by the hand Grimaud said Athos put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the monk Grimaud shuddered and nodding awaited the departure regarding the butt of his musket with silent eloquence Then obeying the orders given him by Athos he headed the small procession bearing the torch in one hand and the musket in the other until it reached De Winter s inn when pounding on the portal with his fist he bowed to my lord and faced about without a word The same order was followed in returning nor did Grimaud s searching glance discover anything of a suspicious appearance save a dark shadow as it were in ambuscade at the corner of the Rue Guenegaud and of the Quai He fancied also that in going he had already observed the street watcher who had attracted his attention He pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which Grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it The next day on awaking the count perceived Raoul by his bedside The young man was already dressed and was reading a new book by M Chapelain Already up Raoul exclaimed the count Yes sir replied Raoul with slight hesitation I did not sleep well You Raoul not sleep well then you must have something on your mind said Athos Sir you will perhaps think that I am in a great hurry to leave you when I have only just arrived but Have you only two days of leave Raoul On the contrary sir I have ten nor is it to the camp I wish to go Where then said Athos smiling if it be not a secret You are now almost a man since you have made your first passage of arms and have acquired the right to go where you will without consulting me Never sir said Raoul as long as I possess the happiness of having you for a protector shall I deem I have the right of freeing myself from a guardianship so valuable to me I have however a wish to go and pass a day at Blois You look at me and you are going to laugh at me No on the contrary I am not inclined to laugh said Athos suppressing a sigh You wish to see Blois again it is but natural Then you permit me to go you are not angry in your heart exclaimed Raoul joyously Certainly and why should I regret what gives you pleasure Oh how kind you are exclaimed the young man pressing his guardian s hand and I can set out immediately When you like Raoul Sir said Raoul as he turned to leave the room I have thought of one thing and that is about the Duchess of Chevreuse who was so kind to me and to whom I owe my introduction to the prince And you ought to thank her Raoul Well try the Hotel de Luynes Raoul and ask if the duchess can receive you I am glad to see you pay attention to the usages of the world You must take Grimaud and Olivain Both sir asked Raoul astonished Both Raoul went out and when Athos heard his young joyous voice calling to Grimaud and Olivain he sighed It is very soon to leave me he thought but he follows the common custom Nature has made us thus she makes the young look ever forward not behind He certainly likes the child but will he love me less as his affection grows for her And Athos confessed to himself that he was unprepared for so prompt a departure but Raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced everything else from the consideration of his guardian Everything was ready at ten o clock for the departure and as Athos was watching Raoul mount a groom rode up from the Duchess de Chevreuse He was charged to tell the Comte de la Fere that she had learned of the return of her youthful protege and also the manner he had conducted himself on the field and she added that she should be very glad to offer him her congratulations Tell her grace replied Athos that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the Hotel de Luynes Then with renewed instructions to Grimaud Athos signified to Raoul that he could set out and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that Raoul should be away from Paris at that moment forty two Another Queen in Want of Help Athos had not failed to send early to Aramis and had given his letter to Blaisois the only serving man whom he had left Blaisois found Bazin donning his beadle s gown his services being required that day at Notre Dame Athos had desired Blaisois to try to speak to Aramis himself Blaisois a tall simple youth who understood nothing but what he was expressly told asked therefore for the Abbe d Herblay and in spite of Bazin s assurances that his master was not at home he persisted in such a manner as to put Bazin into a passion Blaisois seeing Bazin in clerical guise was a little discomposed at his denials and wanted to pass at all risks believing too that the man with whom he had to do was endowed with the virtues of his cloth namely patience and Christian charity But Bazin still the servant of a musketeer when once the blood mounted to his fat cheeks seized a broomstick and began belaboring Blaisois saying You have insulted the church my friend you have insulted the church At this moment Aramis aroused by this unusual disturbance cautiously opened the door of his room and Blaisois looking reproachfully at the Cerberus drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to Aramis From the Comte de la Fere said Aramis All right And he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much noise Blaisois returned disconsolate to the Hotel of the Grand Roi Charlemagne and when Athos inquired if his commission was executed he related his adventure You foolish fellow said Athos laughing And you did not tell him that you came from me No sir At ten o clock Athos with his habitual exactitude was waiting on the Pont du Louvre and was almost immediately joined by Lord de Winter They waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear Aramis was not coming to join them Patience said Athos whose eyes were fixed in the direction of the Rue du Bac patience I see an abbe cuffing a man then bowing to a woman it must be Aramis It was indeed Aramis Having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him Aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten paces At this moment one of his penitents passed and as she was young and pretty Aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious smile A most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and Lord de Winter Where are we going inquired Aramis are we going to fight perchance I carry no sword this morning and cannot return home to procure one No said Lord de Winter we are going to pay a visit to Her Majesty the Queen of England Oh very well replied Aramis then bending his face down to Athos s ear what is the object of this visit continued he Nay I know not some evidence required from us perhaps May it not be about that cursed affair asked Aramis in which case I do not greatly care to go for it will be to pocket a lecture and since it is my function to give them to others I am rather averse to receiving them myself If it were so answered Athos we should not be taken there by Lord de Winter for he would come in for his share he was one of us You re right yes let us go On arriving at the Louvre Lord de Winter entered first indeed there was but one porter there to receive them at the gate It was impossible in daylight for the impoverished state of the habitation grudging charity had conceded to an unfortunate queen to pass unnoticed by Athos Aramis and even the Englishman Large rooms completely stripped of furniture bare walls upon which here and there shone the old gold moldings which had resisted time and neglect windows with broken panes impossible to close no carpets neither guards nor servants this is what first met the eyes of Athos to which he touching his companion s elbow directed his attention by his glances Mazarin is better lodged said Aramis Mazarin is almost king answered Athos Madame Henrietta is almost no longer queen If you would condescend to be clever Athos observed Aramis I really do think you would be wittier than poor Monsieur de Voiture Athos smiled The queen appeared to be impatiently expecting them for at the first slight noise she heard in the hall leading to her room she came herself to the door to receive these courtiers in the corridors of Misfortune Enter You are welcome gentlemen she said The gentlemen entered and remained standing but at a motion from the queen they seated themselves Athos was calm and grave but Aramis was furious the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented itself You are examining the luxury I enjoy said the queen glancing sadly around her Madame replied Aramis I must ask your pardon but I know not how to hide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of Henry IV is treated at the court of France Monsieur Aramis is not an officer asked the queen of Lord de Winter That gentleman is the Abbe d Herblay replied he Aramis blushed Madame he said I am an abbe it is true but I am so against my will I never had a vocation for the bands my cassock is fastened by one button only and I am always ready to become a musketeer once more This morning being ignorant that I should have the honor of seeing your majesty I encumbered myself with this dress but you will find me none the less a man devoted to your majesty s service in whatever way you may see fit to use me The Abbe d Herblay resumed De Winter is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to His Majesty King Louis XIII of whom I have spoken to you madame Then turning to Athos he continued And this gentleman is that noble Comte de la Fere whose high reputation is so well known to your majesty Gentlemen said the queen a few years ago I had around me ushers treasures armies and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my service To day look around you and it may astonish you that in order to accomplish a plan which is dearer to me than life I have only Lord de Winter the friend of twenty years and you gentlemen whom I see for the first time and whom I know but as my countrymen It is enough said Athos bowing low if the lives of three men can purchase yours madame I thank you gentlemen But hear me continued she I am not only the most miserable of queens but the most unhappy of mothers the most wretched of wives My children two of them at least the Duke of York and the Princess Elizabeth are far away from me exposed to the blows of the ambitious and our foes my husband the king is leading in England so wretched an existence that it is no exaggeration to aver that he seeks death as a thing to be desired Hold gentlemen here is the letter conveyed to me by Lord de Winter Read it Obeying the queen Athos read aloud the letter which we have already seen in which King Charles demanded to know whether the hospitality of France would be accorded him Well asked Athos when he had closed the letter Well said the queen it has been refused The two friends exchanged a smile of contempt And now said Athos what is to be done I have the honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire Monsieur d Herblay and myself to do in your service We are ready Ah sir you have a noble heart exclaimed the queen with a burst of gratitude whilst Lord de Winter turned to her with a glance which said Did I not answer for them But you sir said the queen to Aramis I madame replied he follow Monsieur de la Fere wherever he leads even were it on to death without demanding wherefore but when it concerns your majesty s service then added he looking at the queen with all the grace of former days I precede the count Well then gentlemen said the queen since it is thus and since you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom the whole world has abandoned this is what is required to be done for me The king is alone with a few gentlemen whom he fears to lose every day surrounded by the Scotch whom he distrusts although he be himself a Scotchman Since Lord de Winter left him I am distracted sirs I ask much too much perhaps for I have no title to request it Go to England join the king be his friends protectors march to battle at his side and be near him in his house where conspiracies more dangerous than the perils of war are hatching every day And in exchange for the sacrifice that you make gentlemen I promise not to reward you I believe that word would offend you but to love you as a sister to prefer you next to my husband and my children to every one I swear it before Heaven And the queen raised her eyes solemnly upward Madame said Athos when must we set out You consent then exclaimed the queen joyfully Yes madame only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in engaging to load us with a friendship so far above our merit We render service to God madame in serving a prince so unfortunate a queen so virtuous Madame we are yours body and soul Oh sirs said the queen moved even to tears this is the first time for five years I have felt the least approach to joy or hope God who can read my heart all the gratitude I feel will reward you Save my husband Save the king and although you care not for the price that is placed upon a good action in this world leave me the hope that we shall meet again when I may be able to thank you myself In the meantime I remain here Have you anything to ask of me From this moment I become your friend and since you are engaged in my affairs I ought to occupy myself in yours Madame replied Athos I have only to ask your majesty s prayers And I said Aramis I am alone in the world and have only your majesty to serve The queen held out her hand which they kissed and she said in a low tone to De Winter If you need money my lord separate the jewels I have given you detach the diamonds and sell them to some Jew You will receive for them fifty or sixty thousand francs spend them if necessary but let these gentlemen be treated as they deserve that is to say like kings The queen had two letters ready one written by herself the other by her daughter the Princess Henrietta Both were addressed to King Charles She gave the first to Athos and the other to Aramis so that should they be separated by chance they might make themselves known to the king after which they withdrew At the foot of the staircase De Winter stopped Not to arouse suspicions gentlemen said he go your way and I will go mine and this evening at nine o clock we will assemble again at the Gate Saint Denis We will travel on horseback as far as our horses can go and afterward we can take the post Once more let me thank you my good friends both in my own name and the queen s The three gentlemen then shook hands Lord de Winter taking the Rue Saint Honore and Athos and Aramis remaining together Well said Aramis when they were alone what do you think of this business my dear count Bad replied Athos very bad But you received it with enthusiasm As I shall ever receive the defense of a great principle my dear D Herblay Monarchs are only strong by the assistance of the aristocracy but aristocracy cannot survive without the countenance of monarchs Let us then support monarchy in order to support ourselves We shall be murdered there said Aramis I hate the English they are coarse like every nation that swills beer Would it be better to remain here said Athos and take a turn in the Bastile or the dungeon of Vincennes for having favored the escape of Monsieur de Beaufort I faith Aramis believe me there is little left to regret We avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes the choice is easy It is true but in everything friend one must always return to the same question a stupid one I admit but very necessary have you any money Something like a hundred pistoles that my farmer sent to me the day before I left Bragelonne but out of that sum I ought to leave fifty for Raoul a young man must live respectably I have then about fifty pistoles And you As for me I am quite sure that after turning out all my pockets and emptying my drawers I shall not find ten louis at home Fortunately Lord de Winter is rich Lord de Winter is ruined for the moment Oliver Cromwell has annexed his income resources Now is the time when Baron Porthos would be useful Now it is that I regret D Artagnan Let us entice them away This secret Aramis does not belong to us take my advice then and let no one into our confidence And moreover in taking such a step we should appear to be doubtful of ourselves Let us regret their absence to ourselves for our own sakes but not speak of it You are right but what are you going to do until this evening I have two things to postpone And what are they First a thrust with the coadjutor whom I met last night at Madame de Rambouillet s and whom I found particular in his remarks respecting me Oh fie a quarrel between priests a duel between allies What can I do friend he is a bully and so am I his cassock is a burden to him and I imagine I have had enough of mine in fact there is so much resemblance between us that I sometimes believe he is Aramis and I am the coadjutor This kind of life fatigues and oppresses me besides he is a turbulent fellow who will ruin our party I am convinced that if I gave him a box on the ear such as I gave this morning to the little citizen who splashed me it would change the appearance of things And I my dear Aramis quietly replied Athos I think it would only change Monsieur de Retz s appearance Take my advice leave things just as they are besides you are neither of you now your own masters he belongs to the Fronde and you to the queen of England So if the second matter which you regret being unable to attend to is not more important than the first Oh that is of the first importance Attend to it then at once Unfortunately it is a thing that I can t perform at any time I choose It was arranged for the evening and no other time will serve I understand said Athos smiling midnight About that time But my dear fellow those are things that bear postponement and you must put it off especially with so good an excuse to give on your return Yes if I return If you do not return how does it concern you Be reasonable Come you are no longer twenty years old To my great regret mordieu Ah if I were but twenty years old Yes said Athos doubtless you would commit great follies But now we must part I have one or two visits to make and a letter yet to write Call for me at eight o clock or shall I wait supper for you at seven That will do very well said Aramis I have twenty visits to make and as many letters to write They then separated Athos went to pay a visit to Madame de Vendome left his name at Madame de Chevreuse s and wrote the following letter to D Artagnan Dear Friend I am about to set off with Aramis on important business I wished to make my adieux to you but time does not permit Remember that I write to you now to repeat how much affection for you I still cherish Raoul is gone to Blois and is ignorant of my departure watch over him in my absence as much as you possibly can and if by chance you receive no news of me three months hence tell him to open a packet which he will find addressed to him in my bronze casket at Blois of which I send you now the key Embrace Porthos from Aramis and myself Adieu perhaps farewell At the hour agreed upon Aramis arrived he was dressed as an officer and had the old sword at his side which he had drawn so often and which he was more than ever ready to draw By the bye he said I think that we are decidedly wrong to depart thus without leaving a line for Porthos and D Artagnan The thing is done dear friend said Athos I foresaw that and have embraced them both from you and myself You are a wonderful man my dear count said Aramis you think of everything Well have you made up your mind to this journey Quite and now that I reflect about it I am glad to leave Paris at this moment And so am I replied Athos my only regret is not having seen D Artagnan but the rascal is so cunning he might have guessed our project When supper was over Blaisois entered Sir said he here is Monsieur d Artagnan s answer But I did not tell you there would be an answer stupid said Athos And I set off without waiting for one but he called me back and gave me this and he presented a little leather bag plump and giving out a golden jingle Athos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note written in these terms My dear Count When one travels and especially for three months one never has a superfluity of money Now recalling former times of mutual distress I send you half my purse it is money to obtain which I made Mazarin sweat Don t make a bad use of it I entreat you As to what you say about not seeing you again I believe not a word of it with such a heart as yours and such a sword one passes through the valley of the shadow of death a dozen times unscathed and unalarmed Au revoir not farewell It is unnecessary to say that from the day I saw Raoul I loved him nevertheless believe that I heartily pray that I may not become to him a father however much I might be proud of such a son Your D Artagnan P S Be it well understood that the fifty louis which I send are equally for Aramis as for you for you as Aramis Athos smiled and his fine eye was dimmed by a tear D Artagnan who had loved him so tenderly loved him still although a Mazarinist There are the fifty louis i faith said Aramis emptying the purse on the table all bearing the effigy of Louis XIII Well what shall you do with this money count Shall you keep it or send it back I shall keep it Aramis and even though I had no need of it I still should keep it What is offered from a generous heart should be accepted generously Take twenty five of them Aramis and give me the remaining twenty five All right I am glad to see you are of my opinion There now shall we start When you like but have you no groom No that idiot Bazin had the folly to make himself verger as you know and therefore cannot leave Notre Dame Very well take Blaisois with whom I know not what to do since I already have Grimaud Willingly said Aramis At this moment Grimaud appeared at the door Ready said he with his usual curtness Let us go then said Athos The two friends mounted as did their servants At the corner of the Quai they encountered Bazin who was running breathlessly Oh sir exclaimed he thank Heaven I have arrived in time Monsieur Porthos has just been to your house and has left this for you saying that the letter was important and must be given to you before you left Good said Aramis taking a purse which Bazin presented to him What is this Wait your reverence there is a letter You know I have already told you that if you ever call me anything but chevalier I will break every bone in your body Give me the letter How can you read asked Athos it is as dark as a cold oven Wait said Bazin striking a flint and setting afire a twisted wax light with which he started the church candles Thus illumined Aramis read the following epistle My dear D Herblay I learned from D Artagnan who has embraced me on the part of the Comte de la Fere and yourself that you are setting out on a journey which may perhaps last two or three months as I know that you do not like to ask money of your friends I offer you some of my own accord Here are two hundred pistoles which you can dispose of as you wish and return to me when opportunity occurs Do not fear that you put me to inconvenience if I want money I can send for some to any of my chateaux at Bracieux alone I have twenty thousand francs in gold So if I do not send you more it is because I fear you would not accept a larger sum I address you because you know that although I esteem him from my heart I am a little awed by the Comte de la Fere but it is understood that what I offer you I offer him at the same time I am as I trust you do not doubt your devoted Du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds Well said Aramis what do you say to that I say my dear D Herblay that it is almost sacrilege to distrust Providence when one has such friends and therefore we will divide the pistoles from Porthos as we divided the louis sent by D Artagnan The division being made by the light of Bazin s taper the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined De Winter at the Porte Saint Denis forty three In which it is proved that first Impulses are oftentimes the best 
2238_121413_000007_000000	train-clean-360	The three gentlemen took the road to Picardy a road so well known to them and which recalled to Athos and Aramis some of the most picturesque adventures of their youth 
2238_121413_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 If Mousqueton were with us observed Athos on reaching the spot where they had had a dispute with the paviers how he would tremble at passing this 
none	none	Do you remember Aramis that it was here he received that famous bullet wound By my faith twould be excusable in him to tremble replied Aramis for even I feel a shudder at the recollection hold just above that tree is the little spot where I thought I was killed 
2238_121413_000010_000000	train-clean-360	It was soon time for Grimaud to recall the past 
none	none	Arriving before the inn at which his master and himself had made such an enormous repast he approached Athos and said showing him the airhole of the cellar Sausages Athos began to laugh for this juvenile escapade of his appeared to be as amusing as if some one had related it of another person At last after traveling two days and a night they arrived at Boulogne toward the evening favored by magnificent weather 
2238_121413_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Boulogne was a strong position then almost a deserted town built entirely on the heights what is now called the lower town did not then exist 
none	none	Gentlemen said De Winter on reaching the gate of the town let us do here as at Paris let us separate to avoid suspicion I know an inn little frequented but of which the host is entirely devoted to me I will go there where I expect to find letters and you go to the first tavern in the town to L Epee du Grand Henri for instance refresh yourselves and in two hours be upon the jetty our boat is waiting for us there The matter being thus decided the two friends found about two hundred paces further the tavern indicated Their horses were fed but not unsaddled the grooms supped for it was already late and their two masters impatient to return appointed a place of meeting with them on the jetty and desired them on no account to exchange a word with any one It is needless to say that this caution concerned Blaisois alone long enough since it had been a useless one to Grimaud 
2238_121413_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Athos and Aramis walked down toward the port 
none	none	From their dress covered with dust and from a certain easy manner by means of which a man accustomed to travel is always recognizable the two friends excited the attention of a few promenaders There was more especially one upon whom their arrival had produced a decided impression 
2238_121413_000016_000003	train-clean-360	This man whom they had noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves been remarked by others was walking in a listless way up and down the jetty From the moment he perceived them he did not cease to look at them and seemed to burn with the wish to speak to them 
2238_121413_000017_000000	train-clean-360	On reaching the jetty Athos and Aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to start 
1914_121449_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Aramis stopped 
none	none	to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to start That is doubtless our boat said Athos Yes replied Aramis and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destination now continued he if only De Winter does not keep us waiting It is not at all amusing here there is not a single woman passing
2238_121413_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Hush said Athos we are overheard 
2238_121413_000021_000000	train-clean-360	In truth the walker who during the observations of the two friends had passed and repassed behind them several times stopped at the name of De Winter but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of this name it might have been by chance he stood so still 
none	none	Gentlemen said the man who was young and pale bowing with ease and courtesy pardon my curiosity but I see you come from Paris or at least that you are strangers at Boulogne We come from Paris yes replied Athos with the same courtesy what is there we can do for you Sir said the young man will you be so good as to tell me if it be true that Cardinal Mazarin is no longer minister That is a strange question said Aramis
2238_121413_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 He is and he is not replied Athos that is to say he is dismissed by one half of France but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him you will perceive that this may last a long time 
none	none	However sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison No sir not at this moment at least Sirs accept my thanks for your politeness said the young man retreating What do you think of that interrogator asked Aramis I think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of information And you replied to him with that notion
2238_121413_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise he was polite to me and I was so to him 
2238_121413_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 But if he be a spy 
none	none	What do you think a spy would be about here We are not living in the time of Cardinal Richelieu who would have closed the ports on bare suspicion
2238_121413_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 It matters not you were wrong to reply to him as you did continued Aramis following with his eyes the young man now vanishing behind the cliffs 
none	none	And you said Athos you forget that you committed a very different kind of imprudence in pronouncing Lord de Winter s name Did you not see that at that name the young man stopped More reason then when he spoke to you for sending him about his business
2238_121413_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 A quarrel asked Athos 
none	none	And since when have you become afraid of a quarrel
2238_121413_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 I am always afraid of a quarrel when I am expected at any place and when such a quarrel might possibly prevent my reaching it 
none	none	Besides let me own something to you I am anxious to see that young man nearer And wherefore Aramis you will certainly laugh at me you will say that I am always repeating the same thing you will call me the most timorous of visionaries but to whom do you see a resemblance in that young man
2238_121413_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 In beauty or on the contrary asked Aramis laughing 
none	none	In ugliness in so far as a man can resemble a woman
2238_121413_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah Egad cried Aramis you set me thinking 
none	none	No in truth you are no visionary my dear friend and now I think of it you yes i faith you re right those delicate yet firm set lips those eyes which seem always at the command of the intellect and never of the heart Yes it is one of Milady s bastards You laugh Aramis From habit that is all I swear to you I like no better than yourself to meet that viper in my path
2238_121413_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah here is De Winter coming said Athos 
none	none	Good one thing now is only awanting and that is that our grooms should not keep us waiting No said Athos
2238_121413_000051_000001	train-clean-360	 I see them about twenty paces behind my lord 
none	none	I recognize Grimaud by his long legs and his determined slouch 
2238_121413_000051_000003	train-clean-360	Tony carries our muskets 
none	none	Then we set sail to night asked Aramis glancing toward the west where the sun had left a single golden cloud which dipping into the ocean appeared by degrees to be extinguished Probably said Athos Diable resumed Aramis I have little fancy for the sea by day still less at night the sounds of wind and wave the frightful movements of the vessel I confess I prefer the convent of Noisy 
2238_121413_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Athos smiled sadly for it was evident that he was thinking of other things as he listened to his friend and moved toward De Winter 
none	none	What ails our friend said Aramis he resembles one of Dante s damned whose neck Apollyon has dislocated and who are ever looking at their heels What the devil makes him glower thus behind him 
2238_121413_000057_000000	train-clean-360	When De Winter perceived them in his turn he advanced toward them with surprising rapidity 
none	none	What is the matter my lord said Athos and what puts you out of breath thus Nothing replied De Winter nothing and yet in passing the heights it seemed to me and he again turned round 
2238_121413_000060_000000	train-clean-360	Athos glanced at Aramis 
2238_121413_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 But let us go continued De Winter let us be off the boat must be waiting for us and there is our sloop at anchor do you see it there 
none	none	I wish I were on board already and he looked back again He has seen him said Athos in a low tone to Aramis 
2238_121413_000063_000000	train-clean-360	They had reached the ladder which led to the boat 
none	none	De Winter made the grooms who carried the arms and the porters with the luggage descend first and was about to follow them 
2238_121413_000064_000000	train-clean-360	At this moment Athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty and hastening his steps as if to reach the other side of the port scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking 
none	none	He fancied in the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned him Athos now descended the ladder in his turn without losing sight of the young man 
2238_121413_000064_000002	train-clean-360	The latter to make a short cut had appeared on a sluice 
2238_121413_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 He certainly bodes us no good said Athos but let us embark once out at sea let him come 
2238_121413_000066_000000	train-clean-360	And Athos sprang into the boat which was immediately pushed off and which soon sped seawards under the efforts of four stalwart rowers 
none	none	But the young man had begun to follow or rather to advance before the boat 
2238_121413_000067_000001	train-clean-360	She was obliged to pass between the point of the jetty surmounted by a beacon just lighted and a rock which jutted out 
none	none	They saw him in the distance climbing the rock in order to look down upon the boat as it passed Ay but said Aramis that young fellow is decidedly a spy Which is the young man asked De Winter turning around
2238_121413_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 He who followed us and spoke to us awaits us there behold 
none	none	De Winter turned and followed the direction of Aramis s finger 
2238_121413_000071_000001	train-clean-360	The beacon bathed with light the little strait through which they were about to pass and the rock where the young man stood with bare head and crossed arms 
none	none	It is he exclaimed De Winter seizing the arm of Athos it is he I thought I recognized him and I was not mistaken Whom do you mean asked Aramis Milady s son replied Athos
2238_121413_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 The monk exclaimed Grimaud 
none	none	The young man heard these words and bent so forward over the rock that one might have supposed he was about to precipitate himself from it Yes it is I my uncle I the son of Milady I the monk I the secretary and friend of Cromwell I know you now both you and your companions In that boat sat three men unquestionably brave whose courage no man would have dared dispute nevertheless at that voice that accent and those gestures they felt a chill access of terror cramp their veins As for Grimaud his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his brow Ah exclaimed Aramis that is the nephew the monk and the son of Milady as he says himself Alas yes murmured De Winter Then wait said Aramis and with the terrible coolness which on important occasions he showed he took one of the muskets from Tony shouldered and aimed it at the young man who stood like the accusing angel upon the rock
2238_121413_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 Fire cried Grimaud unconsciously 
none	none	Athos threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which was about to be fired The devil take you said Aramis I had him so well at the point of my gun I should have sent a ball into his breast It is enough to have killed the mother said Athos hoarsely The mother was a wretch who struck at us all and at those dear to us
2238_121413_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but the son has done us no harm 
none	none	Grimaud who had risen to watch the effect of the shot fell back hopeless wringing his hands 
2238_121413_000089_000000	train-clean-360	The young man burst into a laugh 
2238_121413_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah it is certainly you he cried 
none	none	I know you even better now His mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the breeze until lost in the depths of the horizon Aramis shuddered Be calm exclaimed Athos for Heaven s sake have we ceased to be men No said Aramis but that fellow is a fiend and ask the uncle whether I was wrong to rid him of his dear nephew De Winter only replied by a groan It was all up with him continued Aramis ah I much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal folly Athos took Lord de Winter s hand and tried to turn the conversation When shall we land in England he asked but De Winter seemed not to hear his words and made no reply
2238_121413_000098_000000	train-clean-360	 Hold Athos said Aramis perhaps there is yet time 
2238_121413_000098_000001	train-clean-360	See if he is still in the same place 
none	none	Athos turned around with an effort the sight of the young man was evidently painful to him and there he still was in fact on the rock the beacon shedding around him as it were a doubtful aureole Decidedly Aramis said Athos I think I was wrong not to let you fire
2238_121413_000101_000000	train-clean-360	 Hold your tongue replied Aramis you would make me weep if such a thing were possible 
none	none	At this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men servants and baggage were aboard The captain was only waiting for his passengers hardly had they put foot on deck ere her head was turned towards Hastings where they were to disembark 
2238_121413_000102_000002	train-clean-360	At this instant the three friends turned in spite of themselves a last look on the rock upon the menacing figure which pursued them and now stood out with a distinctness still 
none	none	Then a voice reached them once more sending this threat To our next meeting sirs in England forty four Te Deum for the Victory of Lens The bustle which had been observed by Henrietta Maria and for which she had vainly sought to discover a reason was occasioned by the battle of Lens announced by the prince s messenger the Duc de Chatillon who had taken such a noble part in the engagement he was besides charged to hang five and twenty flags taken from the Lorraine party as well as from the Spaniards upon the arches of Notre Dame Such news was decisive it destroyed in favor of the court the struggle commenced with parliament The motive given for all the taxes summarily imposed and to which the parliament had made opposition was the necessity of sustaining the honor of France and the uncertain hope of beating the enemy Now since the affair of Nordlingen they had experienced nothing but reverses the parliament had a plea for calling Mazarin to account for imaginary victories always promised ever deferred but this time there really had been fighting a triumph and a complete one And this all knew so well that it was a double victory for the court a victory at home and abroad so that even when the young king learned the news he exclaimed Ah gentlemen of the parliament we shall see what you will say now Upon which the queen had pressed the royal child to her heart whose haughty and unruly sentiments were in such harmony with her own A council was called on the same evening but nothing transpired of what had been decided on It was only known that on the following Sunday a Te Deum would be sung at Notre Dame in honor of the victory of Lens The following Sunday then the Parisians arose with joy at that period a Te Deum was a grand affair this kind of ceremony had not then been abused and it produced a great effect The shops were deserted houses closed every one wished to see the young king with his mother and the famous Cardinal Mazarin whom they hated so much that no one wished to be deprived of his presence Moreover great liberty prevailed throughout the immense crowd every opinion was openly expressed and chorused so to speak of coming insurrection as the thousand bells of all the Paris churches rang out the Te Deum The police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous lips Nevertheless at eight o clock in the morning the regiment of the queen s guards commanded by Guitant under whom was his nephew Comminges marched publicly preceded by drums and trumpets filing off from the Palais Royal as far as Notre Dame a manoeuvre which the Parisians witnessed tranquilly delighted as they were with military music and brilliant uniforms Friquet had put on his Sunday clothes under the pretext of having a swollen face which he had managed to simulate by introducing a handful of cherry kernels into one side of his mouth and had procured a whole holiday from Bazin On leaving Bazin Friquet started off to the Palais Royal where he arrived at the moment of the turning out of the regiment of guards and as he had only gone there for the enjoyment of seeing it and hearing the music he took his place at their head beating the drum on two pieces of slate and passing from that exercise to that of the trumpet which he counterfeited quite naturally with his mouth in a manner which had more than once called forth the praises of amateurs of imitative harmony This amusement lasted from the Barriere des Sergens to the place of Notre Dame and Friquet found in it very real enjoyment but when at last the regiment separated penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extremity of the Rue Saint Christophe near the Rue Cocatrix in which Broussel lived then Friquet remembered that he had not had breakfast and after thinking in which direction he had better turn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the day he reflected deeply and decided that Councillor Broussel should bear the cost of this repast In consequence he took to his heels arrived breathlessly at the councillor s door and knocked violently His mother the councillor s old servant opened it What doest thou here good for nothing she said and why art thou not at Notre Dame I have been there mother said Friquet but I saw things happen of which Master Broussel ought to be warned and so with Monsieur Bazin s permission you know mother Monsieur Bazin the verger I came to speak to Monsieur Broussel And what hast thou to say boy to Monsieur Broussel I wish to tell him replied Friquet screaming with all his might that there is a whole regiment of guards coming this way And as I hear everywhere that at the court they are ill disposed to him I wish to warn him that he may be on his guard Broussel heard the scream of the young oddity and enchanted with this excess of zeal came down to the first floor for he was in truth working in his room on the second Well said he friend what matters the regiment of guards to us and art thou not mad to make such a disturbance Knowest thou not that it is the custom of these soldiers to act thus and that it is usual for the regiment to form themselves into two solid walls when the king goes by Friquet counterfeited surprise and twisting his new cap around in his fingers said It is not astonishing for you to know it Monsieur Broussel who knows everything but as for me by holy truth I did not know it and I thought I would give you good advice you must not be angry with me for that Monsieur Broussel On the contrary my boy on the contrary I am pleased with your zeal Dame Nanette look for those apricots which Madame de Longueville sent to us yesterday from Noisy and give half a dozen of them to your son with a crust of new bread Oh thank you sir thank you Monsieur Broussel said Friquet I am so fond of apricots Broussel then proceeded to his wife s room and asked for breakfast it was nine o clock The councillor placed himself at the window the street was completely deserted but in the distance was heard like the noise of the tide rushing in the deep hum of the populous waves increasing now around Notre Dame This noise redoubled when D Artagnan with a company of musketeers placed himself at the gates of Notre Dame to secure the service of the church He had instructed Porthos to profit by this opportunity to see the ceremony and Porthos in full dress mounted his finest horse taking the part of supernumerary musketeer as D Artagnan had so often done formerly The sergeant of this company a veteran of the Spanish wars had recognized Porthos his old companion and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of Treville Porthos had not only been well received by the company but he was moreover looked on with great admiration At ten o clock the guns of the Louvre announced the departure of the king and then a movement similar to that of trees in a stormy wind that bend and writhe with agitated tops ran though the multitude which was compressed behind the immovable muskets of the guard At last the king appeared with the queen in a gilded chariot Ten other carriages followed containing the ladies of honor the officers of the royal household and the court God save the king was the cry in every direction the young monarch gravely put his head out of the window looked sufficiently grateful and even bowed at which the cries of the multitude were renewed Just as the court was settling down in the cathedral a carriage bearing the arms of Comminges quitted the line of the court carriages and proceeded slowly to the end of the Rue Saint Christophe now entirely deserted When it arrived there four guards and a police officer who accompanied it mounted into the heavy machine and closed the shutters then through an opening cautiously made the policeman began to watch the length of the Rue Cocatrix as if he was waiting for some one All the world was occupied with the ceremony so that neither the chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been observed Friquet whose eye ever on the alert could alone have discovered them had gone to devour his apricots upon the entablature of a house in the square of Notre Dame Thence he saw the king the queen and Monsieur Mazarin and heard the mass as well as if he had been on duty Toward the end of the service the queen seeing Comminges standing near her waiting for a confirmation of the order she had given him before quitting the Louvre said in a whisper Go Comminges and may God aid you Comminges immediately left the church and entered the Rue Saint Christophe Friquet seeing this fine officer thus walk away followed by two guards amused himself by pursuing them and did this so much the more gladly as the ceremony ended at that instant and the king remounted his carriage Hardly had the police officer observed Comminges at the end of the Rue Cocatrix when he said one word to the coachman who at once put his vehicle into motion and drove up before Broussel s door Comminges knocked at the door at the same moment and Friquet was waiting behind Comminges until the door should be opened What dost thou there rascal asked Comminges I want to go into Master Broussel s house captain replied Friquet in that wheedling way the gamins of Paris know so well how to assume when necessary And on what floor does he live asked Comminges In the whole house said Friquet the house belongs to him he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals he must be at dinner now it is noon Good said Comminges At this moment the door was opened and having questioned the servant the officer learned that Master Broussel was at home and at dinner Broussel was seated at the table with his family having his wife opposite to him his two daughters by his side and his son Louvieres whom we have already seen when the accident happened to the councillor an accident from which he had quite recovered at the bottom of the table The worthy man restored to perfect health was tasting the fine fruit which Madame de Longueville had sent to him At sight of the officer Broussel was somewhat moved but seeing him bow politely he rose and bowed also Still in spite of this reciprocal politeness the countenances of the women betrayed a certain amount of uneasiness Louvieres became very pale and waited impatiently for the officer to explain himself Sir said Comminges I am the bearer of an order from the king Very well sir replied Broussel what is this order And he held out his hand I am commissioned to seize your person sir said Comminges in the same tone and with the same politeness and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow me A thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced a more appalling effect It was a horrible thing at that period to be imprisoned by the enmity of the king Louvieres sprang forward to snatch his sword which stood against a chair in a corner of the room but a glance from the worthy Broussel who in the midst of it all did not lose his presence of mind checked this foolhardy action of despair Madame Broussel separated by the width of the table from her husband burst into tears and the young girls clung to their father s arms Come sir said Comminges make haste you must obey the king Sir said Broussel I am in bad health and cannot give myself up a prisoner in this state I must have time It is impossible said Comminges the order is strict and must be put into execution this instant Impossible said Louvieres sir beware of driving us to despair Impossible cried a shrill voice from the end of the room Comminges turned and saw Dame Nanette her eyes flashing with anger and a broom in her hand My good Nanette be quiet I beseech you said Broussel Me keep quiet while my master is being arrested he the support the liberator the father of the people Ah well yes you have to know me yet Are you going added she to Comminges The latter smiled Come sir said he addressing Broussel silence that woman and follow me Silence me me me said Nanette Ah yet one wants some one besides you for that my fine king s cockatoo You shall see And Dame Nanette sprang to the window threw it open and in such a piercing voice that it might have been heard in the square of Notre Dame Help she screamed my master is being arrested the Councillor Broussel is being arrested Help Sir said Comminges declare yourself at once will you obey or do you intend to rebel against the king I obey I obey sir cried Broussel trying to disengage himself from the grasp of his two daughters and by a look restrain his son who seemed determined to dispute authority In that case commanded Comminges silence that old woman Ah old woman screamed Nanette And she began to shriek more loudly clinging to the bars of the window Help help for Master Broussel who is arrested because he has defended the people Help Comminges seized the servant around the waist and would have dragged her from her post but at that instant a treble voice proceeding from a kind of entresol was heard screeching Murder fire assassins Master Broussel is being killed Master Broussel is being strangled It was Friquet s voice and Dame Nanette feeling herself supported recommenced with all her strength to sound her shrilly squawk Many curious faces had already appeared at the windows and the people attracted to the end of the street began to run first men then groups and then a crowd of people hearing cries and seeing a chariot they could not understand it but Friquet sprang from the entresol on to the top of the carriage They want to arrest Master Broussel he cried the guards are in the carriage and the officer is upstairs The crowd began to murmur and approached the house The two guards who had remained in the lane mounted to the aid of Comminges those who were in the chariot opened the doors and presented arms Don t you see them cried Friquet don t you see there they are The coachman turning around gave Friquet a slash with his whip which made him scream with pain Ah devil s coachman cried Friquet you re meddling too Wait And regaining his entresol he overwhelmed the coachman with every projectile he could lay hands on The tumult now began to increase the street was not able to contain the spectators who assembled from every direction the crowd invaded the space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear between them and the carriage The soldiers pushed back by these living walls were in danger of being crushed against the spokes of the wheels and the panels of the carriages The cries which the police officer repeated twenty times In the king s name were powerless against this formidable multitude seemed on the contrary to exasperate it still more when at the shout In the name of the king an officer ran up and seeing the uniforms ill treated he sprang into the scuffle sword in hand and brought unexpected help to the guards This gentleman was a young man scarcely sixteen years of age now white with anger He leaped from his charger placed his back against the shaft of the carriage making a rampart of his horse drew his pistols from their holsters and fastened them to his belt and began to fight with the back sword like a man accustomed to the handling of his weapon During ten minutes he alone kept the crowd at bay at last Comminges appeared pushing Broussel before him Let us break the carriage cried the people In the king s name cried Comminges The first who advances is a dead man cried Raoul for it was in fact he who feeling himself pressed and almost crushed by a gigantic citizen pricked him with the point of his sword and sent him howling back Comminges so to speak threw Broussel into the carriage and sprang in after him At this moment a shot was fired and a ball passed through the hat of Comminges and broke the arm of one of the guards Comminges looked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of Louvieres appearing at the window of the second floor Very well sir said Comminges you shall hear of this anon And you of me sir said Louvieres and we shall see then who can speak the loudest Friquet and Nanette continued to shout the cries the noise of the shot and the intoxicating smell of powder produced their usual maddening effects Down with the officer down with him was the cry One step nearer said Comminges putting down the sashes that the interior of the carriage might be well seen and placing his sword on his prisoner s breast one step nearer and I kill the prisoner my orders were to carry him off alive or dead I will take him dead that s all A terrible cry was heard and the wife and daughters of Broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people the latter knew that this officer who was so pale but who appeared so determined would keep his word they continued to threaten but they began to disperse Drive to the palace said Comminges to the coachman who was by then more dead than alive The man whipped his animals which cleared a way through the crowd but on arriving on the Quai they were obliged to stop the carriage was upset the horses carried off stifled mangled by the crowd Raoul on foot for he had not time to mount his horse again tired like the guards of distributing blows with the flat of his sword had recourse to its point But this last and dreaded resource served only to exasperate the multitude From time to time a shot from a musket or the blade of a rapier flashed among the crowd projectiles continued to hail down from the windows and some shots were heard the echo of which though they were probably fired in the air made all hearts vibrate Voices unheard except on days of revolution were distinguished faces were seen that only appeared on days of bloodshed Cries of Death death to the guards to the Seine with the officer were heard above all the noise deafening as it was Raoul his hat in ribbons his face bleeding felt not only his strength but also his reason going a red mist covered his sight and through this mist he saw a hundred threatening arms stretched over him ready to seize upon him when he fell The guards were unable to help any one each one was occupied with his self preservation All was over carriages horses guards and perhaps even the prisoner were about to be torn to shreds when all at once a voice well known to Raoul was heard and suddenly a great sword glittered in the air at the same time the crowd opened upset trodden down and an officer of the musketeers striking and cutting right and left rushed up to Raoul and took him in his arms just as he was about to fall God s blood cried the officer have they killed him Woe to them if it be so And he turned around so stern with anger strength and threat that the most excited rebels hustled back on one another in order to escape and some of them even rolled into the Seine Monsieur d Artagnan murmured Raoul Yes sdeath in person and fortunately it seems for you my young friend Come on here you others he continued rising in his stirrups raising his sword and addressing those musketeers who had not been able to follow his rapid onslaught Come sweep away all that for me Shoulder muskets Present arms Aim At this command the mountain of populace thinned so suddenly that D Artagnan could not repress a burst of Homeric laughter Thank you D Artagnan said Comminges showing half of his body through the window of the broken vehicle thanks my young friend your name that I may mention it to the queen Raoul was about to reply when D Artagnan bent down to his ear Hold your tongue said he and let me answer Do not lose time Comminges he continued get out of the carriage if you can and make another draw up be quick or in five minutes the mob will be on us again with swords and muskets and you will be killed Hold there s a carriage coming over yonder Then bending again to Raoul he whispered Above all things do not divulge your name That s right I will go said Comminges and if they come back fire Not at all not at all replied D Artagnan let no one move On the contrary one shot at this moment would be paid for dearly to morrow Comminges took his four guards and as many musketeers and ran to the carriage from which he made the people inside dismount and brought them to the vehicle which had upset But when it was necessary to convey the prisoner from one carriage to the other the people catching sight of him whom they called their liberator uttered every imaginable cry and knotted themselves once more around the vehicle Start start said D Artagnan There are ten men to accompany you I will keep twenty to hold in check the mob go and lose not a moment Ten men for Monsieur de Comminges As the carriage started off the cries were redoubled and more than ten thousand people thronged the Quai and overflowed the Pont Neuf and adjacent streets A few shots were fired and one musketeer was wounded Forward cried D Artagnan driven to extremities biting his moustache and then he charged with his twenty men and dispersed them in fear One man alone remained in his place gun in hand Ah he exclaimed it is thou who wouldst have him assassinated Wait an instant And he pointed his gun at D Artagnan who was riding toward him at full speed D Artagnan bent down to his horse s neck the young man fired and the ball severed the feathers from the hat The horse started brushed against the imprudent man who thought by his strength alone to stay the tempest and he fell against the wall D Artagnan pulled up his horse and whilst his musketeers continued to charge he returned and bent with drawn sword over the man he had knocked down Oh sir exclaimed Raoul recognizing the young man as having seen him in the Rue Cocatrix spare him it is his son D Artagnan s arm dropped to his side Ah you are his son he said that is a different thing Sir I surrender said Louvieres presenting his unloaded musket to the officer Eh no do not surrender egad On the contrary be off and quickly If I take you you will be hung The young man did not wait to be told twice but passing under the horse s head disappeared at the corner of the Rue Guenegaud I faith said D Artagnan to Raoul you were just in time to stay my hand He was a dead man and on my honor if I had discovered that it was his son I should have regretted having killed him Ah sir said Raoul allow me after thanking you for that poor fellow s life to thank you on my own account I too sir was almost dead when you arrived Wait wait young man do not fatigue yourself with speaking We can talk of it afterward Then seeing that the musketeers had cleared the Quai from the Pont Neuf to the Quai Saint Michael he raised his sword for them to double their speed The musketeers trotted up and at the same time the ten men whom D Artagnan had given to Comminges appeared Halloo cried D Artagnan has something fresh happened Eh sir replied the sergeant their vehicle has broken down a second time it really must be doomed They are bad managers said D Artagnan shrugging his shoulders When a carriage is chosen it ought to be strong The carriage in which a Broussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten thousand men What are your commands lieutenant Take the detachment and conduct him to his place But you will be left alone Certainly So you suppose I have need of an escort Go The musketeers set off and D Artagnan was left alone with Raoul Now he said are you in pain Yes my head is not only swimming but burning What s the matter with this head said D Artagnan raising the battered hat Ah ah a bruise Yes I think I received a flower pot upon my head Brutes said D Artagnan But were you not on horseback you have spurs Yes but I got down to defend Monsieur de Comminges and my horse was taken away Here it is I see At this very moment Friquet passed mounted on Raoul s horse waving his parti colored cap and crying Broussel Broussel Halloo stop rascal cried D Artagnan Bring hither that horse Friquet heard perfectly but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road D Artagnan felt inclined for an instant to pursue Master Friquet but not wishing to leave Raoul alone he contented himself with taking a pistol from the holster and cocking it Friquet had a quick eye and a fine ear He saw D Artagnan s movement heard the sound of the click and stopped at once Ah it is you your honor he said advancing toward D Artagnan and I am truly pleased to meet you D Artagnan looked attentively at Friquet and recognized the little chorister of the Rue de la Calandre Ah tis thou rascal said he come here so thou hast changed thy trade thou art no longer a choir boy nor a tavern boy thou hast become a horse stealer Ah your honor how can you say so exclaimed Friquet I was seeking the gentleman to whom this horse belongs an officer brave and handsome as a youthful Caesar then pretending to see Raoul for the first time Ah but if I mistake not continued he here he is you won t forget the boy sir Raoul put his hand in his pocket What are you about asked D Artagnan To give ten francs to this honest fellow replied Raoul taking a pistole from his pocket Ten kicks on his back said D Artagnan be off you little villain and forget not that I have your address Friquet who did not expect to be let off so cheaply bounded off like a gazelle up the Quai a la Rue Dauphine and disappeared Raoul mounted his horse and both leisurely took their way to the Rue Tiquetonne D Artagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own son They arrived without accident at the Hotel de la Chevrette The handsome Madeleine announced to D Artagnan that Planchet had returned bringing Mousqueton with him who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would permit D Artagnan desired Planchet to be summoned but he had disappeared Then bring some wine said D Artagnan You are much pleased with yourself said he to Raoul when they were alone are you not Well yes replied Raoul It seems to me I did my duty I defended the king And who told you to defend the king The Comte de la Fere himself Yes the king but to day you have not fought for the king you have fought for Mazarin which is not quite the same thing But you yourself Oh for me that is another matter I obey my captain s orders As for you your captain is the prince understand that rightly you have no other But has one ever seen such a wild fellow continued he making himself a Mazarinist and helping to arrest Broussel Breathe not a word of that or the Comte de la Fere will be furious You think the count will be angry with me Think it I m certain of it were it not for that I should thank you for you have worked for us However I scold you instead of him and in his place the storm will blow over more easily believe me And moreover my dear child continued D Artagnan I am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your guardian I do not understand you sir said Raoul D Artagnan rose and taking a letter from his writing desk presented it to Raoul The face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the paper Oh mon Dieu he said raising his fine eyes to D Artagnan moist with tears the count has left Paris without seeing me He left four days ago said D Artagnan But this letter seems to intimate that he is about to incur danger perhaps death He he incur danger of death No be not anxious he is traveling on business and will return ere long I hope you have no repugnance to accept me as your guardian in the interim Oh no Monsieur d Artagnan said Raoul you are such a brave gentleman and the Comte de la Fere has so much affection for you Eh Egad love me too I will not torment you much but only on condition that you become a Frondist my young friend and a hearty Frondist too But can I continue to visit Madame de Chevreuse I should say you could and the coadjutor and Madame de Longueville and if the worthy Broussel were there whom you so stupidly helped arrest I should tell you to excuse yourself to him at once and kiss him on both cheeks Well sir I will obey you although I do not understand you It is unnecessary for you to understand Hold continued D Artagnan turning toward the door which had just opened here is Monsieur du Vallon who comes with his coat torn Yes but in exchange said Porthos covered with perspiration and soiled by dust in exchange I have torn many skins Those wretches wanted to take away my sword Deuce take em what a popular commotion continued the giant in his quiet manner but I knocked down more than twenty with the hilt of Balizarde A draught of wine D Artagnan Oh I ll answer for you said the Gascon filling Porthos s glass to the brim but when you have drunk give me your opinion Upon what asked Porthos Look here resumed D Artagnan here is Monsieur de Bragelonne who determined at all risks to aid the arrest of Broussel and whom I had great difficulty to prevent defending Monsieur de Comminges The devil said Porthos and his guardian what would he have said to that Do you hear interrupted D Artagnan become a Frondist my friend belong to the Fronde and remember that I fill the count s place in everything and he jingled his money Will you come said he to Porthos Where asked Porthos filling a second glass of wine To present our respects to the cardinal Porthos swallowed the second glass with the same grace with which he had imbibed the first took his beaver and followed D Artagnan As for Raoul he remained bewildered with what he had seen having been forbidden by D Artagnan to leave the room until the tumult was over forty five The Beggar of saint Eustache D Artagnan had calculated that in not going at once to the Palais Royal he would give Comminges time to arrive before him and consequently to make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he D Artagnan and his friend had rendered to the queen s party in the morning They were indeed admirably received by Mazarin who paid them numerous compliments and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired namely D Artagnan his captaincy Porthos his barony 
2238_121415_000006_000000	train-clean-360	D Artagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk for he knew well that to Mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform But though he held the cardinal s promises as of little worth he affected to be completely satisfied for he was unwilling to discourage Porthos 
2238_121415_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Whilst the two friends were with the cardinal the queen sent for him Mazarin thinking that it would be the means of increasing the zeal of his two defenders if he procured them personal thanks from the queen motioned them to follow him 
2238_121415_000007_000001	train-clean-360	D Artagnan and Porthos pointed to their dusty and torn dresses but the cardinal shook his head 
2238_121415_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Those costumes he said are of more worth than most of those which you will see on the backs of the queen s courtiers they are costumes of battle 
2238_121415_000009_000000	train-clean-360	D Artagnan and Porthos obeyed 
2238_121415_000009_000001	train-clean-360	The court of Anne of Austria was full of gayety and animation for after having gained a victory over the Spaniard it had just gained another over the people 
none	none	Broussel had been conducted out of Paris without further resistance and was at this time in the prison of Saint Germain while Blancmesnil who was arrested at the same time but whose arrest had been made without difficulty or noise was safe in the Castle of Vincennes Comminges was near the queen who was questioning him upon the details of his expedition and every one was listening to his account when D Artagnan and Porthos were perceived at the door behind the cardinal Ah madame said Comminges hastening to D Artagnan here is one who can tell you better than myself for he was my protector 
2238_121415_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Without him I should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at Saint Cloud for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the river 
2238_121415_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Speak D Artagnan speak 
none	none	D Artagnan had been a hundred times in the same room with the queen since he had become lieutenant of the musketeers but her majesty had never once spoken to him Well sir at last said Anne of Austria you are silent after rendering such a service
2238_121415_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Madame replied D Artagnan I have nought to say save that my life is ever at your majesty s service and that I shall only be happy the day I lose it for you 
2238_121415_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 I know that sir I have known that said the queen a long time therefore I am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude and my esteem 
2238_121415_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Permit me madame said D Artagnan to reserve a portion for my friend like myself he laid an emphasis on these words an ancient musketeer of the company of Treville he has done wonders 
none	none	His name asked the queen In the regiment said D Artagnan he is called Porthos the queen started but his true name is the Chevalier du Vallon De Bracieux de Pierrefonds added Porthos
2238_121415_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 These names are too numerous for me to remember them all and I will content myself with the first said the queen graciously 
none	none	Porthos bowed 
2238_121415_000020_000002	train-clean-360	At this moment the coadjutor was announced a cry of surprise ran through the royal assemblage 
2238_121415_000020_000003	train-clean-360	Although the coadjutor had preached that same morning it was well known that he leaned much to the side of the Fronde and Mazarin in requesting the archbishop of Paris to make his nephew preach had evidently had the intention of administering to Monsieur de Retz one of those Italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving 
none	none	The fact was in leaving Notre Dame the coadjutor had learned the event of the day 
2238_121415_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Although almost engaged to the leaders of the Fronde he had not gone so far but that retreat was possible should the court offer him the advantages for which he was ambitious and to which the coadjutorship was but a stepping stone 
2238_121415_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Monsieur de Retz wished to become archbishop in his uncle s place and cardinal like Mazarin and the popular party could with difficulty accord him favors so entirely royal 
2238_121415_000021_000003	train-clean-360	He therefore hastened to the palace to congratulate the queen on the battle of Lens determined beforehand to act with or against the court as his congratulations were well or ill received 
2238_121415_000022_000000	train-clean-360	The coadjutor possessed perhaps as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at him 
2238_121415_000022_000001	train-clean-360	His speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule 
2238_121415_000022_000002	train-clean-360	He concluded by saying that he placed his feeble influence at her majesty s command 
none	none	During the whole time he was speaking the queen appeared to be well pleased with the coadjutor s harangue but terminating as it did with such a phrase the only one which could be caught at by the jokers Anne turned around and directed a glance toward her favorites which announced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their tender mercies Immediately the wits of the court plunged into satire Nogent Beautin the fool of the court exclaimed that the queen was very happy to have the succor of religion at such a moment This caused a universal burst of laughter 
2238_121415_000023_000002	train-clean-360	The Count de Villeroy said that he did not know how any fear could be entertained for a moment when the court had to defend itself against the parliament and the citizens of Paris his holiness the coadjutor who by a signal could raise an army of curates church porters and vergers 
2238_121415_000024_000000	train-clean-360	The Marechal de la Meilleraie added that in case the coadjutor should appear on the field of battle it would be a pity that he should not be distinguished in the melee by wearing a red hat as Henry IV had been distinguished by his white plume at the battle of Ivry 
2238_121415_000025_000000	train-clean-360	During this storm Gondy who had it in his power to make it most unpleasant for the jesters remained calm and stern 
2238_121415_000025_000001	train-clean-360	The queen at last asked him if he had anything to add to the fine discourse he had just made to her 
2238_121415_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes madame replied the coadjutor I have to beg you to reflect twice ere you cause a civil war in the kingdom 
none	none	The queen turned her back and the laughing recommenced 
2238_121415_000028_000000	train-clean-360	The coadjutor bowed and left the palace casting upon the cardinal such a glance as is best understood by mortal foes 
2238_121415_000028_000001	train-clean-360	That glance was so sharp that it penetrated the heart of Mazarin who reading in it a declaration of war seized D Artagnan by the arm and said 
2238_121415_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 If occasion requires monsieur you will remember that man who has just gone out will you not 
2238_121415_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes my lord he replied 
2238_121415_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Then turning toward Porthos The devil said he this has a bad look 
2238_121415_000030_000002	train-clean-360	I dislike these quarrels among men of the church 
none	none	Gondy withdrew distributing benedictions on his way and finding a malicious satisfaction in causing the adherents of his foes to prostrate themselves at his feet
2238_121415_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh he murmured as he left the threshold of the palace ungrateful court faithless court cowardly court 
none	none	I will teach you how to laugh to morrow but in another manner 
2238_121415_000033_000000	train-clean-360	But whilst they were indulging in extravagant joy at the Palais Royal to increase the hilarity of the queen Mazarin a man of sense and whose fear moreover gave him foresight lost no time in making idle and dangerous jokes he went out after the coadjutor settled his account locked up his gold and had confidential workmen to contrive hiding places in his walls 
none	none	On his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come in after his departure and was waiting for him he started with delight when on demanding the name of this young man he learned that it was Louvieres 
2238_121415_000034_000001	train-clean-360	He hastened to his cabinet 
2238_121415_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Broussel s son was there still furious and still bearing bloody marks of his struggle with the king s officers 
2238_121415_000034_000003	train-clean-360	The only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a friend 
2238_121415_000035_000000	train-clean-360	The coadjutor went to him and held out his hand 
2238_121415_000035_000001	train-clean-360	The young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his heart 
2238_121415_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear Monsieur Louvieres said the coadjutor believe me I am truly concerned for the misfortune which has happened to you 
2238_121415_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Is that true and do you speak seriously asked Louvieres 
2238_121415_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 From the depth of my heart said Gondy 
2238_121415_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 In that case my lord the time for words has passed and the hour for action is at hand my lord in three days if you wish it my father will be out of prison and in six months you may be cardinal 
2238_121415_000040_000000	train-clean-360	The coadjutor started 
2238_121415_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh let us speak frankly continued Louvieres and act in a straightforward manner 
2238_121415_000041_000001	train-clean-360	Thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given as you have done for the last six months out of pure Christian charity that would be too grand 
none	none	You are ambitious it is natural you are a man of genius and you know your worth 
2238_121415_000041_000003	train-clean-360	As for me I hate the court and have but one desire at this moment vengeance 
none	none	Give us the clergy and the people of whom you can dispose and I will bring you the citizens and the parliament with these four elements Paris is ours in a week and believe me monsieur coadjutor the court will give from fear what it will not give from good will It was now the coadjutor s turn to fix his piercing eyes on Louvieres But Monsieur Louvieres are you aware that it is simply civil war you are proposing to me
2238_121415_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 You have been preparing long enough my lord for it to be welcome to you now 
2238_121415_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Never mind said the coadjutor you must be well aware that this requires reflection 
2238_121415_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 And how many hours of reflection do you ask 
none	none	Twelve hours sir is it too long It is now noon at midnight I will be at your house
2238_121415_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 If I should not be in wait for me 
2238_121415_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Good at midnight my lord 
none	none	At midnight my dear Monsieur Louvieres When once more alone Gondy sent to summon all the curates with whom he had any connection to his house 
2238_121415_000052_000001	train-clean-360	Two hours later thirty officiating ministers from the most populous and consequently the most disturbed parishes of Paris had assembled there 
none	none	Gondy related to them the insults he had received at the Palais Royal and retailed the jests of Beautin the Count de Villeroy and Marechal de la Meilleraie 
2238_121415_000052_000003	train-clean-360	The curates asked him what was to be done 
none	none	Simply this said the coadjutor
2238_121415_000053_000001	train-clean-360	 You are the directors of all consciences 
2238_121415_000053_000002	train-clean-360	Well undermine in them the miserable prejudice of respect and fear of kings teach your flocks that the queen is a tyrant and repeat often and loudly so that all may know it that the misfortunes of France are caused by Mazarin her lover and her destroyer begin this work to day this instant even and in three days I shall expect the result 
2238_121415_000053_000003	train-clean-360	For the rest if any one of you have further or better counsel to expound I will listen to him with the greatest pleasure 
none	none	Three curates remained those of saint Merri saint Sulpice and saint Eustache The others withdrew
2238_121415_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 You think then that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers said Gondy 
2238_121415_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 We hope so answered the curates 
2238_121415_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Let us hear 
none	none	Monsieur de saint Merri you begin
2238_121415_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 My lord I have in my parish a man who might be of the greatest use to you 
2238_121415_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Who and what is this man 
none	none	A shopkeeper in the Rue des Lombards who has great influence upon the commerce of his quarter What is his name He is named Planchet who himself also caused a rising about six weeks ago but as he was searched for after this emeute he disappeared
2238_121415_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 And can you find him 
none	none	I hope so I think he has not been arrested and as I am his wife s confessor if she knows where he is I shall know it too
2238_121415_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Very well sir find this man and when you have found him bring him to me 
2238_121415_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 We will be with you at six o clock my lord 
2238_121415_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Go my dear curate and may God assist you 
none	none	And you sir continued Gondy turning to the curate of saint Sulpice I my lord said the latter I know a man who has rendered great services to a very popular prince and who would make an excellent leader of revolt 
2238_121415_000069_000001	train-clean-360	Him I can place at your disposal it is Count de Rochefort 
none	none	I know him also but unfortunately he is not in Paris
2238_121415_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 My lord he has been for three days at the Rue Cassette 
2238_121415_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 And wherefore has he not been to see me 
2238_121415_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 He was told my lord will pardon me 
2238_121415_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 Certainly speak 
2238_121415_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 That your lordship was about to treat with the court 
2238_121415_000076_000000	train-clean-360	Gondy bit his lips 
none	none	They are mistaken bring him here at eight o clock sir and may Heaven bless you as I bless you And now tis your turn said the coadjutor turning to the last that remained have you anything as good to offer me as the two gentlemen who have left us
2238_121415_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 Better my lord 
none	none	Diable think what a solemn engagement you are making one has offered a wealthy shopkeeper the other a count you are going then to offer a prince are you I offer you a beggar my lord Ah ah said Gondy reflecting you are right sir some one who could raise the legion of paupers who choke up the crossings of Paris some one who would know how to cry aloud to them that all France might hear it that it is Mazarin who has reduced them to poverty
2238_121415_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 Exactly your man 
none	none	Bravo and the man A plain and simple beggar as I have said my lord who asks for alms as he gives holy water a practice he has carried on for six years on the steps of saint Eustache And you say that he has a great influence over his compeers Are you aware my lord that mendacity is an organized body a kind of association of those who have nothing against those who have everything an association in which every one takes his share one that elects a leader
2238_121415_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I have heard it said replied the coadjutor 
2238_121415_000089_000000	train-clean-360	 Well the man whom I offer you is a general syndic 
2238_121415_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 And what do you know of him 
2238_121415_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing my lord except that he is tormented with remorse 
2238_121415_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 What makes you think so 
none	none	On the twenty eighth of every month he makes me say a mass for the repose of the soul of one who died a violent death yesterday I said this mass again And his name Maillard but I do not think it is his right one
2238_121415_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 And think you that we should find him at this hour at his post 
none	none	Certainly
2238_121415_000098_000000	train-clean-360	 Let us go and see your beggar sir and if he is such as you describe him you are right it will be you who have discovered the true treasure 
2238_121415_000099_000000	train-clean-360	Gondy dressed himself as an officer put on a felt cap with a red feather hung on a long sword buckled spurs to his boots wrapped himself in an ample cloak and followed the curate 
none	none	The coadjutor and his companion passed through all the streets lying between the archbishopric and the saint Eustache Church watching carefully to ascertain the popular feeling 
2238_121415_000100_000001	train-clean-360	The people were in an excited mood but like a swarm of frightened bees seemed not to know at what point to concentrate and it was very evident that if leaders of the people were not provided all this agitation would pass off in idle buzzing 
2238_121415_000101_000000	train-clean-360	On arriving at the Rue des Prouvaires the curate pointed toward the square before the church 
2238_121415_000102_000000	train-clean-360	 Stop he said there he is at his post 
none	none	Gondy looked at the spot indicated and perceived a beggar seated in a chair and leaning against one of the moldings a little basin was near him and he held a holy water brush in his hand Is it by permission that he remains there asked Gondy No my lord these places are bought 
2238_121415_000105_000001	train-clean-360	I believe this man paid his predecessor a hundred pistoles for his 
2238_121415_000106_000000	train-clean-360	 The rascal is rich then 
2238_121415_000107_000000	train-clean-360	 Some of those men sometimes die worth twenty thousand and twenty five and thirty thousand francs and sometimes more 
none	none	Hum said Gondy laughing I was not aware my alms were so well invested 
2238_121415_000109_000000	train-clean-360	In the meantime they were advancing toward the square and the moment the coadjutor and the curate put their feet on the first church step the mendicant arose and proffered his brush 
2238_121415_000110_000000	train-clean-360	He was a man between sixty six and sixty eight years of age little rather stout with gray hair and light eyes 
2238_121415_000110_000001	train-clean-360	His countenance denoted the struggle between two opposite principles a wicked nature subdued by determination perhaps by repentance 
none	none	He started on seeing the cavalier with the curate The latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat which was on the ground Maillard began the curate this gentleman and I have come to talk with you a little
2238_121415_000113_000000	train-clean-360	 With me said the mendicant it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy water 
2238_121415_000114_000000	train-clean-360	There was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and which astonished the coadjutor 
2238_121415_000115_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes continued the curate apparently accustomed to this tone yes we wish to know your opinion of the events of to day and what you have heard said by people going in and out of the church 
2238_121415_000116_000000	train-clean-360	The mendicant shook his head 
none	none	These are melancholy doings your reverence which always fall again upon the poor 
2238_121415_000117_000001	train-clean-360	As to what is said everybody is discontented everybody complains but everybody means nobody 
none	none	Explain yourself my good friend said the coadjutor
2238_121415_000119_000000	train-clean-360	 I mean that all these cries all these complaints these curses produce nothing but storms and flashes and that is all but the lightning will not strike until there is a hand to guide it 
2238_121415_000120_000000	train-clean-360	 My friend said Gondy you seem to be a clever and a thoughtful man are you disposed to take a part in a little civil war should we have one and put at the command of the leader should we find one your personal influence and the influence you have acquired over your comrades 
2238_121415_000121_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes sir provided this war were approved of by the church and would advance the end I wish to attain I mean the remission of my sins 
2238_121415_000122_000000	train-clean-360	 The war will not only be approved of but directed by the church 
2238_121415_000122_000001	train-clean-360	As for the remission of your sins we have the archbishop of Paris who has the very greatest power at the court of Rome and even the coadjutor who possesses some plenary indulgences we will recommend you to him 
none	none	Consider Maillard said the curate that I have recommended you to this gentleman who is a powerful lord and that I have made myself responsible for you I know monsieur le cure said the beggar that you have always been very kind to me and therefore I in my turn will be serviceable to you And do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le cure told me it was just now
2238_121415_000126_000000	train-clean-360	 I think they have some esteem for me said the mendicant with pride and that not only will they obey me but wherever I go they will follow me 
2238_121415_000127_000000	train-clean-360	 And could you count on fifty resolute men good unemployed but active souls brawlers capable of bringing down the walls of the Palais Royal by crying Down with Mazarin as fell those at Jericho 
2238_121415_000128_000000	train-clean-360	 I think said the beggar I can undertake things more difficult and more important than that 
none	none	Ah ah said Gondy you will undertake then some night to throw up some ten barricades
2238_121415_000130_000000	train-clean-360	 I will undertake to throw up fifty and when the day comes to defend them 
none	none	I faith exclaimed Gondy you speak with a certainty that gives me pleasure and since monsieur le cure can answer for you
2238_121415_000132_000000	train-clean-360	 I answer for him said the curate 
none	none	Here is a bag containing five hundred pistoles in gold make all your arrangements and tell me where I shall be able to find you this evening at ten o clock
2238_121415_000134_000000	train-clean-360	 It must be on some elevated place whence a given signal may be seen in every part of Paris 
none	none	Shall I give you a line for the vicar of saint Jacques de la Boucherie he will let you into the rooms in his tower said the curate
2238_121415_000136_000000	train-clean-360	 Capital answered the mendicant 
2238_121415_000137_000000	train-clean-360	 Then said the coadjutor this evening at ten o clock and if I am pleased with you another bag of five hundred pistoles will be at your disposal 
2238_121415_000138_000000	train-clean-360	The eyes of the mendicant dashed with cupidity but he quickly suppressed his emotion 
none	none	This evening sir he replied all will be ready forty six The Tower of saint Jacques de la Boucherie 
2010_121416_000003_000000	train-clean-360	At a quarter to six o clock Monsieur de Gondy having finished his business returned to the archiepiscopal palace 
none	none	At six o clock the curate of saint Merri was announced 
2010_121416_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was followed by another man 
none	none	The curate then entered followed by Planchet
2010_121416_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Your holiness said the curate here is the person of whom I had the honor to speak to you 
2010_121416_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Planchet saluted in the manner of one accustomed to fine houses 
2010_121416_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 And you are disposed to serve the cause of the people asked Gondy 
none	none	Most undoubtedly said Planchet
2010_121416_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 I am a Frondist from my heart 
2010_121416_000009_000002	train-clean-360	You see in me such as I am a person sentenced to be hung 
2010_121416_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 And on what account 
none	none	I rescued from the hands of Mazarin s police a noble lord whom they were conducting back to the Bastile where he had been for five years Will you name him Oh you know him well my lord it is Count de Rochefort
2010_121416_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah really yes said the coadjutor I have heard this affair mentioned 
2010_121416_000014_000001	train-clean-360	You raised the whole district so they told me 
none	none	Very nearly replied Planchet with a self satisfied air And your business is
2010_121416_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 That of a confectioner in the Rue des Lombards 
2010_121416_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Explain to me how it happens that following so peaceful a business you had such warlike inclinations 
2010_121416_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Why does my lord belonging to the church now receive me in the dress of an officer with a sword at his side and spurs to his boots 
2010_121416_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Not badly answered i faith said Gondy laughing but I have you must know always had in spite of my bands warlike inclinations 
2010_121416_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Well my lord before I became a confectioner I myself was three years sergeant in the Piedmontese regiment and before I became sergeant I was for eighteen months the servant of Monsieur d Artagnan 
2010_121416_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 The lieutenant of musketeers asked Gondy 
2010_121416_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Himself my lord 
none	none	But he is said to be a furious Mazarinist Phew whistled Planchet
2010_121416_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you mean by that 
2010_121416_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing my lord Monsieur d Artagnan belongs to the service Monsieur d Artagnan makes it his business to defend the cardinal who pays him as much as we make it ours we citizens to attack him whom he robs 
2010_121416_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 You are an intelligent fellow my friend can we count upon you 
2010_121416_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 You may count upon me my lord provided you want to make a complete upheaval of the city 
2010_121416_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Tis that exactly 
2010_121416_000030_000001	train-clean-360	How many men think you you could collect together to night 
2010_121416_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Two hundred muskets and five hundred halberds 
2010_121416_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Let there be only one man in every district who can do as much and by to morrow we shall have quite a powerful army 
2010_121416_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Are you disposed to obey Count de Rochefort 
2010_121416_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I would follow him to hell and that is saying not a little as I believe him entirely capable of the descent 
none	none	Bravo
2010_121416_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 By what sign to morrow shall we be able to distinguish friends from foes 
2010_121416_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Every Frondist must put a knot of straw in his hat 
none	none	Good 
2010_121416_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Give the watchword 
2010_121416_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you want money 
2010_121416_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Money never comes amiss at any time my lord if one has it not one must do without it with it matters go on much better and more rapidly 
2010_121416_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Gondy went to a box and drew forth a bag 
2010_121416_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Here are five hundred pistoles he said and if the action goes off well you may reckon upon a similar sum to morrow 
2010_121416_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 I will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship said Planchet putting the bag under his arm 
2010_121416_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 That is right I recommend the cardinal to your attention 
2010_121416_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Make your mind easy he is in good hands 
2010_121416_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Planchet went out the curate remaining for a moment 
2010_121416_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Are you satisfied my lord he asked 
2010_121416_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes he appears to be a resolute fellow 
none	none	Well he will do more than he has promised
2010_121416_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 He will do wonders then 
2010_121416_000050_000000	train-clean-360	The curate rejoined Planchet who was waiting for him on the stairs 
none	none	Ten minutes later the curate of saint Sulpice was announced 
2010_121416_000050_000002	train-clean-360	As soon as the door of Gondy s study was opened a man rushed in 
2010_121416_000050_000003	train-clean-360	It was the Count de Rochefort 
2010_121416_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Tis you then my dear count cried Gondy offering his hand 
none	none	You have made up your mind at last my lord said Rochefort
2010_121416_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 It has been made up a long time said Gondy 
none	none	Let us say no more on the subject you tell me so I believe you 
2010_121416_000054_000001	train-clean-360	Well we are going to give a ball to Mazarin 
none	none	I hope so
2010_121416_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 And when will the dance begin 
2010_121416_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 The invitations are given for this evening said the coadjutor but the violins will not begin to play until to morrow morning 
none	none	You may reckon upon me and
2010_121416_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 upon fifty soldiers 
none	none	which the Chevalier d Humieres has promised me whenever I need them Upon fifty soldiers Yes he is making recruits and he will lend them to me if any are missing when the fete is over I shall replace them
2010_121416_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Good my dear Rochefort but that is not all 
none	none	What have you done with Monsieur de Beaufort
2010_121416_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 He is in Vendome where he will wait until I write to him to return to Paris 
none	none	Write to him now s the time You are sure of your enterprise
2010_121416_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but he must make haste for hardly will the people of Paris have revolted before we shall have a score of princes begging to lead them If he defers he will find the place of honor taken 
none	none	Shall I send word to him as coming from you Yes certainly
2010_121416_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 Shall I tell him that he can count on you 
none	none	To the end And you will leave the command to him
2010_121416_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 Of the war yes but in politics 
2010_121416_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 You must know it is not his element 
2010_121416_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 He must leave me to negotiate for my cardinal s hat in my own fashion 
2010_121416_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 You care about it then so much 
2010_121416_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 Since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me said Gondy I wish at least that the hat should be red 
2010_121416_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 One must not dispute matters of taste and colors said Rochefort laughing 
2010_121416_000076_000001	train-clean-360	 I answer for his consent 
none	none	How soon can he be here
2010_121416_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 In five days 
2010_121416_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 Let him come and he will find a change I will answer for it 
2010_121416_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 Therefore go and collect your fifty men and hold yourself in readiness 
none	none	For what For everything Is there any signal for the general rally
2010_121416_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 A knot of straw in the hat 
none	none	Very good 
2010_121416_000085_000001	train-clean-360	Adieu my lord 
2010_121416_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 Adieu my dear Rochefort 
2010_121416_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah Monsieur Mazarin Monsieur Mazarin said Rochefort leading off his curate who had not found an opportunity of uttering a single word during the foregoing dialogue you will see whether I am too old to be a man of action 
none	none	It was half past nine o clock and the coadjutor required half an hour to go from the archbishop s palace to the tower of saint Jacques de la Boucherie 
2010_121416_000088_000001	train-clean-360	He remarked that a light was burning in one of the highest windows of the tower 
2010_121416_000088_000002	train-clean-360	 Good said he our syndic is at his post 
2010_121416_000089_000000	train-clean-360	He knocked and the door was opened 
2010_121416_000089_000001	train-clean-360	The vicar himself awaited him conducted him to the top of the tower and when there pointed to a little door placed the light which he had brought with him in a corner of the wall that the coadjutor might be able to find it on his return and went down again 
none	none	Although the key was in the door the coadjutor knocked
2010_121416_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 Come in said a voice which he recognized as that of the mendicant whom he found lying on a kind of truckle bed 
2010_121416_000090_000001	train-clean-360	He rose on the entrance of the coadjutor and at that moment ten o clock struck 
2010_121416_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 Well said Gondy have you kept your word with me 
2010_121416_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 Not exactly replied the mendicant 
none	none	How is that
2010_121416_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 You asked me for five hundred men did you not 
2010_121416_000094_000001	train-clean-360	Well I have ten thousand for you 
2010_121416_000095_000000	train-clean-360	 You are not boasting 
2010_121416_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you wish for a proof 
none	none	Yes 
2010_121416_000098_000000	train-clean-360	There were three candles alight each of which burnt before a window one looking upon the city the other upon the Palais Royal and a third upon the Rue Saint Denis 
2010_121416_000099_000000	train-clean-360	The man went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after the other 
2010_121416_000100_000000	train-clean-360	 What are you doing asked the coadjutor 
2010_121416_000101_000000	train-clean-360	 I have given the signal 
none	none	For what
2010_121416_000103_000000	train-clean-360	 For the barricades 
none	none	When you leave this you will behold my men at work Only take care you do not break your legs in stumbling over some chain or your neck by falling in a hole Good there is your money the same sum as that you have received already 
2010_121416_000104_000001	train-clean-360	Now remember that you are a general and do not go and drink 
2010_121416_000105_000000	train-clean-360	 For twenty years I have tasted nothing but water 
2010_121416_000106_000000	train-clean-360	The man took the bag from the hands of the coadjutor who heard the sound of his fingers counting and handling the gold pieces 
none	none	Ah ah said the coadjutor you are avaricious my good fellow 
2010_121416_000108_000000	train-clean-360	The mendicant sighed and threw down the bag 
none	none	Must I always be the same said he and shall I never succeed in overcoming the old leaven 
2010_121416_000109_000001	train-clean-360	Oh misery oh vanity 
2010_121416_000110_000000	train-clean-360	 You take it however 
2010_121416_000111_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but I make hereby a vow in your presence to employ all that remains to me in pious works 
2010_121416_000112_000000	train-clean-360	His face was pale and drawn like that of a man who had just undergone some inward struggle 
2010_121416_000113_000000	train-clean-360	 Singular man muttered Gondy taking his hat to go away but on turning around he saw the beggar between him and the door 
none	none	His first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped Your blessing your holiness before you go I beseech you he cried
2010_121416_000115_000000	train-clean-360	 Your holiness said Gondy my friend you take me for some one else 
2010_121416_000116_000000	train-clean-360	 No your holiness I take you for what you are that is to say the coadjutor I recognized you at the first glance 
2010_121416_000117_000000	train-clean-360	Gondy smiled 
2010_121416_000117_000001	train-clean-360	 And you want my blessing he said 
2010_121416_000118_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I have need of it 
2010_121416_000119_000000	train-clean-360	The mendicant uttered these words in a tone of such humility such earnest repentance that Gondy placed his hand upon him and gave him his benediction with all the unction of which he was capable 
2010_121416_000120_000000	train-clean-360	 Now said Gondy there is a communion between us 
2010_121416_000120_000001	train-clean-360	I have blessed you and you are sacred to me 
2010_121416_000120_000002	train-clean-360	Come have you committed some crime pursued by human justice from which I can protect you 
2010_121416_000121_000000	train-clean-360	The beggar shook his head 
2010_121416_000121_000001	train-clean-360	 The crime which I have committed my lord has no call upon human justice and you can only deliver me from it by blessing me frequently as you have just done 
none	none	Come be candid said the coadjutor you have not all your life followed the trade which you do now No my lord 
2010_121416_000123_000001	train-clean-360	I have pursued it for six years only 
none	none	And previously where were you In the Bastile
2010_121416_000126_000000	train-clean-360	 And before you went to the Bastile 
none	none	I will tell you my lord on the day when you are willing to hear my confession Good 
2010_121416_000128_000001	train-clean-360	At whatsoever hour of the day or night you may present yourself remember that I shall be ready to give you absolution 
2010_121416_000129_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you my lord said the mendicant in a hoarse voice 
2010_121416_000129_000001	train-clean-360	 But I am not yet ready to receive it 
none	none	Very well Adieu
2010_121416_000131_000000	train-clean-360	 Adieu your holiness said the mendicant opening the door and bending low before the prelate 
none	none	forty seven The Riot It was about eleven o clock at night Gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of Paris The whole city seemed peopled with fantastic beings silent shadows were seen unpaving the streets and others dragging and upsetting great wagons whilst others again dug ditches large enough to ingulf whole regiments of horsemen These active beings flitted here and there like so many demons completing some unknown labor these were the beggars of the Court of Miracles the agents of the giver of holy water in the Square of Saint Eustache preparing barricades for the morrow Gondy gazed on these deeds of darkness on these nocturnal laborers with a kind of fear he asked himself if after having called forth these foul creatures from their dens he should have the power of making them retire again He felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of these beings happened to approach him He reached the Rue Saint Honore and went up it toward the Rue de la Ferronnerie there the aspect changed here it was the tradesmen who were running from shop to shop their doors seemed closed like their shutters but they were only pushed to in such a manner as to open and allow the men who seemed fearful of showing what they carried to enter closing immediately These men were shopkeepers who had arms to lend to those who had none One individual went from door to door bending under the weight of swords guns muskets and every kind of weapon which he deposited as fast as he could By the light of a lantern the coadjutor recognized Planchet The coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of the Rue de la Monnaie there he found groups of bourgeois clad in black cloaks or gray according as they belonged to the upper or lower bourgeoisie They were standing motionless while single men passed from one group to another All these cloaks gray or black were raised behind by the point of a sword or before by the barrel of an arquebuse or a musket On reaching the Pont Neuf the coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a man approached him Who are you asked the man I do not know you for one of us Then it is because you do not know your friends my dear Monsieur Louvieres said the coadjutor raising his hat Louvieres recognized him and bowed Gondy continued his way and went as far as the Tour de Nesle There he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the walls They might be said to be a procession of ghosts for they were all wrapped in white cloaks When they reached a certain spot these men appeared to be annihilated one after the other as if the earth had opened under their feet Gondy edged into a corner saw them vanish from the first until the last but one The last raised his eyes to ascertain doubtless that neither his companions nor himself had been watched and in spite of the darkness he perceived Gondy He walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his throat Halloo Monsieur de Rochefort said Gondy laughing are you a boy to play with firearms Rochefort recognized the voice Ah it is you my lord said he The very same What people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth My fifty recruits from the Chevalier d Humieres who are destined to enter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their equipment their white cloaks And where are you going To the house of one of my friends a sculptor only we enter by the trap through which he lets down his marble Very good said Gondy shaking Rochefort by the hand who descended in his turn and closed the trap after him It was now one o clock in the morning and the coadjutor returned home He opened a window and leaned out to listen A strange incomprehensible unearthly sound seemed to pervade the whole city one felt that something unusual and terrible was happening in all the streets now dark as ocean s most unfathomable caves From time to time a dull sound was heard like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the sea but nothing clear nothing distinct nothing intelligible it was like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an earthquake The work of revolt continued the whole night thus The next morning on awaking Paris seemed to be startled at her own appearance It was like a besieged town Armed men shouldering muskets watched over the barricades with menacing looks words of command patrols arrests executions even were encountered at every step Those bearing plumed hats and gold swords were stopped and made to cry Long live Broussel Down with Mazarin and whoever refused to comply with this ceremony was hooted at spat upon and even beaten They had not yet begun to slay but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not wanting The barricades had been pushed as far as the Palais Royal From the Rue de Bons Enfants to that of the Ferronnerie from the Rue Saint Thomas du Louvre to the Pont Neuf from the Rue Richelieu to the Porte Saint Honore there were more than ten thousand armed men those who were at the front hurled defiance at the impassive sentinels of the regiment of guards posted around the Palais Royal the gates of which were closed behind them a precaution which made their situation precarious Among these thousands moved in bands numbering from one hundred to two hundred pale and haggard men clothed in rags who bore a sort of standard on which was inscribed these words Behold the misery of the people Wherever these men passed frenzied cries were heard and there were so many of these bands that the cries were to be heard in all directions The astonishment of Mazarin and of Anne of Austria was great when it was announced to them that the city which the previous evening they had left entirely tranquil had awakened to such feverish commotion nor would either the one or the other believe the reports that were brought to them declaring they would rather rely on the evidence of their own eyes and ears Then a window was opened and when they saw and heard they were convinced Mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet trembling all over locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his fingers As for the queen furious and left to her own guidance she went for the Marechal de la Meilleraie and desired him to take as many men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this pleasantry The marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wont to hesitate at nothing and he had that lofty contempt for the populace which army officers usually profess He took a hundred and fifty men and attempted to go out by the Pont du Louvre but there he met Rochefort and his fifty horsemen attended by more than five hundred men The marshal made no attempt to force that barrier and returned up the quay But at Pont Neuf he found Louvieres and his bourgeois This time the marshal charged but he was welcomed by musket shots while stones fell like hail from all the windows He left there three men He beat a retreat toward the market but there he met Planchet with his halberdiers their halberds were leveled at him threateningly He attempted to ride over those gray cloaks but the gray cloaks held their ground and the marshal retired toward the Rue Saint Honore leaving four of his guards dead on the field of battle The marshal then entered the Rue Saint Honore but there he was opposed by the barricades of the mendicant of Saint Eustache They were guarded not only by armed men but even by women and children Master Friquet the owner of a pistol and of a sword which Louvieres had given him had organized a company of rogues like himself and was making a tremendous racket The marshal thought this barrier not so well fortified as the others and determined to break through it He dismounted twenty men to make a breach in the barricade whilst he and others remaining on their horses were to protect the assailants The twenty men marched straight toward the barrier but from behind the beams from among the wagon wheels and from the heights of the rocks a terrible fusillade burst forth and at the same time Planchet s halberdiers appeared at the corner of the Cemetery of the Innocents and Louvieres s bourgeois at the corner of the Rue de la Monnaie The Marechal de la Meilleraie was caught between two fires but he was brave and made up his mind to die where he was He returned blow for blow and cries of pain began to be heard in the crowd The guards more skillful did greater execution but the bourgeois more numerous overwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of iron Men fell around him as they had fallen at Rocroy or at Lerida Fontrailles his aide de camp had an arm broken his horse had received a bullet in his neck and he had difficulty in controlling him maddened by pain In short he had reached that supreme moment when the bravest feel a shudder in their veins when suddenly in the direction of the Rue de l Arbre Sec the crowd opened crying Long live the coadjutor and Gondy in surplice and cloak appeared moving tranquilly in the midst of the fusillade and bestowing his benedictions to the right and left as undisturbed as if he were leading a procession of the Fete Dieu All fell to their knees The marshal recognized him and hastened to meet him Get me out of this in Heaven s name he said or I shall leave my carcass here and those of all my men A great tumult arose in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not have been heard Gondy raised his hand and demanded silence All were still My children he said this is the Marechal de la Meilleraie as to whose intentions you have been deceived and who pledges himself on returning to the Louvre to demand of the queen in your name our Broussel s release You pledge yourself to that marshal added Gondy turning to La Meilleraie Morbleu cried the latter I should say that I do pledge myself to it I had no hope of getting off so easily He gives you his word of honor said Gondy The marshal raised his hand in token of assent Long live the coadjutor cried the crowd Some voices even added Long live the marshal But all took up the cry in chorus Down with Mazarin The crowd gave place the barricade was opened and the marshal with the remnant of his company retreated preceded by Friquet and his bandits some of them making a presence of beating drums and others imitating the sound of the trumpet It was almost a triumphal procession only behind the guards the barricades were closed again The marshal bit his fingers In the meantime as we have said Mazarin was in his closet putting his affairs in order He called for D Artagnan but in the midst of such tumult he little expected to see him D Artagnan not being on service In about ten minutes D Artagnan appeared at the door followed by the inseparable Porthos Ah come in come in Monsieur d Artagnan cried the cardinal and welcome your friend too But what is going on in this accursed Paris What is going on my lord nothing good replied D Artagnan shaking his head The town is in open revolt and just now as I was crossing the Rue Montorgueil with Monsieur du Vallon who is here and is your humble servant they wanted in spite of my uniform or perhaps because of my uniform to make us cry Long live Broussel and must I tell you my lord what they wished us to cry as well Speak speak Down with Mazarin I faith the treasonable word is out Mazarin smiled but became very pale And you did cry he asked I faith no said D Artagnan I was not in voice Monsieur du Vallon has a cold and did not cry either Then my lord Then what asked Mazarin Look at my hat and cloak And D Artagnan displayed four gunshot holes in his cloak and two in his beaver As for Porthos s coat a blow from a halberd had cut it open on the flank and a pistol shot had cut his feather in two Diavolo said the cardinal pensively gazing at the two friends with lively admiration I should have cried I should At this moment the tumult was heard nearer Mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around him He had a great desire to go to the window but he dared not See what is going on Monsieur D Artagnan said he D Artagnan went to the window with his habitual composure Oho said he what is this Marechal de la Meilleraie returning without a hat Fontrailles with his arm in a sling wounded guards horses bleeding eh then what are the sentinels about They are aiming they are going to fire They have received orders to fire on the people if the people approach the Palais Royal exclaimed Mazarin But if they fire all is lost cried D Artagnan We have the gates The gates to hold for five minutes the gates they will be torn down twisted into iron wire ground to powder God s death don t fire screamed D Artagnan throwing open the window In spite of this recommendation which owing to the noise could scarcely have been heard two or three musket shots resounded succeeded by a terrible discharge The balls might be heard peppering the facade of the Palais Royal and one of them passing under D Artagnan s arm entered and broke a mirror in which Porthos was complacently admiring himself Alack alack cried the cardinal a Venetian glass Oh my lord said D Artagnan quietly shutting the window it is not worth while weeping yet for probably an hour hence there will not be one of your mirrors remaining in the Palais Royal whether they be Venetian or Parisian But what do you advise then asked Mazarin trembling Eh egad to give up Broussel as they demand What the devil do you want with a member of the parliament He is of no earthly use to anybody And you Monsieur du Vallon is that your advice What would you do I should give up Broussel said Porthos Come come with me gentlemen exclaimed Mazarin I will go and discuss the matter with the queen He stopped at the end of the corridor and said I can count upon you gentlemen can I not We do not give ourselves twice over said D Artagnan we have given ourselves to you command we shall obey Very well then said Mazarin enter this cabinet and wait till I come back And turning off he entered the drawing room by another door forty eight The Riot becomes a Revolution The closet into which D Artagnan and Porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawing room where the queen was by tapestried curtains only and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room whilst the aperture between the two hangings small as it was permitted them to see The queen was standing in the room pale with anger her self control however was so great that it might have been imagined that she was calm Comminges Villequier and Guitant were behind her and the women again were behind the men The Chancellor Sequier who twenty years previously had persecuted her so ruthlessly stood before her relating how his carriage had been smashed how he had been pursued and had rushed into the Hotel d O that the hotel was immediately invaded pillaged and devastated happily he had time to reach a closet hidden behind tapestry in which he was secreted by an old woman together with his brother the Bishop of Meaux Then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest so as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered Fortunately however he had not been taken the people believing that he had escaped by some back entrance retired and left him at liberty to retreat Then disguised in he clothes of the Marquis d O he had left the hotel stumbling over the bodies of an officer and two guards who had been killed whilst defending the street door During the recital Mazarin entered and glided noiselessly up to the queen to listen Well said the queen when the chancellor had finished speaking what do you think of it all I think that matters look very gloomy madame But what step would you propose to me I could propose one to your majesty but I dare not You may you may sir said the queen with a bitter smile you were not so timid once The chancellor reddened and stammered some words It is not a question of the past but of the present said the queen you said you could give me advice what is it Madame said the chancellor hesitating it would be to release Broussel The queen although already pale became visibly paler and her face was contracted Release Broussel she cried never At this moment steps were heard in the ante room and without any announcement the Marechal de la Meilleraie appeared at the door Ah there you are marechal cried Anne of Austria joyfully I trust you have brought this rabble to reason Madame replied the marechal I have left three men on the Pont Neuf four at the Halle six at the corner of the Rue de l Arbre Sec and two at the door of your palace fifteen in all I have brought away ten or twelve wounded I know not where I have left my hat and in all probability I should have been left with my hat had the coadjutor not arrived in time to rescue me Ah indeed said the queen it would have much astonished me if that low cur with his distorted legs had not been mixed up with all this Madame said La Meilleraie do not say too much against him before me for the service he rendered me is still fresh Very good said the queen be as grateful as you like it does not implicate me you are here safe and sound that is all I wished for you are not only welcome but welcome back Yes madame but I only came back on one condition that I would transmit to your majesty the will of the people The will exclaimed the queen frowning Oh oh monsieur marechal you must indeed have found yourself in wondrous peril to have undertaken so strange a commission The irony with which these words were uttered did not escape the marechal Pardon madame he said I am not a lawyer I am a mere soldier and probably therefore I do not quite comprehend the value of certain words I ought to have said the wishes and not the will of the people As for what you do me the honor to say I presume you mean I was afraid The queen smiled Well then madame yes I did feel fear and though I have been through twelve pitched battles and I cannot count how many charges and skirmishes I own for the third time in my life I was afraid Yes and I would rather face your majesty however threatening your smile than face those demons who accompanied me hither and who sprung from I know not whence unless from deepest hell Bravo said D Artagnan in a whisper to Porthos well answered Well said the queen biting her lips whilst her courtiers looked at each other with surprise what is the desire of my people That Broussel shall be given up to them madame Never said the queen never Your majesty is mistress said La Meilleraie retreating a few steps Where are you going marechal asked the queen To give your majesty s reply to those who await it Stay marechal I will not appear to parley with rebels Madame I have pledged my word and unless you order me to be arrested I shall be forced to return Anne of Austria s eyes shot glances of fire Oh that is no impediment sir said she I have had greater men than you arrested Guitant Mazarin sprang forward Madame said he if I dared in my turn advise Would it be to give up Broussel sir If so you can spare yourself the trouble No said Mazarin although perhaps that counsel is as good as any other Then what may it be To call for monsieur le coadjuteur The coadjutor cried the queen that dreadful mischief maker It is he who has raised all this revolt The more reason said Mazarin if he has raised it he can put it down And hold madame suggested Comminges who was near a window out of which he could see hold the moment is a happy one for there he is now giving his blessing in the square of the Palais Royal The queen sprang to the window It is true she said the arch hypocrite see I see said Mazarin that everybody kneels before him although he be but coadjutor whilst I were I in his place though I am cardinal should be torn to pieces I persist then madame in my wish he laid an emphasis on the word that your majesty should receive the coadjutor And wherefore do you not say like the rest your will replied the queen in a low voice Mazarin bowed Monsieur le marechal said the queen after a moment s reflection go and find the coadjutor and bring him to me And what shall I say to the people That they must have patience said Anne as I have The fiery Spanish woman spoke in a tone so imperative that the marechal made no reply he bowed and went out D Artagnan turned to Porthos How will this end he said We shall soon see said Porthos in his tranquil way In the meantime Anne of Austria approached Comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst Mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by D Artagnan and Porthos Ere long the door opened and the marechal entered followed by the coadjutor There madame he said is Monsieur Gondy who hastens to obey your majesty s summons The queen advanced a few steps to meet him and then stopped cold severe unmoved with her lower lip scornfully protruded Gondy bowed respectfully Well sir said the queen what is your opinion of this riot That it is no longer a riot madame he replied but a revolt The revolt is at the door of those who think my people can rebel cried Anne unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor whom she looked upon and probably with reason as the promoter of the tumult Revolt thus it is called by those who have wished for this demonstration and who are perhaps the cause of it but wait wait the king s authority will put all this to rights Was it to tell me that madame coldly replied Gondy that your majesty admitted me to the honor of entering your presence No my dear coadjutor said Mazarin it was to ask your advice in the unhappy dilemma in which we find ourselves Is it true asked Gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion Yes said the queen it is requested The coadjutor bowed Your majesty wishes then You to say what you would do in her place Mazarin hastened to reply The coadjutor looked at the queen who replied by a sign in the affirmative Were I in her majesty s place said Gondy coldly I should not hesitate I should release Broussel And if I do not give him up what think you will be the result exclaimed the queen I believe that not a stone in Paris will remain unturned put in the marechal It was not your opinion that I asked said the queen sharply without even turning around If it is I whom your majesty interrogates replied the coadjutor in the same calm manner I reply that I hold monsieur le marechal s opinion in every respect The color mounted to the queen s face her fine blue eyes seemed to start out of her head and her carmine lips compared by all the poets of the day to a pomegranate in flower were trembling with anger Mazarin himself who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this disturbed household was alarmed Give up Broussel she cried fine counsel indeed Upon my word one can easily see it comes from a priest Gondy remained firm and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his head as the sarcasms of the evening before had done but hatred and revenge were accumulating in his heart silently and drop by drop He looked coldly at the queen who nudged Mazarin to make him say something in his turn Mazarin according to his custom was thinking much and saying little Ho ho said he good advice advice of a friend I too would give up that good Monsieur Broussel dead or alive and all would be at an end If you yield him dead all will indeed be at an end my lord but quite otherwise than you mean Did I say dead or alive replied Mazarin It was only a way of speaking You know I am not familiar with the French language which you monsieur le coadjuteur both speak and write so well This is a council of state D Artagnan remarked to Porthos but we held better ones at La Rochelle with Athos and Aramis At the Saint Gervais bastion said Porthos There and elsewhere The coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed still with the same tranquillity Madame if the opinion I have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to follow I know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they will leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a revolution Thus then it is your opinion said Anne of Austria with a sneer and biting her lips with rage that yesterday s riot which to day is already a rebellion to morrow may become a revolution Yes madame replied the coadjutor gravely But if I am to believe you sir the people seem to have thrown off all restraint It is a bad year for kings said Gondy shaking his head look at England madame Yes but fortunately we have no Oliver Cromwell in France replied the queen Who knows said Gondy such men are like thunderbolts one recognizes them only when they have struck Every one shuddered and there was a moment of silence during which the queen pressed her hand to her side evidently to still the beatings of her heart Porthos murmured D Artagnan look well at that priest Yes said Porthos I see him What then Well he is a man Porthos looked at D Artagnan in astonishment Evidently he did not understand his meaning Your majesty continued the coadjutor pitilessly is about to take such measures as seem good to you but I foresee that they will be violent and such as will still further exasperate the rioters In that case you monsieur le coadjuteur who have such power over them and are at the same time friendly to us said the queen ironically will quiet them by bestowing your blessing upon them Perhaps it will be too late said Gondy still unmoved perhaps I shall have lost all influence while by giving up Broussel your majesty will strike at the root of the sedition and will gain the right to punish severely any revival of the revolt Have I not then that right cried the queen If you have it use it replied Gondy Peste said D Artagnan to Porthos There is a man after my own heart Oh if he were minister and I were his D Artagnan instead of belonging to that beast of a Mazarin mordieu what fine things we would do together Yes said Porthos The queen made a sign for every one except Mazarin to quit the room and Gondy bowed as if to leave with the rest Stay sir said Anne to him Good thought Gondy she is going to yield She is going to have him killed said D Artagnan to Porthos but at all events it shall not be by me I swear to Heaven on the contrary that if they fall upon him I will fall upon them And I too said Porthos Good muttered Mazarin sitting down we shall soon see something startling The queen s eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had closed the door she turned away It was evident that she was making unnatural efforts to subdue her anger she fanned herself smelled at her vinaigrette and walked up and down Gondy who began to feel uneasy examined the tapestry with his eyes touched the coat of mail which he wore under his long gown and felt from time to time to see if the handle of a good Spanish dagger which was hidden under his cloak was well within reach And now at last said the queen now that we are alone repeat your counsel monsieur le coadjuteur It is this madame that you should appear to have reflected and publicly acknowledge an error which constitutes the extra strength of a strong government release Broussel from prison and give him back to the people Oh cried Anne to humble myself thus Am I or am I not the queen This screaming mob are they or are they not my subjects Have I friends Have I guards Ah by Notre Dame as Queen Catherine used to say continued she excited by her own words rather than give up this infamous Broussel to them I will strangle him with my own hands And she sprang toward Gondy whom assuredly at that moment she hated more than Broussel with outstretched arms The coadjutor remained immovable and not a muscle of his face was discomposed only his glance flashed like a sword in returning the furious looks of the queen He were a dead man said the Gascon if there were still a Vitry at the court and if Vitry entered at this moment but for my part before he could reach the good prelate I would kill Vitry at once the cardinal would be infinitely pleased with me Hush said Porthos listen Madame cried the cardinal seizing hold of Anne and drawing her back Madame what are you about Then he added in Spanish Anne are you mad You a queen to quarrel like a washerwoman And do you not perceive that in the person of this priest is represented the whole people of Paris and that it is dangerous to insult him at this moment and if this priest wished it in an hour you would be without a crown Come then on another occasion you can be firm and strong but to day is not the proper time to day flatter and caress or you are only a common woman At the first words of this address D Artagnan had seized Porthos s arm which he pressed with gradually increasing force When Mazarin ceased speaking he said to Porthos in a low tone Never tell Mazarin that I understand Spanish or I am a lost man and you are also All right said Porthos This rough appeal marked by the eloquence which characterized Mazarin when he spoke in Italian or Spanish and which he lost entirely in speaking French was uttered with such impenetrable expression that Gondy clever physiognomist as he was had no suspicion of its being more than a simple warning to be more subdued The queen on her part thus chided softened immediately and sat down and in an almost weeping voice letting her arms fall by her side said Pardon me sir and attribute this violence to what I suffer A woman and consequently subject to the weaknesses of my sex I am alarmed at the idea of civil war a queen accustomed to be obeyed I am excited at the first opposition Madame replied Gondy bowing your majesty is mistaken in qualifying my sincere advice as opposition Your majesty has none but submissive and respectful subjects It is not the queen with whom the people are displeased they ask for Broussel and are only too happy if you release him to them to live under your government Mazarin who at the words It is not the queen with whom the people are displeased had pricked up his ears thinking that the coadjutor was about to speak of the cries Down with Mazarin and pleased with Gondy s suppression of this fact he said with his sweetest voice and his most gracious expression Madame credit the coadjutor who is one of the most able politicians we have the first available cardinal s hat seems to belong already to his noble brow Ah how much you have need of me cunning rogue thought Gondy And what will he promise us said D Artagnan Peste if he is giving away hats like that Porthos let us look out and both demand a regiment to morrow Corbleu let the civil war last but one year and I will have a constable s sword gilt for me And for me put in Porthos For you I will give you the baton of the Marechal de la Meilleraie who does not seem to be much in favor just now And so sir said the queen you are seriously afraid of a public tumult Seriously said Gondy astonished at not having further advanced I fear that when the torrent has broken its embankment it will cause fearful destruction And I said the queen think that in such a case other embankments should be raised to oppose it Go I will reflect Gondy looked at Mazarin astonished and Mazarin approached the queen to speak to her but at this moment a frightful tumult arose from the square of the Palais Royal Gondy smiled the queen s color rose and Mazarin grew even paler What is that again he asked At this moment Comminges rushed into the room Pardon your majesty he cried but the people have dashed the sentinels against the gates and they are now forcing the doors what are your commands Listen madame said Gondy The moaning of waves the noise of thunder the roaring of a volcano cannot be compared with the tempest of cries heard at that moment What are my commands said the queen Yes for time presses How many men have you about the Palais Royal Six hundred Place a hundred around the king and with the remainder sweep away this mob for me Madame cried Mazarin what are you about Go said the queen Comminges went out with a soldier s passive obedience At this moment a monstrous battering was heard One of the gates began to yield Oh madame cried Mazarin you have ruined us all the king yourself and me At this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal Anne became alarmed in her turn and would have recalled Comminges It is too late said Mazarin tearing his hair too late The gale had given way Hoarse shouts were heard from the excited mob D Artagnan put his hand to his sword motioning to Porthos to follow his example Save the queen cried Mazarin to the coadjutor Gondy sprang to the window and threw it open he recognized Louvieres at the head of a troop of about three or four thousand men Not a step further he shouted the queen is signing What are you saying asked the queen The truth madame said Mazarin placing a pen and a paper before her you must then he added Sign Anne I implore you I command you The queen fell into a chair took the pen and signed The people kept back by Louvieres had not made another step forward but the awful murmuring which indicates an angry people continued The queen had written The keeper of the prison at Saint Germain will set Councillor Broussel at liberty and she had signed it The coadjutor whose eyes devoured her slightest movements seized the paper immediately the signature had been affixed to it returned to the window and waved it in his hand This is the order he said All Paris seemed to shout with joy and then the air resounded with the cries of Long live Broussel Long live the coadjutor Long live the queen cried De Gondy but the cries which replied to his were poor and few and perhaps he had but uttered it to make Anne of Austria sensible of her weakness And now that you have obtained what you want go said she Monsieur de Gondy Whenever her majesty has need of me replied the coadjutor bowing her majesty knows I am at her command Ah cursed priest cried Anne when he had retired stretching out her arm to the scarcely closed door one day I will make you drink the dregs of the atrocious gall you have poured out on me to day Mazarin wished to approach her Leave me she exclaimed you are not a man and she went out of the room It is you who are not a woman muttered Mazarin Then after a moment of reverie he remembered where he had left D Artagnan and Porthos and that they must have overheard everything He knit his brows and went direct to the tapestry which he pushed aside The closet was empty At the queen s last word D Artagnan had dragged Porthos into the gallery Thither Mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends walking up and down Why did you leave the closet Monsieur d Artagnan asked the cardinal Because replied D Artagnan the queen desired every one to leave and I thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the rest And you have been here since About a quarter of an hour said D Artagnan motioning to Porthos not to contradict him Mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that D Artagnan had seen and heard everything but he was pleased with his falsehood Decidedly Monsieur d Artagnan you are the man I have been seeking You may reckon upon me and so may your friend Then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile he re entered his closet more calmly for on the departure of De Gondy the uproar had ceased as though by enchantment forty nine Misfortune refreshes the Memory Anne of Austria returned to her oratory furious What she cried wringing her beautiful hands What the people have seen Monsieur de Conde a prince of the blood royal arrested by my mother in law Maria de Medicis they saw my mother in law their former regent expelled by the cardinal they saw Monsieur de Vendome that is to say the son of Henry IV a prisoner at Vincennes and whilst these great personages were imprisoned insulted and threatened they said nothing and now for a Broussel good God what then is to become of royalty The queen unconsciously touched here upon the exciting question The people had made no demonstration for the princes but they had risen for Broussel they were taking the part of a plebeian and in defending Broussel they instinctively felt they were defending themselves During this time Mazarin walked up and down the study glancing from time to time at his beautiful Venetian mirror starred in every direction Ah he said it is sad I know well to be forced to yield thus but pshaw we shall have our revenge What matters it about Broussel it is a name not a thing Mazarin clever politician as he was was for once mistaken Broussel was a thing not a name The next morning therefore when Broussel made his entrance into Paris in a large carriage having his son Louvieres at his side and Friquet behind the vehicle the people threw themselves in his way and cries of Long live Broussel Long live our father resounded from all parts and was death to Mazarin s ears and the cardinal s spies brought bad news from every direction which greatly agitated the minister but was calmly received by the queen The latter seemed to be maturing in her mind some great stroke a fact which increased the uneasiness of the cardinal who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination of Anne of Austria The coadjutor returned to parliament more a monarch than king queen and cardinal all three together By his advice a decree from parliament summoned the citizens to lay down their arms and demolish the barricades They now knew that it required but one hour to take up arms again and one night to reconstruct the barricades Rochefort had returned to the Chevalier d Humieres his fifty horsemen less two missing at roll call But the chevalier was himself at heart a Frondist and would hear nothing said of compensation The mendicant had gone to his old place on the steps of Saint Eustache and was again distributing holy water with one hand and asking alms with the other No one could suspect that those two hands had been engaged with others in drawing out from the social edifice the keystone of royalty Louvieres was proud and satisfied he had taken revenge on Mazarin and had aided in his father s deliverance from prison His name had been mentioned as a name of terror at the Palais Royal Laughingly he said to the councillor restored to his family Do you think father that if now I should ask for a company the queen would give it to me D Artagnan profited by this interval of calm to send away Raoul whom he had great difficulty in keeping shut up during the riot and who wished positively to strike a blow for one party or the other Raoul had offered some opposition at first but D Artagnan made use of the Comte de la Fere s name and after paying a visit to Madame de Chevreuse Raoul started to rejoin the army Rochefort alone was dissatisfied with the termination of affairs He had written to the Duc de Beaufort to come and the duke was about to arrive and he world find Paris tranquil He went to the coadjutor to consult with him whether it would not be better to send word to the duke to stop on the road but Gondy reflected for a moment and then said Let him continue his journey All is not then over asked Rochefort My dear count we have only just begun What induces you to think so The knowledge that I have of the queen s heart she will not rest contented beaten Is she then preparing for a stroke I hope so Come let us see what you know I know that she has written to the prince to return in haste from the army Ah ha said Rochefort you are right We must let Monsieur de Beaufort come In fact the evening after this conversation the report was circulated that the Prince de Conde had arrived It was a very simple natural circumstance and yet it created a profound sensation It was said that Madame de Longueville for whom the prince had more than a brother s affection and in whom he had confided had been indiscreet His confidence had unveiled the sinister project of the queen Even on the night of the prince s return some citizens bolder than the rest such as the sheriffs captains and the quartermaster went from house to house among their friends saying Why do we not take the king and place him in the Hotel de Ville It is a shame to leave him to be educated by our enemies who will give him evil counsel whereas brought up by the coadjutor for instance he would imbibe national principles and love his people That night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray and black cloaks the patrols of armed shop people and the bands of mendicants reappeared The queen had passed the night in lonely conference with the prince who had entered the oratory at midnight and did not leave till five o clock in the morning At five o clock Anne went to the cardinal s room If she had not yet taken any repose he at least was already up Six days had already passed out of the ten he had asked from Mordaunt he was therefore occupied in revising his reply to Cromwell when some one knocked gently at the door of communication with the queen s apartments Anne of Austria alone was permitted to enter by that door The cardinal therefore rose to open it The queen was in a morning gown but it became her still for like Diana of Poictiers and Ninon Anne of Austria enjoyed the privilege of remaining ever beautiful nevertheless this morning she looked handsomer than usual for her eyes had all the sparkle inward satisfaction adds to expression What is the matter madame said Mazarin uneasily You seem secretly elated Yes Giulio she said proud and happy for I have found the means of strangling this hydra You are a great politician my queen said Mazarin let us hear the means And he hid what he had written by sliding the letter under a folio of blank paper You know said the queen that they want to take the king away from me Alas yes and to hang me They shall not have the king Nor hang me Listen I want to carry off my son from them with yourself I wish that this event which on the day it is known will completely change the aspect of affairs should be accomplished without the knowledge of any others but yourself myself and a third person And who is this third person Monsieur le Prince He has come then as they told me Last evening And you have seen him He has just left me And will he aid this project The plan is his own And Paris He will starve it out and force it to surrender at discretion The plan is not wanting in grandeur I see but one impediment What is it Impossibility A senseless word Nothing is impossible On paper In execution We have money A little said Mazarin trembling lest Anne should ask to draw upon his purse Troops Five or six thousand men Courage Plenty Then the thing is easy Oh do think of it Giulio Paris this odious Paris waking up one morning without queen or king surrounded besieged famished having for its sole resource its stupid parliament and their coadjutor with crooked limbs Charming charming said Mazarin I can imagine the effect I do not see the means I will find the means myself You are aware it will be war civil war furious devouring implacable Oh yes yes war said Anne of Austria Yes I will reduce this rebellious city to ashes I will extinguish the fire with blood I will perpetuate the crime and punishment by making a frightful example Paris I I detest I loathe it Very fine Anne You are now sanguinary but take care We are not in the time of Malatesta and Castruccio Castracani You will get yourself decapitated my beautiful queen and that would be a pity You laugh Faintly It is dangerous to go to war with a nation Look at your brother monarch Charles I He is badly off very badly We are in France and I am Spanish So much the worse I had much rather you were French and myself also they would hate us both less Nevertheless you consent Yes if the thing be possible It is it is I who tell you so make preparations for departure I I am always prepared to go only as you know I never do go and perhaps shall go this time as little as before In short if I go will you go too I will try You torment me Giulio with your fears and what are you afraid of then Of many things What are they Mazarin s face smiling as it was became clouded Anne said he you are but a woman and as a woman you may insult men at your ease knowing that you can do it with impunity You accuse me of fear I have not so much as you have since I do not fly as you do Against whom do they cry out is it against you or against myself Whom would they hang yourself or me Well I can weather the storm I whom notwithstanding you tax with fear not with bravado that is not my way but I am firm Imitate me Make less hubbub and think more deeply You cry very loud you end by doing nothing you talk of flying Mazarin shrugged his shoulders and taking the queen s hand led her to the window Look he said Well said the queen blinded by her obstinacy Well what do you see from this window If I am not mistaken those are citizens helmeted and mailed armed with good muskets as in the time of the League and whose eyes are so intently fixed on this window that they will see you if you raise that curtain much and now come to the other side what do you see Creatures of the people armed with halberds guarding your doors You will see the same at every opening from this palace to which I should lead you Your doors are guarded the airholes of your cellars are guarded and I could say to you as that good La Ramee said to me of the Duc de Beaufort you must be either bird or mouse to get out He did get out nevertheless Do you think of escaping in the same way I am a prisoner then Parbleu said Mazarin I have been proving it to you this last hour And he quietly resumed his dispatch at the place where he had been interrupted Anne trembling with anger and scarlet with humiliation left the room shutting the door violently after her Mazarin did not even turn around When once more in her own apartment Anne fell into a chair and wept then suddenly struck with an idea I am saved she exclaimed rising oh yes yes I know a man who will find the means of taking me from Paris a man I have too long forgotten Then falling into a reverie she added however with an expression of joy Ungrateful woman that I am for twenty years I have forgotten this man whom I ought to have made a marechal of France My mother in law expended gold caresses dignities on Concini who ruined her the king made Vitry marechal of France for an assassination while I have left in obscurity in poverty the noble D Artagnan who saved me And running to a table on which were paper pens and ink she hastily began to write fifty The Interview It had been D Artagnan s practice ever since the riots to sleep in the same room as Porthos and on this eventful morning he was still there sleeping and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles As for Porthos he dreamed that the panels of his carriage were not capacious enough to contain the armorial bearings he had ordered to be painted on them They were both aroused at seven o clock by the entrance of an unliveried servant who brought a letter for D Artagnan From whom asked the Gascon From the queen replied the servant Ho said Porthos raising himself in his bed what does she say D Artagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly whilst Porthos looked at him with starting eyes not daring to ask a single question Friend Porthos said D Artagnan handing the letter to him this time at least you are sure of your title of baron and I of my captaincy Read for yourself and judge Porthos took the letter and with a trembling voice read the following words The queen wishes to speak to Monsieur d Artagnan who must follow the bearer Well exclaimed Porthos I see nothing in that very extraordinary But I see much that is very extraordinary in it replied D Artagnan It is evident by their sending for me that matters are becoming complicated Just reflect a little what an agitation the queen s mind must be in for her to have remembered me after twenty years It is true said Porthos Sharpen your sword baron load your pistols and give some corn to the horses for I will answer for it something lightning like will happen ere to morrow But stop do you think it can be a trap that they are laying for us suggested Porthos incessantly thinking how his greatness must be irksome to inferior people If it is a snare replied D Artagnan I shall scent it out be assured If Mazarin is an Italian I am a Gascon And D Artagnan dressed himself in an instant Whilst Porthos still in bed was hooking on his cloak for him a second knock at the door was heard Come in exclaimed D Artagnan and another servant entered From His Eminence Cardinal Mazarin presenting a letter D Artagnan looked at Porthos A complicated affair said Porthos where will you begin It is arranged capitally his eminence expects me in half an hour Good My friend said D Artagnan turning to the servant tell his eminence that in half an hour I shall be at his command It is very fortunate resumed the Gascon when the valet had retired that he did not meet the other one Do you not think that they have sent for you both for the same thing I do not think it I am certain of it Quick quick D Artagnan Remember that the queen awaits you and after the queen the cardinal and after the cardinal myself D Artagnan summoned Anne of Austria s servant and signified that he was ready to follow him into the queen s presence The servant conducted him by the Rue des Petits Champs and turning to the left entered the little garden gate leading into the Rue Richelieu then they gained the private staircase and D Artagnan was ushered into the oratory A certain emotion for which he could not account made the lieutenant s heart beat he had no longer the assurance of youth experience had taught him the importance of past events Formerly he would have approached the queen as a young man who bends before a woman but now it was a different thing he answered her summons as an humble soldier obeys an illustrious general The silence of the oratory was at last disturbed by the slight rustling of silk and D Artagnan started when he perceived the tapestry raised by a white hand which by its form its color and its beauty he recognized as that royal hand which had one day been presented to him to kiss The queen entered It is you Monsieur d Artagnan she said fixing a gaze full of melancholy interest on the countenance of the officer and I know you well Look at me well in your turn I am the queen do you recognize me No madame replied D Artagnan But are you no longer aware continued Anne giving that sweet expression to her voice which she could do at will that in former days the queen had once need of a young brave and devoted cavalier that she found this cavalier and that although he might have thought that she had forgotten him she had kept a place for him in the depths of her heart No madame I was ignorant of that said the musketeer So much the worse sir said Anne of Austria so much the worse at least for the queen for to day she has need of the same courage and the same devotion What exclaimed D Artagnan does the queen surrounded as she is by such devoted servants such wise counselors men in short so great by merit or position does she deign to cast her eyes on an obscure soldier Anne understood this covert reproach and was more moved than irritated by it She had many a time felt humiliated by the self sacrifice and disinterestedness shown by the Gascon gentleman She had allowed herself to be exceeded in generosity All that you tell me of those by whom I am surrounded Monsieur d Artagnan is doubtless true said the queen but I have confidence in you alone I know that you belong to the cardinal but belong to me as well and I will take upon myself the making of your fortune Come will you do to day what formerly the gentleman you do not know did for the queen I will do everything your majesty commands replied D Artagnan The queen reflected for a moment and then seeing the cautious demeanor of the musketeer Perhaps you like repose she said I do not know for I have never had it madame Have you any friends I had three two of whom have left Paris to go I know not where One alone is left to me but he is one of those known I believe to the cavalier of whom your majesty did me the honor to speak Very good said the queen you and your friend are worth an army What am I to do madame Return at five o clock and I will tell you but do not breathe to a living soul sir the rendezvous which I give you No madame Swear it upon the cross Madame I have never been false to my word when I say I will not do a thing I mean it The queen although astonished at this language to which she was not accustomed from her courtiers argued from it a happy omen of the zeal with which D Artagnan would serve her in the accomplishment of her project It was one of the Gascon s artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under an appearance of rough loyalty Has the queen any further commands for me now asked D Artagnan No sir replied Anne of Austria and you may retire until the time that I mentioned to you D Artagnan bowed and went out Diable he exclaimed when the door was shut they seem to have the greatest need of me just now Then as the half hour had already glided by he crossed the gallery and knocked at the cardinal s door Bernouin introduced him I come for your commands my lord he said And according to his custom D Artagnan glanced rapidly around and remarked that Mazarin had a sealed letter before him But it was so placed on the desk that he could not see to whom it was addressed You come from the queen said Mazarin looking fixedly at D Artagnan I my lord who told you that Nobody but I know it I regret infinitely to tell you my lord that you are mistaken replied the Gascon impudently firm to the promise he had just made to Anne of Austria I opened the door of the ante room myself and I saw you enter at the end of the corridor Because I was shown up the private stairs How so I know not it must have been a mistake Mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make D Artagnan reveal anything he was desirous of hiding so he gave up for the time the discovery of the mystery the Gascon was concealing Let us speak of my affairs said Mazarin since you will tell me naught of yours Are you fond of traveling My life has been passed on the high road Would anything retain you particularly in Paris Nothing but an order from a superior would retain me in Paris Very well Here is a letter which must be taken to its address To its address my lord But it has none In fact the side of the letter opposite the seal was blank I must tell you resumed Mazarin that it is in a double envelope I understand and I am to take off the first one when I have reached a certain place Just so take it and go You have a friend Monsieur du Vallon whom I like much let him accompany you The devil said D Artagnan to himself He knows that we overheard his conversation yesterday and he wants to get us away from Paris Do you hesitate asked Mazarin No my lord and I will set out at once There is one thing only which I must request What is it Speak That your eminence will go at once to the queen What for Merely to say these words I am going to send Monsieur d Artagnan away and I wish him to set out directly I told you said Mazarin that you had seen the queen I had the honor of saying to your eminence that there had been some mistake What is the meaning of that May I venture to repeat my prayer to your eminence Very well I will go Wait here for me And looking attentively around him to see if he had left any of his keys in his closets Mazarin went out Ten minutes elapsed during which D Artagnan made every effort to read through the first envelope what was written on the second But he did not succeed Mazarin returned pale and evidently thoughtful He seated himself at his desk and D Artagnan proceeded to examine his face as he had just examined the letter he held but the envelope which covered his countenance appeared as impenetrable as that which covered the letter Ah thought the Gascon he looks displeased Can it be with me He meditates Is it about sending me to the Bastile All very fine my lord but at the very first hint you give of such a thing I will strangle you and become Frondist I should be carried home in triumph like Monsieur Broussel and Athos would proclaim me the French Brutus It would be exceedingly droll The Gascon with his vivid imagination had already seen the advantage to be derived from his situation Mazarin gave however no order of the kind but on the contrary began to be insinuating You were right he said my dear Monsieur d Artagnan and you cannot set out yet I beg you to return me that dispatch D Artagnan obeyed and Mazarin ascertained that the seal was intact I shall want you this evening he said Return in two hours My lord said D Artagnan I have an appointment in two hours which I cannot miss Do not be uneasy said Mazarin it is the same Good thought D Artagnan I fancied it was so Return then at five o clock and bring that worthy Monsieur du Vallon with you Only leave him in the ante room as I wish to speak to you alone D Artagnan bowed and thought Both at the same hour both commands alike both at the Palais Royal Monsieur de Gondy would pay a hundred thousand francs for such a secret You are thoughtful said Mazarin uneasily Yes I was thinking whether we ought to come armed or not Armed to the teeth replied Mazarin Very well my lord it shall be so D Artagnan saluted went out and hastened to repeat to his friend Mazarin s flattering promises which gave Porthos an indescribable happiness fifty one The Flight When D Artagnan returned to the Palais Royal at five o clock it presented in spite of the excitement which reigned in the town a spectacle of the greatest rejoicing Nor was that surprising The queen had restored Broussel and Blancmesnil to the people and had therefore nothing to fear since the people had nothing more just then to ask for The return also of the conqueror of Lens was the pretext for giving a grand banquet The princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the court since noon then after dinner the queen was to have a play in her apartment Anne of Austria had never appeared more brilliant than on that day radiant with grace and wit Mazarin disappeared as they rose from table He found D Artagnan waiting for him already at his post in the ante room The cardinal advanced to him with a smile and taking him by the hand led him into his study My dear M d Artagnan said the minister sitting down I am about to give you the greatest proof of confidence that a minister can give an officer I hope said D Artagnan bowing that you give it my lord without hesitation and with the conviction that I am worthy of it More worthy than any one in Paris my dear friend therefore I apply to you We are about to leave this evening continued Mazarin My dear M d Artagnan the welfare of the state is deposited in your hands He paused Explain yourself my lord I am listening The queen has resolved to make a little excursion with the king to Saint Germain Aha said D Artagnan that is to say the queen wishes to leave Paris A woman s caprice you understand Yes I understand perfectly said D Artagnan It was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to return at five o clock Was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that I would mention the appointment to no one muttered D Artagnan Oh women women whether queens or not they are always the same Do you disapprove of this journey my dear M d Artagnan asked Mazarin anxiously I my lord said D Artagnan why should I Because you shrug your shoulders It is a way I have of speaking to myself I neither approve nor disapprove my lord I merely await your commands Good it is you accordingly that I have pitched upon to conduct the king and the queen to Saint Germain Liar thought D Artagnan You see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving D Artagnan s composure that as I have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your hands Yes my lord and I feel the whole responsibility of such a charge You accept however I always accept Do you think the thing possible Everything is possible Shall you be attacked on the road Probably And what will you do in that case I shall pass through those who attack me And suppose you cannot pass through them So much the worse for them I shall pass over them And you will place the king and queen in safety also at Saint Germain Yes On your life On my life You are a hero my friend said Mazarin gazing at the musketeer with admiration D Artagnan smiled And I asked Mazarin after a moment s silence How and you my lord If I wish to leave That would be much more difficult Why so Your eminence might be recognized Even under this disguise asked Mazarin raising a cloak which covered an arm chair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearl gray and red entirely embroidered with silver If your eminence is disguised it will be almost easy Ah said Mazarin breathing more freely But it will be necessary for your eminence to do what the other day you declared you should have done in our place cry Down with Mazarin I will Down with Mazarin In French in good French my lord take care of your accent they killed six thousand Angevins in Sicily because they pronounced Italian badly Take care that the French do not take their revenge on you for the Sicilian vespers I will do my best The streets are full of armed men continued D Artagnan Are you sure that no one is aware of the queen s project Mazarin reflected This affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor my lord the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for everything Mazarin shuddered but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn first And therefore added he quietly I have not confidence in every one the proof of which is that I have fixed upon you to escort me Shall you not go with the queen No replied Mazarin Then you will start after the queen No said Mazarin again Ah said D Artagnan who began to understand Yes continued the cardinal I have my plan With the queen I double her risk after the queen her departure would double mine then the court once safe I might be forgotten The great are often ungrateful Very true said D Artagnan fixing his eyes in spite of himself on the queen s diamond which Mazarin wore on his finger Mazarin followed the direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the ring inside I wish he said with his cunning smile to prevent them from being ungrateful to me It is but Christian charity replied D Artagnan not to lead one s neighbors into temptation It is exactly for that reason said Mazarin that I wish to start before them D Artagnan smiled he was just the man to understand the astute Italian Mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment You will begin therefore by taking me first out of Paris will you not my dear M d Artagnan A difficult commission my lord replied D Artagnan resuming his serious manner But said Mazarin you did not make so many difficulties with regard to the king and queen The king and the queen are my king and queen replied the musketeer my life is theirs and I must give it for them If they ask it what have I to say That is true murmured Mazarin in a low tone but as thy life is not mine I suppose I must buy it must I not and sighing deeply he began to turn the hoop of his ring outside again D Artagnan smiled These two men met at one point and that was cunning had they been actuated equally by courage the one would have done great things for the other But also said Mazarin you must understand that if I ask this service from you it is with the intention of being grateful Is it still only an intention your eminence asked D Artagnan Stay said Mazarin drawing the ring from his finger my dear D Artagnan there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly it is but just it should return to you take it I pray D Artagnan spared Mazarin the trouble of insisting and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable pleasure I valued it much said Mazarin giving a last look at it nevertheless I give it to you with great pleasure And I my lord said D Artagnan accept it as it is given Come let us speak of your little affairs You wish to leave before everybody and at what hour At ten o clock And the queen at what time is it her wish to start At midnight Then it is possible I can get you out of Paris and leave you beyond the barriere and can return for her Capital but how will you get me out of Paris Oh as to that you must leave it to me I give you absolute power therefore take as large an escort as you like D Artagnan shook his head It seems to me however said Mazarin the safest method Yes for you my lord but not for the queen you must leave it to me and give me the entire direction of the undertaking Nevertheless Or find some one else continued D Artagnan turning his back Oh muttered Mazarin I do believe he is going off with the diamond M d Artagnan my dear M d Artagnan he called out in a coaxing voice will you answer for everything I will answer for nothing I will do my best Well then let us go I must trust to you It is very fortunate said D Artagnan to himself You will be here at half past nine And I shall find your eminence ready Certainly quite ready Well then it is a settled thing and now my lord will you obtain for me an audience with the queen For what purpose I wish to receive her majesty s commands from her own lips She desired me to give them to you She may have forgotten something You really wish to see her It is indispensable my lord Mazarin hesitated for one instant but D Artagnan was firm Come then said the minister I will conduct you to her but remember not one word of our conversation What has passed between us concerns ourselves alone my lord replied D Artagnan Swear to be mute I never swear my lord I say yes or no and as I am a gentleman I keep my word Come then I see that I must trust unreservedly to you Believe me my lord it will be your best plan Come said Mazarin conducting D Artagnan into the queen s oratory and desiring him to wait there He did not wait long for in five minutes the queen entered in full gala costume Thus dressed she scarcely appeared thirty five years of age She was still exceedingly handsome It is you Monsieur D Artagnan she said smiling graciously I thank you for having insisted on seeing me I ought to ask your majesty s pardon but I wished to receive your commands from your own mouth Do you accept the commission which I have intrusted to you With gratitude Very well be here at midnight I will not fail Monsieur d Artagnan continued the queen I know your disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a moment but I swear to you that I shall not forget this second service as I forgot the first Your majesty is free to forget or to remember as it pleases you and I know not what you mean said D Artagnan bowing Go sir said the queen with her most bewitching smile go and return at midnight And D Artagnan retired but as he passed out he glanced at the curtain through which the queen had entered and at the bottom of the tapestry he remarked the tip of a velvet slipper Good thought he Mazarin has been listening to discover whether I betrayed him In truth that Italian puppet does not deserve the services of an honest man D Artagnan was not less exact to his appointment and at half past nine o clock he entered the ante room He found the cardinal dressed as an officer and he looked very well in that costume which as we have already said he wore elegantly only he was very pale and trembled slightly Quite alone he asked Yes my lord And that worthy Monsieur du Vallon are we not to enjoy his society Certainly my lord he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the garden of the Palais Royal And we start in his carriage then Yes my lord And with us no other escort but you two Is it not enough One of us would suffice Really my dear Monsieur d Artagnan said the cardinal your coolness startles me I should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with confidence And Bernouin do I not take him with me There is no room for him he will rejoin your eminence Let us go said Mazarin since everything must be done as you wish My lord there is time to draw back said D Artagnan and your eminence is perfectly free Not at all not at all said Mazarin let us be off And so they descended the private stair Mazarin leaning on the arm of D Artagnan a hand the musketeer felt trembling At last after crossing the courts of the Palais Royal where there still remained some of the conveyances of late guests they entered the garden and reached the little gate Mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from his pocket but with such shaking fingers that he could not find the keyhole Give it to me said D Artagnan who when the gate was open deposited the key in his pocket reckoning upon returning by that gate The steps were already down and the door open Mousqueton stood at the door and Porthos was inside the carriage Mount my lord said D Artagnan to Mazarin who sprang into the carriage without waiting for a second bidding D Artagnan followed him and Mousqueton having closed the door mounted behind the carriage with many groans He had made some difficulties about going under pretext that he still suffered from his wound but D Artagnan had said to him Remain if you like my dear Monsieur Mouston but I warn you that Paris will be burnt down to night upon which Mousqueton had declared without asking anything further that he was ready to follow his master and Monsieur d Artagnan to the end of the world The carriage started at a measured pace without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a hurry The cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around him On his left was Porthos whilst D Artagnan was on his right each guarded a door and served as a rampart to him on either side Before him on the front seat lay two pairs of pistols one in front of Porthos and the other of D Artagnan About a hundred paces from the Palais Royal a patrol stopped the carriage Who goes asked the captain Mazarin replied D Artagnan bursting into a laugh The cardinal s hair stood on end But the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens who seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed would never have believed in the possibility of so great an imprudence A good journey to ye they cried allowing it to pass Hem said D Artagnan what does my lord think of that reply Man of talent cried Mazarin In truth said Porthos I understand but now About the middle of the Rue des Petits Champs they were stopped by a second patrol Who goes there inquired the captain of the patrol Keep back my lord said D Artagnan And Mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared completely hidden between them Who goes there cried the same voice impatiently whilst D Artagnan perceived that they had rushed to the horses heads But putting his head out of the carriage Eh Planchet said he The chief approached and it was indeed Planchet D Artagnan had recognized the voice of his old servant How sir said Planchet is it you Eh mon Dieu yes my good friend this worthy Porthos has just received a sword wound and I am taking him to his country house at Saint Cloud Oh really said Planchet Porthos said D Artagnan if you can still speak say a word my dear Porthos to this good Planchet Planchet my friend said Porthos in a melancholy voice I am very ill should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to me Oh good Heaven said Planchet what a misfortune and how did it happen I will tell you all about it replied Mousqueton Porthos uttered a deep groan Make way for us Planchet said D Artagnan in a whisper to him or he will not arrive alive the lungs are attacked my friend Planchet shook his head with the air of a man who says In that case things look ill Then he exclaimed turning to his men Let them pass they are friends The carriage resumed its course and Mazarin who had held his breath ventured to breathe again Bricconi muttered he A few steps in advance of the gate of Saint Honore they met a third troop this latter party was composed of ill looking fellows who resembled bandits more than anything else they were the men of the beggar of Saint Eustache Attention Porthos cried D Artagnan Porthos placed his hand on the pistols What is it asked Mazarin My lord I think we are in bad company A man advanced to the door with a kind of scythe in his hand Qui vive he asked Eh rascal said D Artagnan do you not recognize his highness the prince s carriage Prince or not said the man open We are here to guard the gate and no one whom we do not know shall pass What is to be done said Porthos Pardieu pass replied D Artagnan But how asked Mazarin Through or over coachman gallop on The coachman raised his whip Not a step further said the man who appeared to be the captain or I will hamstring your horses Peste said Porthos it would be a pity animals which cost me a hundred pistoles each I will pay you two hundred for them said Mazarin Yes but when once they are hamstrung our necks will be strung next If one of them comes to my side asked Porthos must I kill him Yes by a blow of your fist if you can we will not fire but at the last extremity I can do it said Porthos Come and open then cried D Artagnan to the man with the scythe taking one of the pistols up by the muzzle and preparing to strike with the handle And as the man approached D Artagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by a lantern Without doubt he recognized D Artagnan for he became deadly pale doubtless the musketeer knew him for his hair stood up on his head Monsieur d Artagnan he cried falling back a step it is Monsieur d Artagnan let him pass D Artagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was heard The noise was caused by Porthos who had just knocked down his man D Artagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces off Sdeath cried he to the coachman Spur your horses whip get on The coachman bestowed a heavy blow of the whip upon his horses the noble animals bounded forward then cries of men who were knocked down were heard then a double concussion was felt and two of the wheels seemed to pass over a round and flexible body There was a moment s silence then the carriage cleared the gate To Cours la Reine cried D Artagnan to the coachman then turning to Mazarin he said Now my lord you can say five paters and five aves in thanks to Heaven for your deliverance You are safe you are free Mazarin replied only by a groan he could not believe in such a miracle Five minutes later the carriage stopped having reached Cours la Reine Is my lord pleased with his escort asked D Artagnan Enchanted monsieur said Mazarin venturing his head out of one of the windows and now do as much for the queen It will not be so difficult replied D Artagnan springing to the ground Monsieur du Vallon I commend his eminence to your care Be quite at ease said Porthos holding out his hand which D Artagnan took and shook in his Oh cried Porthos as if in pain D Artagnan looked with surprise at his friend What is the matter then he asked I think I have sprained my wrist said Porthos The devil why you strike like a blind or a deaf man It was necessary my man was going to fire a pistol at me but you how did you get rid of yours Oh mine replied D Artagnan was not a man What was it then It was an apparition And I charmed it away Without further explanation D Artagnan took the pistols which were upon the front seat placed them in his belt wrapped himself in his cloak and not wishing to enter by the same gate as that through which they had left he took his way toward the Richelieu gate fifty two The Carriage of Monsieur le Coadjuteur Instead of returning then by the Saint Honore gate D Artagnan who had time before him walked around and re entered by the Porte Richelieu He was approached to be examined and when it was discovered by his plumed hat and his laced coat that he was an officer of the musketeers he was surrounded with the intention of making him cry Down with Mazarin The demonstration did not fail to make him uneasy at first but when he discovered what it meant he shouted it in such a voice that even the most exacting were satisfied He walked down the Rue Richelieu meditating how he should carry off the queen in her turn for to take her in a carriage bearing the arms of France was not to be thought of when he perceived an equipage standing at the door of the hotel belonging to Madame de Guemenee He was struck by a sudden idea Ah pardieu he exclaimed that would be fair play And approaching the carriage he examined the arms on the panels and the livery of the coachman on his box This scrutiny was so much the more easy the coachman being sound asleep It is in truth monsieur le coadjuteur s carriage said D Artagnan upon my honor I begin to think that Heaven favors us He mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachman s little finger To the Palais Royal he called out The coachman awoke with a start and drove off in the direction he was desired never doubting but that the order had come from his master The porter at the palace was about to close the gates but seeing such a handsome equipage he fancied that it was some visit of importance and the carriage was allowed to pass and to stop beneath the porch It was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back and without dropping the reins he sprang from his box to open the door D Artagnan in his turn sprang to the ground and just at the moment when the coachman alarmed at not seeing his master fell back a step he seized him by his collar with the left whilst with the right hand he placed the muzzle of a pistol at his breast Pronounce one single word muttered D Artagnan and you are a dead man The coachman perceived at once by the expression of the man who thus addressed him that he had fallen into a trap and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring Two musketeers were pacing the court to whom D Artagnan called by their names Monsieur de Belliere said he to one of them do me the favor to take the reins from the hands of this worthy man mount upon the box and drive to the door of the private stair and wait for me there it is an affair of importance on the service of the king The musketeer who knew that his lieutenant was incapable of jesting with regard to the service obeyed without a word although he thought the order strange Then turning toward the second musketeer D Artagnan said Monsieur du Verger help me to place this man in a place of safety The musketeer thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise bowed and drawing his sword signified that he was ready D Artagnan mounted the staircase followed by his prisoner who in his turn was followed by the soldier and entered Mazarin s ante room Bernouin was waiting there impatient for news of his master Well sir he said Everything goes on capitally my dear Monsieur Bernouin but here is a man whom I must beg you to put in a safe place Where then sir Where you like provided that the place which you shall choose has iron shutters secured by padlocks and a door that can be locked We have that sir replied Bernouin and the poor coachman was conducted to a closet the windows of which were barred and which looked very much like a prison And now my good friend said D Artagnan to him I must invite you to deprive yourself for my sake of your hat and cloak The coachman as we can well understand made no resistance in fact he was so astonished at what had happened to him that he stammered and reeled like a drunken man D Artagnan deposited his clothes under the arm of one of the valets And now Monsieur du Verger he said shut yourself up with this man until Monsieur Bernouin returns to open the door The duty will be tolerably long and not very amusing I know but added he seriously you understand it is on the king s service At your command lieutenant replied the musketeer who saw the business was a serious one By the bye continued D Artagnan should this man attempt to fly or to call out pass your sword through his body The musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter and D Artagnan went out followed by Bernouin Midnight struck Lead me into the queen s oratory said D Artagnan announce to her I am here and put this parcel with a well loaded musket under the seat of the carriage which is waiting at the foot of the private stair Bernouin conducted D Artagnan to the oratory where he sat down pensively Everything had gone on as usual at the Palais Royal As we said before by ten o clock almost all the guests had dispersed those who were to fly with the court had the word of command and they were each severally desired to be from twelve o clock to one at Cours la Reine At ten o clock Anne of Austria had entered the king s room Monsieur had just retired and the youthful Louis remaining the last was amusing himself by placing some lead soldiers in a line of battle a game which delighted him much Two royal pages were playing with him Laporte said the queen it is time for his majesty to go to bed The king asked to remain up having he said no wish to sleep but the queen was firm Are you not going to morrow morning at six o clock Louis to bathe at Conflans I think you wished to do so of your own accord You are right madame said the king and I am ready to retire to my room when you have kissed me Laporte give the light to Monsieur the Chevalier de Coislin The queen touched with her lips the white smooth brow the royal child presented to her with a gravity which already partook of etiquette Go to sleep soon Louis said the queen for you must be awakened very early I will do my best to obey you madame said the youthful king but I have no inclination to sleep Laporte said Anne of Austria in an undertone find some very dull book to read to his majesty but do not undress yourself The king went out accompanied by the Chevalier de Coislin bearing the candlestick and then the queen returned to her own apartment Her ladies that is to say Madame de Bregy Mademoiselle de Beaumont Madame de Motteville and Socratine her sister so called on account of her sense had just brought into her dressing room the remains of the dinner on which according to her usual custom she supped The queen then gave her orders spoke of a banquet which the Marquis de Villequier was to give to her on the day after the morrow indicated the persons she would admit to the honor of partaking of it announced another visit on the following day to Val de Grace where she intended to pay her devotions and gave her commands to her senior valet to accompany her When the ladies had finished their supper the queen feigned extreme fatigue and passed into her bedroom Madame de Motteville who was on especial duty that evening followed to aid and undress her The queen then began to read and after conversing with her affectionately for a few minutes dismissed her It was at this moment D Artagnan entered the courtyard of the palace in the coadjutor s carriage and a few seconds later the carriages of the ladies in waiting drove out and the gates were shut after them A few minutes after twelve o clock Bernouin knocked at the queen s bedroom door having come by the cardinal s secret corridor Anne of Austria opened the door to him herself She was dressed that is to say in dishabille wrapped in a long warm dressing gown It is you Bernouin she said Is Monsieur d Artagnan there Yes madame in your oratory He is waiting till your majesty is ready I am Go and tell Laporte to wake and dress the king and then pass on to the Marechal de Villeroy and summon him to me Bernouin bowed and retired The queen entered her oratory which was lighted by a single lamp of Venetian crystal She saw D Artagnan who stood expecting her Is it you she said Yes madame Are you ready I am And his eminence the cardinal Has got off without any accident He is awaiting your majesty at Cours la Reine But in what carriage do we start I have provided for everything a carriage below is waiting for your majesty Let us go to the king D Artagnan bowed and followed the queen The young Louis was already dressed with the exception of his shoes and doublet he had allowed himself to be dressed in great astonishment overwhelming Laporte with questions who replied only in these words Sire it is by the queen s commands The bedclothes were thrown back exposing the king s bed linen which was so worn that here and there holes could be seen It was one of the results of Mazarin s niggardliness The queen entered and D Artagnan remained at the door As soon as the child perceived the queen he escaped from Laporte and ran to meet her Anne then motioned to D Artagnan to approach and he obeyed My son said Anne of Austria pointing to the musketeer calm standing uncovered here is Monsieur d Artagnan who is as brave as one of those ancient heroes of whom you like so much to hear from my women Remember his name well and look at him well that his face may not be forgotten for this evening he is going to render us a great service The young king looked at the officer with his large formed eye and repeated Monsieur d Artagnan That is it my son The young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out to the musketeer the latter bent on his knee and kissed it Monsieur d Artagnan repeated Louis very well madame At this moment they were startled by a noise as if a tumult were approaching What is that exclaimed the queen Oh oh replied D Artagnan straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance it is the murmur of the populace in revolution We must fly said the queen Your majesty has given me the control of this business we had better wait and see what they want Monsieur d Artagnan I will answer for everything Nothing is so catching as confidence The queen full of energy and courage was quickly alive to these two virtues in others Do as you like she said I rely upon you Will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this business Command sir What do the people want this time demanded the king We are about to ascertain sire replied D Artagnan as he rapidly left the room The tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the Palais Royal entirely Cries were heard from the interior of which they could not comprehend the sense It was evident that there was clamor and sedition The king half dressed the queen and Laporte remained each in the same state and almost in the same place where they were listening and waiting Comminges who was on guard that night at the Palais Royal ran in He had about two hundred men in the courtyards and stables and he placed them at the queen s disposal Well asked Anne of Austria when D Artagnan reappeared what does it mean It means madame that the report has spread that the queen has left the Palais Royal carrying off the king and the people ask to have proof to the contrary or threaten to demolish the Palais Royal Oh this time it is too much exclaimed the queen and I will prove to them I have not left D Artagnan saw from the expression of the queen s face that she was about to issue some violent command He approached her and said in a low voice Has your majesty still confidence in me This voice startled her Yes sir she replied every confidence speak Will the queen deign to follow my advice Speak Let your majesty dismiss M de Comminges and desire him to shut himself up with his men in the guardhouse and in the stables Comminges glanced at D Artagnan with the envious look with which every courtier sees a new favorite spring up You hear Comminges said the queen D Artagnan went up to him with his usual quickness he caught the anxious glance Monsieur de Comminges he said pardon me we both are servants of the queen are we not It is my turn to be of use to her do not envy me this happiness Comminges bowed and left Come said D Artagnan to himself I have got one more enemy And now said the queen addressing D Artagnan what is to be done for you hear that instead of becoming calmer the noise increases Madame said D Artagnan the people want to see the king and they must see him What must see him Where on the balcony Not at all madame but here sleeping in his bed Oh your majesty exclaimed Laporte Monsieur d Artagnan is right The queen became thoughtful and smiled like a woman to whom duplicity is no stranger Without doubt she murmured Monsieur Laporte said D Artagnan go and announce to the people through the grating that they are going to be satisfied and that in five minutes they shall not only see the king but they shall see him in bed add that the king sleeps and that the queen begs that they will keep silence so as not to awaken him But not every one a deputation of two or four people Every one madame But reflect they will keep us here till daybreak It shall take but a quarter of an hour I answer for everything madame believe me I know the people they are like a great child who only wants humoring Before the sleeping king they will be mute gentle and timid as lambs Go Laporte said the queen The young king approached his mother and said Why do as these people ask It must be so my son said Anne of Austria But if they say it must be to me am I no longer king The queen remained silent Sire said D Artagnan will your majesty permit me to ask you a question Louis XIV turned around astonished that any one should dare to address him But the queen pressed the child s hand Yes sir he said Does your majesty remember when playing in the park of Fontainebleau or in the palace courts at Versailles ever to have seen the sky grow suddenly dark and heard the sound of thunder Yes certainly Well then this noise of thunder however much your majesty may have wished to continue playing has said go in sire You must do so Certainly sir but they tell me that the noise of thunder is the voice of God Well then sire continued D Artagnan listen to the noise of the people you will perceive that it resembles that of thunder In truth at that moment a terrible murmur was wafted to them by the night breeze then all at once it ceased Hold sire said D Artagnan they have just told the people that you are asleep you see you still are king The queen looked with surprise at this strange man whose brilliant courage made him the equal of the bravest and who was by his fine and quick intelligence the equal of the most astute Laporte entered Well Laporte asked the queen Madame he replied Monsieur d Artagnan s prediction has been accomplished they are calm as if by enchantment The doors are about to be opened and in five minutes they will be here Laporte said the queen suppose you put one of your sons in the king s place we might be off during the time If your majesty desires it said Laporte my sons like myself are at the queen s service Not at all said D Artagnan should one of them know his majesty and discover but a substitute all would be lost You are right sir always right said Anne of Austria Laporte place the king in bed Laporte placed the king dressed as he was in the bed and then covered him as far as the shoulders with the sheet The queen bent over him and kissed his brow Pretend to sleep Louis said she Yes said the king but I do not wish to be touched by any of those men Sire I am here said D Artagnan and I give you my word that if a single man has the audacity his life shall pay for it And now what is to be done asked the queen for I hear them Monsieur Laporte go to them and again recommend silence Madame wait at the door whilst I shall be at the head of the king s bed ready to die for him Laporte went out the queen remained standing near the hangings whilst D Artagnan glided behind the curtains Then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard and the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her lips On seeing the queen the men stopped short respectfully Enter gentlemen enter said the queen There was then amongst that crowd a moment s hesitation which looked like shame They had expected resistance they had expected to be thwarted to have to force the gates to overturn the guards The gates had opened of themselves and the king ostensibly at least had no other guard at his bed head but his mother The foremost of them stammered and attempted to fall back Enter gentlemen said Laporte since the queen desires you so to do Then one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door and to advance on tiptoe This example was imitated by the rest until the room filled silently as if these men had been the humblest most devoted courtiers Far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be seen all craning to their utmost height to try and see D Artagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the curtain and in the very first man who entered he recognized Planchet Sir said the queen to him thinking he was the leader of the band you wished to see the king and therefore I determined to show him to you myself Approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to run away No certainly replied Planchet rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon him You will say then to my good and faithful Parisians continued Anne with a smile the expression of which did not deceive D Artagnan that you have seen the king in bed asleep and the queen also ready to retire I shall tell them madame and those who accompany me will say the same thing but But what asked Anne of Austria Will your majesty pardon me said Planchet but is it really the king who is lying there Anne of Austria started If she said there is one among you who knows the king let him approach and say whether it is really his majesty lying there A man wrapped in a cloak in the folds of which his face was hidden approached and leaned over the bed and looked For one second D Artagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and D Artagnan recognized the coadjutor It is certainly the king said the man rising again God bless his majesty Yes repeated the leader in a whisper God bless his majesty and all these men who had entered enraged passed from anger to pity and blessed the royal infant in their turn Now said Planchet let us thank the queen My friends retire They all bowed and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had entered Planchet who had been the first to enter was the last to leave The queen stopped him What is your name my friend she said Planchet much surprised at the inquiry turned back Yes continued the queen I think myself as much honored to have received you this evening as if you had been a prince and I wish to know your name Yes thought Planchet to treat me as a prince No thank you D Artagnan trembled lest Planchet seduced like the crow in the fable should tell his name and that the queen knowing his name would discover that Planchet had belonged to him Madame replied Planchet respectfully I am called Dulaurier at your service Thank you Monsieur Dulaurier said the queen and what is your business Madame I am a clothier in the Rue Bourdonnais That is all I wished to know said the queen Much obliged to you Monsieur Dulaurier You will hear again from me Come come thought D Artagnan emerging from behind the curtain decidedly Monsieur Planchet is no fool it is evident he has been brought up in a good school The different actors in this strange scene remained facing one another without uttering a single word the queen standing near the door D Artagnan half out of his hiding place the king raised on his elbow ready to fall down on his bed again at the slightest sound that would indicate the return of the multitude but instead of approaching the noise became more and more distant and very soon it died entirely away The queen breathed more freely D Artagnan wiped his damp forehead and the king slid off his bed saying Let us go At this moment Laporte reappeared Well asked the queen Well madame replied the valet I followed them as far as the gates They announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them and in fact they went away quite proud and happy Oh the miserable wretches murmured the queen they shall pay dearly for their boldness and it is I who promise this Then turning to D Artagnan she said Sir you have given me this evening the best advice I have ever received Continue and say what we must do now Monsieur Laporte said D Artagnan finish dressing his majesty We may go then asked the queen Whenever your majesty pleases You have only to descend by the private stairs and you will find me at the door Go sir said the queen I will follow you D Artagnan went down and found the carriage at its post and the musketeer on the box D Artagnan took out the parcel which he had desired Bernouin to place under the seat It may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to Monsieur de Gondy s coachman He placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head whilst the musketeer got off the box Sir said D Artagnan you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coachman You must mount your horse and proceed to the Rue Tiquetonne Hotel de la Chevrette whence you will take my horse and that of Monsieur du Vallon which you must saddle and equip as if for war and then you will leave Paris bringing them with you to Cours la Reine If when you arrive at Cours la Reine you find no one you must go on to Saint Germain On the king s service The musketeer touched his cap and went away to execute the orders thus received D Artagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him The queen appeared and was followed by the king and the Duke d Anjou his brother Monsieur the coadjutor s carriage she exclaimed falling back Yes madame said D Artagnan but get in fearlessly for I myself will drive you The queen uttered a cry of surprise and entered the carriage and the king and monsieur took their places at her side Come Laporte said the queen How madame said the valet in the same carriage as your majesties It is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening but of the king s safety Get in Laporte Laporte obeyed Pull down the blinds said D Artagnan But will that not excite suspicion sir asked the queen Your majesty s mind may be quite at ease replied the officer I have my answer ready The blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the Rue Richelieu On reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the head of a dozen men holding a lantern in his hand D Artagnan signed to them to draw near Do you recognize the carriage he asked the sergeant No replied the latter Look at the arms The sergeant put the lantern near the panel They are those of monsieur le coadjuteur he said Hush he is enjoying a ride with Madame de Guemenee The sergeant began to laugh Open the gate he cried I know who it is Then putting his face to the lowered blinds he said I wish you joy my lord Impudent fellow cried D Artagnan you will get me turned off The gate groaned on its hinges and D Artagnan seeing the way clear whipped his horses who started at a canter and five minutes later they had rejoined the cardinal Mousqueton exclaimed D Artagnan draw up the blinds of his majesty s carriage It is he cried Porthos Disguised as a coachman exclaimed Mazarin And driving the coadjutor s carriage said the queen Corpo di Dio Monsieur d Artagnan said Mazarin you are worth your weight in gold fifty three How D Artagnan and Porthos earned by selling Straw Mazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for Saint Germain but the queen declared that she should wait for the people whom she had appointed to meet her However she offered the cardinal Laporte s place which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other It was not without foundation that a report of the king s intention to leave Paris by night had been circulated Ten or twelve persons had been in the secret since six o clock and howsoever great their prudence might be they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure without suspicion being generated Besides each individual had one or two others for whom he was interested and as there could be no doubt but that the queen was leaving Paris full of terrible projects of vengeance every one had warned parents and friends of what was about to transpire so that the news of the approaching exit ran like a train of lighted gunpowder along the streets The first carriage which arrived after that of the queen was that of the Prince de Conde with the princess and dowager princess Both these ladies had been awakened in the middle of the night and did not know what it all was about The second contained the Duke and Duchess of Orleans the tall young Mademoiselle and the Abbe de la Riviere and the third the Duke de Longueville and the Prince de Conti brother and brother in law of Conde They all alighted and hastened to pay their respects to the king and queen in their coach The queen fixed her eyes upon the carriage they had left and seeing that it was empty she said But where is Madame de Longueville Ah yes where is my sister asked the prince Madame de Longueville is ill said the duke and she desired me to excuse her to your majesty Anne gave a quick glance to Mazarin who answered by an almost imperceptible shake of his head What do you say of this asked the queen I say that she is a hostage for the Parisians answered the cardinal Why is she not come asked the prince in a low voice addressing his brother Silence whispered the duke she has her reasons She will ruin us returned the prince She will save us said Conti Carriages now arrived in crowds those of the Marechal de Villeroy Guitant Villequier and Comminges came into the line The two musketeers arrived in their turn holding the horses of D Artagnan and Porthos in their hands These two instantly mounted the coachman of the latter replacing D Artagnan on the coach box of the royal coach Mousqueton took the place of the coachman and drove standing for reasons known to himself like Automedon of antiquity The queen though occupied by a thousand details tried to catch the Gascon s eye but he with his wonted prudence had mingled with the crowd Let us be the avant guard said he to Porthos and find good quarters at Saint Germain nobody will think of us and for my part I am greatly fatigued As for me replied Porthos I am falling asleep which is strange considering we have not had any fighting truly the Parisians are idiots Or rather we are very clever said D Artagnan Perhaps And how is your wrist Better but do you think that we ve got them this time Got what You your command and I my title I faith yes I should expect so besides if they forget I shall take the liberty of reminding them The queen s voice she is speaking said Porthos I think she wants to ride on horseback Oh she would like it but But what The cardinal won t allow it Gentlemen he said addressing the two musketeers accompany the royal carriage we are going forward to look for lodgings D Artagnan started off for Saint Germain followed by Porthos We will go on gentlemen said the queen And the royal carriage drove on followed by the other coaches and about fifty horsemen They reached Saint German without any accident on descending the queen found the prince awaiting her bare headed to offer her his hand What an awakening for the Parisians said the queen radiant It is war said the prince Well then let it be war Have we not on our side the conqueror of Rocroy of Nordlingen of Lens The prince bowed low It was then three o clock in the morning The queen walked first every one followed her About two hundred persons had accompanied her in her flight Gentlemen said the queen laughing pray take up your abode in the chateau it is large and there will be no want of room for you all but as we never thought of coming here I am informed that there are in all only three beds in the whole establishment one for the king one for me And one for the cardinal muttered the prince Am I am I then to sleep on the floor asked Gaston d Orleans with a forced smile No my prince replied Mazarin the third bed is intended for your highness But your eminence replied the prince I answered Mazarin I shall not sleep at all I have work to do Gaston desired that he should be shown into the room wherein he was to sleep without in the least concerning himself as to where his wife and daughter were to repose Well for my part I shall go to bed said D Artagnan come Porthos Porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his friend They walked from one end of the chateau to the other Porthos looking with wondering eyes at D Artagnan who was counting on his fingers Four hundred at a pistole each four hundred pistoles Yes interposed Porthos four hundred pistoles but who is to make four hundred pistoles A pistole is not enough said D Artagnan tis worth a louis What is worth a louis Four hundred at a louis each make four hundred louis Four hundred said Porthos Yes there are two hundred of them and each of them will need two which will make four hundred But four hundred what Listen cried D Artagnan But as there were all kinds of people about who were in a state of stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court he whispered in his friend s ear I understand answered Porthos I understand you perfectly on my honor two hundred louis each of us would be making a pretty thing of it but what will people say Let them say what they will besides how will they know that we are doing it But who will distribute these things asked Porthos Isn t Mousqueton there But he wears my livery my livery will be known replied Porthos He can turn his coat inside out You are always in the right my dear friend cried Porthos but where the devil do you discover all the notions you put into practice D Artagnan smiled The two friends turned down the first street they came to Porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right whilst D Artagnan knocked at the door of a house to the left Some straw they said Sir we don t keep any was the reply of the people who opened the doors but please ask at the hay dealer s Where is the hay dealer s At the last large door in the street Are there any other people in Saint Germain who sell straw Yes there s the landlord of the Lamb and Gros Louis the farmer they both live in the Rue des Ursulines Very well D Artagnan went instantly to the hay dealer and bargained with him for a hundred and fifty trusses of straw which he obtained at the rate of three pistoles each He went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same price Finally Farmer Louis sold them eighty trusses making in all four hundred and thirty There was no more to be had in Saint Germain This foraging did not occupy more than half an hour Mousqueton duly instructed was put at the head of this sudden and new business He was cautioned not to let a bit of straw out of his hands under a louis the truss and they intrusted to him straw to the amount of four hundred and thirty louis D Artagnan taking with him three trusses of straw returned to the chateau where everybody freezing with cold and more than half asleep envied the king the queen and the Duke of Orleans on their camp beds The lieutenant s entrance produced a burst of laughter in the great drawing room but he did not appear to notice that he was the object of general attention but began to arrange with so much cleverness nicety and gayety his straw bed that the mouths of all these poor creatures who could not go to sleep began to water Straw they all cried out straw where is there any to be found I can show you answered the Gascon And he conducted them to Mousqueton who freely distributed the trusses at the rate of a louis apiece It was thought rather dear but people wanted to sleep and who would not give even two or three louis for a few hours of sound sleep D Artagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it making it over about a dozen times and since he was supposed to have paid like the others a louis for his truss of straw he pocketed in that way thirty louis in less than half an hour At five o clock in the morning the straw was worth eighty francs a truss and there was no more to be had D Artagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own use He put in his pocket the key of the room where he had hidden them and accompanied by Porthos returned to settle with Mousqueton who naively and like the worthy steward that he was handed them four hundred and thirty louis and kept one hundred for himself Mousqueton who knew nothing of what was going on in the chateau wondered that the idea had not occurred to him sooner D Artagnan put the gold in his hat and in going back to the chateau settled the reckoning with Porthos each of them had cleared two hundred and fifteen louis Porthos however found that he had no straw left for himself He returned to Mousqueton but the steward had sold the last wisp He then repaired to D Artagnan who thanks to his four trusses of straw was in the act of making up and tasting by anticipation the luxury of a bed so soft so well stuffed at the head so well covered at the foot that it would have excited the envy of the king himself if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own D Artagnan could on no account consent to pull his bed to pieces again for Porthos but for a consideration of four louis that the latter paid him for it he consented that Porthos should share his couch with him He laid his sword at the head his pistols by his side stretched his cloak over his feet placed his felt hat on the top of his cloak and extended himself luxuriously on the straw which rustled under him He was already enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis made in a quarter of an hour when a voice was heard at the door of the hall which made him stir Monsieur d Artagnan it cried Here cried Porthos here Porthos foresaw that if D Artagnan was called away he should remain the sole possessor of the bed An officer approached I am come to fetch you Monsieur d Artagnan From whom His eminence sent me Tell my lord that I m going to sleep and I advise him as a friend to do the same His eminence is not gone to bed and will not go to bed and wants you instantly The devil take Mazarin who does not know when to sleep at the proper time What does he want with me Is it to make me a captain In that case I will forgive him And the musketeer rose grumbling took his sword hat pistols and cloak and followed the officer whilst Porthos alone and sole possessor of the bed endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep which his predecessor had set him Monsieur d Artagnan said the cardinal on perceiving him I have not forgotten with what zeal you have served me I am going to prove to you that I have not Good thought the Gascon this is a promising beginning Monsieur d Artagnan he resumed do you wish to become a captain Yes my lord And your friend still longs to be made a baron At this very moment my lord he no doubt dreams that he is one already Then said Mazarin taking from his portfolio the letter which he had already shown D Artagnan take this dispatch and carry it to England D Artagnan looked at the envelope there was no address on it Am I not to know to whom to present it You will know when you reach London at London you may tear off the outer envelope And what are my instructions To obey in every particular the man to whom this letter is addressed You must set out for Boulogne At the Royal Arms of England you will find a young gentleman named Mordaunt Yes my lord and what am I to do with this young gentleman Follow wherever he leads you D Artagnan looked at the cardinal with a stupefied air There are your instructions said Mazarin go Go tis easy to say so but that requires money and I haven t any Ah replied Mazarin so you have no money None my lord But the diamond I gave you yesterday I wish to keep it in remembrance of your eminence Mazarin sighed Tis very dear living in England my lord especially as envoy extraordinary Zounds replied Mazarin the people there are very sedate and their habits since the revolution simple but no matter He opened a drawer and took out a purse What do you say to a thousand crowns D Artagnan pouted out his lower lip in a most extraordinary manner I reply my lord tis but little as certainly I shall not go alone I suppose not Monsieur du Vallon that worthy gentleman for with the exception of yourself Monsieur d Artagnan there s not a man in France that I esteem and love so much as him Then my lord replied D Artagnan pointing to the purse which Mazarin still held if you love and esteem him so much you understand me Be it so on his account I add two hundred crowns Scoundrel muttered D Artagnan But on our return he said aloud may we that is my friend and I depend on having he his barony and I my promotion On the honor of Mazarin I should like another sort of oath better said D Artagnan to himself then aloud May I not offer my duty to her majesty the queen Her majesty is asleep and you must set off directly replied Mazarin go pray sir One word more my lord if there s any fighting where I m going must I fight You are to obey the commands of the personage to whom I have addressed the inclosed letter Tis well said D Artagnan holding out his hand to receive the money I offer my best respects and services to you my lord D Artagnan then returning to the officer said Sir have the kindness also to awaken Monsieur du Vallon and to say tis by his eminence s order and that I shall await him at the stables The officer went off with an eagerness that showed the Gascon that he had some personal interest in the matter Porthos was snoring most musically when some one touched him on the shoulder I come from the cardinal said the officer Heigho said Porthos opening his large eyes what have you got to say That his eminence has ordered you to England and that Monsieur d Artagnan is waiting for you in the stables Porthos sighed heavily arose took his hat his pistols and his cloak and departed casting a look of regret upon the couch where he had hoped to sleep so well No sooner had he turned his back than the officer laid himself down in it and he had scarcely crossed the threshold before his successor in his turn was snoring immoderately It was very natural he being the only person in the whole assemblage except the king the queen and the Duke of Orleans who slept gratuitously fifty four In which we hear Tidings of Aramis D Artagnan went straight to the stables day was just dawning He found his horse and that of Porthos fastened to the manger but to an empty manger He took pity on these poor animals and went to a corner of the stable where he saw a little straw but in doing so he struck his foot against a human body which uttered a cry and arose on its knees rubbing its eyes It was Mousqueton who having no straw to lie upon had helped himself to that of the horses Mousqueton cried D Artagnan let us be off Let us set off Mousqueton recognizing the voice of his master s friend got up suddenly and in doing so let fall some louis which he had appropriated to himself illegally during the night Ho ho exclaimed D Artagnan picking up a louis and displaying it here s a louis that smells confoundedly of straw Mousqueton blushed so confusedly that the Gascon began to laugh at him and said Porthos would be angry my dear Monsieur Mousqueton but I pardon you only let us remember that this gold must serve us as a joke so be gay come along Mousqueton instantly assumed a jovial countenance saddled the horses quickly and mounted his own without making faces over it Whilst this went on Porthos arrived with a very cross look on his face and was astonished to find the lieutenant resigned and Mousqueton almost merry Ah that s it he cried you have your promotion and I my barony We are going to fetch our brevets said D Artagnan and when we come back Master Mazarin will sign them And where are we going asked Porthos To Paris first I have affairs to settle And they both set out for Paris On arriving at its gates they were astounded to see the threatening aspect of the capital Around a broken down carriage the people were uttering imprecations whilst the persons who had attempted to escape were made prisoners that is to say an old man and two women On the other hand as the two friends approached to enter they showed them every kind of civility thinking them deserters from the royal party and wishing to bind them to their own What is the king doing they asked He is asleep And the Spanish woman Dreaming And the cursed Italian He is awake so keep on the watch as they are gone away it s for some purpose rely on it But as you are the strongest after all continued D Artagnan don t be furious with old men and women and keep your wrath for more appropriate occasions The people listened to these words and let go the ladies who thanked D Artagnan with an eloquent look Now onward cried the Gascon And they continued their way crossing the barricades getting the chains about their legs pushed about questioning and questioned In the place of the Palais Royal D Artagnan saw a sergeant who was drilling six or seven hundred citizens It was Planchet who brought into play profitably the recollections of the regiment of Piedmont In passing before D Artagnan he recognized his former master Good day Monsieur d Artagnan said Planchet proudly Good day Monsieur Dulaurier replied D Artagnan Planchet stopped short staring at D Artagnan The first row seeing their sergeant stop stopped in their turn and so on to the very last These citizens are dreadfully ridiculous observed D Artagnan to Porthos and went on his way Five minutes afterward he entered the hotel of La Chevrette where pretty Madeleine the hostess came to him My dear Mistress Turquaine said the Gascon if you happen to have any money lock it up quickly if you happen to have any jewels hide them directly if you happen to have any debtors make them pay you or any creditors don t pay them Why prithee asked Madeleine Because Paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like Babylon of which you have no doubt heard tell And are you going to leave me at such a time This very instant And where are you going Ah if you could tell me that you would be doing me a service Ah me ah me Have you any letters for me inquired D Artagnan wishing to signify to the hostess that her lamentations were superfluous and that therefore she had better spare him demonstrations of her grief There s one just arrived and she handed the letter to D Artagnan From Athos cried D Artagnan recognizing the handwriting Ah said Porthos let us hear what he says D Artagnan opened the letter and read as follows Dear D Artagnan dear Du Vallon my good friends perhaps this may be the last time that you will ever hear from me Aramis and I are very unhappy but God our courage and the remembrance of our friendship sustain us Think often of Raoul I intrust to you certain papers which are at Blois and in two months and a half if you do not hear of us take possession of them Embrace with all your heart the vicomte for your devoted friend ATHOS I believe by Heaven said D Artagnan that I shall embrace him since he s upon our road and if he is so unfortunate as to lose our dear Athos from that very day he becomes my son And I said Porthos shall make him my sole heir Let us see what more does Athos say Should you meet on your journey a certain Monsieur Mordaunt distrust him in a letter I cannot say more Monsieur Mordaunt exclaimed the Gascon surprised Monsieur Mordaunt tis well said Porthos we shall remember that but see there is a postscript from Aramis So there is said D Artagnan and he read We conceal the place where we are dear friends knowing your brotherly affection and that you would come and die with us were we to reveal it Confound it interrupted Porthos with an explosion of passion which sent Mousqueton to the other end of the room are they in danger of dying D Artagnan continued Athos bequeaths to you Raoul and I bequeath to you my revenge If by any good luck you lay your hand on a certain man named Mordaunt tell Porthos to take him into a corner and to wring his neck I dare not say more in a letter ARAMIS If that is all it is easily done said Porthos On the contrary observed D Artagnan with a vexed look it would be impossible How so It is precisely this Monsieur Mordaunt whom we are going to join at Boulogne and with whom we cross to England Well suppose instead of joining this Monsieur Mordaunt we were to go and join our friends said Porthos with a gesture fierce enough to have frightened an army I did think of it but this letter has neither date nor postmark True said Porthos And he began to wander about the room like a man beside himself gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the scabbard As to D Artagnan he remained standing like a man in consternation with the deepest affliction depicted on his face Ah this is not right Athos insults us he wishes to die alone it is bad bad bad Mousqueton witnessing this despair melted into tears in a corner of the room Come said D Artagnan all this leads to nothing Let us go on We will embrace Raoul and perhaps he will have news of Athos Stop an idea cried Porthos indeed my dear D Artagnan I don t know how you manage but you are always full of ideas let us go and embrace Raoul Woe to that man who should happen to contradict my master at this moment said Mousqueton to himself I wouldn t give a farthing for his life They set out On arriving at the Rue Saint Denis the friends found a vast concourse of people It was the Duc de Beaufort who was coming from the Vendomois and whom the coadjutor was showing to the Parisians intoxicated with joy With the duke s aid they already considered themselves invincible The two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the prince and so reached the Saint Denis gate Is it true said the guard to the two cavaliers that the Duc de Beaufort has arrived in Paris Nothing more certain and the best proof of it is said D Artagnan that he has dispatched us to meet the Duc de Vendome his father who is coming in his turn Long live De Beaufort cried the guards and they drew back respectfully to let the two friends pass Once across the barriers these two knew neither fatigue nor fear Their horses flew and they never ceased speaking of Athos and Aramis The camp had entered Saint Omer the friends made a little detour and went to the camp and gave the army an exact account of the flight of the king and queen They found Raoul near his tent reclining on a truss of hay of which his horse stole some mouthfuls the young man s eyes were red and he seemed dejected The Marechal de Grammont and the Comte de Guiche had returned to Paris and he was quite lonely And as soon as he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms Oh is it you dear friends Did you come here to fetch me Will you take me away with you Do you bring me tidings of my guardian Have you not received any said D Artagnan to the youth Alas sir no and I do not know what has become of him so that I am really so unhappy that I weep In fact tears rolled down his cheeks Porthos turned aside in order not to show by his honest round face what was passing in his mind Deuce take it cried D Artagnan more moved than he had been for a long time don t despair my friend if you have not received any letters from the count we have received one Oh really cried Raoul And a comforting one too added D Artagnan seeing the delight that his intelligence gave the young man Have you it asked Raoul Yes that is I had it repined the Gascon making believe to find it Wait it ought to be there in my pocket it speaks of his return does it not Porthos All Gascon as he was D Artagnan could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood Yes replied Porthos coughing Eh give it to me said the young man Eh I read it a little while since Can I have lost it Ah confound it yes my pocket has a hole in it Oh yes Monsieur Raoul said Mousqueton the letter was very consoling These gentlemen read it to me and I wept for joy But at any rate you know where he is Monsieur d Artagnan asked Raoul somewhat comforted Ah that s the thing replied the Gascon Undoubtedly I know it but it is a mystery Not to me I hope No not to you so I am going to tell you where he is Porthos devoured D Artagnan with wondering eyes Where the devil shall I say that he is so that he cannot try to rejoin him thought D Artagnan Well where is he sir asked Raoul in a soft and coaxing voice He is at Constantinople Among the Turks exclaimed Raoul alarmed Good heavens how can you tell me that Does that alarm you cried D Artagnan Pooh what are the Turks to such men as the Comte de la Fere and the Abbe d Herblay Ah his friend is with him said Raoul That comforts me a little Has he wit or not this demon D Artagnan said Porthos astonished at his friend s deception Now sir said D Artagnan wishing to change the conversation here are fifty pistoles that the count has sent you by the same courier I suppose you have no more money and that they will be welcome I have still twenty pistoles sir Well take them that makes seventy And if you wish for more said Porthos putting his hand to his pocket Thank you sir replied Raoul blushing thank you a thousand times At this moment Olivain appeared Apropos said D Artagnan loud enough for the servant to hear him are you satisfied with Olivain Yes in some respects tolerably well Olivain pretended to have heard nothing and entered the tent What fault do you find with the fellow He is a glutton Oh sir cried Olivain reappearing at this accusation And a little bit of a thief Oh sir oh And more especially a notorious coward Oh oh sir you really vilify me cried Olivain The deuce cried D Artagnan Pray learn Monsieur Olivain that people like us are not to be served by cowards Rob your master eat his sweetmeats and drink his wine but by Jove don t be a coward or I shall cut off your ears Look at Monsieur Mouston see the honorable wounds he has received observe how his habitual valor has given dignity to his countenance Mousqueton was in the third heaven and would have embraced D Artagnan had he dared meanwhile he resolved to sacrifice his life for him on the next occasion that presented itself Send away that fellow Raoul said the Gascon for if he s a coward he will disgrace thee some day Monsieur says I am coward cried Olivain because he wanted the other day to fight a cornet in Grammont s regiment and I refused to accompany him Monsieur Olivain a lackey ought never to disobey said D Artagnan sternly then taking him aside he whispered to him Thou hast done right thy master was in the wrong here s a crown for thee but should he ever be insulted and thou dost not let thyself be cut in quarters for him I will cut out thy tongue Remember that Olivain bowed and slipped the crown into his pocket And now Raoul said the Gascon Monsieur du Vallon and I are going away as ambassadors where I know not but should you want anything write to Madame Turquaine at La Chevrette Rue Tiquetonne and draw upon her purse as on a banker with economy for it is not so well filled as that of Monsieur d Emery And having meantime embraced his ward he passed him into the robust arms of Porthos who lifted him up from the ground and held him a moment suspended near the noble heart of the formidable giant Come said D Artagnan let us go And they set out for Boulogne where toward evening they arrived their horses flecked with foam and dark with perspiration At ten steps from the place where they halted was a young man in black who seemed waiting for some one and who from the moment he saw them enter the town never took his eyes off them D Artagnan approached him and seeing him stare so fixedly said Well friend I don t like people to quiz me Sir said the young man do you not come from Paris if you please D Artagnan thought it was some gossip who wanted news from the capital Yes sir he said in a softened tone Are you not going to put up at the Arms of England Yes sir Are you not charged with a mission from his eminence Cardinal Mazarin Yes sir In that case I am the man you have to do with I am M Mordaunt Ah thought D Artagnan the man I am warned against by Athos Ah thought Porthos the man Aramis wants me to strangle They both looked searchingly at the young man who misunderstood the meaning of that inquisition Do you doubt my word he said In that case I can give you proofs No sir said D Artagnan and we place ourselves at your orders Well gentlemen resumed Mordaunt we must set out without delay to day is the last day granted me by the cardinal My ship is ready and had you not come I must have set off without you for General Cromwell expects my return impatiently So thought the lieutenant tis to General Cromwell that our dispatches are addressed Have you no letter for him asked the young man I have one the seal of which I am not to break till I reach London but since you tell me to whom it is addressed tis useless to wait till then D Artagnan tore open the envelope of the letter It was directed to Monsieur Oliver Cromwell General of the Army of the English Nation Ah said D Artagnan a singular commission Who is this Monsieur Oliver Cromwell inquired Porthos Formerly a brewer replied the Gascon Perhaps Mazarin wishes to make a speculation in beer as we did in straw said Porthos Come come gentlemen said Mordaunt impatiently let us depart What exclaimed Porthos without supper Cannot Monsieur Cromwell wait a little Yes but I said Mordaunt Well you said Porthos what then I cannot wait Oh as to you that is not my concern and I shall sup either with or without your permission The young man s eyes kindled in secret but he restrained himself Monsieur said D Artagnan you must excuse famished travelers Besides our supper can t delay you much We will hasten on to the inn you will meanwhile proceed on foot to the harbor We will take a bite and shall be there as soon as you are Just as you please gentlemen provided we set sail he said The name of your ship inquired D Artagnan The Standard Very well in half an hour we shall be on board And the friends spurring on their horses rode to the hotel the Arms of England What do you say of that young man asked D Artagnan as they hurried along I say that he doesn t suit me at all said Porthos and that I feel a strong itching to follow Aramis s advice By no means my dear Porthos that man is a messenger of General Cromwell it would insure for us a poor reception I imagine should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confidant Nevertheless said Porthos I have always noticed that Aramis gives good advice Listen returned D Artagnan when our embassy is finished Well If it brings us back to France Well Well we shall see At that moment the two friends reached the hotel Arms of England where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the port There they found a brig ready to set sail upon the deck of which they recognized Mordaunt walking up and down impatiently It is singular said D Artagnan whilst the boat was taking them to the Standard it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one I must have known but who it was I cannot yet remember A few minutes later they were on board but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men and it was eight o clock before they raised anchor The young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be spread Porthos completely used up by three nights without sleep and a journey of seventy leagues on horseback retired to his cabin and went to sleep D Artagnan overcoming his repugnance to Mordaunt walked with him upon the deck and invented a hundred stories to make him talk Mousqueton was seasick fifty five The Scotchman And now our readers must leave the Standard to sail peaceably not toward London where D Artagnan and Porthos believed they were going but to Durham whither Mordaunt had been ordered to repair by the letter he had received during his sojourn at Boulogne and accompany us to the royalist camp on this side of the Tyne near Newcastle There placed between two rivers on the borders of Scotland but still on English soil the tents of a little army extended It was midnight Some Highlanders were listlessly keeping watch The moon which was partially obscured by heavy clouds now and then lit up the muskets of the sentinels or silvered the walls the roofs and the spires of the town that Charles I had just surrendered to the parliamentary troops whilst Oxford and Newark still held out for him in the hopes of coming to some arrangement At one of the extremities of the camp near an immense tent in which the Scottish officers were holding a kind of council presided over by Lord Leven their commander a man attired as a cavalier lay sleeping on the turf his right hand extended over his sword About fifty paces off another man also appareled as a cavalier was talking to a Scotch sentinel and though a foreigner he seemed to understand without much difficulty the answers given in the broad Perthshire dialect As the town clock of Newcastle struck one the sleeper awoke and with all the gestures of a man rousing himself out of deep sleep he looked attentively about him perceiving that he was alone he rose and making a little circuit passed close to the cavalier who was speaking to the sentinel The former had no doubt finished his questions for a moment later he said good night and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first cavalier In the shadow of a tent the former was awaiting him Well my dear friend said he in as pure French as has ever been uttered between Rouen and Tours Well my friend there is not a moment to lose we must let the king know immediately Why what is the matter It would take too long to tell you besides you will hear it all directly and the least word dropped here might ruin all We must go and find Lord Winter They both set off to the other end of the camp but as it did not cover more than a surface of five hundred feet they quickly arrived at the tent they were looking for Tony is your master sleeping said one of the two cavaliers to a servant who was lying in the outer compartment which served as a kind of ante room No monsieur le comte answered the servant I think not or at least he has not long been so for he was pacing up and down for more than two hours after he left the king and the sound of his footsteps has only ceased during the last ten minutes However you may look and see added the lackey raising the curtained entrance of the tent Lord Winter was seated near an aperture arranged as a window to let in the night air his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon intermittently veiled as we before observed by heavy clouds The two friends approached Winter who with his head on his hands was gazing at the heavens he did not hear them enter and remained in the same attitude till he felt a hand upon his shoulder He turned around recognized Athos and Aramis and held out his hand to them Have you observed said he to them what a blood red color the moon has to night No replied Athos I thought it looked much the same as usual Look again chevalier returned Lord Winter I must own said Aramis I am like the Comte de la Fere I can see nothing remarkable about it My lord said Athos in a position so precarious as ours we must examine the earth and not the heavens Have you studied our Scotch troops and have you confidence in them The Scotch inquired Winter What Scotch Ours egad exclaimed Athos Those in whom the king has confided Lord Leven s Highlanders No said Winter then he paused but tell me can you not perceive the russet tint which marks the heavens Not the least in the world said Aramis and Athos at once Tell me continued Winter always possessed by the same idea is there not a tradition in France that Henry IV the evening before the day he was assassinated when he was playing at chess with M de Bassompiere saw clots of blood upon the chessboard Yes said Athos and the marechal has often told me so himself Then it was so murmured Winter and the next day Henry IV was killed But what has this vision of Henry IV to do with you my lord inquired Aramis Nothing and indeed I am mad to trouble you with such things when your coming to my tent at such an hour announces that you are the bearers of important news Yes my lord said Athos I wish to speak to the king To the king but the king is asleep I have something important to reveal to him Can it not be put off till to morrow He must know it this moment and perhaps it is already too late Come then said Lord Winter Lord Winter s tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee a kind of corridor communicating between the two This corridor was guarded not by a sentinel but by a confidential servant through whom in case of urgency Charles could communicate instantly with his faithful subject These gentlemen are with me said Winter The lackey bowed and let them pass As he had said on a camp bed dressed in his black doublet booted unbelted with his felt hat beside him lay the king overcome by sleep and fatigue They advanced and Athos who was the first to enter gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face framed in its long and now untidy matted hair the blue veins showing through the transparent temples his eyes seemingly swollen by tears Athos sighed deeply the sigh woke the king so lightly did he sleep He opened his eyes Ah said he raising himself on his elbow is it you Comte de la Fere Yes sire replied Athos You watch while I sleep and you have come to bring me some news Alas sire answered Athos your majesty has guessed aright It is bad news Yes sire Never mind the messenger is welcome You never come to me without conferring pleasure You whose devotion recognizes neither country nor misfortune you who are sent to me by Henrietta whatever news you bring speak out Sire Cromwell has arrived this night at Newcastle Ah exclaimed the king to fight No sire but to buy your majesty What did you say I said sire that four hundred thousand pounds are owing to the Scottish army For unpaid wages yes I know it For the last year my faithful Highlanders have fought for honor alone Athos smiled Well sir though honor is a fine thing they are tired of fighting for it and to night they have sold you for two hundred thousand pounds that is to say for half what is owing them Impossible cried the king the Scotch sell their king for two hundred thousand pounds And who is the Judas who has concluded this infamous bargain Lord Leven Are you certain of it sir I heard it with my own ears The king sighed deeply as if his heart would break and then buried his face in his hands Oh the Scotch he exclaimed the Scotch I called my faithful to whom I trusted myself when I could have fled to Oxford the Scotch my brothers But are you well assured sir Lying behind the tent of Lord Leven I raised it and saw all heard all And when is this to be consummated To day this morning so your majesty must perceive there is no time to lose To do what since you say I am sold To cross the Tyne reach Scotland and rejoin Lord Montrose who will not sell you And what shall I do in Scotland A war of partisans unworthy of a king The example of Robert Bruce will absolve you sire No no I have fought too long they have sold me they shall give me up and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their heads Sire said Athos perhaps a king should act thus but not a husband and a father I have come in the name of your wife and daughter and of the children you have still in London and I say to you Live sire it is the will of Heaven The king raised himself buckled on his belt and passing his handkerchief over his moist forehead said Well what is to be done Sire have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely Winter said the king do you believe in the fidelity of yours Sire they are but men and men are become both weak and wicked I will not answer for them I would confide my life to them but I should hesitate ere I trusted them with your majesty s Well said Athos since you have not a regiment we are three devoted men It is enough Let your majesty mount on horseback and place yourself in the midst of us we will cross the Tyne reach Scotland and you will be saved Is this your counsel also Winter inquired the king Yes sire And yours Monsieur d Herblay Yes sire As you wish then Winter give the necessary orders Winter then left the tent in the meantime the king finished his toilet The first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as Winter re entered it All is ready sire said he For us also inquired Athos Grimaud and Blaisois are holding your horses ready saddled In that case exclaimed Athos let us not lose an instant but set off Come added the king Sire said Aramis will not your majesty acquaint some of your friends of this Friends answered Charles sadly I have but three one of twenty years who has never forgotten me and two of a week s standing whom I shall never forget Come gentlemen come The king quitted his tent and found his horse ready waiting for him It was a chestnut that the king had ridden for three years and of which he was very fond The horse neighed with pleasure at seeing him Ah said the king I was unjust here is a creature that loves me You at least will be faithful to me Arthur The horse as if it understood these words bent its red nostrils toward the king s face and parting his lips displayed all its teeth as if with pleasure Yes yes said the king caressing it with his hand yes my Arthur thou art a fond and faithful creature After this little scene Charles threw himself into the saddle and turning to Athos Aramis and Winter said Now gentlemen I am at your service But Athos was standing with his eyes fixed on a black line which bordered the banks of the Tyne and seemed to extend double the length of the camp What is that line cried Athos whose vision was still rather obscured by the uncertain shades and demi tints of daybreak What is that line I did not observe it yesterday It must be the fog rising from the river said the king Sire it is something more opaque than the fog Indeed said Winter it appears to me like a bar of red color It is the enemy who have made a sortie from Newcastle and are surrounding us exclaimed Athos The enemy cried the king Yes the enemy It is too late Stop a moment does not that sunbeam yonder just by the side of the town glitter on the Ironsides This was the name given the cuirassiers whom Cromwell had made his body guard Ah said the king we shall soon see whether my Highlanders have betrayed me or not What are you going to do exclaimed Athos To give them the order to charge and run down these miserable rebels And the king putting spurs to his horse set off to the tent of Lord Leven Follow him said Athos Come exclaimed Aramis Is the king wounded cried Lord Winter I see spots of blood on the ground And he set off to follow the two friends He was stopped by Athos Go and call out your regiment said he I can foresee that we shall have need of it directly Winter turned his horse and the two friends rode on It had taken but two minutes for the king to reach the tent of the Scottish commander he dismounted and entered The general was there surrounded by the more prominent chiefs The king they exclaimed as all rose in bewilderment Charles was indeed in the midst of them his hat on his head his brows bent striking his boot with his riding whip Yes gentlemen the king in person the king who has come to ask for some account of what has happened What is the matter sire exclaimed Lord Leven It is this sir said the king angrily that General Cromwell has reached Newcastle that you knew it and I was not informed of it that the enemy have left the town and are now closing the passages of the Tyne against us that our sentinels have seen this movement and I have been left unacquainted with it that by an infamous treaty you have sold me for two hundred thousand pounds to Parliament Of this treaty at least I have been warned This is the matter gentlemen answer and exculpate yourselves for I stand here to accuse you Sire said Lord Leven with hesitation sire your majesty has been deceived by false reports My own eyes have seen the enemy extend itself between myself and Scotland and I can almost say that with my own ears I have heard the clauses of the treaty debated The Scotch chieftains looked at each other in their turn with frowning brows Sire murmured Lord Leven crushed by shame sire we are ready to give you every proof of our fidelity I ask but one said the king put the army in battle array and face the enemy That cannot be sire said the earl How cannot be What hinders it exclaimed the king Your majesty is well aware that there is a truce between us and the English army And if there is a truce the English army has broken it by quitting the town contrary to the agreement which kept it there Now I tell you you must pass with me through this army across to Scotland and if you refuse you may choose betwixt two names which the contempt of all honest men will brand you with you are either cowards or traitors The eyes of the Scotch flashed fire and as often happens on such occasions from shame they passed to effrontery and two heads of clans advanced upon the king Yes said they we have promised to deliver Scotland and England from him who for the last five and twenty years has sucked the blood and gold of Scotland and England We have promised and we will keep our promise Charles Stuart you are our prisoner And both extended their hands as if to seize the king but before they could touch him with the tips of their fingers both had fallen one dead the other stunned Aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and Athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his pistol Then as Lord Leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue which seemed to come from Heaven for the prince they already thought was their prisoner Athos and Aramis dragged the king from the perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal tent On their road they perceived Lord Winter marching at the head of his regiment The king motioned him to accompany them fifty six The Avenger They all four entered the tent they had no plan ready they must think of one The king threw himself into an arm chair I am lost said he No sire replied Athos You are only betrayed The king sighed deeply Betrayed yes betrayed by the Scotch amongst whom I was born whom I have always loved better than the English Oh traitors that ye are Sire said Athos this is not a moment for recrimination but a time to show yourself a king and a gentleman Up sire up for you have here at least three men who will not betray you Ah if we had been five murmured Athos thinking of D Artagnan and Porthos What do you say inquired Charles rising I say sire that there is now but one way open Lord Winter answers for his regiment or at least very nearly so we will not split straws about words let him place himself at the head of his men we will place ourselves at the side of your majesty and we will mow a swath through Cromwell s army and reach Scotland There is another method said Aramis Let one of us put on the dress and mount the king s horse Whilst they pursue him the king might escape It is good advice said Athos and if the king will do one of us the honor we shall be truly grateful to him What do you think of this counsel Winter asked the king looking with admiration at these two men whose chief idea seemed to be how they could take on their shoulders all the dangers that assailed him I think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by Monsieur d Herblay I humbly entreat your majesty to choose quickly for we have not an instant to lose But if I accept it is death or at least imprisonment for him who takes my place He will have had the glory of having saved his king cried Winter The king looked at his old friend with tears in his eyes undid the Order of the Saint Esprit which he wore to honor the two Frenchmen who were with him and passed it around Winter s neck who received on his knees this striking proof of his sovereign s confidence and friendship It is right said Athos he has served your majesty longer than we have The king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his eyes Wait a moment sir said he I have an order for each of you also He turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up and took out two ribbons of the Order of the Garter These cannot be for us said Athos Why not sir asked Charles Such are for royalty and we are simple commoners Speak not of crowns I shall not find amongst them such great hearts as yours No no you do yourselves injustice but I am here to do you justice On your knees count Athos knelt down and the king passed the ribbon down from left to right as usual raised his sword and instead of pronouncing the customary formula I make you a knight Be brave faithful and loyal he said You are brave faithful and loyal I knight you monsieur le comte Then turning to Aramis he said It is now your turn monsieur le chevalier The same ceremony recommenced with the same words whilst Winter unlaced his leather cuirass that he might disguise himself like the king Charles having proceeded with Aramis as with Athos embraced them both Sire said Winter who in this trying emergency felt all his strength and energy fire up we are ready The king looked at the three gentlemen Then we must fly said he Flying through an army sire said Athos in all countries in the world is called charging Then I shall die sword in hand said Charles Monsieur le comte monsieur le chevalier if ever I am king Sire you have already done us more honor than simple gentlemen could ever aspire to therefore gratitude is on our side But we must not lose time We have already wasted too much The king again shook hands with all three exchanged hats with Winter and went out Winter s regiment was ranged on some high ground above the camp The king followed by the three friends turned his steps that way The Scotch camp seemed as if at last awakened the soldiers had come out of their tents and taken up their station in battle array Do you see that said the king Perhaps they are penitent and preparing to march If they are penitent said Athos let them follow us Well said the king what shall we do Let us examine the enemy s army At the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of battle The air was soft and clear as it generally is at that early hour of the morning The regiments the standards and even the colors of the horses and uniforms were now clearly distinct On the summit of a rising ground a little in advance of the enemy appeared a short and heavy looking man this man was surrounded by officers He turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king stood Does this man know your majesty personally inquired Aramis Charles smiled That man is Cromwell said he Then draw down your hat sire that he may not discover the substitution Ah said Athos how much time we have lost Now said the king give the word and let us start Will you not give it sire asked Athos No I make you my lieutenant general said the king Listen then Lord Winter Proceed sire I beg What we are going to say does not concern your majesty The king smiling turned a few steps back This is what I propose to do said Athos We will divide our regiments into two squadrons You will put yourself at the head of the first We and his majesty will lead the second If no obstacle occurs we will both charge together force the enemy s line and throw ourselves into the Tyne which we must cross either by fording or swimming if on the contrary any repulse should take place you and your men must fight to the last man whilst we and the king proceed on our road Once arrived at the brink of the river should we even find them three ranks deep as long as you and your regiment do your duty we will look to the rest To horse said Lord Winter To horse re echoed Athos everything is arranged and decided Now gentlemen cried the king forward and rally to the old cry of France Montjoy and saint Denis The war cry of England is too often in the mouths of traitors They mounted the king on Winter s horse and Winter on that of the king then Winter took his place at the head of the first squadron and the king with Athos on his right and Aramis on his left at the head of the second The Scotch army stood motionless and silent seized with shame at sight of these preparations Some of the chieftains left the ranks and broke their swords in two There said the king that consoles me they are not all traitors At this moment Winter s voice was raised with the cry of Forward The first squadron moved off the second followed and descended from the plateau A regiment of cuirassiers nearly equal as to numbers issued from behind the hill and came full gallop toward it The king pointed this out Sire said Athos we foresaw this and if Lord Winter s men but do their duty we are saved instead of lost At this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the horses Winter s voice crying out Sword in hand At these words every sword was drawn and glittered in the air like lightning Now gentlemen said the king in his turn excited by this sight come gentlemen sword in hand But Aramis and Athos were the only ones to obey this command and the king s example We are betrayed said the king in a low voice Wait a moment said Athos perhaps they do not recognize your majesty s voice and await the order of their captain Have they not heard that of their colonel But look look cried the king drawing up his horse with a sudden jerk which threw it on its haunches and seizing the bridle of Athos s horse Ah cowards traitors screamed Lord Winter whose voice they heard whilst his men quitting their ranks dispersed all over the plain About fifteen men were ranged around him and awaited the charge of Cromwell s cuirassiers Let us go and die with them said the king Let us go said Athos and Aramis All faithful hearts with me cried out Winter This voice was heard by the two friends who set off full gallop No quarter cried a voice in French answering to that of Winter which made them tremble As for Winter at the sound of that voice he turned pale and was as it were petrified It was the voice of a cavalier mounted on a magnificent black horse who was charging at the head of the English regiment of which in his ardor he was ten steps in advance Tis he murmured Winter his eyes glazed and he allowed his sword to fall to his side The king the king cried out several voices deceived by the blue ribbon and chestnut horse of Winter take him alive No it is not the king exclaimed the cavalier Lord Winter you are not the king you are my uncle At the same moment Mordaunt for it was he leveled his pistol at Winter it went off and the ball entered the heart of the old cavalier who with one bound on his saddle fell back into the arms of Athos murmuring He is avenged Think of my mother shouted Mordaunt as his horse plunged and darted off at full gallop Wretch exclaimed Aramis raising his pistol as he passed by him but the powder flashed in the pan and it did not go off At this moment the whole regiment came up and they fell upon the few men who had held out surrounding the two Frenchmen Athos after making sure that Lord Winter was really dead let fall the corpse and said Come Aramis now for the honor of France and the two Englishmen who were nearest to them fell mortally wounded At the same moment a fearful hurrah rent the air and thirty blades glittered about their heads Suddenly a man sprang out of the English ranks fell upon Athos twined arms of steel around him and tearing his sword from him said in his ear Silence yield you yield to me do you not A giant had seized also Aramis s two wrists who struggled in vain to release himself from this formidable grasp D Art exclaimed Athos whilst the Gascon covered his mouth with his hand I am your prisoner said Aramis giving up his sword to Porthos Fire fire cried Mordaunt returning to the group surrounding the two friends And wherefore fire said the colonel every one has yielded It is the son of Milady said Athos to D Artagnan I recognize him It is the monk whispered Porthos to Aramis I know it And now the ranks began to open D Artagnan held the bridle of Athos s horse and Porthos that of Aramis Both of them attempted to lead his prisoner off the battle field This movement revealed the spot where Winter s body had fallen Mordaunt had found it out and was gazing on his dead relative with an expression of malignant hatred Athos though now cool and collected put his hand to his belt where his loaded pistols yet remained What are you about said D Artagnan Let me kill him We are all four lost if by the least gesture you discover that you recognize him Then turning to the young man he exclaimed A fine prize a fine prize friend Mordaunt we have both myself and Monsieur du Vallon taken two Knights of the Garter nothing less But said Mordaunt looking at Athos and Aramis with bloodshot eyes these are Frenchmen I imagine I faith I don t know Are you French sir said he to Athos I am replied the latter gravely Very well my dear sir you are the prisoner of a fellow countryman But the king where is the king exclaimed Athos anxiously D Artagnan vigorously seized his prisoner s hand saying Eh the king We have secured him Yes said Aramis through an infamous act of treason Porthos pressed his friend s hand and said to him Yes sir all is fair in war stratagem as well as force look yonder At this instant the squadron that ought to have protected Charles s retreat was advancing to meet the English regiments The king who was entirely surrounded walked alone in a great empty space He appeared calm but it was evidently not without a mighty effort Drops of perspiration trickled down his face and from time to time he put a handkerchief to his mouth to wipe away the blood that rilled from it Behold Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed an old Puritan soldier whose eyes flashed at the sight of the man they called the tyrant Do you call him Nebuchadnezzar said Mordaunt with a terrible smile no it is Charles the First the king the good King Charles who despoils his subjects to enrich himself Charles glanced a moment at the insolent creature who uttered this but did not recognize him Nevertheless the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed Mordaunt Bon jour messieurs said the king to the two gentlemen who were held by D Artagnan and Porthos The day has been unfortunate but it is not your fault thank God But where is my old friend Winter The two gentlemen turned away their heads in silence In Strafford s company said Mordaunt tauntingly Charles shuddered The demon had known how to wound him The remembrance of Strafford was a source of lasting remorse to him the shadow that haunted him by day and night The king looked around him He saw a corpse at his feet It was Winter s He uttered not a word nor shed a tear but a deadly pallor spread over his face he knelt down on the ground raised Winter s head and unfastening the Order of the Saint Esprit placed it on his own breast Lord Winter is killed then inquired D Artagnan fixing his eyes on the corpse Yes said Athos by his own nephew Come he was the first of us to go peace be to him he was an honest man said D Artagnan Charles Stuart said the colonel of the English regiment approaching the king who had just put on the insignia of royalty do you yield yourself a prisoner Colonel Tomlison said Charles kings cannot yield the man alone submits to force Your sword The king drew his sword and broke it on his knee At this moment a horse without a rider covered with foam his nostrils extended and eyes all fire galloped up and recognizing his master stopped and neighed with pleasure it was Arthur The king smiled patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the saddle Now gentlemen said he conduct me where you will Turning back again he said I thought I saw Winter move if he still lives by all you hold most sacred do not abandon him Never fear King Charles said Mordaunt the bullet pierced his heart Do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or Porthos said D Artagnan to Athos and Aramis that you recognize this man for Milady is not dead her soul lives in the body of this demon The detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive but on the road an aide de camp from Cromwell sent orders that Colonel Tomlison should conduct him to Holdenby Castle At the same time couriers started in every direction over England and Europe to announce that Charles Stuart was the prisoner of Oliver Cromwell fifty seven Oliver Cromwell Have you been to the general said Mordaunt to D Artagnan and Porthos you know he sent for you after the action We want first to put our prisoners in a place of safety replied D Artagnan Do you know sir these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds Oh be assured said Mordaunt looking at them with an expression he vainly endeavoured to soften my soldiers will guard them and guard them well I promise you I shall take better care of them myself answered D Artagnan besides all they require is a good room with sentinels or their simple parole that they will not attempt escape I will go and see about that and then we shall have the honor of presenting ourselves to the general and receiving his commands for his eminence You think of starting at once then inquired Mordaunt Our mission is ended and there is nothing more to detain us now but the good pleasure of the great man to whom we were sent The young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant You will follow these men and not lose sight of them when you have discovered where they lodge come and await me at the town gate The sergeant made a sign of comprehension Instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town Mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence Cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent pitched Cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission but the sentinel who knew that Mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general thought the order did not extend to the young man Mordaunt therefore raised the canvas and saw Cromwell seated before a table his head buried in his hands his back being turned Whether he heard Mordaunt or not as he entered Cromwell did not move Mordaunt remained standing near the door At last after a few moments Cromwell raised his head and as if he divined that some one was there turned slowly around I said I wished to be alone he exclaimed on seeing the young man They thought this order did not concern me sir nevertheless if you wish it I am ready to go Ah is it you Mordaunt said Cromwell the cloud passing away from his face since you are here it is well you may remain I come to congratulate you To congratulate me what for On the capture of Charles Stuart You are now master of England I was much more really so two hours ago How so general Because England had need of me to take the tyrant and now the tyrant is taken Have you seen him Yes sir said Mordaunt What is his bearing Mordaunt hesitated but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell the truth Calm and dignified said he What did he say Some parting words to his friends His friends murmured Cromwell Has he any friends Then he added aloud Did he make any resistance No sir with the exception of two or three friends every one deserted him he had no means of resistance To whom did he give up his sword He did not give it up he broke it He did well but instead of breaking it he might have used it to still more advantage There was a momentary pause I heard that the colonel of the regiment that escorted Charles was killed said Cromwell staring very fixedly at Mordaunt Yes sir By whom inquired Cromwell By me What was his name Lord Winter Your uncle exclaimed Cromwell My uncle answered Mordaunt but traitors to England are no longer members of my family Cromwell observed the young man a moment in silence then with that profound melancholy Shakespeare describes so well Mordaunt he said you are a terrible servant When the Lord commands said Mordaunt His commands are not to be disputed Abraham raised the knife against Isaac and Isaac was his son Yes said Cromwell but the Lord did not suffer that sacrifice to be accomplished I have looked around me said Mordaunt and I have seen neither goat nor kid caught among the bushes of the plain Cromwell bowed You are strong among the strong Mordaunt he said and the Frenchmen how did they behave Most fearlessly Yes yes murmured Cromwell the French fight well and if my glass was good and I mistake not they were foremost in the fight They were replied Mordaunt After you however said Cromwell It was the fault of their horses not theirs Another pause And the Scotch They kept their word and never stirred said Mordaunt Wretched men Their officers wish to see you sir I have no time to see them Are they paid Yes to night Let them be off and return to their own country there to hide their shame if its hills are high enough I have nothing more to do with them nor they with me And now go Mordaunt Before I go said Mordaunt I have some questions and a favor to ask you sir A favor from me Mordaunt bowed I come to you my leader my head my father and I ask you master are you contented with me Cromwell looked at him with astonishment The young man remained immovable Yes said Cromwell you have done since I knew you not only your duty but more than your duty you have been a faithful friend a cautious negotiator a brave soldier Do you remember sir it was my idea the Scotch treaty for giving up the king Yes the idea was yours I had no such contempt for men before Was I not a good ambassador in France Yes for Mazarin has granted what I desire Have I not always fought for your glory and interests Too ardently perhaps it is what I have just reproached you for But what is the meaning of all these questions To tell you my lord that the moment has now arrived when with a single word you may recompense all these services Oh said Oliver with a slight curl of his lip I forgot that every service merits some reward and that up to this moment you have not been paid Sir I can take my pay at this moment to the full extent of my wishes How is that I have the payment under my hand I almost possess it What is it Have they offered you money Do you wish a step or some place in the government Sir will you grant me my request Let us hear what it is first Sir when you have told me to obey an order did I ever answer Let me see that order If however your wish should be one impossible to fulfill When you have cherished a wish and have charged me with its fulfillment have I ever replied It is impossible But a request preferred with so much preparation Ah do not fear sir said Mordaunt with apparent simplicity it will not ruin you Well then said Cromwell I promise as far as lies in my power to grant your request proceed Sir two prisoners were taken this morning will you let me have them For their ransom have they then offered a large one inquired Cromwell On the contrary I think they are poor sir They are friends of yours then Yes sir exclaimed Mordaunt they are friends dear friends of mine and I would lay down my life for them Very well Mordaunt exclaimed Cromwell pleased at having his opinion of the young man raised once more I will give them to you I will not even ask who they are do as you like with them Thank you sir exclaimed Mordaunt thank you my life is always at your service and should I lose it I should still owe you something thank you you have indeed repaid me munificently for my services He threw himself at the feet of Cromwell and in spite of the efforts of the Puritan general who did not like this almost kingly homage he took his hand and kissed it What said Cromwell arresting him for a moment as he arose is there nothing more you wish neither gold nor rank You have given me all you can give me and from to day your debt is paid And Mordaunt darted out of the general s tent his heart beating and his eyes sparkling with joy Cromwell gazed a moment after him He has slain his uncle he murmured Alas what are my servants Possibly this one who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing has asked more in the eyes of Heaven than those who tax the country and steal the bread of the poor Nobody serves me for nothing Charles who is my prisoner may still have friends but I have none And with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by Mordaunt fifty eight Jesus Seigneur Whilst Mordaunt was making his way to Cromwell s tent D Artagnan and Porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at Newcastle The order given by Mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by D Artagnan who accordingly by an expressive glance warned Athos and Aramis to exercise extreme caution The prisoners therefore had remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerors which they could do with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answering his own thoughts It would be impossible to describe Mousqueton s astonishment when from the threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching followed by a sergeant with a dozen men He rubbed his eyes doubting if he really saw before him Athos and Aramis and forced at last to yield to evidence he was on the point of breaking forth in exclamations when he encountered a glance from the eyes of Porthos the repressive force of which he was not inclined to dispute Mousqueton remained glued to the door awaiting the explanation of this strange occurrence What upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acquaintance with one another The house to which D Artagnan and Porthos conducted Athos and Aramis was the one assigned to them by General Cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous evening It was at the corner of two streets and had in the rear bordering on the side street stables and a sort of garden The windows on the ground floor according to a custom in provincial villages were barred so that they strongly resembled the windows of a prison The two friends made the prisoners enter the house first whilst they stood at the door desiring Mousqueton to take the four horses to the stable Why don t we go in with them asked Porthos We must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do replied D Artagnan The sergeant and his men took possession of the little garden D Artagnan asked them what they wished and why they had taken that position We have had orders answered the man to help you in taking care of your prisoners There could be no fault to find with this arrangement on the contrary it seemed to be a delicate attention to be gratefully received D Artagnan therefore thanked the man and gave him a crown piece to drink to General Cromwell s health The sergeant answered that Puritans never drank and put the crown piece in his pocket Ah said Porthos what a fearful day my dear D Artagnan What a fearful day when to day we find our friends Yes but under what circumstances Tis true that our position is an awkward one but let us go in and see more clearly what is to be done Things look black enough replied Porthos I understand now why Aramis advised me to strangle that horrible Mordaunt Silence cried the Gascon do not utter that name But argued Porthos I speak French and they are all English D Artagnan looked at Porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man cannot help feeling at displays of crass stupidity But as Porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment he merely pushed him indoors saying Let us go in They found Athos in profound despondency Aramis looked first at Porthos and then at D Artagnan without speaking but the latter understood his meaningful look You want to know how we came here Tis easily guessed Mazarin sent us with a letter to General Cromwell But how came you to fall into company with Mordaunt whom I bade you distrust asked Athos And whom I advised you to strangle Porthos said Aramis Mazarin again Cromwell had sent him to Mazarin Mazarin sent us to Cromwell There is a certain fatality in it Yes you are right D Artagnan a fatality that will separate and ruin us So my dear Aramis say no more about it and let us prepare to submit to destiny Zounds on the contrary let us speak about it for it was agreed among us once for all that we should always hold together though engaged on opposing sides Yes added Athos I now ask you D Artagnan what side you are on Ah behold for what end the wretched Mazarin has made use of you Do you know in what crime you are to day engaged In the capture of a king his degradation and his murder Oh oh cried Porthos do you think so You are exaggerating Athos we are not so far gone as that replied the lieutenant Good heavens we are on the very eve of it I say why is the king taken prisoner Those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy him as a slave Do you think it is to replace him on the throne that Cromwell has paid for him two hundred thousand pounds sterling They will kill him you may be sure of it I don t maintain the contrary said D Artagnan But what s that to us I am here because I am a soldier and have to obey orders I have taken an oath to obey and I do obey but you who have taken no such oath why are you here and what cause do you represent That most sacred in the world said Athos the cause of misfortune of religion royalty A friend a wife a daughter have done us the honor to call us to their aid We have served them to the best of our poor means and God will recompense the will forgive the want of power You may see matters differently D Artagnan and think otherwise I will not attempt to argue with you but I blame you Heyday cried D Artagnan what matters it to me after all if Cromwell who s an Englishman revolts against his king who is a Scotchman I am myself a Frenchman I have nothing to do with these things why hold me responsible Yes said Porthos Because all gentlemen are brothers because you are a gentleman because the kings of all countries are the first among gentlemen because the blind populace ungrateful and brutal always takes pleasure in pulling down what is above them And you you D Artagnan a man sprung from the ancient nobility of France bearing an honorable name carrying a good sword have helped to give up a king to beersellers shopkeepers and wagoners Ah D Artagnan perhaps you have done your duty as a soldier but as a gentleman I say that you are very culpable D Artagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower unable to reply and thoroughly uncomfortable for when turned from the eyes of Athos he encountered those of Aramis And you Porthos continued the count as if in consideration for D Artagnan s embarrassment you the best heart the best friend the best soldier that I know you with a soul that makes you worthy of a birth on the steps of a throne and who sooner or later must receive your reward from an intelligent king you my dear Porthos you a gentleman in manners in tastes and in courage you are as culpable as D Artagnan Porthos blushed but with pleasure rather than with confusion and yet bowing his head as if humiliated he said Yes yes my dear count I feel that you are right Athos arose Come he said stretching out his hand to D Artagnan come don t be sullen my dear son for I have said all this to you if not in the tone at least with the feelings of a father It would have been easier to me merely to have thanked you for preserving my life and not to have uttered a word of all this Doubtless doubtless Athos But here it is you have sentiments the devil knows what such as every one can t entertain Who could suppose that a sensible man could leave his house France his ward a charming youth for we saw him in the camp to fly to the aid of a rotten worm eaten royalty which is going to crumble one of these days like an old hovel The sentiments you air are certainly fine so fine that they are superhuman However that may be D Artagnan replied Athos without falling into the snare which his Gascon friend had prepared for him by an appeal to his parental love however that may be you know in the bottom of your heart that it is true but I am wrong to dispute with my master D Artagnan I am your prisoner treat me as such Ah pardieu said D Artagnan you know you will not be my prisoner very long No said Aramis they will doubtless treat us like the prisoners of the Philipghauts And how were they treated asked D Artagnan Why said Aramis one half were hanged and the other half were shot Well I said D Artagnan I answer that while there remains a drop of blood in my veins you will be neither hanged nor shot Sang Diou let them come on Besides do you see that door Athos Yes what then Well you can go out by that door whenever you please for from this moment you are free as the air I recognize you there my brave D Artagnan replied Athos but you are no longer our masters That door is guarded D Artagnan you know that Very well you will force it said Porthos There are only a dozen men at the most That would be nothing for us four it is too much for us two No divided as we now are we must perish See the fatal example on the Vendomois road D Artagnan you so brave and you Porthos so valiant and so strong you were beaten to day Aramis and I are beaten in our turn Now that never happened to us when we were four together Let us die then as De Winter has died as for me I will fly only on condition that we all fly together Impossible said D Artagnan we are under Mazarin s orders I know it and I have nothing more to say my arguments lead to nothing doubtless they are bad since they have not determined minds so just as yours Besides said Aramis had they taken effect it would be still better not to compromise two excellent friends like D Artagnan and Porthos Be assured gentlemen we shall do you honor in our dying As for myself I shall be proud to face the bullets or even the rope in company with you Athos for you have never seemed to me so grand as you are to day D Artagnan said nothing but after having gnawed the flower stalk he began to bite his nails At last Do you imagine he resumed that they mean to kill you And wherefore should they do so What interest have they in your death Moreover you are our prisoners Fool cried Aramis knowest thou not then Mordaunt I have but exchanged with him one look yet that look convinced me that we were doomed The truth is I m very sorry that I did not strangle him as you advised me said Porthos Eh I make no account of the harm Mordaunt can do cried D Artagnan Cap de Diou if he troubles me too much I will crush him the insect Do not fly then It is useless for I swear to you that you are as safe here as you were twenty years ago you Athos in the Rue Ferou and you Aramis in the Rue de Vaugirard Stop cried Athos extending his hand to one of the grated windows by which the room was lighted you will soon know what to expect for here he is Who Mordaunt In fact looking at the place to which Athos pointed D Artagnan saw a cavalier coming toward the house at full gallop It was Mordaunt D Artagnan rushed out of the room Porthos wanted to follow him Stay said D Artagnan and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers on the door When Mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw D Artagnan on the threshold and the soldiers lying on the grass here and there with their arms Halloo he cried are the prisoners still there Yes sir answered the sergeant uncovering Tis well order four men to conduct them to my lodging Four men prepared to do so What is it said D Artagnan with that jeering manner which our readers have so often observed in him since they made his acquaintance What is the matter if you please Sir replied Mordaunt I have ordered the two prisoners we made this morning to be conducted to my lodging Wherefore sir Excuse curiosity but I wish to be enlightened on the subject Because these prisoners sir are at my disposal and I choose to dispose of them as I like Allow me allow me sir said D Artagnan to observe you are in error The prisoners belong to those who take them and not to those who only saw them taken You might have taken Lord Winter who tis said was your uncle prisoner but you preferred killing him tis well we that is Monsieur du Vallon and I could have killed our prisoners we preferred taking them Mordaunt s very lips grew white with rage D Artagnan now saw that affairs were growing worse and he beat the guard s march upon the door At the first beat Porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the door This movement was observed by Mordaunt Sir he thus addressed D Artagnan your resistance is useless these prisoners have just been given me by my illustrious patron Oliver Cromwell These words struck D Artagnan like a thunderbolt The blood mounted to his temples his eyes became dim he saw from what fountainhead the ferocious hopes of the young man arose and he put his hand to the hilt of his sword As for Porthos he looked inquiringly at D Artagnan This look of Porthos s made the Gascon regret that he had summoned the brute force of his friend to aid him in an affair which seemed to require chiefly cunning Violence he said to himself would spoil all D Artagnan my friend prove to this young serpent that thou art not only stronger but more subtle than he is Ah he said making a low bow why did you not begin by saying that Monsieur Mordaunt What are you sent by General Oliver Cromwell the most illustrious captain of the age I have this instant left him replied Mordaunt alighting in order to give his horse to a soldier to hold Why did you not say so at once my dear sir all England is with Cromwell and since you ask for my prisoners I bend sir to your wishes They are yours take them Mordaunt delighted advanced Porthos looking at D Artagnan with open mouthed astonishment Then D Artagnan trod on his foot and Porthos began to understand that this was merely acting Mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and with his hat in hand prepared to pass by the two friends motioning to the four men to follow him But pardon said D Artagnan with the most charming smile and putting his hand on the young man s shoulder if the illustrious General Oliver Cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour he has of course made that act of donation in writing Mordaunt stopped short He has given you some little writing for me the least bit of paper which may show that you come in his name Be pleased to give me that scrap of paper so that I may justify by a pretext at least my abandoning my countrymen Otherwise you see although I am sure that General Oliver Cromwell can intend them no harm it would have a bad appearance Mordaunt recoiled he felt the blow and discharged a terrible look at D Artagnan who responded by the most amiable expression that ever graced a human countenance When I tell you a thing sir said Mordaunt you insult me by doubting it I cried D Artagnan I doubt what you say God keep me from it my dear Monsieur Mordaunt On the contrary I take you to be a worthy and accomplished gentleman And then sir do you wish me to speak freely to you continued D Artagnan with his frank expression Speak out sir said Mordaunt Monsieur du Vallon yonder is rich and has forty thousand francs yearly so he does not care about money I do not speak for him but for myself Well sir What more Well I I m not rich In Gascony tis no dishonor sir nobody is rich and Henry IV of glorious memory who was the king of the Gascons as His Majesty Philip IV is the king of the Spaniards never had a penny in his pocket Go on sir I see what you wish to get at and if it is simply what I think that stops you I can obviate the difficulty Ah I knew well said the Gascon that you were a man of talent Well here s the case here s where the saddle hurts me as we French say I am an officer of fortune nothing else I have nothing but what my sword brings me in that is to say more blows than banknotes Now on taking prisoners this morning two Frenchmen who seemed to me of high birth in short two knights of the Garter I said to myself my fortune is made I say two because in such circumstances Monsieur du Vallon who is rich always gives me his prisoners Mordaunt completely deceived by the wordy civility of D Artagnan smiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him and said I shall have the order signed directly sir and with it two thousand pistoles meanwhile let me take these men away No replied D Artagnan what signifies a delay of half an hour I am a man of order sir let us do things in order Nevertheless replied Mordaunt I could compel you I command here Ah sir said D Artagnan I see that although we have had the honor of traveling in your company you do not know us We are gentlemen we are both of us able to kill you and your eight men we two only For Heaven s sake don t be obstinate for when others are obstinate I am obstinate likewise and then I become ferocious and headstrong and there s my friend who is even more headstrong and ferocious than myself Besides we are sent here by Cardinal Mazarin and at this moment represent both the king and the cardinal and are therefore as ambassadors able to act with impunity a thing that General Oliver Cromwell who is assuredly as great a politician as he is a general is quite the man to understand Ask him then for the written order What will that cost you my dear Monsieur Mordaunt Yes the written order said Porthos who now began to comprehend what D Artagnan was aiming at we ask only for that However inclined Mordaunt was to have recourse to violence he understood the reasons D Artagnan had given him besides completely ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four Frenchmen all his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the ransom He decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand pistoles at which he estimated the prisoners He therefore mounted his horse and disappeared Good thought D Artagnan a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an hour to return it is more than we need Then turning without the least change of countenance to Porthos he said looking him full in the face Friend Porthos listen to this first not a syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard it is unnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render them Very well I understand Go to the stable you will find Mousqueton there saddle your horses put your pistols in your saddle bags take out the horses and lead them to the street below this so that there will be nothing to do but mount them all the rest is my business Porthos made no remark but obeyed with the sublime confidence he had in his friend I go he said only shall I enter the chamber where those gentlemen are No it is not worth while Well do me the kindness to take my purse which I left on the mantelpiece All right He then proceeded with his usual calm gait to the stable and went into the very midst of the soldiery who foreigner as he was could not help admiring his height and the enormous strength of his great limbs At the corner of the street he met Mousqueton and took him with him D Artagnan meantime went into the house whistling a tune which he had begun before Porthos went away My dear Athos I have reflected on your arguments and I am convinced I am sorry to have had anything to do with this matter As you say Mazarin is a knave I have resolved to fly with you not a word be ready Your swords are in the corner do not forget them they are in many circumstances very useful there is Porthos s purse too He put it into his pocket The two friends were perfectly stupefied Well pray is there anything to be so surprised at he said I was blind Athos has made me see that s all come here The two friends went near him Do you see that street There are the horses Go out by the door turn to the right jump into your saddles all will be right don t be uneasy at anything except mistaking the signal That will be the signal when I call out Jesus Seigneur But give us your word that you will come too D Artagnan said Athos I swear I will by Heaven Tis settled said Aramis at the cry Jesus Seigneur we go out upset all that stands in our way run to our horses jump into our saddles spur them is that all Exactly See Aramis as I have told you D Artagnan is first amongst us all said Athos Very true replied the Gascon but I always run away from compliments Don t forget the signal Jesus Seigneur and he went out as he came in whistling the self same air The soldiers were playing or sleeping two of them were singing in a corner out of tune the psalm On the rivers of Babylon D Artagnan called the sergeant My dear friend General Cromwell has sent Monsieur Mordaunt to fetch me Guard the prisoners well I beg of you The sergeant made a sign as much as to say he did not understand French and D Artagnan tried to make him comprehend by signs and gestures Then he went into the stable he found the five horses saddled his own amongst the rest Each of you take a horse by the bridle he said to Porthos and Mousqueton turn to the left so that Athos and Aramis may see you clearly from the window They are coming then said Porthos In a moment You didn t forget my purse No be easy Good Porthos and Mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their post Then D Artagnan being alone struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the soldiers There caressing as he pretended the animal with his hand he put this bit of burning tinder in his ear It was necessary to be as good a horseman as he was to risk such a scheme for no sooner had the animal felt the burning tinder than he uttered a cry of pain and reared and jumped as if he had been mad The soldiers whom he was nearly trampling ran away Help help cried D Artagnan stop my horse has the staggers In an instant the horse s eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with foam Help cried D Artagnan What will you let me be killed Jesus Seigneur No sooner had he uttered this cry than the door opened and Athos and Aramis rushed out The coast owing to the Gascon s stratagem was clear The prisoners are escaping the prisoners are escaping cried the sergeant Stop stop cried D Artagnan giving rein to his famous steed who darting forth overturned several men Stop stop cried the soldiers and ran for their arms But the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to the nearest gate In the middle of the street they saw Grimaud and Blaisois who were coming to find their masters With one wave of his hand Athos made Grimaud who followed the little troop understand everything and they passed on like a whirlwind D Artagnan still directing them from behind with his voice They passed through the gate like apparitions without the guards thinking of detaining them and reached the open country All this time the soldiers were calling out Stop stop and the sergeant who began to see that he was the victim of an artifice was almost in a frenzy of despair Whilst all this was going on a cavalier in full gallop was seen approaching It was Mordaunt with the order in his hand The prisoners he exclaimed jumping off his horse The sergeant had not the courage to reply he showed him the open door the empty room Mordaunt darted to the steps understood all uttered a cry as if his very heart was pierced and fell fainting on the stone steps fifty nine Noble Natures never lose Courage nor good Stomachs their Appetites The little troop without looking behind them or exchanging a word fled at a rapid gallop fording a little stream of which none of them knew the name and leaving on their left a town which Athos declared to be Durham At last they came in sight of a small wood and spurring their horses afresh rode in its direction As soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently thick to conceal them from the sight of any one who might be in pursuit they drew up to hold a council together The two grooms held the horses that they might take a little rest without being unsaddled and Grimaud was posted as sentinel Come first of all said Athos to D Artagnan my friend that I may shake hands with you you our rescuer you the true hero of us all Athos is right you have my adoration said Aramis in his turn pressing his hand To what are you not equal with your superior intelligence infallible eye your arm of iron and your enterprising mind Now said the Gascon that is all well I accept for Porthos and myself everything thanks and compliments we have plenty of time to spare The two friends recalled by D Artagnan to what was also due to Porthos pressed his hand in their turn And now said Athos it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen but we must map up our campaign What shall we do What are we going to do i faith It is not very difficult to say Tell us then D Artagnan We are going to reach the nearest seaport unite our little resources hire a vessel and return to France As for me I will give my last sou for it Life is the greatest treasure and speaking candidly ours hangs by a thread What do you say to this Du Vallon I said Porthos I am entirely of D Artagnan s opinion this is a beastly country this England You are quite decided then to leave it asked Athos of D Artagnan Egad I don t see what is to keep me here A glance was exchanged between Athos and Aramis Go then my friends said the former sighing How go then exclaimed D Artagnan Let us go you mean No my friend said Athos you must leave us Leave you cried D Artagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement Bah said Porthos why separate since we are all together Because you can and ought to return to France your mission is accomplished but ours is not Your mission is not accomplished exclaimed D Artagnan looking in astonishment at Athos No my friend replied Athos in his gentle but decided voice we came here to defend King Charles we have but ill defended him it remains for us to save him To save the king said D Artagnan looking at Aramis as he had looked at Athos Aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head D Artagnan s countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion he began to think he had to do with madmen You cannot be speaking seriously Athos said he the king is surrounded by an army which is conducting him to London This army is commanded by a butcher or the son of a butcher it matters little Colonel Harrison His majesty I can assure you will be tried on his arrival in London I have heard enough from the lips of Oliver Cromwell to know what to expect A second look was exchanged between Athos and Aramis And when the trial is ended there will be no delay in putting the sentence into execution continued D Artagnan And to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned asked Athos The penalty of death I greatly fear they have gone too far for him to pardon them and there is nothing left to them but one thing and that is to kill him Have you never heard what Oliver Cromwell said when he came to Paris and was shown the dungeon at Vincennes where Monsieur de Vendome was imprisoned What did he say asked Porthos Princes must be knocked on the head I remember it said Athos And you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution now that he has got hold of the king On the contrary I am certain he will do so But then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head so threatened Athos you are becoming mad No my friend Athos gently replied but De Winter sought us out in France and introduced us Monsieur d Herblay and myself to Madame Henrietta Her majesty did us the honor to ask our aid for her husband We engaged our word our word included everything It was our strength our intelligence our life in short that we promised It remains now for us to keep our word Is that your opinion D Herblay Yes said Aramis we have promised Then continued Athos we have another reason it is this listen In France at this moment everything is poor and paltry We have a king ten years old who doesn t yet know what he wants we have a queen blinded by a belated passion we have a minister who governs France as he would govern a great farm that is to say intent only on turning out all the gold he can by the exercise of Italian cunning and invention we have princes who set up a personal and egotistic opposition who will draw from Mazarin s hands only a few ingots of gold or some shreds of power granted as bribes I have served them without enthusiasm God knows that I estimated them at their real value and that they are not high in my esteem but on principle To day I am engaged in a different affair I have encountered misfortune in a high place a royal misfortune a European misfortune I attach myself to it If we can succeed in saving the king it will be good if we die for him it will be grand So you know beforehand you must perish said D Artagnan We fear so and our only regret is to die so far from both of you What will you do in a foreign land an enemy s country I traveled in England when I was young I speak English like an Englishman and Aramis too knows something of the language Ah if we had you my friends With you D Artagnan with you Porthos all four reunited for the first time for twenty years we would dare not only England but the three kingdoms put together And did you promise the queen resumed D Artagnan petulantly to storm the Tower of London to kill a hundred thousand soldiers to fight victoriously against the wishes of the nation and the ambition of a man and when that man is Cromwell Do not exaggerate your duty In Heaven s name my dear Athos do not make a useless sacrifice When I see you merely you look like a reasonable being when you speak I seem to have to do with a madman Come Porthos join me say frankly what do you think of this business Nothing good replied Porthos Come continued D Artagnan who irritated that instead of listening to him Athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts you have never found yourself the worse for my advice Well then believe me Athos your mission is ended and ended nobly return to France with us Friend said Athos our resolution is irrevocable Then you have some other motive unknown to us Athos smiled and D Artagnan struck his hand together in anger and muttered the most convincing reasons that he could discover but to all these reasons Athos contented himself by replying with a calm sweet smile and Aramis by nodding his head Very well cried D Artagnan at last furious very well since you wish it let us leave our bones in this beggarly land where it is always cold where fine weather is a fog fog is rain and rain a deluge where the sun represents the moon and the moon a cream cheese in truth whether we die here or elsewhere matters little since we must die Only reflect my good fellow said Athos it is but dying rather sooner Pooh a little sooner or a little later it isn t worth quarreling over If I am astonished at anything remarked Porthos sententiously it is that it has not already happened Oh it will happen you may be sure said D Artagnan So it is agreed and if Porthos makes no objection I said Porthos I will do whatever you please and besides I think what the Comte de la Fere said just now is very good But your future career D Artagnan your ambition Porthos Our future our ambition replied D Artagnan with feverish volubility Need we think of that since we are to save the king The king saved we shall assemble our friends together we will head the Puritans reconquer England we shall re enter London place him securely on his throne And he will make us dukes and peers said Porthos whose eyes sparkled with joy at this imaginary prospect Or he will forget us added D Artagnan Oh said Porthos Well that has happened friend Porthos It seems to me that we once rendered Anne of Austria a service not much less than that which to day we are trying to perform for Charles I but none the less Anne of Austria has forgotten us for twenty years Well in spite of that D Artagnan said Athos you are not sorry that you were useful to her No indeed said D Artagnan I admit even that in my darkest moments I find consolation in that remembrance You see then D Artagnan though princes often are ungrateful God never is Athos said D Artagnan I believe that were you to fall in with the devil you would conduct yourself so well that you would take him with you to Heaven So then said Athos offering his hand to D Artagnan Tis settled replied D Artagnan I find England a charming country and I stay but on one condition only What is it That I am not forced to learn English Well now said Athos triumphantly I swear to you my friend by the God who hears us I believe that there is a power watching over us and that we shall all four see France again So be it said D Artagnan but I I confess I have a contrary conviction Our good D Artagnan said Aramis represents among us the opposition in parliament which always says no and always does aye But in the meantime saves the country added Athos Well now that everything is decided cried Porthos rubbing his hands suppose we think of dinner It seems to me that in the most critical positions of our lives we have always dined Oh yes speak of dinner in a country where for a feast they eat boiled mutton and as a treat drink beer What the devil did you come to such a country for Athos But I forgot added the Gascon smiling pardon I forgot you are no longer Athos but never mind let us hear your plan for dinner Porthos My plan Yes have you a plan No I am hungry that is all Pardieu if that is all I am hungry too but it is not everything to be hungry one must find something to eat unless we browse on the grass like our horses Ah exclaimed Aramis who was not quite so indifferent to the good things of the earth as Athos do you remember when we were at Parpaillot the beautiful oysters that we ate And the legs of mutton of the salt marshes said Porthos smacking his lips But suggested D Artagnan have we not our friend Mousqueton who managed for us so well at Chantilly Porthos Yes said Porthos we have Mousqueton but since he has been steward he has become very heavy never mind let us call him and to make sure that he will reply agreeably Here Mouston cried Porthos Mouston appeared with a most piteous face What is the matter my dear M Mouston asked D Artagnan Are you ill Sir I am very hungry replied Mouston Well it is just for that reason that we have called you my good M Mouston Could you not procure us a few of those nice little rabbits and some of those delicious partridges of which you used to make fricassees at the hotel Faith I do not remember the name of the hotel At the hotel of said Porthos by my faith nor do I remember it either It does not matter and a few of those bottles of old Burgundy wine which cured your master so quickly of his sprain Alas sir said Mousqueton I much fear that what you ask for are very rare things in this detestable and barren country and I think we should do better to go and seek hospitality from the owner of a little house we see on the fringe of the forest How is there a house in the neighborhood asked D Artagnan Yes sir replied Mousqueton Well let us as you say go and ask a dinner from the master of that house What is your opinion gentlemen and does not M Mouston s suggestion appear to you full of sense Oh said Aramis suppose the master is a Puritan So much the better mordioux replied D Artagnan if he is a Puritan we will inform him of the capture of the king and in honor of the news he will kill for us his fatted hens But if he should be a cavalier said Porthos In that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowls You are very happy exclaimed Athos laughing in spite of himself at the sally of the irresistible Gascon for you see the bright side of everything What would you have said D Artagnan I come from a land where there is not a cloud in the sky It is not like this then said Porthos stretching out his hand to assure himself whether a chill sensation he felt on his cheek was not really caused by a drop of rain Come come said D Artagnan more reason why we should start on our journey Halloo Grimaud Grimaud appeared Well Grimaud my friend have you seen anything asked the Gascon Nothing replied Grimaud Those idiots cried Porthos they have not even pursued us Oh if we had been in their place Yes they are wrong said D Artagnan I would willingly have said two words to Mordaunt in this little desert It is an excellent spot for bringing down a man in proper style I think decidedly observed Aramis gentlemen that the son hasn t his mother s energy What my good fellow replied Athos wait awhile we have scarcely left him two hours ago he does not know yet in what direction we came nor where we are We may say that he is not equal to his mother when we put foot in France if we are not poisoned or killed before then Meanwhile let us dine suggested Porthos I faith yes said Athos for I am hungry Look out for the black fowls cried Aramis And the four friends guided by Mousqueton took up the way toward the house already almost restored to their former gayety for they were now as Athos had said all four once more united and of single mind sixty Respect to Fallen Majesty As our fugitives approached the house they found the ground cut up as if a considerable body of horsemen had preceded them Before the door the traces were yet more apparent these horsemen whoever they might be had halted there Egad cried D Artagnan it s quite clear that the king and his escort have been by here The devil said Porthos in that case they have eaten everything Bah said D Artagnan they will have left a chicken at least He dismounted and knocked on the door There was no response He pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted Well cried Porthos I can see nobody said D Artagnan Aha What Blood At this word the three friends leaped from their horses and entered D Artagnan had already opened the door of the second room and from the expression of his face it was clear that he there beheld some extraordinary object The three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground bathed in a pool of blood It was evident that he had attempted to regain his bed but had not had sufficient strength to do so Athos who imagined that he saw him move was the first to go up to him Well inquired D Artagnan Well if he is dead said Athos he has not been so long for he is still warm But no his heart is beating Ho there my friend The wounded man heaved a sigh D Artagnan took some water in the hollow of his hand and threw it upon his face The man opened his eyes made an effort to raise his head and fell back again The wound was in the top of his skull and blood was flawing copiously Aramis dipped a cloth into some water and applied it to the gash Again the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these strangers who appeared to pity him You are among friends said Athos in English so cheer up and tell us if you have the strength to do so what has happened The king muttered the wounded man the king is a prisoner You have seen him asked Aramis in the same language The man made no reply Make your mind easy resumed Athos we are all faithful servants of his majesty Is what you tell me true asked the wounded man On our honor as gentlemen Then I may tell you all I am brother to Parry his majesty s lackey Athos and Aramis remembered that this was the name by which De Winter had called the man they had found in the passage of the king s tent We know him said Athos he never left the king Yes that is he Well he thought of me when he saw the king was taken and as they were passing before the house he begged in the king s name that they would stop as the king was hungry They brought him into this room and placed sentinels at the doors and windows Parry knew this room as he had often been to see me when the king was at Newcastle He knew that there was a trap door communicating with a cellar from which one could get into the orchard He made a sign which I understood but the king s guards must have noticed it and held themselves on guard I went out as if to fetch wood passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar and whilst Parry was gently bolting the door pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow me Alas he would not But Parry clasped his hands and implored him and at last he agreed I went on first fortunately The king was a few steps behind me when suddenly I saw something rise up in front of me like a huge shadow I wanted to cry out to warn the king but that very moment I felt a blow as if the house was falling on my head and fell insensible When I came to myself again I was stretched in the same place I dragged myself as far as the yard The king and his escort were no longer there I spent perhaps an hour in coming from the yard to this place then my strength gave out and I fainted again And now how are you feeling Very ill replied the wounded man Can we do anything for you asked Athos Help to put me on the bed I think I shall feel better there Have you any one to depend on for assistance My wife is at Durham and may return at any moment But you is there nothing that you want We came here with the intention of asking for something to eat Alas they have taken everything there isn t a morsel of bread in the house You hear D Artagnan said Athos we shall have to look elsewhere for our dinner It is all one to me now said D Artagnan I am no longer hungry Faith neither am I said Porthos They carried the man to his bed and called Grimaud to dress the wound In the service of the four friends Grimaud had had so frequent occasion to make lint and bandages that he had become something of a surgeon In the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room where they took counsel together Now said Aramis we know how the matter stands The king and his escort have gone this way we had better take the opposite direction eh Athos did not reply he reflected Yes said Porthos let us take the opposite direction if we follow the escort we shall find everything devoured and die of hunger What a confounded country this England is This is the first time I have gone without my dinner for ten years and it is generally my best meal What do you think D Artagnan asked Athos Do you agree with Aramis Not at all said D Artagnan I am precisely of the contrary opinion What you would follow the escort exclaimed Porthos in dismay No I would join the escort Athos s eyes shone with joy Join the escort cried Aramis Let D Artagnan speak said Athos you know he always has wise advice to give Clearly said D Artagnan we must go where they will not look for us Now they will be far from looking for us among the Puritans therefore with the Puritans we must go Good my friend good said Athos It is excellent advice I was about to give it when you anticipated me That then is your opinion asked Aramis Yes They will think we are trying to leave England and will search for us at the ports meanwhile we shall reach London with the king Once in London we shall be hard to find without considering continued Athos throwing a glance at Aramis the chances that may come to us on the way Yes said Aramis I understand I however do not understand said Porthos But no matter since it is at the same time the opinion of D Artagnan and of Athos it must be the best But said Aramis shall we not be suspected by Colonel Harrison Egad cried D Artagnan he s just the man I count upon Colonel Harrison is one of our friends We have met him twice at General Cromwell s He knows that we were sent from France by Monsieur Mazarin he will consider us as brothers Besides is he not a butcher s son Well then Porthos shall show him how to knock down an ox with a blow of the fist and I how to trip up a bull by taking him by the horns That will insure his confidence Athos smiled You are the best companion that I know D Artagnan he said offering his hand to the Gascon and I am very happy in having found you again my dear son This was as we have seen the term which Athos applied to D Artagnan in his more expansive moods At this moment Grimaud came in He had stanched the wound and the man was better The four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any message for him to his brother Tell him answered the brave man to let the king know that they have not killed me outright However insignificant I am I am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my death Be easy said D Artagnan he will know all before night The little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league ahead My dear friends said D Artagnan give your swords to Monsieur Mouston who will return them to you at the proper time and place and do not forget you are our prisoners It was not long before they joined the escort The king was riding in front surrounded by troopers and when he saw Athos and Aramis a glow of pleasure lighted his pale cheeks D Artagnan passed to the head of the column and leaving his friends under the guard of Porthos went straight to Harrison who recognized him as having met him at Cromwell s and received him as politely as a man of his breeding and disposition could It turned out as D Artagnan had foreseen The colonel neither had nor could have any suspicion They halted for the king to dine This time however due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape In the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the officers Will you dine with me asked Harrison of D Artagnan Gad I should be very happy but I have my companion Monsieur du Vallon and the two prisoners whom I cannot leave Let us manage it better Have a table set for us in a corner and send us whatever you like from yours Good answered Harrison The matter was arranged as D Artagnan had suggested and when he returned he found the king already seated at his little table where Parry waited on him Harrison and his officers sitting together at another table and in a corner places reserved for himself and his companions The table at which the Puritan officers were seated was round and whether by chance or coarse intention Harrison sat with his back to the king The king saw the four gentlemen come in but appeared to take no notice of them They sat down in such a manner as to turn their backs on nobody The officers table and that of the king were opposite to them I faith colonel said D Artagnan we are very grateful for your gracious invitation for without you we ran the risk of going without dinner as we have without breakfast My friend here Monsieur du Vallon shares my gratitude for he was particularly hungry And I am so still said Porthos bowing to Harrison And how said Harrison laughing did this serious calamity of going without breakfast happen to you In a very simple manner colonel said D Artagnan I was in a hurry to join you and took the road you had already gone by You can understand our disappointment when arriving at a pretty little house on the skirts of a wood which at a distance had quite a gay appearance with its red roof and green shutters we found nothing but a poor wretch bathed Ah colonel pay my respects to the officer of yours who struck that blow Yes said Harrison laughing and looking over at one of the officers seated at his table When Groslow undertakes this kind of thing there s no need to go over the ground a second time Ah it was this gentleman said D Artagnan bowing to the officer I am sorry he does not speak French that I might tender him my compliments I am ready to receive and return them sir said the officer in pretty good French for I resided three years in Paris Then sir allow me to assure you that your blow was so well directed that you have nearly killed your man Nearly I thought I had quite said Groslow No It was a very near thing but he is not dead As he said this D Artagnan gave a glance at Parry who was standing in front of the king to show him that the news was meant for him The king too who had listened in the greatest agony now breathed again Hang it said Groslow I thought I had succeeded better If it were not so far from here to the house I would return and finish him And you would do well if you are afraid of his recovering for you know if a wound in the head does not kill at once it is cured in a week And D Artagnan threw a second glance toward Parry on whose face such an expression of joy was manifested that Charles stretched out his hand to him smiling Parry bent over his master s hand and kissed it respectfully I ve a great desire to drink the king s health said Athos Let me propose it then said D Artagnan Do said Aramis Porthos looked at D Artagnan quite amazed at the resources with which his companion s Gascon sharpness continually supplied him D Artagnan took up his camp tin cup filled it with wine and arose Gentlemen said he let us drink to him who presides at the repast Here s to our colonel and let him know that we are always at his commands as far as London and farther And as D Artagnan as he spoke looked at Harrison the colonel imagined the toast was for himself He arose and bowed to the four friends whose eyes were fixed on Charles while Harrison emptied his glass without the slightest misgiving The king in return looked at the four gentlemen and drank with a smile full of nobility and gratitude Come gentlemen cried Harrison regardless of his illustrious captive let us be off Where do we sleep colonel At Thirsk replied Harrison Parry said the king rising too my horse I desire to go to Thirsk Egad said D Artagnan to Athos your king has thoroughly taken me and I am quite at his service If what you say is sincere replied Athos he will never reach London How so Because before then we shall have carried him off Well this time Athos said D Artagnan upon my word you are mad Have you some plan in your head then asked Aramis Ay said Porthos the thing would not be impossible with a good plan I have none said Athos but D Artagnan will discover one D Artagnan shrugged his shoulders and they proceeded sixty one D Artagnan hits on a Plan As night closed in they arrived at Thirsk The four friends appeared to be entire strangers to one another and indifferent to the precautions taken for guarding the king They withdrew to a private house and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety they occupied but one room and provided an exit which might be useful in case of an attack The lackeys were sent to their several posts except that Grimaud lay on a truss of straw across the doorway D Artagnan was thoughtful and seemed for the moment to have lost his usual loquacity Porthos who could never see anything that was not self evident talked to him as usual He replied in monosyllables and Athos and Aramis looked significantly at one another Next morning D Artagnan was the first to rise He had been down to the stables already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary orders for the day whilst Athos and Aramis were still in bed and Porthos snoring At eight o clock the march was resumed in the same order as the night before except that D Artagnan left his friends and began to renew the acquaintance which he had already struck up with Monsieur Groslow Groslow whom D Artagnan s praises had greatly pleased welcomed him with a gracious smile Really sir D Artagnan said to him I am pleased to find one with whom to talk in my own poor tongue My friend Monsieur du Vallon is of a very melancholy disposition so much so that one can scarcely get three words out of him all day As for our two prisoners you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for conversation They are hot royalists said Groslow The more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the Stuart for whom I hope you re preparing a pretty trial Why said Groslow that is just what we are taking him to London for And you never by any chance lose sight of him I presume I should think not indeed You see he has a truly royal escort Ay there s no fear in the daytime but at night We redouble our precautions And what method of surveillance do you employ Eight men remain constantly in his room The deuce he is well guarded then But besides these eight men you doubtless place some guard outside Oh no Just think What would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men Two men how do you mean Yes the king and his lackey Oh then they allow the lackey to remain with him Yes Stuart begged this favor and Harrison consented Under pretense that he s a king it appears he cannot dress or undress without assistance Really captain said D Artagnan determined to continue on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced the more I listen to you the more surprised I am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak French You have lived three years in Paris May I ask what you were doing there My father who is a merchant placed me with his correspondent who in turn sent his son to join our house in London Were you pleased with Paris sir Yes but you are much in want of a revolution like our own not against your king who is a mere child but against that lazar of an Italian the queen s favorite Ah I am quite of your opinion sir and we should soon make an end of Mazarin if we had only a dozen officers like yourself without prejudices vigilant and incorruptible But said the officer I thought you were in his service and that it was he who sent you to General Cromwell That is to say I am in the king s service and that knowing he wanted to send some one to England I solicited the appointment so great was my desire to know the man of genius who now governs the three kingdoms So that when he proposed to us to draw our swords in honor of old England you see how we snapped up the proposition Yes I know that you charged by the side of Mordaunt On his right and left sir Ah there s another brave and excellent young man Do you know him asked the officer Yes very well Monsieur du Vallon and myself came from France with him It appears too you kept him waiting a long time at Boulogne What would you have I was like you and had a king in keeping Aha said Groslow what king Our own to be sure the little one Louis XIV And how long had you to take care of him Three nights and by my troth I shall always remember those three nights with a certain pleasure How do you mean I mean that my friends officers in the guards and mousquetaires came to keep me company and we passed the night in feasting drinking dicing Ah true said the Englishman with a sigh you Frenchmen are born boon companions And don t you play too when you are on guard Never said the Englishman In that case you must be horribly bored and have my sympathy The fact is I look to my turn for keeping guard with horror It s tiresome work to keep awake a whole night Yes but with a jovial partner and dice and guineas clinking on the cloth the night passes like a dream You don t like playing then On the contrary I do Lansquenet for instance Devoted to it I used to play almost every night in France And since your return to England I have not handled a card or dice box I sincerely pity you said D Artagnan with an air of profound compassion Look here said the Englishman Well To morrow I am on guard In Stuart s room Yes come and pass the night with me Impossible Impossible why so I play with Monsieur du Vallon every night Sometimes we don t go to bed at all Well what of that Why he would be annoyed if I did not play with him Does he play well I have seen him lose as much as two thousand pistoles laughing all the while till the tears rolled down Bring him with you then But how about our prisoners Let your servants guard them Yes and give them a chance of escaping said D Artagnan Why one of them is a rich lord from Touraine and the other a knight of Malta of noble family We have arranged the ransom of each of them two thousand on arriving in France We are reluctant to leave for a single moment men whom our lackeys know to be millionaires It is true we plundered them a little when we took them and I will even confess that it is their purse that Monsieur du Vallon and I draw on in our nightly play Still they may have concealed some precious stone some valuable diamond so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their treasures We have made ourselves the constant guardians of our men and while I sleep Monsieur du Vallon watches Ah ah said Groslow You see then why I must decline your polite invitation which is especially attractive to me because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after night with the same person the chances always balance and at the month s end nothing is gained or lost Ah said Groslow sighing there is something still more wearisome and that is not to play at all I can understand that said D Artagnan But come resumed the Englishman are these men of yours dangerous In what respect Are they capable of attempting violence D Artagnan burst out laughing at the idea Jesus Dieu he cried one of them is trembling with fever having failed to adapt himself to this charming country of yours and the other is a knight of Malta as timid as a young girl and for greater security we have taken from them even their penknives and pocket scissors Well then said Groslow bring them with you But really said D Artagnan I have eight men on guard you know Four of them can guard the king and the other four your prisoners I ll manage it somehow you will see But said D Artagnan now I think of it what is to prevent our beginning to night Nothing at all said Groslow Just so Come to us this evening and to morrow we ll return your visit Capital This evening with you to morrow at Stuart s the next day with me You see that with a little forethought one can lead a merry life anywhere and everywhere said D Artagnan Yes with Frenchmen and Frenchmen like you And Monsieur du Vallon added the other You will see what a fellow he is a man who nearly killed Mazarin between two doors They employ him because they are afraid of him Ah there he is calling me now You ll excuse me I know They exchanged bows and D Artagnan returned to his companions What on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog exclaimed Porthos My dear fellow don t speak like that of Monsieur Groslow He s one of my most intimate friends One of your friends cried Porthos this butcher of unarmed farmers Hush my dear Porthos Monsieur Groslow is perhaps rather hasty it s true but at bottom I have discovered two good qualities in him he is conceited and stupid Porthos opened his eyes in amazement Athos and Aramis looked at one another and smiled they knew D Artagnan and knew that he did nothing without a purpose But continued D Artagnan you shall judge of him for yourself He is coming to play with us this evening Oho said Porthos his eyes glistening at the news Is he rich He s the son of one of the wealthiest merchants in London And knows lansquenet Adores it Basset His mania Biribi Revels in it Good said Porthos we shall pass an agreeable evening The more so as it will be the prelude to a better How so We invite him to play to night he has invited us in return to morrow But wait To night we stop at Derby and if there is a bottle of wine in the town let Mousqueton buy it It will be well to prepare a light supper of which you Athos and Aramis are not to partake Athos because I told him you had a fever Aramis because you are a knight of Malta and won t mix with fellows like us Do you understand That s no doubt very fine said Porthos but deuce take me if I understand at all Porthos my friend you know I am descended on the father s side from the Prophets and on the mother s from the Sybils and that I only speak in parables and riddles Let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see I can tell you nothing more at present Go ahead my friend said Athos I am sure that whatever you do is well done And you Aramis are you of that opinion Entirely so my dear D Artagnan Very good said D Artagnan here indeed are true believers it is a pleasure to work miracles before them they are not like that unbelieving Porthos who must see and touch before he will believe The fact is said Porthos with an air of finesse I am rather incredulous D Artagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended there At five in the evening they sent Mousqueton on before as agreed upon Blaisois went with him In crossing the principal street in Derby the four friends perceived Blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome house It was there a lodging was prepared for them At the hour agreed upon Groslow came D Artagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years standing Porthos scanned him from head to foot and smiled when he discovered that in spite of the blow he had administered to Parry s brother he was not nearly so strong as himself Athos and Aramis suppressed as well as they could the disgust they felt in the presence of such coarseness and brutality In short Groslow seemed to be pleased with his reception Athos and Aramis kept themselves to their role At midnight they withdrew to their chamber the door of which was left open on the pretext of kindly consideration Furthermore D Artagnan went with them leaving Porthos at play with Groslow Porthos gained fifty pistoles from Groslow and found him a more agreeable companion than he had at first believed him to be As to Groslow he promised himself that on the following evening he would recover from D Artagnan what he had lost to Porthos and on leaving reminded the Gascon of his appointment The next day was spent as usual D Artagnan went from Captain Groslow to Colonel Harrison and from Colonel Harrison to his friends To any one not acquainted with him he seemed to be in his normal condition but to his friends to Athos and Aramis was apparent a certain feverishness in his gayety What is he contriving asked Aramis Wait said Athos Porthos said nothing but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles he had gained from Groslow with a degree of satisfaction which betrayed itself in his whole bearing Arrived at Ryston D Artagnan assembled his friends His face had lost the expression of careless gayety it had worn like a mask the whole day Athos pinched Aramis s hand The moment is at hand he said Yes returned D Artagnan who had overheard him to night gentlemen we rescue the king D Artagnan said Athos this is no joke I trust It would quite cut me up You are a very odd man Athos he replied to doubt me thus Where and when have you seen me trifle with a friend s heart and a king s life I have told you and I repeat it that to night we rescue Charles I You left it to me to discover the means and I have done so Porthos looked at D Artagnan with an expression of profound admiration Aramis smiled as one who hopes Athos was pale and trembled in every limb Speak said Athos We are invited replied D Artagnan to pass the night with M Groslow But do you know where No In the king s room The king s room cried Athos Yes gentlemen in the king s room Groslow is on guard there this evening and to pass the time away he has invited us to keep him company All four of us asked Athos Pardieu certainly all four we couldn t leave our prisoners could we Ah ah said Aramis Tell us about it said Athos palpitating We are going then we two with our swords you with daggers We four have got to master these eight fools and their stupid captain Monsieur Porthos what do you say to that I say it is easy enough answered Porthos We dress the king in Groslow s clothes Mousqueton Grimaud and Blaisois have our horses saddled at the end of the first street We mount them and before daylight are twenty leagues distant Athos placed his two hands on D Artagnan s shoulders and gazed at him with his calm sad smile I declare my friend said he that there is not a creature under the sky who equals you in prowess and in courage Whilst we thought you indifferent to our sorrows which you couldn t share without crime you alone among us have discovered what we were searching for in vain I repeat it D Artagnan you are the best one among us I bless and love you my dear son And to think that I couldn t find that out said Porthos scratching his head it is so simple But said Aramis if I understand rightly we are to kill them all eh Athos shuddered and turned pale Mordioux answered D Artagnan I believe we must I confess I can discover no other safe and satisfactory way Let us see said Aramis how are we to act I have arranged two plans Firstly at a given signal which shall be the words At last you each plunge a dagger into the heart of the soldier nearest to you We on our side do the same That will be four killed We shall then be matched four against the remaining five If these five men give themselves up we gag them if they resist we kill them If by chance our Amphitryon changes his mind and receives only Porthos and myself why then we must resort to heroic measures and each give two strokes instead of one It will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper time But if you yourselves should be struck said Athos Impossible said D Artagnan those beer drinkers are too clumsy and awkward Besides you will strike at the throat Porthos it kills as quickly and prevents all outcry Very good said Porthos it will be a nice little throat cutting Horrible horrible exclaimed Athos Nonsense said D Artagnan you would do as much mister Humanity in a battle But if you think the king s life is not worth what it must cost there s an end of the matter and I send to Groslow to say I am ill No you are right said Athos At this moment a soldier entered to inform them that Groslow was waiting for them Where asked D Artagnan In the room of the English Nebuchadnezzar replied the staunch Puritan Good replied Athos whose blood mounted to his face at the insult offered to royalty tell the captain we are coming The Puritan then went out The lackeys had been ordered to saddle eight horses and to wait keeping together and without dismounting at the corner of a street about twenty steps from the house where the king was lodged It was nine o clock in the evening the sentinels had been relieved at eight and Captain Groslow had been on guard for an hour D Artagnan and Porthos armed with their swords and Athos and Aramis each carrying a concealed poniard approached the house which for the time being was Charles Stuart s prison The two latter followed their captors in the humble guise of captives without arms Od s bodikins said Groslow as the four friends entered I had almost given you up D Artagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear The fact is we that is Monsieur du Vallon and I hesitated a little And why D Artagnan looked significantly toward Athos and Aramis Aha said Groslow on account of political opinions No matter On the contrary he added laughing if they want to see their Stuart they shall see him Are we to pass the night in the king s room asked D Artagnan No but in the one next to it and as the door will remain open it comes to the same thing Have you provided yourself with money I assure you I intend to play the devil s game to night D Artagnan rattled the gold in his pockets Very good said Groslow and opened the door of the room I will show you the way and he went in first D Artagnan turned to look at his friends Porthos was perfectly indifferent Athos pale but resolute Aramis was wiping a slight moisture from his brow The eight guards were at their posts Four in the king s room two at the door between the rooms and two at that by which the friends had entered Athos smiled when he saw their bare swords he felt it was no longer to be a butchery but a fight and he resumed his usual good humor Charles was perceived through the door lying dressed upon his bed at the head of which Parry was seated reading in a low voice a chapter from the Bible A candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer far less calm From time to time Parry stopped thinking the king whose eyes were closed was really asleep but Charles would open his eyes and say with a smile Go on my good Parry I am listening Groslow advanced to the door of the king s room replaced on his head the hat he had taken off to receive his guests looked for a moment contemptuously at this simple yet touching scene then turning to D Artagnan assumed an air of triumph at what he had achieved Capital cried the Gascon you would make a distinguished general And do you think asked Groslow that Stuart will ever escape while I am on guard No to be sure replied D Artagnan unless forsooth the sky rains friends upon him Groslow s face brightened It is impossible to say whether Charles who kept his eyes constantly closed had noticed the insolence of the Puritan captain but the moment he heard the clear tone of D Artagnan s voice his eyelids rose in spite of himself Parry too started and stopped reading What are you thinking about said the king go on my good Parry unless you are tired Parry resumed his reading On a table in the next room were lighted candles cards two dice boxes and dice Gentlemen said Groslow I beg you will take your places I will sit facing Stuart whom I like so much to see especially where he now is and you Monsieur d Artagnan opposite to me Athos turned red with rage D Artagnan frowned at him That s it said D Artagnan you Monsieur le Comte de la Fere to the right of Monsieur Groslow You Chevalier d Herblay to his left Du Vallon next me You ll bet for me and those gentlemen for Monsieur Groslow By this arrangement D Artagnan could nudge Porthos with his knee and make signs with his eyes to Athos and Aramis At the names Comte de la Fere and Chevalier d Herblay Charles opened his eyes and raising his noble head in spite of himself threw a glance at all the actors in the scene At that moment Parry turned over several leaves of his Bible and read with a loud voice this verse in Jeremiah God said Hear ye the words of the prophets my servants whom I have sent unto you The four friends exchanged glances The words that Parry had read assured them that their presence was understood by the king and was assigned to its real motive D Artagnan s eyes sparkled with joy You asked me just now if I was in funds said D Artagnan placing some twenty pistoles upon the table Well in my turn I advise you to keep a sharp lookout on your treasure my dear Monsieur Groslow for I can tell you we shall not leave this without robbing you of it Not without my defending it said Groslow So much the better said D Artagnan Fight my dear captain fight You know or you don t know that that is what we ask of you Oh yes said Groslow bursting with his usual coarse laugh I know you Frenchmen want nothing but cuts and bruises Charles had heard and understood it all A slight color mounted to his cheeks The soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs little by little and under the pretense of much heat throw off the Scotch plaid which covered him Athos and Aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying with his clothes on The game began The luck had turned and Groslow having won some hundred pistoles was in the merriest possible humor Porthos who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and thirty more besides was very cross and questioned D Artagnan with a nudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be time to change the game Athos and Aramis looked at him inquiringly But D Artagnan remained impassible It struck ten They heard the guard going its rounds How many rounds do they make a night asked D Artagnan drawing more pistoles from his pocket Five answered Groslow one every two hours D Artagnan glanced at Athos and Aramis and for the first time replied to Porthos s nudge of the knee by a nudge responsive Meanwhile the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the king s room attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men had stolen little by little toward the table and standing on tiptoe lounged watching the game over the shoulders of D Artagnan and Porthos Those on the other side had followed their example thus favoring the views of the four friends who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about the chamber The two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed but they were leaning on them while they watched the game Athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached With his white aristocratic hands he played with the louis bending and straightening them again as if they were made of pewter Aramis less self controlled fumbled continually with his hidden poniard Porthos impatient at his continued losses kept up a vigorous play with his knee D Artagnan turned mechanically looking behind him and between the figures of two soldiers he could see Parry standing up and Charles leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering a fervent prayer to God D Artagnan saw that the moment was come He darted a preparatory glance at Athos and Aramis who slyly pushed their chairs a little back so as to leave themselves more space for action He gave Porthos a second nudge of the knee and Porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took care at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn smoothly from the scabbard Hang it cried D Artagnan another twenty pistoles lost Really Captain Groslow you are too much in fortune s way This can t last and he drew another twenty from his pocket One more turn captain twenty pistoles on one throw only one the last Done for twenty replied Groslow And he turned up two cards as usual a king for D Artagnan and an ace for himself A king said D Artagnan it s a good omen Master Groslow look out for the king And in spite of his extraordinary self control there was a strange vibration in the Gascon s voice which made his partner start Groslow began turning the cards one after another If he turned up an ace first he won if a king he lost He turned up a king At last cried D Artagnan At this word Athos and Aramis jumped up Porthos drew back a step Daggers and swords were just about to shine when suddenly the door was thrown open and Harrison appeared in the doorway accompanied by a man enveloped in a large cloak Behind this man could be seen the glistening muskets of half a dozen soldiers Groslow jumped up ashamed at being surprised in the midst of wine cards and dice But Harrison paid not the least attention to him and entering the king s room followed by his companion Charles Stuart said he an order has come to conduct you to London without stopping day or night Prepare yourself then to start at once And by whom is this order given asked the king By General Oliver Cromwell And here is mister Mordaunt who has brought it and is charged with its execution Mordaunt muttered the four friends exchanging glances D Artagnan swept up the money that he and Porthos had lost and buried it in his huge pocket Athos and Aramis placed themselves behind him At this movement Mordaunt turned around recognized them and uttered an exclamation of savage delight I m afraid we are prisoners whispered D Artagnan to his friend Not yet replied Porthos Colonel colonel cried Mordaunt you are betrayed These four Frenchmen have escaped from Newcastle and no doubt want to carry off the king Arrest them Ah my young man said D Artagnan drawing his sword that is an order sooner given than executed Fly friends fly he added whirling his sword around him The next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the soldiers who guarded it before they had time to cock their muskets Athos and Aramis followed him Porthos brought up the rear and before soldiers officers or colonel had time to recover their surprise all four were in the street Fire cried Mordaunt fire upon them Three or four shots were fired but with no other result than to show the four fugitives turning the corner of the street safe and sound The horses were at the place fixed upon and they leaped lightly into their saddles Forward cried D Artagnan and spur for your dear lives They galloped away and took the road they had come by in the morning namely in the direction toward Scotland A few hundred yards beyond the town D Artagnan drew rein Halt he cried this time we shall be pursued We must let them leave the village and ride after us on the northern road and when they have passed we will take the opposite direction There was a stream close by and a bridge across it D Artagnan led his horse under the arch of the bridge The others followed Ten minutes later they heard the rapid gallop of a troop of horsemen A few minutes more and the troop passed over their heads sixty two London As soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance D Artagnan remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain followed by his three friends directing their course as well as they could guess toward London This time said D Artagnan when they were sufficiently distant to proceed at a trot I think all is lost and we have nothing better to do than to reach France What do you say Athos to that proposition Isn t it reasonable Yes dear friend Athos replied but you said a word the other day that was more than reasonable it was noble and generous You said Let us die here I recall to you that word Oh said Porthos death is nothing it isn t death that can disquiet us since we don t know what it is What troubles me is the idea of defeat As things are turning out I foresee that we must give battle to London to the provinces to all England and certainly in the end we can t fail to be beaten We ought to witness this great tragedy even to its last scene said Athos Whatever happens let us not leave England before the crisis Don t you agree with me Aramis Entirely my dear count Then too I confess I should not be sorry to come across Mordaunt again It appears to me that we have an account to settle with him and that it is not our custom to leave a place without paying our debts of this kind at least Ah that s another thing said D Artagnan and I should not mind waiting in London a whole year for a chance of meeting this Mordaunt in question Only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count for I imagine just now that Noll Cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with us Athos do you know any inn in the whole town where one can find white sheets roast beef reasonably cooked and wine which is not made of hops and gin I think I know what you want replied Athos De Winter took us to the house of a Spaniard who he said had become naturalized as an Englishman by the guineas of his new compatriots What do you say to it Aramis Why the idea of taking quarters with Senor Perez seems to me very reasonable and for my part I agree to it We will invoke the remembrance of that poor De Winter for whom he seemed to have a great regard we will tell him that we have come as amateurs to see what is going on we will spend with him a guinea each per day and I think that by taking all these precautions we can be quite undisturbed You forget Aramis one precaution of considerable importance What is that The precaution of changing our clothes Changing our clothes exclaimed Porthos I don t see why we are very comfortable in those we wear To prevent recognition said D Artagnan Our clothes have a cut which would proclaim the Frenchman at first sight Now I don t set sufficient store on the cut of my jerkin to risk being hung at Tyburn or sent for change of scene to the Indies I shall buy a chestnut colored suit I ve remarked that your Puritans revel in that color But can you find your man said Aramis to Athos Oh to be sure yes He lives at the Bedford Tavern Greenhall Street Besides I can find my way about the city with my eyes shut I wish we were already there said D Artagnan and my advice is that we reach London before daybreak even if we kill our horses Come on then said Athos for unless I am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to go The friends urged on their horses and arrived in fact at about five o clock in the morning They were stopped and questioned at the gate by which they sought to enter the city but Athos replied in excellent English that they had been sent forward by Colonel Harrison to announce to his colleague Monsieur Bridge the approach of the king That reply led to several questions about the king s capture and Athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished completely The way was therefore opened to the four friends with all sorts of Puritan congratulations Athos was right He went direct to the Bedford Tavern and the host who recognized him was delighted to see him again with such a numerous and promising company Though it was scarcely daylight our four travelers found the town in a great bustle owing to the reported approach of Harrison and the king The plan of changing their clothes was unanimously adopted The landlord sent out for every description of garment as if he wanted to fit up his wardrobe Athos chose a black coat which gave him the appearance of a respectable citizen Aramis not wishing to part with his sword selected a dark blue cloak of a military cut Porthos was seduced by a wine colored doublet and sea green breeches D Artagnan who had fixed on his color beforehand had only to select the shade and looked in his chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar dealer Now said D Artagnan for the actual man We must cut off our hair that the populace may not insult us As we no longer wear the sword of the gentleman we may as well have the head of the Puritan This as you know is the important point of distinction between the Covenanter and the Cavalier After some discussion this was agreed to and Mousqueton played the role of barber We look hideous said Athos And smack of the Puritan to a frightful extent said Aramis My head feels actually cold said Porthos As for me I feel anxious to preach a sermon said D Artagnan Now said Athos that we cannot even recognize one another and have therefore no fear of others recognizing us let us go and see the king s entrance They had not been long in the crowd before loud cries announced the king s arrival A carriage had been sent to meet him and the gigantic Porthos who stood a head above the entire rabble soon announced that he saw the royal equipage approaching D Artagnan raised himself on tiptoe and as the carriage passed saw Harrison at one window and Mordaunt at the other The next day Athos leaning out of his window which looked upon the most populous part of the city heard the Act of Parliament which summoned the ex king Charles I to the bar publicly cried Parliament indeed cried Athos Parliament can never have passed such an act as that At this moment the landlord came in Did parliament pass this act Athos asked of him in English Yes my lord the pure parliament What do you mean by the pure parliament Are there then two parliaments My friend D Artagnan interrupted as I don t understand English and we all understand Spanish have the kindness to speak to us in that language which since it is your own you must find pleasure in using when you have the chance Ah excellent said Aramis As to Porthos all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of the breakfast table You were asking then said the host in Spanish I asked said Athos in the same language if there are two parliaments a pure and an impure Why how extraordinary said Porthos slowly raising his head and looking at his friends with an air of astonishment I understand English then I understand what you say That is because we are talking Spanish my dear friend said Athos Oh the devil said Porthos I am sorry for that it would have been one language more When I speak of the pure parliament resumed the host I mean the one which Colonel Bridge has weeded Ah really said D Artagnan these people are very ingenious When I go back to France I must suggest some such convenient course to Cardinal Mazarin and the coadjutor One of them will weed the parliament in the name of the court and the other in the name of the people and then there won t be any parliament at all And who is this Colonel Bridge asked Aramis and how does he go to work to weed the parliament Colonel Bridge replied the Spaniard is a retired wagoner a man of much sense who made one valuable observation whilst driving his team namely that where there happened to be a stone on the road it was much easier to remove the stone than try and make the wheel pass over it Now of two hundred and fifty one members who composed the parliament there were one hundred and ninety one who were in the way and might have upset his political wagon He took them up just as he formerly used to take up the stones from the road and threw them out of the house Neat remarked D Artagnan Very And all these one hundred and ninety one were Royalists asked Athos Without doubt senor and you understand that they would have saved the king To be sure said Porthos with majestic common sense they were in the majority And you think said Aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal He will be forced to do so smiled the Spaniard Now Athos said D Artagnan do you begin to believe that it s a ruined cause and that what with your Harrisons Joyces Bridges and Cromwells we shall never get the upper hand The king will be delivered at the tribunal said Athos the very silence of his supporters indicates that they are at work D Artagnan shrugged his shoulders But said Aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or imprisonment D Artagnan whistled a little air of incredulity We shall see said Athos for we shall go to the sittings I presume You will not have long to wait said the landlord they begin to morrow So then they drew up the indictments before the king was taken Of course said D Artagnan they began the day he was sold And you know said Aramis that it was our friend Mordaunt who made if not the bargain at least the overtures And you know added D Artagnan that whenever I catch him I will kill him this Mordaunt And I too exclaimed Porthos And I too added Aramis Touching unanimity cried D Artagnan which well becomes good citizens like us Let us take a turn around the town and imbibe a little fog Yes said Porthos twill be at least a little change from beer sixty three The Trial The next morning King Charles I was haled by a strong guard before the high court which was to judge him All London was crowding to the doors of the house The throng was terrific and it was not till after much pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their destination When they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already occupied but being anxious not to be too conspicuous all with the exception of Porthos who had a fancy to display his red doublet were quite satisfied with their places the more so as chance had brought them to the centre of their row so that they were exactly opposite the arm chair prepared for the royal prisoner Toward eleven o clock the king entered the hall surrounded by guards but wearing his head covered and with a calm expression turned to every side with a look of complete assurance as if he were there to preside at an assembly of submissive subjects rather than to meet the accusations of a rebel court The judges proud of having a monarch to humiliate evidently prepared to enjoy the right they had arrogated to themselves and sent an officer to inform the king that it was customary for the accused to uncover his head Charles without replying a single word turned his head in another direction and pulled his felt hat over it Then when the officer was gone he sat down in the arm chair opposite the president and struck his boots with a little cane which he carried in his hand Parry who accompanied him stood behind him D Artagnan was looking at Athos whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king possessing more self control had banished from his own This agitation in one so cold and calm as Athos frightened him I hope he whispered to him that you will follow his majesty s example and not get killed for your folly in this den Set your mind at rest replied Athos Aha continued D Artagnan it is clear that they are afraid of something or other for look the sentinels are being reinforced They had only halberds before now they have muskets The halberds were for the audience in the rear the muskets are for us Thirty forty fifty sixty five men said Porthos counting the reinforcements Ah said Aramis but you forget the officer D Artagnan grew pale with rage He recognized Mordaunt who with bare sword was marshalling the musketeers behind the king and opposite the benches Do you think they have recognized us said D Artagnan In that case I should beat a retreat I don t care to be shot in a box No said Aramis he has not seen us He sees no one but the king Mon Dieu how he stares at him the insolent dog Does he hate his majesty as much as he does us Pardi answered Athos we only carried off his mother the king has spoiled him of his name and property True said Aramis but silence the president is speaking to the king Stuart Bradshaw was saying listen to the roll call of your judges and address to the court any observations you may have to make The king turned his head away as if these words had not been intended for him Bradshaw waited and as there was no reply there was a moment of silence Out of the hundred and sixty three members designated there were only seventy three present for the rest fearful of taking part in such an act had remained away When the name of Colonel Fairfax was called one of those brief but solemn silences ensued which announced the absence of the members who had no wish to take a personal part in the trial Colonel Fairfax repeated Bradshaw Fairfax answered a laughing voice the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of a woman is not such a fool as to be here A loud laugh followed these words pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own weakness a weakness which removes them beyond the power of vengeance It is a woman s voice cried Aramis faith I would give a good deal if she is young and pretty And he mounted on the bench to try and get a sight of her By my soul said Aramis she is charming Look D Artagnan everybody is looking at her and in spite of Bradshaw s gaze she has not turned pale It is Lady Fairfax herself said D Artagnan Don t you remember Porthos we saw her at General Cromwell s The roll call continued These rascals will adjourn when they find that they are not in sufficient force said the Comte de la Fere You don t know them Athos look at Mordaunt s smile Is that the look of a man whose victim is likely to escape him Ah cursed basilisk it will be a happy day for me when I can cross something more than a look with you The king is really very handsome said Porthos and look too though he is a prisoner how carefully he is dressed The feather in his hat is worth at least five and twenty pistoles Look at it Aramis The roll call finished the president ordered them to read the act of accusation Athos turned pale A second time he was disappointed in his expectation Notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue the king then was condemned in advance I told you so Athos said D Artagnan shrugging his shoulders Now take your courage in both hands and hear what this gentleman in black is going to say about his sovereign with full license and privilege Never till then had a more brutal accusation or meaner insults tarnished kingly majesty Charles listened with marked attention passing over the insults noting the grievances and when hatred overflowed all bounds and the accuser turned executioner beforehand replying with a smile of lofty scorn The fact is said D Artagnan if men are punished for imprudence and triviality this poor king deserves punishment But it seems to me that that which he is just now undergoing is hard enough In any case Aramis replied the punishment should fall not on the king but on his ministers for the first article of the constitution is The king can do no wrong As for me thought Porthos giving Mordaunt his whole attention were it not for breaking in on the majesty of the situation I would leap down from the bench reach Mordaunt in three bounds and strangle him I would then take him by the feet and knock the life out of these wretched musketeers who parody the musketeers of France Meantime D Artagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the king I must speak to him about it As to Athos his face aflame his fists clinched his lips bitten till they bled he sat there foaming with rage at that endless parliamentary insult and that long enduring royal patience the inflexible arm and steadfast heart had given place to a trembling hand and a body shaken by excitement At this moment the accuser concluded with these words The present accusation is preferred by us in the name of the English people At these words there was a murmur along the benches and a second voice not that of a woman but a man s stout and furious thundered behind D Artagnan You lie it cried Nine tenths of the English people are horrified at what you say This voice was that of Athos who standing up with outstretched hand and quite out of his mind thus assailed the public accuser King judges spectators all turned their eyes to the bench where the four friends were seated Mordaunt did the same and recognized the gentleman around whom the three other Frenchmen were standing pale and menacing His eyes glittered with delight He had discovered those to whose death he had devoted his life A movement of fury called to his side some twenty of his musketeers and pointing to the bench where his enemies were Fire on that bench he cried But with the rapidity of thought D Artagnan seized Athos by the waist and followed by Porthos with Aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed Charles also had recognized the four Frenchmen He put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes that he might not witness the slaying of his faithful friends Mordaunt pale and trembling with anger rushed from the hall sword in hand followed by six pikemen pushing inquiring and panting in the crowd and then having found nothing returned The tumult was indescribable More than half an hour passed before any one could make himself heard The judges were looking for a new outbreak from the benches The spectators saw the muskets leveled at them and divided between fear and curiosity remained noisy and excited Quiet was at length restored What have you to say in your defense asked Bradshaw of the king Then rising with his head still covered in the tone of a judge rather than a prisoner Charles began Before questioning me he said reply to my question I was free at Newcastle and had there concluded a treaty with both houses Instead of performing your part of this contract as I performed mine you bought me from the Scotch cheaply I know and that does honor to the economic talent of your government But because you have paid the price of a slave do you imagine that I have ceased to be your king No To answer you would be to forget it I shall only reply to you when you have satisfied me of your right to question me To answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges and I only acknowledge you as my executioners And in the middle of a deathlike silence Charles calm lofty and with his head still covered sat down again in his arm chair Why are not my Frenchmen here he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment they would have seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive and of their tears when dead Well said the president seeing that Charles was determined to remain silent so be it We will judge you in spite of your silence You are accused of treason of abuse of power and murder The evidence will support it Go and another sitting will accomplish what you have postponed in this Charles rose and turned toward Parry whom he saw pale and with his temples dewed with moisture Well my dear Parry said he what is the matter and what can affect you in this manner Oh my king said Parry with tears in his eyes and in a tone of supplication do not look to the left as we leave the hall And why Parry Do not look I implore you my king But what is the matter Speak said Charles attempting to look across the hedge of guards which surrounded him It is but you will not look will you it is because they have had the axe with which criminals are executed brought and placed there on the table The sight is hideous Fools said Charles do they take me for a coward like themselves You have done well to warn me Thank you Parry When the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the hall As he passed the table on which the axe was laid he stopped and turning with a smile said Ah the axe an ingenious device and well worthy of those who know not what a gentleman is you frighten me not executioner s axe added he touching it with the cane which he held in his hand and I strike you now waiting patiently and Christianly for you to return the blow And shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed on When he reached the door a stream of people who had been disappointed in not being able to get into the house and to make amends had collected to see him come out stood on each side as he passed many among them glaring on him with threatening looks How many people thought he and not one true friend And as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind a voice beside him said Respect to fallen majesty The king turned quickly around with tears in his eyes and heart It was an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive before him without rendering him this final homage But the next moment the unfortunate man was nearly killed with heavy blows of sword hilts and among those who set upon him the king recognized Captain Groslow Alas said Charles that is a severe chastisement for a very trifling fault He continued his walk but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces when a furious fellow leaning between two soldiers spat in the king s face as once an infamous and accursed Jew spit in the face of Jesus of Nazareth Loud roars of laughter and sullen murmurs arose together The crowd opened and closed again undulating like a stormy sea and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of Athos Charles wiped his face and said with a sad smile Poor wretch for half a crown he would do as much to his own father The king was not mistaken Athos and his friends again mingling with the throng were taking a last look at the martyr king When the soldier saluted Charles Athos s heart bounded for joy and that unfortunate on coming to himself found ten guineas that the French gentleman had slipped into his pocket But when the cowardly insulter spat in the face of the captive monarch Athos grasped his dagger But D Artagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried Wait Athos stopped D Artagnan leaning on Athos made a sign to Porthos and Aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several others The man took his way toward the city The four friends followed him The man who had the appearance of being a butcher descended a little steep and isolated street looking on to the river with two of his friends Arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed turned around and looking insolently at the Frenchmen passed some jests from one to another I don t know English Athos said D Artagnan but you know it and will interpret for me Then quickening their steps they passed the three men but turned back immediately and D Artagnan walked straight up to the butcher and touching him on the chest with the tip of his finger said to Athos Say this to him in English You are a coward You have insulted a defenseless man You have befouled the face of your king You must die Athos pale as a ghost repeated these words to the man who seeing the bodeful preparations that were making put himself in an attitude of defense Aramis at this movement drew his sword No cried D Artagnan no steel Steel is for gentlemen And seizing the butcher by the throat Porthos said he kill this fellow for me with a single blow Porthos raised his terrible fist which whistled through the air like a sling and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the insulter s skull and crushed it The man fell like an ox beneath the poleaxe His companions horror struck could neither move nor cry out Tell them this Athos resumed D Artagnan thus shall all die who forget that a captive man is sacred and that a captive king doubly represents the Lord Athos repeated D Artagnan s words The fellows looked at the body of their companion swimming in blood and then recovering voice and legs together ran screaming off Justice is done said Porthos wiping his forehead And now said D Artagnan to Athos entertain no further doubts about me I undertake all that concerns the king sixty four Whitehall The parliament condemned Charles to death as might have been foreseen Political judgments are generally vain formalities for the same passions which give rise to the accusation ordain to the condemnation Such is the atrocious logic of revolutions Although our friends were expecting that condemnation it filled them with grief D Artagnan whose mind was never more fertile in resources than in critical emergencies swore again that he would try all conceivable means to prevent the denouement of the bloody tragedy But by what means As yet he could form no definite plan all must depend on circumstances Meanwhile it was necessary at all hazards in order to gain time to put some obstacle in the way of the execution on the following day the day appointed by the judges The only way of doing that was to cause the disappearance of the London executioner The headsman out of the way the sentence could not be executed True they could send for the headsman of the nearest town but at least a day would be gained and a day might be sufficient for the rescue D Artagnan took upon himself that more than difficult task Another thing not less essential was to warn Charles Stuart of the attempt to be made so that he might assist his rescuers as much as possible or at least do nothing to thwart their efforts Aramis assumed that perilous charge Charles Stuart had asked that Bishop Juxon might be permitted to visit him Mordaunt had called on the bishop that very evening to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king and also of Cromwell s permission Aramis determined to obtain from the bishop through fear or by persuasion consent that he should enter in the bishop s place and clad in his sacerdotal robes the prison at Whitehall Finally Athos undertook to provide in any event the means of leaving England in case either of failure or of success The night having come they made an appointment to meet at eleven o clock at the hotel and each started out to fulfill his dangerous mission The palace of Whitehall was guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by the fierce anxiety of Cromwell who came and went or sent his generals or his agents continually Alone in his usual room lighted by two candles the condemned monarch gazed sadly on the luxury of his past greatness just as at the last hour one sees the images of life more mildly brilliant than of yore Parry had not quitted his master and since his condemnation had not ceased to weep Charles leaning on a table was gazing at a medallion of his wife and daughter he was waiting first for Juxon then for martyrdom At times he thought of those brave French gentlemen who had appeared to him from a distance of a hundred leagues fabulous and unreal like the forms that appear in dreams In fact he sometimes asked himself if all that was happening to him was not a dream or at least the delirium of a fever He rose and took a few steps as if to rouse himself from his torpor and went as far as the window he saw glittering below him the muskets of the guards He was thereupon constrained to admit that he was indeed awake and that his bloody dream was real Charles returned in silence to his chair rested his elbow on the table bowed his head upon his hand and reflected Alas he said to himself if I only had for a confessor one of those lights of the church whose soul has sounded all the mysteries of life all the littlenesses of greatness perhaps his utterance would overawe the voice that wails within my soul But I shall have a priest of vulgar mind whose career and fortune I have ruined by my misfortune He will speak to me of God and death as he has spoken to many another dying man not understanding that this one leaves his throne to an usurper his children to the cold contempt of public charity And he raised the medallion to his lips It was a dull foggy night A neighboring church clock slowly struck the hour The flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty room These were the ancestors of Charles standing back dimly in their tarnished frames An awful sadness enveloped the heart of Charles He buried his brow in his hands and thought of the world so beautiful when one is about to leave it of the caresses of children so pleasing and so sweet especially when one is parting from his children never to see them again then of his wife the noble and courageous woman who had sustained him to the last moment He drew from his breast the diamond cross and the star of the Garter which she had sent him by those generous Frenchmen he kissed it and then as he reflected that she would never again see those things till he lay cold and mutilated in the tomb there passed over him one of those icy shivers which may be called forerunners of death Then in that chamber which recalled to him so many royal souvenirs whither had come so many courtiers the scene of so much flattering homage alone with a despairing servant whose feeble soul could afford no support to his own the king at last yielded to sorrow and his courage sank to a level with that feebleness those shadows and that wintry cold That king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered cloth Suddenly the door opened an ecclesiastic in episcopal robes entered followed by two guards to whom the king waved an imperious gesture The guards retired the room resumed its obscurity Juxon cried Charles Juxon thank you my last friend you come at a fitting moment The bishop looked anxiously at the man sobbing in the ingle nook Come Parry said the king cease your tears If it s Parry said the bishop I have nothing to fear so allow me to salute your majesty and to tell you who I am and for what I am come At this sight and this voice Charles was about to cry out when Aramis placed his finger on his lips and bowed low to the king of England The chevalier murmured Charles Yes sire interrupted Aramis raising his voice Bishop Juxon the faithful knight of Christ obedient to your majesty s wishes Charles clasped his hands amazed and stupefied to find that these foreigners without other motive than that which their conscience imposed on them thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a king You he said you how did you penetrate hither If they recognize you you are lost Care not for me sire think only of yourself You see your friends are wakeful I know not what we shall do yet but four determined men can do much Meanwhile do not be surprised at anything that happens prepare yourself for every emergency Charles shook his head Do you know that I die to morrow at ten o clock Something your majesty will happen between now and then to make the execution impossible The king looked at Aramis with astonishment At this moment a strange noise like the unloading of a cart and followed by a cry of pain was heard beneath the window Do you hear said the king I hear said Aramis but I understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain I know not who can have uttered the cry said the king but the noise is easily understood Do you know that I am to be beheaded outside this window Well these boards you hear unloaded are the posts and planks to build my scaffold Some workmen must have fallen underneath them and been hurt Aramis shuddered in spite of himself You see said the king that it is useless for you to resist I am condemned leave me to my death My king said Aramis they well may raise a scaffold but they cannot make an executioner What do you mean asked the king I mean that at this hour the headsman has been got out of the way by force or persuasion The scaffold will be ready by to morrow but the headsman will be wanting and they will put it off till the day after to morrow What then said the king To morrow night we shall rescue you How can that be cried the king whose face was lighted up in spite of himself by a flash of joy Oh sir cried Parry may you and yours be blessed How can it be repeated the king I must know so that I may assist you if there is any chance I know nothing about it continued Aramis but the cleverest the bravest the most devoted of us four said to me when I left him Tell the king that to morrow at ten o clock at night we shall carry him off He has said it and will do it Tell me the name of that generous friend said the king that I may cherish for him an eternal gratitude whether he succeeds or not D Artagnan sire the same who had so nearly rescued you when Colonel Harrison made his untimely entrance You are indeed wonderful men said the king if such things had been related to me I should not have believed them Now sire resumed Aramis listen to me Do not forget for a single instant that we are watching over your safety observe the smallest gesture the least bit of song the least sign from any one near you watch everything hear everything interpret everything Oh chevalier cried the king what can I say to you There is no word though it should come from the profoundest depth of my heart that can express my gratitude If you succeed I do not say that you will save a king no in presence of the scaffold as I am royalty I assure you is a very small affair but you will save a husband to his wife a father to his children Chevalier take my hand it is that of a friend who will love you to his last sigh Aramis stooped to kiss the king s hand but Charles clasped his and pressed it to his heart At this moment a man entered without even knocking at the door Aramis tried to withdraw his hand but the king still held it The man was one of those Puritans half preacher and half soldier who swarmed around Cromwell What do you want sir said the king I desire to know if the confession of Charles Stuart is at an end said the stranger And what is it to you replied the king we are not of the same religion All men are brothers said the Puritan One of my brothers is about to die and I come to prepare him Bear with him whispered Aramis it is doubtless some spy After my reverend lord bishop said the king to the man I shall hear you with pleasure sir The man retired but not before examining the supposed Juxon with an attention which did not escape the king Chevalier said the king when the door was closed I believe you are right and that this man only came here with evil intentions Take care that no misfortune befalls you when you leave I thank your majesty said Aramis but under these robes I have a coat of mail a pistol and a dagger Go then sir and God keep you The king accompanied him to the door where Aramis pronounced his benediction upon him and passing through the ante rooms filled with soldiers jumped into his carriage and drove to the bishop s palace Juxon was waiting for him impatiently Well said he on perceiving Aramis Everything has succeeded as I expected spies guards satellites all took me for you and the king blesses you while waiting for you to bless him May God protect you my son for your example has given me at the same time hope and courage Aramis resumed his own attire and left Juxon with the assurance that he might again have recourse to him He had scarcely gone ten yards in the street when he perceived that he was followed by a man wrapped in a large cloak He placed his hand on his dagger and stopped The man came straight toward him It was Porthos My dear friend cried Aramis You see we had each our mission said Porthos mine was to guard you and I am doing so Have you seen the king Yes and all goes well We are to meet our friends at the hotel at eleven It was then striking half past ten by saint Paul s Arrived at the hotel it was not long before Athos entered All s well he cried as he entered I have hired a cedar wherry as light as a canoe as easy on the wing as any swallow It is waiting for us at Greenwich opposite the Isle of Dogs manned by a captain and four men who for the sum of fifty pounds sterling will keep themselves at our disposition three successive nights Once on board we drop down the Thames and in two hours are on the open sea In case I am killed the captain s name is Roger and the skiff is called the Lightning A handkerchief tied at the four corners is to be the signal Next moment D Artagnan entered Empty your pockets said he I want a hundred pounds and as for my own and he emptied them inside out The sum was collected in a minute D Artagnan ran out and returned directly after There said he it s done Ough and not without a deal of trouble too Has the executioner left London asked Athos Ah you see that plan was not sure enough he might go out by one gate and return by another Where is he then In the cellar The cellar what cellar Our landlord s to be sure Mousqueton is propped against the door and here s the key Bravo said Aramis how did you manage it Like everything else with money but it cost me dear How much asked Athos Five hundred pounds And where did you get so much money said Athos Had you then that sum The queen s famous diamond answered D Artagnan with a sigh Ah true said Aramis I recognized it on your finger You bought it back then from Monsieur des Essarts asked Porthos Yes but it was fated that I should not keep it So then we are all right as regards the executioner said Athos but unfortunately every executioner has his assistant his man or whatever you call him And this one had his said D Artagnan but as good luck would have it just as I thought I should have two affairs to manage our friend was brought home with a broken leg In the excess of his zeal he had accompanied the cart containing the scaffolding as far as the king s window and one of the crossbeams fell on his leg and broke it Ah cried Aramis that accounts for the cry I heard Probably said D Artagnan but as he is a thoughtful young man he promised to send four expert workmen in his place to help those already at the scaffold and wrote the moment he was brought home to Master Tom Lowe an assistant carpenter and friend of his to go down to Whitehall with three of his friends Here s the letter he sent by a messenger for sixpence who sold it to me for a guinea And what on earth are you going to do with it asked Athos Can t you guess my dear Athos You who speak English like John Bull himself are Master Tom Lowe we your three companions Do you understand it now Athos uttered a cry of joy and admiration ran to a closet and drew forth workmen s clothes which the four friends immediately put on they then left the hotel Athos carrying a saw Porthos a vise Aramis an axe and D Artagnan a hammer and some nails The letter from the executioner s assistant satisfied the master carpenter that those were the men he expected sixty five The Workmen Toward midnight Charles heard a great noise beneath his window It arose from blows of hammer and hatchet clinking of pincers and cranching of saws Lying dressed upon his bed the noise awoke him with a start and found a gloomy echo in his heart He could not endure it and sent Parry to ask the sentinel to beg the workmen to strike more gently and not disturb the last slumber of one who had been their king The sentinel was unwilling to leave his post but allowed Parry to pass Arriving at the window Parry found an unfinished scaffold over which they were nailing a covering of black serge Raised to the height of twenty feet so as to be on a level with the window it had two lower stories Parry odious as was this sight to him sought for those among some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise and fixed on two men who were loosening the last hooks of the iron balcony My friends said Parry mounting the scaffold and standing beside them would you work a little more quietly The king wishes to get a sleep One of the two who was standing up was of gigantic size and was driving a pick with all his might into the wall whilst the other kneeling beside him was collecting the pieces of stone The face of the first was lost to Parry in the darkness but as the second turned around and placed his finger on his lips Parry started back in amazement Very well very well said the workman aloud in excellent English Tell the king that if he sleeps badly to night he will sleep better to morrow night These blunt words so terrible if taken literally were received by the other workmen with a roar of laughter But Parry withdrew thinking he was dreaming Charles was impatiently awaiting his return At the moment he re entered the sentinel who guarded the door put his head through the opening curious as to what the king was doing The king was lying on his bed resting on his elbow Parry closed the door and approaching the king his face radiant with joy Sire he said in a low voice do you know who these workmen are who are making so much noise I No how would you have me know Parry bent his head and whispered to the king It is the Comte de la Fere and his friends Raising my scaffold cried the king astounded Yes and at the same time making a hole in the wall The king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to Heaven then leaping down from his bed he went to the window and pulling aside the curtain tried to distinguish the figures outside but in vain Parry was not wrong It was Athos he had recognized and Porthos who was boring a hole through the wall This hole communicated with a kind of loft the space between the floor of the king s room and the ceiling of the one below it Their plan was to pass through the hole they were making into this loft and cut out from below a piece of the flooring of the king s room so as to form a kind of trap door Through this the king was to escape the next night and hidden by the black covering of the scaffold was to change his dress for that of a workman slip out with his deliverers pass the sentinels who would suspect nothing and so reach the skiff that was waiting for him at Greenwich Day gilded the tops of the houses The aperture was finished and Athos passed through it carrying the clothes destined for the king wrapped in black cloth and the tools with which he was to open a communication with the king s room He had only two hours work to do to open communication with the king and according to the calculations of the four friends they had the entire day before them since the executioner being absent another must be sent for to Bristol D Artagnan returned to change his workman s clothes for his chestnut colored suit and Porthos to put on his red doublet As for Aramis he went off to the bishop s palace to see if he could possibly pass in with Juxon to the king s presence All three agreed to meet at noon in Whitehall Place to see how things went on Before leaving the scaffold Aramis had approached the opening where Athos was concealed to tell him that he was about to make an attempt to gain another interview with the king Adieu then and be of good courage said Athos Report to the king the condition of affairs Say to him that when he is alone it will help us if he will knock on the floor for then I can continue my work in safety Try Aramis to keep near the king Speak loud very loud for they will be listening at the door If there is a sentinel within the apartment kill him without hesitation If there are two let Parry kill one and you the other If there are three let yourself be slain but save the king Be easy said Aramis I will take two poniards and give one to Parry Is that all Yes go but urge the king strongly not to stand on false generosity While you are fighting if there is a fight he must flee The trap once replaced over his head you being on the trap dead or alive they will need at least ten minutes to find the hole by which he has escaped In those ten minutes we shall have gained the road and the king will be saved Everything shall be done as you say Athos Your hand for perhaps we shall not see each other again Athos put his arm around Aramis s neck and embraced him For you he said Now if I die say to D Artagnan that I love him as a son and embrace him for me Embrace also our good and brave Porthos Adieu Adieu said Aramis I am as sure now that the king will be saved as I am sure that I clasp the most loyal hand in the world Aramis parted from Athos went down from the scaffold in his turn and took his way to the hotel whistling the air of a song in praise of Cromwell He found the other two friends sitting at table before a good fire drinking a bottle of port and devouring a cold chicken Porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians D Artagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious plans Aramis related what had been agreed upon D Artagnan approved with a movement of the head and Porthos with his voice Bravo he said besides we shall be there at the time of the flight What with D Artagnan Grimaud and Mousqueton we can manage to dispatch eight of them I say nothing about Blaisois for he is only fit to hold the horses Two minutes a man makes four minutes Mousqueton will lose another that s five and in five minutes we shall have galloped a quarter of a league Aramis swallowed a hasty mouthful gulped a glass of wine and changed his clothes Now said he I m off to the bishop s Take care of the executioner D Artagnan All right Grimaud has relieved Mousqueton and has his foot on the cellar door Well don t be inactive Inactive my dear fellow Ask Porthos I pass my life upon my legs Aramis again presented himself at the bishop s Juxon consented the more readily to take him with him as he would require an assistant priest in case the king should wish to communicate Dressed as Aramis had been the night before the bishop got into his carriage and the former more disguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his deacon s dress got in by his side The carriage stopped at the door of the palace It was about nine o clock in the morning Nothing was changed The ante rooms were still full of soldiers the passages still lined by guards The king was already sanguine but when he perceived Aramis his hope turned to joy He embraced Juxon and pressed the hand of Aramis The bishop affected to speak in a loud voice before every one of their previous interview The king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit and that he desired another under the same conditions Juxon turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the king Every one withdrew As soon as the door was closed Sire said Aramis speaking rapidly you are saved the London executioner has vanished His assistant broke his leg last night beneath your majesty s window the cry we heard was his and there is no executioner nearer at hand than Bristol But the Comte de la Fere asked the king Two feet below you take the poker from the fireplace and strike three times on the floor He will answer you The king did so and the moment after three muffled knocks answering the given signal sounded beneath the floor So said Charles he who knocks down there Is the Comte de la Fere sire said Aramis He is preparing a way for your majesty to escape Parry for his part will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be opened Oh Juxon said the king seizing the bishop s two hands in his own promise that you will pray all your life for this gentleman and for the other that you hear beneath your feet and for two others also who wherever they may be are on the watch for my safety Sire replied Juxon you shall be obeyed Meanwhile the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the passage Aramis seized the poker and gave the signal to stop the noise came nearer and nearer It was that of a number of men steadily approaching The four men stood motionless All eyes were fixed on the door which opened slowly and with a kind of solemnity A parliamentary officer clothed in black and with a gravity that augured ill entered bowed to the king and unfolding a parchment read the sentence as is usually done to criminals before their execution What is this said Aramis to Juxon Juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than Aramis about it Then it is for to day asked the king Was not your majesty warned that it was to take place this morning Then I must die like a common criminal by the hand of the London executioner The London executioner has disappeared your majesty but a man has offered his services instead The execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal affairs A slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that Charles evinced as he learned these tidings But Aramis was livid His heart ceased beating he closed his eyes and leaned upon the table Charles perceived it and took his hand Come my friend said he courage Then he turned to the officer Sir I am ready There is but little reason why I should delay you Firstly I wish to communicate secondly to embrace my children and bid them farewell for the last time Will this be permitted me Certainly replied the officer and left the room Aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned aloud Oh my lord bishop he cried seizing Juxon s hands where is Providence where is Providence My son replied the bishop with firmness you see Him not because the passions of the world conceal Him My son said the king to Aramis do not take it so to heart You ask what God is doing God beholds your devotion and my martyrdom and believe me both will have their reward Ascribe to men then what is happening and not to God It is men who drive me to death it is men who make you weep Yes sire said Aramis yes you are right It is men whom I should hold responsible and I will hold them responsible Be seated Juxon said the king falling upon his knees I have now to confess to you Remain sir he added to Aramis who had moved to leave the room Remain Parry I have nothing to say that cannot be said before all Juxon sat down and the king kneeling humbly before him began his confession sixty six Remember The mob had already assembled when the confession terminated The king s children next arrived the Princess Charlotte a beautiful fair haired child with tears in her eyes and the Duke of Gloucester a boy eight or nine years old whose tearless eyes and curling lip revealed a growing pride He had wept all night long but would not show his grief before the people Charles s heart melted within him at the sight of those two children whom he had not seen for two years and whom he now met at the moment of death He turned to brush away a tear and then summoning up all his firmness drew his daughter toward him recommending her to be pious and resigned Then he took the boy upon his knee My son he said to him you saw a great number of people in the streets as you came here These men are going to behead your father Do not forget that Perhaps some day they will want to make you king instead of the Prince of Wales or the Duke of York your elder brothers But you are not the king my son and can never be so while they are alive Swear to me then never to let them put a crown upon your head unless you have a legal right to the crown For one day listen my son one day if you do so they will doom you to destruction head and crown too and then you will not be able to die with a calm conscience as I die Swear my son The child stretched out his little hand toward that of his father and said I swear to your majesty Henry said Charles call me your father Father replied the child I swear to you that they shall kill me sooner than make me king Good my child Now kiss me and you too Charlotte Never forget me Oh never never cried both the children throwing their arms around their father s neck Farewell said Charles farewell my children Take them away Juxon their tears will deprive me of the courage to die Juxon led them away and this time the doors were left open Meanwhile Athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his work Two long hours he waited in terrible inaction A deathlike silence reigned in the room above At last he determined to discover the cause of this stillness He crept from his hole and stood hidden by the black drapery beneath the scaffold Peeping out from the drapery he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers around the scaffold and the first ranks of the populace swaying and groaning like the sea What is the matter then he asked himself trembling more than the wind swayed cloth he was holding back The people are hurrying on the soldiers under arms and among the spectators I see D Artagnan What is he waiting for What is he looking at Good God have they allowed the headsman to escape Suddenly the dull beating of muffled drums filled the square The sound of heavy steps was heard above his head The next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then believing At the same moment a well known voice above him pronounced these words Colonel I want to speak to the people Athos shuddered from head to foot It was the king speaking on the scaffold In fact after taking a few drops of wine and a piece of bread Charles weary of waiting for death had suddenly decided to go to meet it and had given the signal for movement Then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first a masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the executioner He approached the block and laid his axe upon it Behind him pale indeed but marching with a firm step was Charles Stuart who advanced between two priests followed by a few superior officers appointed to preside at the execution and attended by two files of partisans who took their places on opposite sides of the scaffold The sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged sensation Every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the promised spectacle when the people believed it had been postponed until the following day All gazed at him searchingly But they could discern nothing but a man of middle height dressed in black apparently of a certain age for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his features The king s request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign for in firm sonorous accents which vibrated in the depths of Athos s heart the king began his speech explaining his conduct and counseling the welfare of the kingdom Oh said Athos to himself is it indeed possible that I hear what I hear and that I see what I see Is it possible that God has abandoned His representative on earth and left him to die thus miserably And I have not seen him I have not said adieu to him A noise was heard like that the instrument of death would make if moved upon the block Do not touch the axe said the king and resumed his speech At the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the people Then unfastening the diamond ornament which the queen had sent him he placed it in the hands of the priest who accompanied Juxon Then he drew from his breast a little cross set in diamonds which like the order had been the gift of Henrietta Maria Sir said he to the priest I shall keep this cross in my hand till the last moment Take it from me when I am dead Yes sire said a voice which Athos recognized as that of Aramis He then took his hat from his head and threw it on the ground One by one he undid the buttons of his doublet took it off and deposited it by the side of his hat Then as it was cold he asked for his gown which was brought to him All the preparations were made with a frightful calmness One would have thought the king was going to bed and not to his coffin Will these be in your way he said to the executioner raising his long locks if so they can be tied up Charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown headsman His calm noble gaze forced the man to turn away his head But after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of Aramis The king seeing that he did not reply repeated his question It will do replied the man in a tremulous voice if you separate them across the neck The king parted his hair with his hands and looking at the block he said This block is very low is there no other to be had It is the usual block answered the man in the mask Do you think you can behead me with a single blow asked the king I hope so was the reply There was something so strange in these three words that everybody except the king shuddered I do not wish to be taken by surprise added the king I shall kneel down to pray do not strike then When shall I strike When I shall lay my head on the block and say Remember then strike boldly Gentlemen said the king to those around him I leave you to brave the tempest I go before you to a kingdom which knows no storms Farewell He looked at Aramis and made a special sign to him with his head Now he continued withdraw a little and let me say my prayer I beseech you You also stand aside he said to the masked man It is only for a moment and I know that I belong to you but remember that you are not to strike till I give the signal Then he knelt down made the sign of the cross and lowering his face to the planks as if he would have kissed them said in a low tone in French Comte de la Fere are you there Yes your majesty he answered trembling Faithful friend noble heart said the king I should not have been rescued I have addressed my people and I have spoken to God last of all I speak to you To maintain a cause which I believed sacred I have lost the throne and my children their inheritance A million in gold remains it is buried in the cellars of Newcastle Keep You only know that this money exists Make use of it then whenever you think it will be most useful for my eldest son s welfare And now farewell Farewell saintly martyred majesty lisped Athos chilled with terror A moment s silence ensued and then in a full sonorous voice the king exclaimed Remember He had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the scaffold and where Athos stood immovable a warm drop fell upon his brow He reeled back with a shudder and the same moment the drops became a crimson cataract Athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or stunned At last he rose and taking his handkerchief steeped it in the blood of the martyred king Then as the crowd gradually dispersed he leaped down crept from behind the drapery glided between two horses mingled with the crowd and was the first to arrive at the inn Having gained his room he raised his hand to his face and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarch s blood fell down insensible sixty seven The Man in the Mask The snow was falling thick and icy Aramis was the next to come in and to discover Athos almost insensible But at the first words he uttered the comte roused himself from the kind of lethargy in which he had sunk Well said Aramis beaten by fate Beaten said Athos Noble and unhappy king Are you wounded cried Aramis No this is his blood Where were you then Where you left me under the scaffold Did you see it all No but I heard all God preserve me from another such hour as I have just passed Then you know that I did not leave him I heard your voice up to the last moment Here is the order he gave me and the cross I took from his hand he desired they should be returned to the queen Then here is a handkerchief to wrap them in replied Athos drawing from his pocket the one he had steeped in the king s blood And what he continued has been done with the poor body By order of Cromwell royal honors will be accorded to it The doctors are embalming the corpse and when it is ready it will be placed in a lighted chapel Mockery muttered Athos savagely royal honors to one whom they have murdered Well cheer up said a loud voice from the staircase which Porthos had just mounted We are all mortal my poor friends You are late my dear Porthos Yes there were some people on the way who delayed me The wretches were dancing I took one of them by the throat and three quarters throttled him Just then a patrol rode up Luckily the man I had had most to do with was some minutes before he could speak so I took advantage of his silence to walk off Have you seen D Artagnan We got separated in the crowd and I could not find him again Oh said Athos satirically I saw him He was in the front row of the crowd admirably placed for seeing and as on the whole the sight was curious he probably wished to stay to the end Ah Comte de la Fere said a calm voice though hoarse with running is it your habit to calumniate the absent This reproof stung Athos to the heart but as the impression produced by seeing D Artagnan foremost in a coarse ferocious crowd had been very strong he contented himself with replying I am not calumniating you my friend They were anxious about you here I simply told them where you were You didn t know King Charles to you he was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love him So saying he stretched out his hand but the other pretended not to see it and he let it drop again slowly by his side Ugh I am tired cried D Artagnan sitting down Drink a glass of port said Aramis it will refresh you Yes let us drink said Athos anxious to make it up by hobnobbing with D Artagnan let us drink and get away from this hateful country The felucca is waiting for us you know let us leave to night we have nothing more to do here You are in a hurry sir count said D Artagnan But what would you have us to do here now that the king is dead Go sir count replied D Artagnan carelessly you see nothing to keep you a little longer in England Well for my part I a bloodthirsty ruffian who can go and stand close to a scaffold in order to have a better view of the king s execution I remain Athos turned pale Every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in his heart Ah you remain in London said Porthos Yes And you Hang it said Porthos a little perplexed between the two I suppose as I came with you I must go away with you I can t leave you alone in this abominable country Thanks my worthy friend So I have a little adventure to propose to you when the count is gone I want to find out who was the man in the mask who so obligingly offered to cut the king s throat A man in a mask cried Athos You did not let the executioner escape then The executioner is still in the cellar where I presume he has had an interview with mine host s bottles But you remind me Mousqueton Sir answered a voice from the depths of the earth Let out your prisoner All is over But said Athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king An amateur headsman replied Aramis who however does not handle the axe amiss Did you not see his face asked Athos He wore a mask But you Aramis who were close to him I could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask Then it must be a man of a certain age Oh said D Artagnan that matters little When one puts on a mask it is not difficult to wear a beard under it I am sorry I did not follow him said Porthos Well my dear Porthos said D Artagnan that s the very thing it came into my head to do Athos understood all now Pardon me D Artagnan he said I have distrusted God I could the more easily distrust you Pardon me my friend We will see about that presently said D Artagnan with a slight smile Well then said Aramis Well while I was watching not the king as monsieur le comte thinks for I know what it is to see a man led to death and though I ought to be accustomed to the sight it always makes me ill while I was watching the masked executioner the idea came to me as I said to find out who he was Now as we are wont to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance as one calls his other hand to aid the first I looked around instinctively to see if Porthos was there for I had seen you Aramis with the king and you count I knew would be under the scaffold and for that reason I forgive you he added offering Athos his hand for you must have suffered much I was looking around for Porthos when I saw near me a head which had been broken but which for better or worse had been patched with plaster and with black silk Humph thought I that looks like my handiwork I fancy I must have mended that skull somewhere or other And in fact it was that unfortunate Scotchman Parry s brother you know on whom Groslow amused himself by trying his strength Well this man was making signs to another at my left and turning around I recognized the honest Grimaud Oh said I to him Grimaud turned round with a jerk recognized me and pointed to the man in the mask Eh said he which meant Do you see him Parbleu I answered and we perfectly understood one another Well everything was finished as you know The mob dispersed I made a sign to Grimaud and the Scotchman and we all three retired into a corner of the square I saw the executioner return into the king s room change his clothes put on a black hat and a large cloak and disappear Five minutes later he came down the grand staircase You followed him cried Athos I should think so but not without difficulty Every few minutes he turned around and thus obliged us to conceal ourselves I might have gone up to him and killed him But I am not selfish and I thought it might console you all a little to have a share in the matter So we followed him through the lowest streets in the city and in half an hour s time he stopped before a little isolated house Grimaud drew out a pistol Eh said he showing it I held back his arm The man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being followed Grimaud and I got behind a tree and the Scotchman having nowhere to hide himself threw himself on his face in the road Next moment the door opened and the man disappeared The scoundrel said Aramis While you have been returning hither he will have escaped and we shall never find him Come now Aramis said D Artagnan you must be taking me for some one else Nevertheless said Athos in your absence Well in my absence haven t I put in my place Grimaud and the Scotchman Before he had taken ten steps beyond the door I had examined the house on all sides At one of the doors that by which he had entered I placed our Scotchman making a sign to him to follow the man wherever he might go if he came out again Then going around the house I placed Grimaud at the other exit and here I am Our game is beaten up Now for the tally ho Athos threw himself into D Artagnan s arms Friend he said you have been too good in pardoning me I was wrong a hundred times wrong I ought to have known you better by this time but we are all possessed of a malignant spirit which bids us doubt Humph said Porthos Don t you think the executioner might be Master Cromwell who to make sure of this affair undertook it himself Ah just so Cromwell is stout and short and this man thin and lanky rather tall than otherwise Some condemned soldier perhaps suggested Athos whom they have pardoned at the price of regicide No no continued D Artagnan it was not the measured step of a foot soldier nor was it the gait of a horseman If I am not mistaken we have to do with a gentleman A gentleman exclaimed Athos Impossible It would be a dishonor to all the nobility Fine sport by Jove cried Porthos with a laugh that shook the windows Fine sport Are you still bent on departure Athos asked D Artagnan No I remain replied Athos with a threatening gesture that promised no good to whomsoever it was addressed Swords then cried Aramis swords let us not lose a moment The four friends resumed their own clothes girded on their swords ordered Mousqueton and Blaisois to pay the bill and to arrange everything for immediate departure and wrapped in their large cloaks left in search of their game The night was dark snow was falling the streets were silent and deserted D Artagnan led the way through the intricate windings and narrow alleys of the city and ere long they had reached the house in question For a moment D Artagnan thought that Parry s brother had disappeared but he was mistaken The robust Scotchman accustomed to the snows of his native hills had stretched himself against a post and like a fallen statue insensible to the inclemency of the weather had allowed the snow to cover him He rose however as they approached Come said Athos here s another good servant Really honest men are not so scarce as I thought Don t be in a hurry to weave crowns for our Scotchman I believe the fellow is here on his own account for I have heard that these gentlemen born beyond the Tweed are very vindictive I should not like to be Groslow if he meets him Well said Athos to the man in English No one has come out he replied Then Porthos and Aramis will you remain with this man while we go around to Grimaud Grimaud had made himself a kind of sentry box out of a hollow willow and as they drew near he put his head out and gave a low whistle Soho cried Athos Yes said Grimaud Well has anybody come out No but somebody has gone in A man or a woman A man Ah ah said D Artagnan there are two of them then I wish there were four said Athos the two parties would then be equal Perhaps there are four said D Artagnan What do you mean Other men may have entered before them and waited for them We can find out said Grimaud At the same time he pointed to a window through the shutters of which a faint light streamed That is true said D Artagnan let us call the others They returned around the house to fetch Porthos and Aramis Have you seen anything they asked No but we are going to replied D Artagnan pointing to Grimaud who had already climbed some five or six feet from the ground All four came up together Grimaud continued to climb like a cat and succeeded at last in catching hold of a hook which served to keep one of the shutters back when opened Then resting his foot on a small ledge he made a sign to show all was right Well asked D Artagnan Grimaud showed his closed hand with two fingers spread out Speak said Athos we cannot see your signs How many are there Two One opposite to me the other with his back to me Good And the man opposite to you is The man I saw go in Do you know him I thought I recognized him and was not mistaken Short and stout Who is it they all asked together in a low tone General Oliver Cromwell The four friends looked at one another And the other asked Athos Thin and lanky The executioner said D Artagnan and Aramis at the same time I can see nothing but his back resumed Grimaud But wait He is moving and if he has taken off his mask I shall be able to see Ah And as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a groan Did you see him they all asked Yes said Grimaud with his hair standing on end The thin spare man Yes The executioner in short asked Aramis Yes And who is it said Porthos He he is murmured Grimaud pale as a ghost and seizing his master s hand Who He asked Athos Mordaunt replied Grimaud D Artagnan Porthos and Aramis uttered a cry of joy Athos stepped back and passed his hand across his brow Fatality he muttered sixty eight Cromwell s House 
3021-121438-0000	train-other-500	It was in fact Mordaunt whom D Artagnan had followed without knowing it
none	none	 On entering the house he had taken off his mask and imitation beard 
3021-121438-0001	train-other-500	then mounting a staircase had opened a door
none	none	 and in a room lighted by a single lamp found himself face to face with a man seated behind a desk 
3021-121438-0002	train-other-500	This man was Cromwell Cromwell had two or three of these retreats in London
none	none	 unknown except to the most intimate of his friends Mordaunt was among these 
3021-121438-0003	train-other-500	It is you Mordaunt he said You are late General I wished to see the ceremony to the end which delayed me Ah I scarcely thought you were so curious as that I am always curious to see the downfall of your honor s enemies and he was not among the least of them
3021-121438-0004	train-other-500	But you general were you not at Whitehall No said Cromwell There was a moment s silence Have you had any account of it None
none	none	 I have been here since the morning I only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the king 
3021-121438-0005	train-other-500	Ah you knew that said Mordaunt It matters little Four men disguised as workmen
none	none	 were to get the king out of prison and take him to Greenwich where a vessel was waiting 
3021-121438-0006	train-other-500	And knowing all that your honor remained here far from the city tranquil and inactive Tranquil yes replied Cromwell But who told you I was inactive But if the plot had succeeded I wished it to do so
none	none	 I thought your excellence considered the death of Charles I as a misfortune necessary to the welfare of England 
3021-121438-0007	train-other-500	Yes his death but it would have been more seemly not upon the scaffold Why so asked Mordaunt Cromwell smiled
none	none	 Because it could have been said 
3021-121438-0008	train-other-500	that I had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of pity But
none	none	 if he had escaped 
3021-121438-0009	train-other-500	Impossible my precautions were taken And does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him The four Frenchmen of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by Mazarin to me
3021-121438-0010	train-other-500	And do you think Mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done It is possible But he will not avow it How so Because they failed Your honor gave me
none	none	 two of these Frenchmen when they were only guilty of fighting for Charles I 
3021-121438-0011	train-other-500	Now that they are guilty of a conspiracy against England will your honor give me all four of them Take them said Cromwell Mordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant ferocity Did the people shout at all Cromwell asked Very little except Long live Cromwell
none	none	 Where were you placed Mordaunt tried for a moment to read in the general s face if this was simply a useless question or whether he knew everything But his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of Cromwell s 
3021-121438-0012	train-other-500	I was so situated as to hear and see everything he answered It was now Cromwell s turn to look fixedly at Mordaunt and Mordaunt to make himself impenetrable It appears said Cromwell that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably well
none	none	 The blow so they tell me at least was struck with a master s hand 
3021-121438-0013	train-other-500	Mordaunt remembered that Cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account
none	none	 and he was now quite convinced that the general had been present at the execution 
3021-121438-0014	train-other-500	hidden behind some screen or curtain In fact said Mordaunt with a calm voice and immovable countenance a single blow sufficed Perhaps it was some one in that occupation said Cromwell Do you think so sir He did not look like an executioner
none	none	 And who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office 
3021-121438-0015	train-other-500	But said Mordaunt it might have been some personal enemy of the king who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this way Perhaps it was some man of rank who had grave reasons for hating the fallen king
none	none	 and who learning that the king was about to flee and escape him 
3021-121438-0016	train-other-500	threw himself in the way with a mask on his face and an axe in his hand
none	none	 not as substitute for the executioner 
3021-121438-0017	train-other-500	but as an ambassador of Fate Possibly And if that were the case would your honor condemn his action It is not for me to judge It rests between his conscience and his God But if your honor knew this man
none	none	 I neither know nor wish to know him Provided Charles is dead 
3021-121438-0018	train-other-500	it is the axe not the man we must thank And yet without the man
none	none	 the king would have been rescued 
3021-121438-0019	train-other-500	Cromwell smiled They would have carried him to Greenwich he said and put him on board a felucca with five barrels of powder in the hold Once out to sea you are too good a politician not to understand the rest Mordaunt Yes
3021-121438-0020	train-other-500	they would have all been blown up Just so The explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do
none	none	 Men would have said that the king had escaped human justice and been overtaken by God s 
3021-121438-0021	train-other-500	You see now why I did not care to know your gentleman in the mask
none	none	 for really 
3021-121438-0022	train-other-500	in spite of his excellent intentions I could not thank him for what he has done Mordaunt bowed humbly Sir he said you are a profound thinker and your plan was sublime Say absurd since it has become useless
3021-121438-0023	train-other-500	The only sublime ideas in politics are those which bear fruit So to night Mordaunt go to Greenwich and ask for the captain of the felucca Lightning Show him a white handkerchief knotted at the four corners and tell the crew to disembark and carry the powder back to the arsenal unless indeed
3021-121438-0024	train-other-500	Unless said Mordaunt
none	none	 whose face was lighted by a savage joy as Cromwell spoke 
3021-121438-0025	train-other-500	This skiff might be of use to you for personal projects Oh my lord my lord That title said Cromwell laughing is all very well here
none	none	 but take care a word like that does not escape your lips in public 
3021-121438-0026	train-other-500	But your honor will soon be called so generally I hope so at least said Cromwell rising and putting on his cloak You are going sir Yes said Cromwell I slept here last night and the night before and you know it is not my custom to sleep three times in the same bed
3021-121438-0027	train-other-500	Then said Mordaunt your honor gives me my liberty for to night And even for all day to morrow if you want it Since last evening he added smiling you have done enough in my service and if you have any personal matters to settle
3021-121438-0028	train-other-500	it is just that I should give you time Thank you sir it will be well employed I hope Cromwell turned as he was going Are you armed he asked I have my sword And no one waiting for you outside No
3021-121438-0029	train-other-500	Then you had better come with me Thank you sir but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and I have none to lose
none	none	 Cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered it 
3021-121438-0030	train-other-500	It closed after him with a spring This door communicated with a subterranean passage leading under the street to a grotto in the garden of a house about a hundred yards from that of the future Protector It was just before this that Grimaud had perceived the two men seated together
3021-121438-0031	train-other-500	D Artagnan was the first to recover from his surprise Mordaunt he cried Ah by Heaven
none	none	 it is God Himself who sent us here 
3021-121438-0032	train-other-500	Yes said Porthos let us break the door in and fall upon him No replied D Artagnan no noise Now Grimaud you come here climb up to the window again and tell us if Mordaunt is alone
3021-121438-0033	train-other-500	and whether he is preparing to go out or go to bed If he comes out we shall catch him If he stays in we will break in the window It is easier and less noisy than the door Grimaud began to scale the wall again
none	none	 Keep guard at the other door Athos and Aramis 
3021-121438-0034	train-other-500	Porthos and I will stay here The friends obeyed He is alone said Grimaud We did not see his companion come out He may have gone by the other door What is he doing Putting on his cloak and gloves He s ours muttered D Artagnan
3021-121438-0035	train-other-500	Porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabbard Put it up again my friend said D Artagnan
none	none	 We must proceed in an orderly manner 
3021-121438-0036	train-other-500	Hush said Grimaud he is coming out
none	none	 He has put out the lamp 
3021-121438-0037	train-other-500	I can see nothing now Get down then and quickly Grimaud leaped down The snow deadened the noise of his fall
none	none	 Now go and tell Athos and Aramis to stand on each side of the door 
3021-121438-0038	train-other-500	and clap their hands if they catch him We will do the same The next moment the door opened and Mordaunt appeared on the threshold face to face with D Artagnan
none	none	 Porthos clapped his hands and the other two came running around 
3021-121438-0039	train-other-500	Mordaunt was livid but he uttered no cry nor called for assistance D Artagnan quietly pushed him in again and by the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward one by one keeping his eyes all the time on Mordaunt s hands who however knowing that it was useless attempted no resistance
none	none	 At last they stood face to face in the very room where ten minutes before Mordaunt had been talking to Cromwell 
3021-121438-0040	train-other-500	Porthos came up behind and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit that in the room
none	none	 Athos and Aramis entered last and locked the door behind them 
3021-121438-0041	train-other-500	Oblige me by taking a seat said D Artagnan pushing a chair toward Mordaunt who sat down pale but calm Aramis Porthos and D Artagnan drew their chairs near him
none	none	 Athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room 
3021-121438-0042	train-other-500	as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings He seemed to be quite overcome Porthos rubbed his hands in feverish impatience Aramis bit his lips till the blood came D Artagnan alone was calm at least in appearance
none	none	 Monsieur Mordaunt he said since after running after one another so long chance has at last brought us together let us have a little conversation if you please sixty nine 
3021-121439-0000	train-other-500	Conversational Though Mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion when once seated he recovered himself as it were and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of escape
none	none	 His eye wandered to a long stout sword on his flank 
3021-121439-0001	train-other-500	and he instinctively slipped it around within reach of his right hand D Artagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing Aramis muttered to himself We shall hear nothing but the usual commonplace things Porthos sucked his mustache muttering
none	none	 A good deal of ceremony to night about crushing an adder Athos shrunk into his corner pale and motionless as a bas relief 
3021-121439-0002	train-other-500	The silence however could not last forever So D Artagnan began Sir he said with desperate politeness
none	none	 it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as I have seen the Italian mummers do whom the Cardinal Mazarin brought over from Bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in France 
3021-121439-0003	train-other-500	Mordaunt did not reply Just now D Artagnan continued you were disguised I mean to say attired as a murderer and now And now I look very much like a man who is going to be murdered Oh sir
3021-121439-0004	train-other-500	said D Artagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen
none	none	 and have such an excellent sword at your side 
3021-121439-0005	train-other-500	No sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and daggers Well that is scarcely the question I had the honor of asking you why you altered your costume The mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe
3021-121439-0006	train-other-500	I do not think it would be out of keeping even at this moment Why then have you laid it aside Because remembering the scene at Armentieres I thought I should find four axes for one as I was to meet four executioners Sir
none	none	 replied D Artagnan in the calmest manner possible 
3021-121439-0007	train-other-500	you are very young I shall therefore overlook your frivolous remarks What took place at Armentieres has no connection whatever with the present occasion
none	none	 We could scarcely have requested your mother to take a sword and fight us 
3021-121439-0008	train-other-500	Aha It is a duel then cried Mordaunt as if disposed to reply at once to the provocation Porthos rose always ready for this kind of adventure Pardon me said D Artagnan Do not let us do things in a hurry We will arrange the matter rather better
3021-121439-0009	train-other-500	Confess Monsieur Mordaunt that you are anxious to kill some of us All replied Mordaunt Then my dear sir
none	none	 I am convinced that these gentlemen return your kind wishes and will be delighted to kill you also 
3021-121439-0010	train-other-500	Of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof I can furnish is this So saying he threw his hat on the ground
none	none	 pushed back his chair to the wall 
3021-121439-0011	train-other-500	and bowed to Mordaunt with true French grace At your service sir he continued My sword is shorter than yours it s true but bah I think the arm will make up for the sword Halt cried Porthos coming forward I begin and without any rhetoric
3021-121439-0012	train-other-500	Allow me Porthos said Aramis
none	none	 Athos did not move 
3021-121439-0013	train-other-500	He might have been taken for a statue Even his breathing seemed to be arrested Gentlemen said D Artagnan you shall have your turn Monsieur Mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward
none	none	 You can see it in his eye So pray keep your places like Athos whose calmness is entirely laudable Besides we will have no words about it 
3021-121439-0014	train-other-500	I have particular business to settle with this gentleman and I shall and will begin Porthos and Aramis drew back disappointed and drawing his sword D Artagnan turned to his adversary Sir I am waiting for you
3021-121439-0015	train-other-500	And for my part gentlemen I admire you You are disputing which shall fight me first but you do not consult me who am most concerned in the matter I hate you all but not equally I hope to kill all four of you but I am more likely to kill the first than the second
3021-121439-0016	train-other-500	the second than the third and the third than the last I claim then the right to choose my opponent If you refuse this right you may kill me but I shall not fight It is but fair said Porthos and Aramis hoping he would choose one of them
none	none	 Athos and D Artagnan said nothing 
3021-121439-0017	train-other-500	but their silence seemed to imply consent Well then said Mordaunt
none	none	 I choose for my adversary the man who not thinking himself worthy to be called Comte de la Fere calls himself Athos Athos sprang up 
3021-121439-0018	train-other-500	but after an instant of motionless silence he said to the astonishment of his friends Monsieur Mordaunt a duel between us is impossible Submit this honour to somebody else And he sat down Ah
none	none	 said Mordaunt with a sneer 
3021-121439-0019	train-other-500	there s one who is afraid Zounds
none	none	 exclaimed D Artagnan bounding toward him 
3021-121439-0020	train-other-500	who says that Athos is afraid
none	none	 Let him have his say D Artagnan said Athos with a smile of sadness and contempt 
3021-121439-0021	train-other-500	Is it your decision Athos resumed the Gascon Irrevocably You hear sir said D Artagnan turning to Mordaunt The Comte de la Fere will not do you the honor of fighting with you Choose one of us to replace the Comte de la Fere
3021-121439-0022	train-other-500	As long as I don t fight with him it is the same to me with whom I fight Put your names into a hat and draw lots A good idea said D Artagnan At least that will conciliate us all said Aramis
none	none	 I should never have thought of that 
3021-121439-0023	train-other-500	said Porthos and yet it is very simple Come Aramis said D Artagnan
none	none	 write this for us in those neat little characters in which you wrote to Marie Michon that the mother of this gentleman intended to assassinate the Duke of Buckingham Mordaunt sustained this new attack without wincing 
3021-121439-0024	train-other-500	He stood with his arms folded apparently as calm as any man could be in such circumstances If he had not courage he had what is very like it namely pride Aramis went to Cromwell s desk tore off three bits of paper of equal size
3021-121439-0025	train-other-500	wrote on the first his own name and on the others those of his two companions and presented them open to Mordaunt
none	none	 who by a movement of his head indicated that he left the matter entirely to Aramis 
3021-121439-0026	train-other-500	He then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to Mordaunt Mordaunt put his hand into the hat took out one of the three papers and disdainfully dropped it on the table without reading it
none	none	 Ah serpent 
3021-121439-0027	train-other-500	muttered D Artagnan I would give my chance of a captaincy in the mousquetaires for that to be my name Aramis opened the paper and in a voice trembling with hate and vengeance read D Artagnan The Gascon uttered a cry of joy and turning to Mordaunt
3021-121439-0028	train-other-500	I hope sir said he you have no objection to make None whatever replied the other drawing his sword and resting the point on his boot The moment that D Artagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him he recovered his usual tranquillity
3021-121439-0029	train-other-500	He turned up his cuffs neatly and rubbed the sole of his right boot on the floor but did not fail however to remark that Mordaunt was looking about him in a singular manner Are you ready sir he said at last
3021-121439-0030	train-other-500	I was waiting for you sir said Mordaunt raising his head and casting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to describe Well then said the Gascon take care of yourself for I am not a bad hand at the rapier Nor I either So much the better
3021-121439-0031	train-other-500	that sets my mind at rest Defend yourself One minute said the young man Give me your word gentlemen
none	none	 that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the other 
3021-121439-0032	train-other-500	Is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that my little viper No but to set my mind at rest as you observed just now It is for something else than that I imagine muttered D Artagnan shaking his head doubtfully
3021-121439-0033	train-other-500	On the honor of gentlemen said Aramis and Porthos In that case gentlemen have the kindness to retire into the corners so as to give us ample room We shall require it Yes gentlemen said D Artagnan we must not leave this person the slightest pretext for behaving badly
3021-121439-0034	train-other-500	which with all due respect I fancy he is anxious still to do This new attack made no impression on Mordaunt The space was cleared the two lamps placed on Cromwell s desk in order that the combatants might have as much light as possible and the swords crossed
none	none	 D Artagnan was too good a swordsman to trifle with his opponent 
3021-121439-0035	train-other-500	He made a rapid and brilliant feint which Mordaunt parried
none	none	 Aha he cried with a smile of satisfaction And without losing a minute thinking he saw an opening he thrust his right in and forced Mordaunt to parry a counter en quarte so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding ring This time it was Mordaunt who smiled 
3021-121439-0036	train-other-500	Ah sir said D Artagnan you have a wicked smile It must have been the devil who taught it you was it not
none	none	 Mordaunt replied by trying his opponent s weapon with an amount of strength which the Gascon was astonished to find in a form apparently so feeble but thanks to a parry no less clever than that which Mordaunt had just achieved 
3021-121439-0037	train-other-500	he succeeded in meeting his sword which slid along his own without touching his chest Mordaunt rapidly sprang back a step Ah you lose ground you are turning Well as you please I even gain something by it for I no longer see that wicked smile of yours
3021-121439-0038	train-other-500	You have no idea what a false look you have particularly when you are afraid Look at my eyes and you will see what no looking glass has ever shown you a frank and honorable countenance
3021-121439-0039	train-other-500	To this flow of words not perhaps in the best taste but characteristic of D Artagnan whose principal object was to divert his opponent s attention Mordaunt did not reply but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with D Artagnan
3021-121439-0040	train-other-500	He smiled more and more sarcastically and his smile began to make the Gascon anxious Come come cried D Artagnan we must finish with this and in his turn he pressed Mordaunt hard who continued to lose ground but evidently on purpose and without letting his sword leave the line for a moment
3021-121439-0041	train-other-500	However as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever Mordaunt s foot at last touched the wall against which he rested his left hand
none	none	 Ah this time you cannot lose ground my fine friend exclaimed D Artagnan Gentlemen did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall 
3021-121439-0042	train-other-500	No Well then you shall see it now
none	none	 In a second D Artagnan had made three terrible thrusts at Mordaunt 
3021-121439-0043	train-other-500	all of which touched but only pricked him The three friends looked on panting and astonished
none	none	 At last D Artagnan having got up too close stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust 
3021-121439-0044	train-other-500	but the moment when after a fine quick feint he was attacking as sharply as lightning the wall seemed to give way Mordaunt disappeared through the opening
none	none	 and D Artagnan s blade caught between the panels shivered like a sword of glass D Artagnan sprang back the wall had closed again Mordaunt in fact while defending himself had manoeuvred so as to reach the secret door by which Cromwell had left 
3021-121439-0045	train-other-500	had felt for the knob with his left hand pressed it and disappeared The Gascon uttered a furious imprecation which was answered by a wild laugh on the other side of the iron panel
none	none	 Help me gentlemen cried D Artagnan we must break in this door 
3021-121439-0046	train-other-500	It is the devil in person said Aramis hastening forward He escapes us growled Porthos pushing his huge shoulder against the hinges but in vain Sblood he escapes us
none	none	 So much the better muttered Athos 
3021-121439-0047	train-other-500	I thought as much said D Artagnan wasting his strength in useless efforts Zounds I thought as much when the wretch kept moving around the room I thought he was up to something It s a misfortune to which his friend the devil treats us said Aramis
none	none	 It s a piece of good fortune sent from Heaven said Athos evidently much relieved 
3021-121439-0048	train-other-500	Really said D Artagnan abandoning the attempt to burst open the panel after several ineffectual attempts
none	none	 Athos I cannot imagine how you can talk to us in that way 
3021-121439-0049	train-other-500	You cannot understand the position we are in In this kind of game not to kill is to let one s self be killed This fox of a fellow will be sending us a hundred iron sided beasts who will pick us off like sparrows in this place Come come we must be off
3021-121439-0050	train-other-500	If we stay here five minutes more there s an end of us Yes you are right But where shall we go asked Porthos To the hotel to be sure to get our baggage and horses and from there
none	none	 if it please God to France where at least 
3021-121439-0051	train-other-500	I understand the architecture of the houses
none	none	 So suiting the action to the word D Artagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into its scabbard picked up his hat and ran down the stairs followed by the others seventy 
3021-121440-0000	train-other-500	The Skiff Lightning D Artagnan had judged correctly Mordaunt felt that he had no time to lose and he lost none
none	none	 He knew the rapidity of decision and action that characterized his enemies and resolved to act with reference to that 
3021-121440-0001	train-other-500	This time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of them After closing the door carefully behind him Mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage
none	none	 sheathing on the way his now useless sword 
3021-121440-0002	train-other-500	and thus reached the neighboring house where he paused to examine himself and to take breath Good he said nothing almost nothing scratches nothing more two in the arm and one in the breast The wounds that I make are better than that
3021-121440-0003	train-other-500	witness the executioner of Bethune my uncle and King Charles Now not a second to lose for a second lost will perhaps save them They must die die all together killed at one stroke by the thunder of men in default of God s
3021-121440-0004	train-other-500	They must disappear broken scattered annihilated I will run then till my legs no longer serve till my heart bursts in my bosom but I will arrive before they do Mordaunt proceeded at a rapid pace to the nearest cavalry barracks about a quarter of a league distant
3021-121440-0005	train-other-500	He made that quarter of a league in four or five minutes Arrived at the barracks he made himself known took the best horse in the stables mounted and gained the high road
none	none	 A quarter of an hour later he was at Greenwich 
3021-121440-0006	train-other-500	There is the port he murmured That dark point yonder is the Isle of Dogs Good I am half an hour in advance of them an hour perhaps
none	none	 Fool that I was I have almost killed myself by my needless haste Now he added rising in the stirrups and looking about him 
3021-121440-0007	train-other-500	which I wonder is the Lightning At this moment as if in reply to his words a man lying on a coil of cables rose and advanced a few steps toward him Mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket and tying a knot at each corner the signal agreed upon
3021-121440-0008	train-other-500	waved it in the air and the man came up to him He was wrapped in a large rough cape which concealed his form and partly his face
none	none	 Do you wish to go on the water sir 
3021-121440-0009	train-other-500	said the sailor Yes just so Along the Isle of Dogs And perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than another
none	none	 You would like one that sails as rapidly as 
3021-121440-0010	train-other-500	Lightning interrupted Mordaunt Then mine is the boat you want sir I m your man I begin to think so particularly if you have not forgotten a certain signal
none	none	 Here it is sir and the sailor took from his coat a handkerchief tied at each corner 
3021-121440-0011	train-other-500	Good quite right cried Mordaunt springing off his horse There s not a moment to lose now take my horse to the nearest inn and conduct me to your vessel But asked the sailor where are your companions I thought there were four of you
3021-121440-0012	train-other-500	Listen to me sir I m not the man you take me for you are in Captain Rogers s post are you not under orders from General Cromwell
none	none	 Mine also are from him 
3021-121440-0013	train-other-500	Indeed sir I recognize you you are Captain Mordaunt Mordaunt was startled Oh fear nothing said the skipper showing his face I am a friend Captain Groslow cried Mordaunt Himself
3021-121440-0014	train-other-500	The general remembered that I had formerly been a naval officer and he gave me the command of this expedition Is there anything new in the wind Nothing
none	none	 I thought perhaps that the king s death 
3021-121440-0015	train-other-500	Has only hastened their flight in ten minutes they will perhaps be here What have you come for then To embark with you Ah ah the general doubted my fidelity
3021-121440-0016	train-other-500	No but I wish to have a share in my revenge Haven t you some one who will relieve me of my horse Groslow whistled and a sailor appeared Patrick said Groslow take this horse to the stables of the nearest inn If any one asks you whose it is
none	none	 you can say that it belongs to an Irish gentleman 
3021-121440-0017	train-other-500	The sailor departed without reply Now said Mordaunt
none	none	 are you not afraid that they will recognize you 
3021-121440-0018	train-other-500	There is no danger dressed as I am in this pilot coat on a night as dark as this Besides even you didn t recognize me they will be much less likely to
none	none	 That is true said Mordaunt and they will be far from thinking of you 
3021-121440-0019	train-other-500	Everything is ready is it not Yes The cargo on board Yes Five full casks And fifty empty ones Good We are carrying port wine to Anvers Excellent
none	none	 Now take me aboard and return to your post 
3021-121440-0020	train-other-500	for they will soon be here I am ready It is important that none of your crew should see me I have but one man on board and I am as sure of him as I am of myself Besides he doesn t know you
3021-121440-0021	train-other-500	like his mates he is ready to obey our orders knowing nothing of our plan Very well let us go They then went down to the Thames
none	none	 A boat was fastened to the shore by a chain fixed to a stake 
3021-121440-0022	train-other-500	Groslow jumped in followed by Mordaunt and in five minutes they were quite away from that world of houses which then crowded the outskirts of London and Mordaunt could discern the little vessel riding at anchor near the Isle of Dogs When they reached the side of this felucca Mordaunt
3021-121440-0023	train-other-500	dexterous in his eagerness for vengeance seized a rope and climbed up the side of the vessel with a coolness and agility very rare among landsmen He went with Groslow to the captain s berth a sort of temporary cabin of planks
3021-121440-0024	train-other-500	for the chief apartment had been given up by Captain Rogers to the passengers who were to be accommodated at the other end of the boat
none	none	 They will have nothing to do then at this end 
3021-121440-0025	train-other-500	said Mordaunt Nothing at all That s a capital arrangement Return to Greenwich and bring them here I shall hide myself in your cabin You have a longboat That in which we came It appeared light and well constructed
3021-121440-0026	train-other-500	Quite a canoe Fasten it to the poop with a rope
none	none	 put the oars into it so that it may follow in the track and there will be nothing to do except to cut the cord 
3021-121440-0027	train-other-500	Put a good supply of rum and biscuit in it for the seamen should the night happen to be stormy they will not be sorry to find something to console themselves with Consider all this done Do you wish to see the powder room No When you return I will set the fuse myself
none	none	 but be careful to conceal your face so that you cannot be recognized by them 
3021-121440-0028	train-other-500	Never fear There s ten o clock striking at Greenwich Groslow then having given the sailor on duty an order to be on the watch with more than usual vigilance went down into the longboat and soon reached Greenwich
3021-121440-0029	train-other-500	The wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted as he approached it but he had no sooner landed than he heard a noise of horses galloping upon the paved road These horsemen were our friends or rather an avant garde
none	none	 composed of D Artagnan and Athos 
3021-121440-0030	train-other-500	As soon as they arrived at the spot where Groslow stood they stopped as if guessing that he was the man they wanted
none	none	 Athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner 
3021-121440-0031	train-other-500	whilst D Artagnan ever cautious remained on horseback one hand upon his pistol leaning forward watchfully
none	none	 On seeing the appointed signal Groslow who had at first crept behind one of the cannon planted on that spot walked straight up to the gentlemen He was so well wrapped up in his cloak that it would have been impossible to see his face 
3021-121440-0032	train-other-500	even if the night had not been so dark as to render precaution superfluous
none	none	 nevertheless the keen glance of Athos perceived at once it was not Rogers who stood before them What do you want with us he asked of Groslow 
3021-121440-0033	train-other-500	I wish to inform you my lord replied Groslow with an Irish accent feigned of course
none	none	 that if you are looking for Captain Rogers you will not find him 
3021-121440-0034	train-other-500	He fell down this morning and broke his leg But I m his cousin he told me everything and desired me to watch instead of him and in his place to conduct wherever they wished to go the gentlemen who should bring me a handkerchief tied at each corner like that one which you hold
none	none	 and one which I have in my pocket And he drew out the handkerchief Was that all he said inquired Athos No my lord he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if I landed you safe and sound at Boulogne 
3021-121440-0035	train-other-500	or any other port you choose in France
none	none	 What do you think of all this said Athos in a low tone to D Artagnan after explaining to him in French what the sailor had said in English 
3021-121440-0036	train-other-500	It seems a likely story to me
none	none	 And to me too 
3021-121440-0037	train-other-500	Besides we can but blow out his brains if he proves false said the Gascon
none	none	 and you Athos you know something of everything and can be our captain 
3021-121440-0038	train-other-500	I dare say you know how to navigate should he fail us My dear friend you guess well My father meant me for the navy and I have some vague notions about navigation You see
none	none	 cried D Artagnan 
3021-121440-0039	train-other-500	They then summoned their friends who with Blaisois Mousqueton and Grimaud promptly joined them
none	none	 leaving Parry behind them who was to take back to London the horses of the gentlemen 
3021-121440-0040	train-other-500	and of their lackeys which had been sold to the host in settlement of their account with him Thanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take away with them a sum of money which if not large
3021-121440-0041	train-other-500	was sufficient as a provision against delays and accidents Parry parted from his friends regretfully they had proposed his going with them to France but he had straightway declined It is very simple Mousqueton had said he is thinking of Groslow
3021-121440-0042	train-other-500	It was Captain Groslow the reader will remember who had broken Parry s head D Artagnan resumed immediately the attitude of distrust that was habitual with him He found the wharf too completely deserted
none	none	 the night too dark 
3021-121440-0043	train-other-500	the captain too accommodating He had reported to Aramis what had taken place and Aramis not less distrustful than he had increased his suspicions
none	none	 A slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed Athos of the Gascon s uneasiness We have no time now for suspicions said Athos 
3021-121440-0044	train-other-500	The boat is waiting for us come Besides said Aramis what prevents our being distrustful and going aboard at the same time
none	none	 We can watch the skipper 
3021-121440-0045	train-other-500	And if he doesn t go straight I will crush him that s all
none	none	 Well said Porthos replied D Artagnan 
3021-121440-0046	train-other-500	Let us go then You first Mousqueton and he stopped his friends directing the valets to go first in order to test the plank leading from the pier to the boat The three valets passed without accident
none	none	 Athos followed them then Porthos then Aramis 
3021-121440-0047	train-other-500	D Artagnan went last still shaking his head What in the devil is the matter with you my friend said Porthos Upon my word you would make Caesar afraid The matter is
none	none	 replied D Artagnan 
3021-121440-0048	train-other-500	that I can see upon this pier neither inspector nor sentinel nor exciseman And you complain of that said Porthos Everything goes as if in flowery paths Everything goes too well Porthos But no matter
3021-121440-0049	train-other-500	we must trust in God As soon as the plank was withdrawn the captain took his place at the tiller and made a sign to one of the sailors who boat hook in hand began to push out from the labyrinth of boats in which they were involved
3021-121440-0050	train-other-500	The other sailor had already seated himself on the port side and was ready to row As soon as there was room for rowing his companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more rapidly At last we are off exclaimed Porthos Alas
none	none	 said Athos we depart alone 
3021-121440-0051	train-other-500	Yes but all four together and without a scratch which is a consolation We are not yet at our destination observed the prudent D Artagnan beware of misadventure Ah my friend cried Porthos like the crows you always bring bad omens
none	none	 Who could intercept us on such a night as this 
3021-121440-0052	train-other-500	pitch dark when one does not see more than twenty yards before one Yes but to morrow morning To morrow we shall be at Boulogne I hope so with all my heart said the Gascon and I confess my weakness
none	none	 Yes Athos you may laugh 
3021-121440-0053	train-other-500	but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it I was looking for a frightful discharge of musketry which would crush us But said Porthos with great wisdom that was impossible
none	none	 for they would have killed the captain and the sailors 
3021-121440-0054	train-other-500	Bah much Monsieur Mordaunt would care
none	none	 You don t imagine he would consider a little thing like that At any rate said Porthos I am glad to hear D Artagnan admit that he is afraid 
3021-121440-0055	train-other-500	I not only confess it but am proud of it returned the Gascon I m not such a rhinoceros as you are Oho what s that The Lightning answered the captain our felucca
none	none	 So far so good laughed Athos 
3021-121440-0056	train-other-500	They went on board and the captain instantly conducted them to the berth prepared for them a cabin which was to serve for all purposes and for the whole party he then tried to slip away under pretext of giving orders to some one
none	none	 Stop a moment cried D Artagnan 
3021-121440-0057	train-other-500	pray how many men have you on board captain I don t understand was the reply
none	none	 Explain it Athos 
3021-121440-0058	train-other-500	Groslow on the question being interpreted answered Three without counting myself D Artagnan understood for while replying the captain had raised three fingers Oh he exclaimed
none	none	 I begin to be more at my ease however 
3021-121440-0059	train-other-500	whilst you settle yourselves I shall make the round of the boat As for me said Porthos
none	none	 I will see to the supper 
3021-121440-0060	train-other-500	A very good idea Porthos said the Gascon
none	none	 Athos lend me Grimaud who in the society of his friend Parry has perhaps picked up a little English and can act as my interpreter 
3021-121440-0061	train-other-500	Go Grimaud
none	none	 said Athos 
3021-121440-0062	train-other-500	D Artagnan finding a lantern on the deck took it up and with a pistol in his hand he said to the captain in English Come being with the classic English oath the only English words he knew and so saying he descended to the lower deck
3021-121440-0063	train-other-500	This was divided into three compartments
none	none	 one which was covered by the floor of that room in which Athos Porthos and Aramis were to pass the night 
3021-121440-0064	train-other-500	the second was to serve as the sleeping room for the servants
none	none	 the third under the prow of the ship 
3021-121440-0065	train-other-500	was under the temporary cabin in which Mordaunt was concealed
none	none	 Oho cried D Artagnan as he went down the steps of the hatchway 
3021-121440-0066	train-other-500	preceded by the lantern what a number of barrels one would think one was in the cave of Ali Baba What is there in them he added putting his lantern on one of the casks The captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again
3021-121440-0067	train-other-500	but controlling himself he answered Port wine
none	none	 Ah port wine tis a comfort 
3021-121440-0068	train-other-500	said the Gascon since we shall not die of thirst Are they all full Grimaud translated the question and Groslow who was wiping the perspiration from off his forehead answered Some full others empty
none	none	 D Artagnan struck the barrels with his hand and having ascertained that he spoke the truth pushed his lantern 
3021-121440-0069	train-other-500	greatly to the captain s alarm into the interstices between the barrels and finding that there was nothing concealed in them Come along he said and he went toward the door of the second compartment Stop
none	none	 said the Englishman I have the key of that door 
3021-121440-0070	train-other-500	and he opened the door with a trembling hand into the second compartment where Mousqueton and Blaisois were preparing supper Here there was evidently nothing to seek or to apprehend and they passed rapidly to examine the third compartment
3021-121440-0071	train-other-500	This was the room appropriated to the sailors Two or three hammocks hung upon the ceiling a table and two benches composed the entire furniture D Artagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the walls and meeting nothing to suspect
3021-121440-0072	train-other-500	regained by the hatchway the deck of the vessel And this room he asked pointing to the captain s cabin That s my room replied Groslow Open the door
none	none	 The captain obeyed D Artagnan stretched out his arm in which he held the lantern 
3021-121440-0073	train-other-500	put his head in at the half opened door and seeing that the cabin was nothing better than a shed Good he said If there is an army on board it is not here that it is hidden Let us see what Porthos has found for supper
3021-121440-0074	train-other-500	And thanking the captain he regained the state cabin where his friends were
none	none	 Porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger He had fallen asleep and was in a profound slumber when D Artagnan returned Athos and Aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when their companion came in again 
3021-121440-0075	train-other-500	Well said Aramis All is well we may sleep tranquilly On this assurance the two friends fell asleep
none	none	 and D Artagnan who was very weary bade good night to Grimaud and laid himself down in his cloak with naked sword at his side in such a manner that his body barricaded the passage and it should be impossible to enter the room without upsetting him seventy one Port Wine In ten minutes the masters slept not so the servants hungry and more thirsty than hungry Blaisois and Mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which consisted of a plank and a valise On a hanging table which swung to and fro with the rolling of the vessel were a pot of beer and three glasses This cursed rolling said Blaisois I know it will serve me as it did when we came over And to think said Mousqueton that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but barley bread and hop beer Pah But where is your wicker flask Monsieur Mousqueton Have you lost it asked Blaisois No replied Mousqueton Parry kept it Those devilish Scotchmen are always thirsty And you Grimaud he said to his companion who had just come in after his round with D Artagnan are you thirsty As thirsty as a Scotchman was Grimaud s laconic reply And he sat down and began to cast up the accounts of his party whose money he managed Oh lackadaisy I m beginning to feel queer cried Blaisois If that s the case said Mousqueton with a learned air take some nourishment Do you call that nourishment said Blaisois pointing to the barley bread and pot of beer upon the table Blaisois replied Mousqueton remember that bread is the true nourishment of a Frenchman who is not always able to get bread ask Grimaud Yes but beer asked Blaisois sharply is that their true drink As to that answered Mousqueton puzzled how to get out of the difficulty I must confess that to me beer is as disagreeable as wine is to the English What Monsieur Mousqueton The English do they dislike wine They hate it But I have seen them drink it As a punishment For example an English prince died one day because they had put him into a butt of Malmsey I heard the Chevalier d Herblay say so The fool cried Blaisois I wish I had been in his place Thou canst be said Grimaud writing down his figures How asked Blaisois I can Explain yourself Grimaud went on with his sum and cast up the whole Port he said extending his hand in the direction of the first compartment examined by D Artagnan and himself Eh eh ah Those barrels I saw through the door Port replied Grimaud beginning a fresh sum I have heard said Blaisois that port is a very good wine Excellent exclaimed Mousqueton smacking his lips Excellent there is port wine in the cellar of Monsieur le Baron de Bracieux Suppose we ask these Englishmen to sell us a bottle said the honest Blaisois Sell cried Mousqueton about whom there was a remnant of his ancient marauding character left One may well perceive young man that you are inexperienced Why buy what one can take Take said Blaisois covet the goods of your neighbor That is forbidden it seems to me Where forbidden asked Mousqueton In the commandments of God or of the church I don t know which I only know it says Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor s goods nor yet his wife That is a child s reason Monsieur Blaisois said Mousqueton in his most patronizing manner Yes you talk like a child I repeat the word Where have you read in the Scriptures I ask you that the English are your neighbors Where that is true said Blaisois at least I can t now recall it A child s reason I repeat it continued Mousqueton If you had been ten years engaged in war as Grimaud and I have been my dear Blaisois you would know the difference there is between the goods of others and the goods of enemies Now an Englishman is an enemy this port wine belongs to the English therefore it belongs to us And our masters asked Blaisois stupefied by this harangue delivered with an air of profound sagacity will they be of your opinion Mousqueton smiled disdainfully I suppose that you think it necessary that I should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say Gentlemen your servant Mousqueton is thirsty What does Monsieur Bracieux care think you whether I am thirsty or not Tis a very expensive wine said Blaisois shaking his head Were it liquid gold Monsieur Blaisois our masters would not deny themselves this wine Know that Monsieur de Bracieux is rich enough to drink a tun of port wine even if obliged to pay a pistole for every drop His manner became more and more lofty every instant then he arose and after finishing off the beer at one draught he advanced majestically to the door of the compartment where the wine was Ah locked he exclaimed these devils of English how suspicious they are Locked said Blaisois ah the deuce it is unlucky for my stomach is getting more and more upset Locked repeated Mousqueton But Blaisois ventured to say I have heard you relate Monsieur Mousqueton that once on a time at Chantilly you fed your master and yourself by taking partridges in a snare carp with a line and bottles with a slipnoose Perfectly true but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was in bottles I cannot throw the loop through this partition nor move with a pack thread a cask of wine which may perhaps weigh two hundred pounds No but you can take out two or three boards of the partition answered Blaisois and make a hole in the cask with a gimlet Mousqueton opened his great round eyes to the utmost astonished to find in Blaisois qualities for which he did not give him credit Tis true he said but where can I get a chisel to take the planks out a gimlet to pierce the cask Trousers said Grimaud still squaring his accounts Ah yes said Mousqueton Grimaud in fact was not only the accountant but the armorer of the party and as he was a man full of forethought these trousers carefully rolled up in his valise contained every sort of tool for immediate use Mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his task In a few minutes he had extracted three boards He tried to pass his body through the aperture but not being like the frog in the fable who thought he was larger than he really was he found he must take out three or four more before he could get through He sighed and set to work again Grimaud had now finished his accounts He arose and stood near Mousqueton I he said What said Mousqueton I can pass That is true said Mousqueton glancing at his friend s long and thin body you will pass easily And he knows the full casks said Blaisois for he has already been in the hold with Monsieur le Chevalier d Artagnan Let Monsieur Grimaud go in Monsieur Mouston I could go in as well as Grimaud said Mousqueton a little piqued Yes but that would take too much time and I am thirsty I am getting more and more seasick Go in then Grimaud said Mousqueton handing him the beer pot and gimlet Rinse the glasses said Grimaud Then with a friendly gesture toward Mousqueton that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another he glided like a serpent through the opening and disappeared Blaisois was in a state of great excitement he was in ecstasies Of all the exploits performed since their arrival in England by the extraordinary men with whom he had the honor to be associated this seemed without question to be the most wonderful You are about to see said Mousqueton looking at Blaisois with an expression of superiority which the latter did not even think of questioning you are about to see Blaisois how we old soldiers drink when we are thirsty My cloak said Grimaud from the bottom of the hold What do you want asked Blaisois My cloak stop up the aperture with it Why asked Blaisois Simpleton exclaimed Mousqueton suppose any one came into the room Ah true cried Blaisois with evident admiration but it will be dark in the cellar Grimaud always sees dark or light night as well as day answered Mousqueton That is lucky said Blaisois As for me when I have no candle I can t take two steps without knocking against something That s because you haven t served said Mousqueton Had you been in the army you would have been able to pick up a needle on the floor of a closed oven But hark I think some one is coming Mousqueton made with a low whistling sound the sign of alarm well known to the lackeys in the days of their youth resumed his place at the table and made a sign to Blaisois to follow his example Blaisois obeyed The door of their cabin was opened Two men wrapped in their cloaks appeared Oho said they not in bed at a quarter past eleven That s against all rules In a quarter of an hour let every one be in bed and snoring These two men then went toward the compartment in which Grimaud was secreted opened the door entered and shut it after them Ah cried Blaisois he is lost Grimaud s a cunning fellow murmured Mousqueton They waited for ten minutes during which time no noise was heard that might indicate that Grimaud was discovered and at the expiration of that anxious interval the two men returned closed the door after them and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and extinguish their lights disappeared Shall we obey asked Blaisois All this looks suspicious They said a quarter of an hour We still have five minutes replied Mousqueton Suppose we warn the masters Let s wait for Grimaud But perhaps they have killed him Grimaud would have cried out You know he is almost dumb We should have heard the blow then But if he doesn t return Here he is At that very moment Grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came in with his face livid his eyes staring wide open with terror so that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing with a large circle of white around them He held in his hand a tankard full of a dark substance and approaching the gleam of light shed by the lamp he uttered this single monosyllable Oh with such an expression of extreme terror that Mousqueton started alarmed and Blaisois was near fainting from fright Both however cast an inquisitive glance into the tankard it was full of gunpowder Convinced that the ship was full of powder instead of having a cargo of wine Grimaud hastened to awake D Artagnan who had no sooner beheld him than he perceived that something extraordinary had taken place Imposing silence Grimaud put out the little night lamp then knelt down and poured into the lieutenant s ear a recital melodramatic enough not to require play of feature to give it pith This was the gist of his strange story The first barrel that Grimaud had found on passing into the compartment he struck it was empty He passed on to another it also was empty but the third which he tried was from the dull sound it gave out evidently full At this point Grimaud stopped and was preparing to make a hole with his gimlet when he found a spigot he therefore placed his tankard under it and turned the spout something whatever it was the cask contained fell silently into the tankard Whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard contained before taking it to his companions the door of the cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a cloak came and stood just before the hogshead behind which Grimaud on hearing him come in instantly crept This was Groslow He was accompanied by another man who carried in his hand something long and flexible rolled up resembling a washing line His face was hidden under the wide brim of his hat Grimaud thinking that they had come as he had to try the port wine effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not a great one Have you the wick asked the one who carried the lantern Here it is answered the other At the voice of this last speaker Grimaud started and felt a shudder creeping through his very marrow He rose gently so that his head was just above the round of the barrel and under the large hat he recognized the pale face of Mordaunt How long will this fuse burn asked this person About five minutes replied the captain That voice also was known to Grimaud He looked from one to the other and after Mordaunt he recognized Groslow Then tell the men to be in readiness don t tell them why now When the clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your men Get down into the longboat That is when I have lighted the match I will undertake that I wish to be sure of my revenge Are the oars in the boat Everything is ready Tis well Mordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot in order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at the opposite end with the match He then arose You hear me at a quarter past midnight in fact in twenty minutes I understand all perfectly sir replied Groslow but allow me to say there is great danger in what you undertake would it not be better to intrust one of the men to set fire to the train My dear Groslow answered Mordaunt you know the French proverb Nothing one does not do one s self is ever well done I shall abide by that rule Grimaud had heard all this if he had not understood it But what he saw made good what he lacked in perfect comprehension of the language He had seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers had seen Mordaunt adjust the fuse he had heard the proverb which Mordaunt had given in French Then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held in his hand and instead of the lively liquor expected by Blaisois and Mousqueton he found beneath his fingers the grains of some coarse powder Mordaunt went away with the captain At the door he stopped to listen Do you hear how they sleep he asked In fact Porthos could be heard snoring through the partition Tis God who gives them into our hands answered Groslow This time the devil himself shall not save them rejoined Mordaunt And they went out together seventy two End of the Port Wine Mystery Grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent posture Ah he said wiping with his sleeve large drops of sweat from his forehead how lucky it was that Mousqueton was thirsty He made haste to pass out by the opening still thinking himself in a dream but the sight of the gunpowder in the tankard proved to him that his dream was a fatal nightmare It may be imagined that D Artagnan listened to these details with increasing interest before Grimaud had finished he rose without noise and putting his mouth to Aramis s ear and at the same time touching him on the shoulder to prevent a sudden movement Chevalier he said get up and don t make the least noise Aramis awoke D Artagnan pressing his hand repeated his call Aramis obeyed Athos is near you said D Artagnan warn him as I have warned you Aramis easily aroused Athos whose sleep was light like that of all persons of a finely organized constitution But there was more difficulty in arousing Porthos He was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep which was very annoying to him when D Artagnan instead of explaining closed his mouth with his hand Then our Gascon extending his arms drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one another Friends he said we must leave this craft at once or we are dead men Bah said Athos are you still afraid Do you know who is captain of this vessel No Captain Groslow The shudder of the three musketeers showed to D Artagnan that his words began to make some impression on them Groslow said Aramis the devil Who is this Groslow asked Porthos I don t remember him Groslow is the man who broke Parry s head and is now getting ready to break ours Oh oh And do you know who is his lieutenant His lieutenant There is none said Athos They don t have lieutenants in a felucca manned by a crew of four Yes but Monsieur Groslow is not a captain of the ordinary kind he has a lieutenant and that lieutenant is Monsieur Mordaunt This time the musketeers did more than shudder they almost cried out Those invincible men were subject to a mysterious and fatal influence which that name had over them the mere sound of it filled them with terror What shall we do said Athos We must seize the felucca said Aramis And kill him said Porthos The felucca is mined said D Artagnan Those casks which I took for casks of port wine are filled with powder When Mordaunt finds himself discovered he will destroy all friends and foes and on my word he would be bad company in going either to Heaven or to hell You have some plan then asked Athos Yes What is it Have you confidence in me Give your orders said the three musketeers Very well come this way D Artagnan went toward a very small low window just large enough to let a man through He turned it gently on its hinges There he said is our road The deuce it is a very cold one my dear friend said Aramis Stay here if you like but I warn you twill be rather too warm presently But we cannot swim to the shore The longboat is yonder lashed to the felucca We will take possession of it and cut the cable Come my friends A moment s delay said Athos our servants Here we are they cried Meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which D Artagnan in raising the shutters had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the window Those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn more striking than the raging sea rolling with its deafening roar its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry moon Gracious Heaven we are hesitating cried D Artagnan if we hesitate what will the servants do I do not hesitate you know said Grimaud Sir interposed Blaisois I warn you that I can only swim in rivers And I not at all said Mousqueton But D Artagnan had now slipped through the window You have decided friend said Athos Yes the Gascon answered Athos you who are a perfect being bid spirit triumph over body Do you Aramis order the servants Porthos kill every one who stands in your way And after pressing the hand of Athos D Artagnan chose a moment when the ship rolled backward so that he had only to plunge into the water which was already up to his waist Athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the sea D Artagnan swam to it and held it suspending himself by this rope his head alone out of water In one second Athos joined him Then they saw as the felucca turned two other heads peeping those of Aramis and Grimaud I am uneasy about Blaisois said Athos he can he says only swim in rivers When people can swim at all they can swim anywhere To the boat to the boat But Porthos I do not see him Porthos is coming he swims like Leviathan In fact Porthos did not appear for a scene half tragedy and half comedy had been performed by him with Mousqueton and Blaisois who frightened by the noise of the sea by the whistling of the wind by the sight of that dark water yawning like a gulf beneath them shrank back instead of going forward Come come said Porthos jump in But monsieur said Mousqueton I can t swim let me stay here And me too monsieur said Blaisois I assure you I shall be very much in the way in that little boat said Mousqueton And I know I shall drown before reaching it continued Blaisois Come along I shall strangle you both if you don t get out said Porthos at last seizing Mousqueton by the throat Forward Blaisois A groan stifled by the grasp of Porthos was all the reply of poor Blaisois for the giant taking him neck and heels plunged him into the water headforemost pushing him out of the window as if he had been a plank Now Mousqueton he said I hope you don t mean to desert your master Ah sir replied Mousqueton his eyes filling with tears why did you re enter the army We were all so happy in the Chateau de Pierrefonds And without any other complaint passive and obedient either from true devotion to his master or from the example set by Blaisois Mousqueton leaped into the sea headforemost A sublime action at all events for Mousqueton looked upon himself as dead But Porthos was not a man to abandon an old servant and when Mousqueton rose above the water blind as a new born puppy he found he was supported by the large hand of Porthos and that he was thus enabled without having occasion even to move to advance toward the cable with the dignity of a very triton In a few minutes Porthos had rejoined his companions who were already in the boat but when after they had all got in it came to his turn there was great danger that in putting his huge leg over the edge of the boat he would upset the little vessel Athos was the last to enter Are you all here he asked Ah have you your sword Athos cried D Artagnan Yes Cut the cable then Athos drew a sharp poniard from his belt and cut the cord The felucca went on the boat continued stationary rocked only by the swashing waves Come Athos said D Artagnan giving his hand to the count you are going to see something curious added the Gascon seventy three Fatality Scarcely had D Artagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden noise was heard resounding through the felucca which had now become dim in the obscurity of the night That you may be sure said the Gascon means something They then at the same instant perceived a large lantern carried on a pole appear on the deck defining the forms of shadows behind it Suddenly a terrible cry a cry of despair was wafted through space and as if the shrieks of anguish had driven away the clouds the veil which hid the moon was cleated away and the gray sails and dark shrouds of the felucca were plainly visible beneath the silvery light Shadows ran as if bewildered to and fro on the vessel and mournful cries accompanied these delirious walkers In the midst of these screams they saw Mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand The agitated figures apparently wild with terror consisted of Groslow who at the hour fixed by Mordaunt had collected his men and the sailors Mordaunt after having listened at the door of the cabin to hear if the musketeers were still asleep had gone down into the cellar convinced by their silence that they were all in a deep slumber Then he had run to the train impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge and full of confidence as are those whom God blinds he had set fire to the wick of nitre All this while Groslow and his men were assembled on deck Haul up the cable and draw the boat to us said Groslow One of the sailors got down the side of the ship seized the cable and drew it it came without the least resistance The cable is cut he cried no boat How no boat exclaimed Groslow it is impossible Tis true however answered the sailor there s nothing in the wake of the ship besides here s the end of the cable What s the matter cried Mordaunt who coming up out of the hatchway rushed to the stern waving his torch Only that our enemies have escaped they have cut the cord and gone off with the boat Mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the door Empty he exclaimed the infernal demons We must pursue them said Groslow they can t be gone far and we will sink them passing over them Yes but the fire ejaculated Mordaunt I have lighted it Ten thousand devils cried Groslow rushing to the hatchway perhaps there is still time to save us Mordaunt answered only by a terrible laugh threw his torch into the sea and plunged in after it The instant Groslow put his foot upon the hatchway steps the ship opened like the crater of a volcano A burst of flame rose toward the skies with an explosion like that of a hundred cannon the air burned ignited by flaming embers then the frightful lightning disappeared the brands sank one after another into the abyss where they were extinguished and save for a slight vibration in the air after a few minutes had elapsed one would have thought that nothing had happened Only the felucca had disappeared from the surface of the sea and Groslow and his three sailors were consumed The four friends saw all this not a single detail of this fearful scene escaped them At one moment bathed as they were in a flood of brilliant light which illumined the sea for the space of a league they might each be seen each by his own peculiar attitude and manner expressing the awe which even in their hearts of bronze they could not help experiencing Soon a torrent of vivid sparks fell around them then at last the volcano was extinguished then all was dark and still the floating bark and heaving ocean They sat silent and dejected By Heaven at last said Athos the first to speak by this time I think all must be over Here my lords save me help cried a voice whose mournful accents reaching the four friends seemed to proceed from some phantom of the ocean All looked around Athos himself stared Tis he it is his voice All still remained silent the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the vessel had disappeared endeavoring in vain to penetrate the darkness After a minute or two they were able to distinguish a man who approached them swimming vigorously Athos extended his arm toward him pointing him out to his companions Yes yes I see him well enough said D Artagnan He again cried Porthos who was breathing like a blacksmith s bellows why he is made of iron Oh my God muttered Athos Aramis and D Artagnan whispered to each other Mordaunt made several strokes more and raising his arm in sign of distress above the waves Pity pity on me gentlemen in Heaven s name my strength is failing me I am dying The voice that implored aid was so piteous that it awakened pity in the heart of Athos Poor fellow he exclaimed Indeed said D Artagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your sympathy I believe he s swimming toward us Does he think we are going to take him in Row Porthos row And setting the example he plowed his oar into the sea two strokes took the bark on twenty fathoms further Oh you will not abandon me You will not leave me to perish You will not be pitiless cried Mordaunt Ah ah said Porthos to Mordaunt I think we have you now my hero and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of hell Oh Porthos murmured the Comte de la Fere Oh pray for mercy s sake don t fly from me For pity s sake cried the young man whose agony drawn breath at times when his head went under water under the wave exhaled and made the icy waters bubble D Artagnan however who had consulted with Aramis spoke to the poor wretch Go away he said your repentance is too recent to inspire confidence See the vessel in which you wished to fry us is still smoking and the situation in which you are is a bed of roses compared to that in which you wished to place us and in which you have placed Monsieur Groslow and his companions Sir replied Mordaunt in a tone of deep despair my penitence is sincere Gentlemen I am young scarcely twenty three years old I was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my mother You would have done what I did Mordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat for the approach of death seemed to give him supernatural strength Alas he said I am then to die You are going to kill the son as you killed the mother Surely if I am culpable and if I ask for pardon I ought to be forgiven Then as if his strength failed him he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and a wave passed over his head which drowned his voice Oh this is torture to me cried Athos Mordaunt reappeared For my part said D Artagnan I say this must come to an end murderer as you were of your uncle executioner as you were of King Charles incendiary I recommend you to sink forthwith to the bottom of the sea and if you come another fathom nearer I ll stave your wicked head in with this oar D Artagnan D Artagnan cried Athos my son I entreat you the wretch is dying and it is horrible to let a man die without extending a hand to save him I cannot resist doing so he must live Zounds replied D Artagnan why don t you give yourself up directly feet and hands bound to that wretch Ah Comte de la Fere you wish to perish by his hands I your son as you call me I will not let you Twas the first time D Artagnan had ever refused a request from Athos Aramis calmly drew his sword which he had carried between his teeth as he swam If he lays his hand on the boat s edge I will cut it off regicide that he is And I said Porthos Wait What are you going to do asked Aramis Throw myself in the water and strangle him Oh gentlemen cried Athos be men be Christians See death is depicted on his face Ah do not bring on me the horrors of remorse Grant me this poor wretch s life I will bless you I I am dying cried Mordaunt come to me come to me D Artagnan began to be touched The boat at this moment turned around and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer Athos Monsieur the Comte de la Fere he cried I supplicate you pity me I call on you where are you I see you no longer I am dying help me help me Here I am sir said Athos leaning and stretching out his arm to Mordaunt with that air of dignity and nobility of soul habitual to him here I am take my hand and jump into our boat Mordaunt made a last effort rose seized the hand thus extended to him and grasped it with the vehemence of despair That s right said Athos put your other hand here And he offered him his shoulder as another stay and support so that his head almost touched that of Mordaunt and these two mortal enemies were in as close an embrace as if they had been brothers Now sir said the count you are safe calm yourself Ah my mother cried Mordaunt with eyes on fire with a look of hate impossible to paint I can only offer thee one victim but it shall at any rate be the one thou wouldst thyself have chosen And whilst D Artagnan uttered a cry Porthos raised the oar and Aramis sought a place to strike a frightful shake given to the boat precipitated Athos into the sea whilst Mordaunt with a shout of triumph grasped the neck of his victim and in order to paralyze his movements twined arms and legs around the musketeer For an instant without an exclamation without a cry for help Athos tried to sustain himself on the surface of the waters but the weight dragged him down he disappeared by degrees soon nothing was to be seen except his long floating hair then both men disappeared and the bubbling of the water which in its turn was soon effaced alone indicated the spot where these two had sunk Mute with horror the three friends had remained open mouthed their eyes dilated their arms extended like statues and motionless as they were the beating of their hearts was audible Porthos was the first who came to himself He tore his hair Oh he cried Athos Athos thou man of noble heart woe is me I have let thee perish At this instant in the midst of the silver circle illumined by the light of the moon the same whirlpool which had been made by the sinking men was again obvious and first were seen rising above the waves a wisp of hair then a pale face with open eyes yet nevertheless the eyes of death then a body which after rising of itself even to the waist above the sea turned gently on its back according to the caprice of the waves and floated In the bosom of this corpse was plunged a poniard the gold hilt of which shone in the moonbeams Mordaunt Mordaunt cried the three friends tis Mordaunt But Athos exclaimed D Artagnan Suddenly the boat leaned on one side beneath a new and unexpected weight and Grimaud uttered a shout of joy every one turned around and beheld Athos livid his eyes dim and his hands trembling supporting himself on the edge of the boat Eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately and laid him in the boat where directly Athos was warmed and reanimated reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends who were intoxicated with joy You are not hurt asked D Artagnan No replied Athos and he Oh he now we may say at last thank Heaven he is really dead Look and D Artagnan obliging Athos to look in the direction he pointed showed him the body of Mordaunt floating on its back which sometimes submerged sometimes rising seemed still to pursue the four friends with looks of insult and mortal hatred At last he sank Athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were expressed Bravo Athos cried Aramis with an emotion very rare in him A capital blow you gave cried Porthos I have a son I wished to live said Athos In short said D Artagnan this has been the will of God It was not I who killed him said Athos in a soft low tone twas destiny seventy four How Mousqueton had a Narrow Escape of being eaten A deep silence reigned for a long time in the boat after the fearful scene described The moon which had shone for a short time disappeared behind the clouds every object was again plunged in the obscurity that is so awful in the deserts and still more so in that liquid desert the ocean and nothing was heard save the whistling of the west wind driving along the tops of the crested billows Porthos was the first to speak I have seen he said many dreadful things but nothing that ever agitated me so much as what I have just witnessed Nevertheless even in my present state of perturbation I protest that I feel happy I have a hundred pounds weight less upon my chest I breathe more freely In fact Porthos breathed so loud as to do credit to the free play of his powerful lungs For my part observed Aramis I cannot say the same as you do Porthos I am still terrified to such a degree that I scarcely believe my eyes I look around the boat expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his heart Oh I feel easy replied Porthos The poniard was pointed at the sixth rib and buried up to the hilt in his body I do not reproach you Athos for what you have done On the contrary when one aims a blow that is the regulation way to strike So now I breathe again I am happy Don t be in haste to celebrate a victory Porthos interposed D Artagnan never have we incurred a greater danger than we are now encountering Men may subdue men they cannot overcome the elements We are now on the sea at night without any pilot in a frail bark should a blast of wind upset the boat we are lost Mousqueton heaved a deep sigh You are ungrateful D Artagnan said Athos yes ungrateful to Providence to whom we owe our safety in the most miraculous manner Let us sail before the wind and unless it changes we shall be drifted either to Calais or Boulogne Should our bark be upset we are five of us good swimmers able enough to turn it over again or if not to hold on by it Now we are on the very road which all the vessels between Dover and Calais take tis impossible but that we should meet with a fisherman who will pick us up But should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the north That said Athos would be quite another thing and we should nevermore see land until we were upon the other side of the Atlantic Which implies that we may die of hunger said Aramis Tis more than possible answered the Comte de la Fere Mousqueton sighed again more deeply than before What is the matter what ails you asked Porthos I am cold sir said Mousqueton Impossible your body is covered with a coating of fat which preserves it from the cold air Ah sir tis this very coating of fat that makes me shiver How is that Mousqueton Alas your honor in the library of the Chateau of Bracieux there are a lot of books of travels What then Amongst them the voyages of Jean Mocquet in the time of Henry IV Well In these books your honor tis told how hungry voyagers drifting out to sea have a bad habit of eating each other and beginning with The fattest among them cried D Artagnan unable in spite of the gravity of the occasion to help laughing Yes sir answered Mousqueton but permit me to say I see nothing laughable in it However he added turning to Porthos I should not regret dying sir were I sure that by doing so I might still be useful to you Mouston replied Porthos much affected should we ever see my castle of Pierrefonds again you shall have as your own and for your descendants the vineyard that surrounds the farm And you should call it Devotion added Aramis the vineyard of self sacrifice to transmit to latest ages the recollection of your devotion to your master Chevalier said D Artagnan laughing you could eat a piece of Mouston couldn t you especially after two or three days of fasting Oh no replied Aramis I should much prefer Blaisois we haven t known him so long One may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended chiefly to divert Athos from the scene which had just taken place the servants with the exception of Grimaud were not silent Suddenly Mousqueton uttered a cry of delight taking from beneath one of the benches a bottle of wine and on looking more closely in the same place he discovered a dozen similar bottles bread and a monster junk of salted beef Oh sir he cried passing the bottle to Porthos we are saved the bark is supplied with provisions This intelligence restored every one save Athos to gayety Zounds exclaimed Porthos tis astonishing how empty violent agitation makes the stomach And he drank off half a bottle at a draught and bit great mouthfuls of the bread and meat Now said Athos sleep or try to sleep my friends and I will watch In a few moments notwithstanding their wet clothes the icy blast that blew and the previous scene of terror these hardy adventurers with their iron frames inured to every hardship threw themselves down intending to profit by the advice of Athos who sat at the helm pensively wakeful guiding the little bark the way it was to go his eyes fixed on the heavens as if he sought to verify not only the road to France but the benign aspect of protecting Providence After some hours of repose the sleepers were aroused by Athos Dawn was shedding its pallid placid glimmer on the purple ocean when at the distance of a musket shot from them was seen a dark gray mass above which gleamed a triangular sail then masters and servants joined in a fervent cry to the crew of that vessel to hear them and to save A bark all cried together It was in fact a small craft from Dunkirk bound for Boulogne A quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all aboard Grimaud tendered twenty guineas to the captain and at nine o clock in the morning having a fair wind our Frenchmen set foot on their native land Egad how strong one feels here said Porthos almost burying his large feet in the sands Zounds I could defy a nation Be quiet Porthos said D Artagnan we are observed We are admired i faith answered Porthos These people who are looking at us are only merchants said Athos and are looking more at the cargo than at us I shall not trust to that said the lieutenant and I shall make for the Dunes as soon as possible Sandy hills about Dunkirk from which it derives its name The party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks of sand unobserved Here after a short conference they proposed to separate And why separate asked Athos Because answered the Gascon we were sent Porthos and I by Cardinal Mazarin to fight for Cromwell instead of fighting for Cromwell we have served Charles I not the same thing by any means In returning with the Comte de la Fere and Monsieur d Herblay our crime would be confirmed We have circumvented Cromwell Mordaunt and the sea but we shall find a certain difficulty in circumventing Mazarin You forget replied Athos that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free from the engagement we entered into Truly Athos interrupted D Artagnan I am vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys would be ashamed of Chevalier he continued addressing Aramis who leaning proudly on his sword seemed to agree with his companion Chevalier Porthos and I run no risk besides should any ill luck happen to two of us will it not be much better that the other two should be spared to assist those who may be apprehended Besides who knows whether divided we may not obtain a pardon you from the queen we from Mazarin which were we all four together would never be granted Come Athos and Aramis go to the right Porthos come with me to the left these gentlemen should file off into Normandy whilst we by the nearest road reach Paris He then gave his friends minute directions as to their route Ah my dear friend exclaimed Athos how I should admire the resources of your mind did I not stop to adore those of your heart And he gave him his hand Isn t this fox a genius Athos asked the Gascon No he knows how to crunch fowls to dodge the huntsman and to find his way home by day or by night that s all Well is all said All Then let s count our money and divide it Ah hurrah there s the sun A merry morning to you Sunshine Tis a long time since I saw thee Come come D Artagnan said Athos do not affect to be strong minded there are tears in your eyes Let us be open with each other and sincere What cried the Gascon do you think Athos we can take leave calmly of two friends at a time not free from danger to you and Aramis No answered Athos embrace me my son Zounds said Porthos sobbing I believe I m crying but how foolish all this is Then they embraced At that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever and when they parted each to take the route agreed on they turned back to utter affectionate expressions which the echoes of the Dunes repeated At last they lost sight of each other Sacrebleu D Artagnan said Porthos I must out with it at once for I can t keep to myself anything I have against you I haven t been able to recognize you in this matter Why not said D Artagnan with his wise smile Because if as you say Athos and Aramis are in real danger this is not the time to abandon them For my part I confess to you that I was all ready to follow them and am still ready to rejoin them in spite of all the Mazarins in the world You would be right Porthos but for one thing which may change the current of your ideas and that is that it is not those gentlemen who are in the greatest danger it is ourselves it is not to abandon them that we have separated but to avoid compromising them Really said Porthos opening his eyes in astonishment Yes no doubt If they are arrested they will only be put in the Bastile if we are arrested it is a matter of the Place de Greve Oh oh said Porthos there is quite a gap between that fate and the baronial coronet you promised me D Artagnan Bah perhaps not so great as you think Porthos you know the proverb All roads lead to Rome But how is it that we are incurring greater risks than Athos and Aramis asked Porthos Because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by Queen Henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by Mazarin because going hence as emissaries to Cromwell we became partisans of King Charles because instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called Mazarin Cromwell Joyce Bridge Fairfax et cetera we very nearly succeeded in saving it Upon my word that is true said Porthos but how can you suppose my dear friend that in the midst of his great preoccupations General Cromwell has had time to think Cromwell thinks of everything Cromwell has time for everything and believe me dear friend we ought not to lose our time it is precious We shall not be safe till we have seen Mazarin and then The devil said Porthos what can we say to Mazarin Leave that to me I have my plan He laughs best who laughs last Cromwell is mighty Mazarin is tricky but I would rather have to do with them than with the late Monsieur Mordaunt Ah said Porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late Monsieur Mordaunt My faith yes said D Artagnan But we must be going The two immediately started across country toward the road to Paris followed by Mousqueton who after being too cold all night at the end of a quarter of an hour found himself too warm seventy five The Return During the six weeks that Athos and Aramis had been absent from France the Parisians finding themselves one morning without either queen or king were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted and the absence of Mazarin a thing so long desired did not compensate for that of the two august fugitives The first feeling that pervaded Paris on hearing of the flight to Saint Germain was that sort of affright which seizes children when they awake in the night and find themselves alone A deputation was therefore sent to the queen to entreat her to return to Paris but she not only declined to receive the deputies but sent an intimation by Chancellor Seguier implying that if the parliament did not humble itself before her majesty by negativing all the questions that had been the cause of the quarrel Paris would be besieged the very next day This threatening answer unluckily for the court produced quite a different effect to that which was intended It wounded the pride of the parliament which supported by the citizens replied by declaring that Cardinal Mazarin was the cause of all the discontent denounced him as the enemy both of the king and the state and ordered him to retire from the court that same day and from France within a week afterward enjoining in case of disobedience on his part all the subjects of the king to pursue and take him Mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law preparations on both sides were commenced by the queen to attack Paris by the citizens to defend it The latter were occupied in breaking up the pavement and stretching chains across the streets when headed by the coadjutor appeared the Prince de Conti the brother of the Prince de Conde and the Duc de Longueville his brother in law This unexpected band of auxiliaries arrived in Paris on the tenth of January and the Prince of Conti was named but not until after a stormy discussion generalissimo of the army of the king out of Paris As for the Duc de Beaufort he arrived from Vendome according to the annals of the day bringing with him his high bearing and his long and beautiful hair qualifications which gained him the sovereignty of the marketplaces The Parisian army had organized with the promptness characteristic of the bourgeois whenever they are moved by any sentiment whatever to disguise themselves as soldiers On the nineteenth the impromptu army had attempted a sortie more to assure itself and others of its actual existence than with any more serious intention They carried a banner on which could be read this strange device We are seeking our king The next following days were occupied in trivial movements which resulted only in the carrying off of a few herds of cattle and the burning of two or three houses That was still the situation of affairs up to the early days of February On the first day of that month our four companions had landed at Boulogne and in two parties had set out for Paris Toward the end of the fourth day of the journey Athos and Aramis reached Nanterre which place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts fearing that they might encounter some troop from the queen s army It was against his will that Athos took these precautions but Aramis had very judiciously reminded him that they had no right to be imprudent that they had been charged by King Charles with a supreme and sacred mission which received at the foot of the scaffold could be accomplished only at the feet of Queen Henrietta Upon that Athos yielded On reaching the capital Athos and Aramis found it in arms The sentinel at the gate refused even to let them pass and called his sergeant The sergeant with the air of importance which such people assume when they are clad with military dignity said Who are you gentlemen Two gentlemen And where do you come from From London And what are you going to do in Paris We are going with a mission to Her Majesty the Queen of England Ah every one seems to be going to see the queen of England We have already at the station three gentlemen whose passports are under examination who are on their way to her majesty Where are your passports We have none we left England ignorant of the state of politics here having left Paris before the departure of the king Ah said the sergeant with a cunning smile you are Mazarinists who are sent as spies My dear friend here Athos spoke rest assured if we were Mazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of passport In your situation distrust those who are well provided with every formality Enter the guardroom said the sergeant we will lay your case before the commandant of the post The guardroom was filled with citizens and common people some playing some drinking some talking In a corner almost hidden from view were three gentlemen who had preceded Athos and Aramis and an officer was examining their passports The first impulse of these three and of those who last entered was to cast an inquiring glance at each other The first arrivals wore long cloaks in whose drapery they were carefully enveloped one of them shorter than the rest remained pertinaciously in the background When the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was bringing in two Mazarinists it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to pass Be it so said Athos yet it is probable on the contrary that we shall enter because we seem to have to do with sensible people There seems to be only one thing to do which is to send our names to Her Majesty the Queen of England and if she engages to answer for us I presume we shall be allowed to enter On hearing these words the shortest of the other three men seemed more attentive than ever to what was going on wrapping his cloak around him more carefully than before Merciful goodness whispered Aramis to Athos did you see What asked Athos The face of the shortest of those three gentlemen No He looked to me but tis impossible At this instant the sergeant who had been for his orders returned and pointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks said The passports are in order let these three gentlemen pass The three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this permission Aramis looked after them and as the last of them passed close to him he pressed the hand of Athos What is the matter with you my friend asked the latter I have doubtless I am dreaming tell me sir he said to the sergeant do you know those three gentlemen who are just gone out Only by their passports they are three Frondists who are gone to rejoin the Duc de Longueville Tis strange said Aramis almost involuntarily I fancied that I recognized Mazarin himself The sergeant burst into a fit of laughter He he cried he venture himself amongst us to be hung Not so foolish as all that Ah muttered Athos I may be mistaken I haven t the unerring eye of D Artagnan Who is speaking of Monsieur D Artagnan asked an officer who appeared at that moment upon the threshold of the room What cried Aramis and Athos what Planchet Planchet added Grimaud Planchet with a gorget indeed Ah gentlemen cried Planchet so you are back again in Paris Oh how happy you make us no doubt you come to join the princes As thou seest Planchet said Aramis whilst Athos smiled on seeing what important rank was held in the city militia by the former comrade of Mousqueton Bazin and Grimaud And Monsieur d Artagnan of whom you spoke just now Monsieur d Herblay may I ask if you have any news of him We parted from him four days ago and we have reason to believe that he has reached Paris before us No sir I am sure he hasn t yet arrived But then he may have stopped at Saint Germain I don t think so we appointed to meet at La Chevrette I was there this very day And had the pretty Madeleine no news asked Aramis smiling No sir and it must be admitted that she seemed very anxious In fact said Aramis there is no time lost and we made our journey quickly Permit me then my dear Athos without inquiring further about our friend to pay my respects to M Planchet Ah monsieur le chevalier said Planchet bowing Lieutenant asked Aramis Lieutenant with a promise of becoming captain Tis capital and pray how did you acquire all these honors In the first place gentlemen you know that I was the means of Monsieur de Rochefort s escape well I was very near being hung by Mazarin and that made me more popular than ever So owing to your popularity No thanks to something better You know gentlemen that I served the Piedmont regiment and had the honor of being a sergeant Yes Well one day when no one could drill a mob of citizens who began to march some with the right foot others with the left I succeeded I did in making them all begin with the same foot and I was made lieutenant on the spot So I presume said Athos that you have a large number of the nobles with you Certainly There are the Prince de Conti the Duc de Longueville the Duc de Beaufort the Duc de Bouillon the Marechal de la Mothe the Marquis de Sevigne and I don t know who for my part And the Vicomte Raoul de Bragelonne inquired Athos in a tremulous voice D Artagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care in parting Yes count nor have I lost sight of him for a single instant since Then said Athos in a tone of delight he is well no accident has happened to him None sir And he lives Still at the Hotel of the Great Charlemagne And passes his time Sometimes with the queen of England sometimes with Madame de Chevreuse He and the Count de Guiche are like each other s shadows Thanks Planchet thanks cried Athos extending his hand to the lieutenant Oh sir Planchet only touched the tips of the count s fingers Well what are you doing count to a former lackey My friend said Athos he has given me news of Raoul And now gentlemen said Planchet who had not heard what they were saying what do you intend to do Re enter Paris if you will let us my good Planchet Let you sir Now as ever I am nothing but your servant Then turning to his men Allow these gentlemen to pass he said they are friends of the Duc de Beaufort Long live the Duc de Beaufort cried the sentinels The sergeant drew near to Planchet What without passports he murmured Without passports said Planchet Take notice captain he continued giving Planchet his expected title take notice that one of the three men who just now went out from here told me privately to distrust these gentlemen And I said Planchet with dignity I know them and I answer for them As he said this he pressed Grimaud s hand who seemed honored by the distinction Farewell till we meet again said Aramis as they took leave of Planchet if anything happens to us we shall blame you for it Sir said Planchet I am in all things at your service That fellow is no fool said Aramis as he got on his horse How should he be replied Athos whilst mounting also seeing he was used so long to brush your hats seventy six The Ambassadors The two friends rode rapidly down the declivity of the Faubourg but on arriving at the bottom were surprised to find that the streets of Paris had become rivers and the open places lakes after the great rains which fell in January the Seine had overflowed its banks and the river inundated half the capital The two gentlemen were obliged therefore to get off their horses and take a boat and in that strange manner they approached the Louvre Night had closed in and Paris seen thus by the light of lanterns flickering on the pools of water crowded with ferry boats of every kind including those that glittered with the armed patrols with the watchword passing from post to post Paris presented such an aspect as to strongly seize the senses of Aramis a man most susceptible to warlike impressions They reached the queen s apartments but were compelled to stop in the ante chamber since her majesty was at that moment giving audience to gentlemen bringing her news from England We too said Athos to the footman who had given him that answer not only bring news from England but have just come from there What then are your names gentlemen The Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier d Herblay said Aramis Ah in that case gentlemen said the footman on hearing the names which the queen had so often pronounced with hope in that case it is another thing and I think her majesty will pardon me for not keeping you here a moment Please follow me and he went on before followed by Athos and Aramis On arriving at the door of the room where the queen was receiving he made a sign for them to wait and opening the door Madame he said I hope your majesty will forgive me for disobeying your orders when you learn that the gentlemen I have come to announce are the Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier d Herblay On hearing those two names the queen uttered a cry of joy which the two gentlemen heard Poor queen murmured Athos Oh let them come in let them come in cried the young princess bounding to the door The poor child was constant in her attendance on her mother and sought by her filial attentions to make her forget the absence of her two sons and her other daughter Come in gentlemen repeated the princess opening the door herself The queen was seated on a fauteuil and before her were standing two or three gentlemen and among them the Duc de Chatillon the brother of the nobleman killed eight or nine years previously in a duel on account of Madame de Longueville on the Place Royale All these gentlemen had been noticed by Athos and Aramis in the guardhouse and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low tone Well sirs cried the queen on perceiving the two friends you have come faithful friends But the royal couriers have been more expeditious than you and here are Monsieur de Flamarens and Monsieur de Chatillon who bring me from Her Majesty the Queen Anne of Austria the very latest intelligence Aramis and Athos were astounded by the calmness even the gayety of the queen s manner Go on with your recital sirs said the queen turning to the Duc de Chatillon You said that His Majesty King Charles my august consort had been condemned to death by a majority of his subjects Yes madame Chatillon stammered out Athos and Aramis were more and more astonished And that being conducted to the scaffold resumed the queen oh my lord oh my king and that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant people Just so madame replied Chatillon in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this affirmation The queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude whilst her daughter threw her arms around her mother s neck and kissed her her own eyes streaming with tears Now madame nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage said Chatillon who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern gaze of Athos
1914_121446_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 One moment yes answered the queen 
none	none	One moment I beg for here are the Chevalier d Herblay and the Comte de la Fere just arrived from London and they can give you as eye witnesses such details as you can convey to the queen my royal sister Speak gentlemen speak I am listening conceal nothing gloss over nothing Since his majesty still lives since the honor of the throne is safe everything else is a matter of indifference to me Athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart Well exclaimed the queen who remarked this movement and his paleness Speak sir 
1914_121446_000029_000002	train-clean-360	I beg you to do so 
none	none	I beg you to excuse me madame I wish to add nothing to the recital of these gentlemen until they perceive themselves that they have perhaps been mistaken
1914_121446_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Mistaken cried the queen almost suffocated by emotion mistaken what has happened then 
none	none	Sir interposed Monsieur de Flamarens to Athos if we are mistaken the error has originated with the queen I do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to rights that would be to accuse Her Majesty Queen Anne of falsehood With the queen sir replied Athos in his calm vibrating voice Yes murmured Flamarens lowering his eyes Athos sighed deeply Or rather sir said Aramis with his peculiar irritating politeness the error of the person who was with you when we met you in the guardroom for if the Comte de la Fere and I are not mistaken we saw you in the company of a third gentleman Chatillon and Flamarens started Explain yourself count cried the queen whose anxiety grew greater every moment On your brow I read despair your lips falter ere you announce some terrible tidings your hands tremble 
1914_121446_000038_000002	train-clean-360	Oh my God my God what has happened 
none	none	Lord ejaculated the young princess falling on her knees have mercy on us Sir said Chatillon if you bring bad tidings it will be cruel in you to announce them to the queen Aramis went so close to Chatillon as almost to touch him Sir said he with compressed lips and flashing eyes you have not the presumption to instruct the Comte de la Fere and myself what we ought to say here During this brief altercation Athos with his hands on his heart his head bent low approached the queen and in a voice of deepest sorrow said Madame princes who by nature are above other men receive from Heaven courage to support greater misfortunes than those of lower rank for their hearts are elevated as their fortunes We ought not therefore I think to act toward a queen so illustrious as your majesty as we should act toward a woman of our lowlier condition Queen destined as you are to endure every sorrow on this earth hear the result of our unhappy mission Athos kneeling down before the queen trembling and very cold drew from his bosom inclosed in the same case the order set in diamonds which the queen had given to Lord de Winter and the wedding ring which Charles I before his death had placed in the hands of Aramis Since the moment he had first received these two mementoes Athos had never parted with them He opened the case and offered them to the queen with deep and silent anguish The queen stretched out her hand seized the ring pressed it convulsively to her lips and without being able to breathe a sigh to give vent to a sob she extended her arms became deadly pale and fell senseless in the arms of her attendants and her daughter Athos kissed the hem of the robe of the widowed queen and rising with a dignity that made a deep impression on those around I the Comte de la Fere a gentleman who has never deceived any human being swear before God and before this unhappy queen that all that was possible to save the king of England was done whilst we were on English ground Now chevalier he added turning to Aramis let us go 
1914_121446_000049_000002	train-clean-360	Our duty is fulfilled 
none	none	Not yet said Aramis we have still a word to say to these gentlemen And turning to Chatillon Sir be so good as not to go away without giving me an opportunity to tell you something I cannot say before the queen Chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out stopping at the window of a gallery on the ground floor Sir said Aramis you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary manner That would not be endurable in any case and is still less so on the part of those who came to bring the queen the message of a liar Sir cried De Chatillon What have you done with Monsieur de Bruy Has he by any possibility gone to change his face which was too like that of Monsieur de Mazarin There is an abundance of Italian masks at the Palais Royal from harlequin even to pantaloon Chevalier chevalier said Athos Leave me alone said Aramis impatiently
1914_121446_000057_000001	train-clean-360	 You know well that I don t like to leave things half finished 
none	none	Conclude then sir answered De Chatillon with as much hauteur as Aramis Gentlemen resumed Aramis any one but the Comte de la Fere and myself would have had you arrested for we have friends in Paris but we are contented with another course 
1914_121446_000059_000001	train-clean-360	Come and converse with us for just five minutes sword in hand upon this deserted terrace 
none	none	One moment gentlemen cried Flamarens I know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept it And why not said Aramis in his tone of raillery Is it Mazarin s proximity that makes you so prudent Oh you hear that Flamarens said Chatillon Not to reply would be a blot on my name and my honor That is my opinion said Aramis You will not reply however and these gentlemen I am sure will presently be of my opinion 
1914_121449_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Aramis shook his head 
none	none	with a motion of indescribable insolence Chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his sword Willingly replied De Chatillon Duke said Flamarens you forget that to morrow you are to command an expedition of the greatest importance projected by the prince assented to by the queen Until to morrow evening you are not at your own disposal Let it be then the day after to morrow said Aramis To morrow rather said De Chatillon if you will take the trouble of coming so far as the gates of Charenton How can you doubt it sir For the pleasure of a meeting with you I would go to the end of the world Very well to morrow sir I shall rely on it Are you going to rejoin your cardinal 
1914_121446_000073_000002	train-clean-360	Swear first on your honor not to inform him of our return 
none	none	Conditions Why not Because it is for victors to make conditions and you are not yet victors gentlemen Then let us draw on the spot It is all one to us to us who do not command to morrow s expedition Chatillon and Flamarens looked at each other There was such irony in the words and in the bearing of Aramis that the duke had great difficulty in bridling his anger but at a word from Flamarens he restrained himself and contented himself with saying You promise sir that s agreed that I shall find you to morrow at Charenton Oh don t be afraid sir replied Aramis and the two gentlemen shortly afterward left the Louvre
1914_121446_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 For what reason is all this fume and fury asked Athos 
none	none	What have they done to you They did you not see what they did No They laughed when we swore that we had done our duty in England Now if they believed us they laughed in order to insult us if they did not believe it they insulted us all the more However I m glad not to fight them until to morrow I hope we shall have something better to do to night than to draw the sword What have we to do Egad to take Mazarin Athos curled his lip with disdain These undertakings do not suit me as you know Aramis Why Because it is taking people unawares Really Athos you would make a singular general You would fight only by broad daylight warn your foe before an attack and never attempt anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the darkness Athos smiled You know one cannot change his nature he said Besides do you know what is our situation and whether Mazarin s arrest wouldn t be rather an encumbrance than an advantage Say at once you disapprove of my proposal I think you ought to do nothing since you exacted a promise from these gentlemen not to let Mazarin know that we were in France I have entered into no engagement and consider myself quite free Come come Where Either to seek the Duc de Beaufort or the Duc de Bouillon and to tell them about this Yes but on one condition that we begin by the coadjutor He is a priest learned in cases of conscience and we will tell him ours It was then agreed that they were to go first to Monsieur de Bouillon as his house came first but first of all Athos begged that he might go to the Hotel du Grand Charlemagne to see Raoul They re entered the boat which had brought them to the Louvre and thence proceeded to the Halles and taking up Grimaud and Blaisois they went on foot to the Rue Guenegaud But Raoul was not at the Hotel du Grand Charlemagne He had received a message from the prince to whom he had hastened with Olivain the instant he had received it seventy seven The three Lieutenants of the Generalissimo The night was dark but still the town resounded with those noises that disclose a city in a state of siege Athos and Aramis did not proceed a hundred steps without being stopped by sentinels placed before the barricades who demanded the watchword and on their saying that they were going to Monsieur de Bouillon on a mission of importance a guide was given them under pretext of conducting them but in fact as a spy over their movements On arriving at the Hotel de Bouillon they came across a little troop of three cavaliers who seemed to know every possible password for they walked without either guide or escort and on arriving at the barricades had nothing to do but to speak to those who guarded them who instantly let them pass with evident deference due probably to their high birth On seeing them Athos and Aramis stood still Oh cried Aramis do you see count Yes said Athos Who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be What do you think Aramis Why they are our men You are not mistaken I recognize Monsieur de Flamarens And I Monsieur de Chatillon As to the cavalier in the brown cloak It is the cardinal In person How the devil do they venture so near the Hotel de Bouillon Athos smiled but did not reply Five minutes afterward they knocked at the prince s door This door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed in the courtyard ready to obey the orders of the Prince de Conti s lieutenant Monsieur de Bouillon had the gout but notwithstanding his illness which had prevented his mounting on horseback for the last month that is since Paris had been besieged he was ready to receive the Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier d Herblay He was in bed but surrounded with all the paraphernalia of war Everywhere were swords pistols cuirasses and arquebuses and it was plain that as soon as his gout was better Monsieur de Bouillon would give a pretty tangle to the enemies of the parliament to unravel Meanwhile to his great regret as he said he was obliged to keep his bed Ah gentlemen he cried as the two friends entered you are very happy you can ride you can go and come and fight for the cause of the people But I as you see am nailed to my bed ah this demon gout this demon gout My lord said Athos we are just arrived from England and our first concern is to inquire after your health Thanks gentlemen thanks As you see my health is but indifferent But you come from England And King Charles is well as I have just heard He is dead my lord said Aramis Pooh said the duke too much astonished to believe it true Dead on the scaffold condemned by parliament Impossible And executed in our presence What then has Monsieur de Flamarens been telling me Monsieur de Flamarens Yes he has just gone out Athos smiled With two companions he said With two companions yes replied the duke Then he added with a certain uneasiness Did you meet them Why yes I think so in the street said Athos and he looked smilingly at Aramis who looked at him with an expression of surprise The devil take this gout cried Monsieur de Bouillon evidently ill at ease My lord said Athos we admire your devotion to the cause you have espoused in remaining at the head of the army whilst so ill in so much pain One must replied Monsieur de Bouillon sacrifice one s comfort to the public good but I confess to you I am now almost exhausted My spirit is willing my head is clear but this demon the gout o ercrows me I confess if the court would do justice to my claims and give the head of my house the title of prince and if my brother De Turenne were reinstated in his command I would return to my estates and leave the court and parliament to settle things between themselves as they might You are perfectly right my lord You think so At this very moment the court is making overtures to me hitherto I have repulsed them but since such men as you assure me that I am wrong in doing so I ve a good mind to follow your advice and to accept a proposition made to me by the Duc de Chatillon just now Accept it my lord accept it said Aramis Faith yes I am even sorry that this evening I almost repulsed but there will be a conference to morrow and we shall see The two friends saluted the duke Go gentlemen he said you must be much fatigued after your voyage Poor King Charles But after all he was somewhat to blame in all that business and we may console ourselves with the reflection that France has no cause of reproach in the matter and did all she could to serve him Oh as to that said Aramis we are witnesses Mazarin especially Yes do you know I am very glad to hear you give that testimony the cardinal has some good in him and if he were not a foreigner well he would be more justly estimated Oh the devil take this gout Athos and Aramis took their leave but even in the ante chamber they could still hear the duke s cries he was evidently suffering the tortures of the damned When they reached the street Aramis said Well Athos what do you think Of whom Pardieu of Monsieur de Bouillon My friend I think that he is much troubled with gout You noticed that I didn t breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit You did well you would have caused him an access of his disease Let us go to Monsieur de Beaufort The two friends went to the Hotel de Vendome It was ten o clock when they arrived The Hotel de Vendome was not less guarded than the Hotel de Bouillon and presented as warlike an appearance There were sentinels a guard in the court stacks of arms and horses saddled Two horsemen going out as Athos and Aramis entered were obliged to give place to them Ah ah gentlemen said Aramis decidedly it is a night for meetings We shall be very unfortunate if after meeting so often this evening we should not succeed in meeting to morrow Oh as to that sir replied Chatillon for it was he who with Flamarens was leaving the Duc de Beaufort you may be assured for if we meet by night without seeking each other much more shall we meet by day when wishing it I hope that is true said Aramis As for me I am sure of it said the duke De Flamarens and De Chatillon continued on their way and Athos and Aramis dismounted Hardly had they given the bridles of their horses to their lackeys and rid themselves of their cloaks when a man approached them and after looking at them for an instant by the doubtful light of the lantern hung in the centre of the courtyard he uttered an exclamation of joy and ran to embrace them Comte de la Fere the man cried out Chevalier d Herblay How does it happen that you are in Paris Rochefort cried the two friends Yes we arrived four or five days ago from the Vendomois as you know and we are going to give Mazarin something to do You are still with us I presume More than ever And the duke Furious against the cardinal You know his success our dear duke He is really king of Paris he can t go out without being mobbed by his admirers Ah so much the better Can we have the honor of seeing his highness I shall be proud to present you and Rochefort walked on Every door was opened to him Monsieur de Beaufort was at supper but he rose quickly on hearing the two friends announced Ah he cried by Jove you re welcome sirs You are coming to sup with me are you not Boisgoli tell Noirmont that I have two guests You know Noirmont do you not The successor of Father Marteau who makes the excellent pies you know of Boisgoli let him send one of his best but not such a one as he made for La Ramee Thank God we don t want either rope ladders or gag pears now My lord said Athos do not let us disturb you We came merely to inquire after your health and to take your orders As to my health since it has stood five years of prison with Monsieur de Chavigny to boot tis excellent As to my orders since every one gives his own commands in our party I shall end if this goes on by giving none at all In short my lord said Athos glancing at Aramis your highness is discontented with your party Discontented sir say my highness is furious To such a degree I assure you though I would not say so to others that if the queen acknowledging the injuries she has done me would recall my mother and give me the reversion of the admiralty which belonged to my father and was promised me at his death well it would not be long before I should be training dogs to say that there were greater traitors in France than the Cardinal Mazarin At this Athos and Aramis could not help exchanging not only a look but a smile and had they not known it for a fact this would have told them that De Chatillon and De Flamarens had been there My lord said Athos we are satisfied we came here only to express our loyalty and to say that we are at your lordship s service and his most faithful servants My most faithful friends gentlemen my most faithful friends you have proved it And if ever I am reconciled with the court I shall prove to you I hope that I remain your friend as well as that of what the devil are their names D Artagnan and Porthos D Artagnan and Porthos Ah yes You understand then Comte de la Fere you understand Chevalier d Herblay that I am altogether and always at your service Athos and Aramis bowed and went out My dear Athos cried Aramis I think you consented to accompany me only to give me a lesson God forgive me Wait a little Aramis it will be time for you to perceive my motive when we have paid our visit to the coadjutor Let us then go to the archiepiscopal palace said Aramis They directed their horses to the city On arriving at the cradle from which Paris sprang they found it inundated with water and it was again necessary to take a boat The palace rose from the bosom of the water and to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied one s self not in Paris but in Venice Some of these boats were dark and mysterious others noisy and lighted up with torches The friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their turn The palace was surrounded with water but a kind of staircase had been fixed to the lower walls and the only difference was that instead of entering by the doors people entered by the windows Thus did Athos and Aramis make their appearance in the ante chamber where about a dozen noblemen were collected in waiting Good heavens said Aramis to Athos does the coadjutor intend to indulge himself in the pleasure of making us cool our hearts off in his ante chamber My dear friend we must take people as we find them The coadjutor is at this moment one of the seven kings of Paris and has a court Let us send in our names and if he does not send us a suitable message we will leave him to his own affairs or those of France Let us call one of these lackeys with a demi pistole in the left hand Exactly so cried Aramis Ah if I m not mistaken here s Bazin Come here fellow Bazin who was crossing the ante chamber majestically in his clerical dress turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus addressed him but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing them A truce to compliments said Aramis we want to see the coadjutor and instantly as we are in haste Certainly sir it is not such lords as you are who are allowed to wait in the ante chamber only just now he has a secret conference with Monsieur de Bruy De Bruy cried the friends tis then useless our seeing monsieur the coadjutor this evening said Aramis so we give it up And they hastened to quit the palace followed by Bazin who was lavish of bows and compliments Well said Athos when Aramis and he were in the boat again are you beginning to be convinced that we should have done a bad turn to all these people in arresting Mazarin You are wisdom incarnate Athos Aramis replied What had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken by the court of France in the terrible events which had occurred in England which they thought should have arrested the attention of all Europe In fact aside from a poor widow and a royal orphan who wept in the corner of the Louvre no one appeared to be aware that Charles I had ever lived and that he had perished on the scaffold The two friends made an appointment for ten o clock on the following day for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel Aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left Athos to enter alone At ten o clock the next day they met again Athos had been out since six o clock Well have you any news Athos asked Nothing No one has seen D Artagnan and Porthos has not appeared Have you anything Nothing The devil said Aramis In fact said Athos this delay is not natural they took the shortest route and should have arrived before we did Add to that D Artagnan s rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose an hour knowing that we were expecting him He expected you will remember to be here on the fifth And here we are at the ninth This evening the margin of possible delay expires What do you think should be done asked Athos if we have no news of them to night Pardieu we must go and look for them All right said Athos But Raoul said Aramis A light cloud passed over the count s face Raoul gives me much uneasiness he said He received yesterday a message from the Prince de Conde he went to meet him at Saint Cloud and has not returned Have you seen Madame de Chevreuse She was not at home And you Aramis you were going I think to visit Madame de Longueville I did go there Well She was no longer there but she had left her new address Where was she Guess I give you a thousand chances How should I know where the most beautiful and active of the Frondists was at midnight for I presume it was when you left me that you went to visit her At the Hotel de Ville my dear fellow What at the Hotel de Ville Has she then been appointed provost of merchants No but she has become queen of Paris ad interim and since she could not venture at once to establish herself in the Palais Royal or the Tuileries she is installed at the Hotel de Ville where she is on the point of giving an heir or an heiress to that dear duke You didn t tell me of that Aramis Really It was my forgetfulness then pardon me Now asked Athos what are we to do with ourselves till evening Here we are without occupation it seems to me You forget my friend that we have work cut out for us in the direction of Charenton I hope to see Monsieur de Chatillon whom I ve hated for a long time there Why have you hated him Because he is the brother of Coligny Ah true he who presumed to be a rival of yours for which he was severely punished that ought to satisfy you Yes but it does not I am rancorous the only stigma that proves me to be a churchman Do you understand You understand that you are in no way obliged to go with me Come now said Athos you are joking In that case my dear friend if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose the drum beats I observed cannon on the road I saw the citizens in order of battle on the Place of the Hotel de Ville certainly the fight will be in the direction of Charenton as the Duc de Chatillon said I supposed said Athos that last night s conferences would modify those warlike arrangements No doubt but they will fight none the less if only to mask the conferences Poor creatures said Athos who are going to be killed in order that Monsieur de Bouillon may have his estate at Sedan restored to him that the reversion of the admiralty may be given to the Duc de Beaufort and that the coadjutor may be made a cardinal Come come dear Athos confess that you would not be so philosophical if your Raoul were to be involved in this affair Perhaps you speak the truth Aramis Well let us go then where the fighting is for that is the most likely place to meet with D Artagnan Porthos and possibly even Raoul Stop there are a fine body of citizens passing quite attractive by Jupiter and their captain see he has the true military style What ho said Grimaud What asked Athos Planchet sir Lieutenant yesterday said Aramis captain to day colonel doubtless to morrow in a fortnight the fellow will be marshal of France Question him about the fight said Athos Planchet prouder than ever of his new duties deigned to explain to the two gentlemen that he was ordered to take up his position on the Place Royale with two hundred men forming the rear of the army of Paris and to march on Charenton when necessary This day will be a warm one said Planchet in a warlike tone No doubt said Aramis but it is far from here to the enemy Sir the distance will be diminished said a subordinate Aramis saluted then turning toward Athos I don t care to camp on the Place Royale with all these people he said Shall we go forward We shall see better what is going on And then Monsieur de Chatillon will not come to the Place Royale to look for you Come then my friend we will go forward Haven t you something to say to Monsieur de Flamarens on your own account My friend said Athos I have made a resolution never to draw my sword save when it is absolutely necessary And how long ago was that When I last drew my poniard Ah Good another souvenir of Monsieur Mordaunt Well my friend nothing now is lacking except that you should feel remorse for having killed that fellow Hush said Athos putting a finger on his lips with the sad smile peculiar to him let us talk no more of Mordaunt it will bring bad luck And Athos set forward toward Charenton followed closely by Aramis seventy eight The Battle of Charenton As Athos and Aramis proceeded and passed different companies on the road they became aware that they were arriving near the field of battle Ah my friend cried Athos suddenly where have you brought us I fancy I perceive around us faces of different officers in the royal army is not that the Duc de Chatillon himself coming toward us with his brigadiers Good day sirs said the duke advancing you are puzzled by what you see here but one word will explain everything There is now a truce and a conference The prince Monsieur de Retz the Duc de Beaufort the Duc de Bouillon are talking over public affairs Now one of two things must happen either matters will not be arranged or they will be arranged in which last case I shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet again Sir said Aramis you speak to the point Allow me to ask you a question Where are the plenipotentiaries At Charenton in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of Paris And was this conference arranged beforehand No gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which Mazarin made last night to the Parisians Athos and Aramis exchanged smiles for they well knew what those propositions were to whom they had been made and who had made them And that house in which the plenipotentiaries are asked Athos belongs to To Monsieur de Chanleu who commands your troops at Charenton I say your troops for I presume that you gentlemen are Frondeurs Yes almost said Aramis We are for the king and the princes added Athos We must understand each other said the duke The king is with us and his generals are the Duke of Orleans and the Prince de Conde although I must add tis almost impossible now to know to which party any one belongs Yes answered Athos but his right place is in our ranks with the Prince de Conti De Beaufort D Elbeuf and De Bouillon but sir supposing that the conference is broken off are you going to try to take Charenton Such are my orders Sir since you command the cavalry Pardon me I am commander in chief So much the better You must know all your officers I mean those more distinguished Why yes very nearly Will you then kindly tell me if you have in your command the Chevalier d Artagnan lieutenant in the musketeers No sir he is not with us he left Paris more than six weeks ago and is believed to have gone on a mission to England I knew that but I supposed he had returned No sir no one has seen him I can answer positively on that point for the musketeers belong to our forces and Monsieur de Cambon the substitute for Monsieur d Artagnan still holds his place The two friends looked at each other You see said Athos It is strange said Aramis It is absolutely certain that some misfortune has happened to them on the way If we have no news of them this evening to morrow we must start Athos nodded affirmatively then turning And Monsieur de Bragelonne a young man fifteen years of age attached to the Prince de Conde has he the honor of being known to you diffident in allowing the sarcastic Aramis to perceive how strong were his paternal feelings Yes surely he came with the prince a charming young man he is one of your friends then monsieur le comte Yes sir answered Athos agitated so much so that I wish to see him if possible Quite possible sir do me the favor to accompany me and I will conduct you to headquarters Halloo there cried Aramis turning around what a noise behind us A body of cavaliers is coming toward us said Chatillon I recognize the coadjutor by his Frondist hat And I the Duc de Beaufort by his white plume of ostrich feathers They are coming full gallop the prince is with them ah he is leaving them They are beating the rappel cried Chatillon we must discover what is going on In fact they saw the soldiers running to their arms the trumpets sounded the drums beat the Duc de Beaufort drew his sword On his side the prince sounded a rappel and all the officers of the royalist army mingling momentarily with the Parisian troops ran to him Gentlemen cried Chatillon the truce is broken that is evident they are going to fight go then into Charenton for I shall begin in a short time there s a signal from the prince The cornet of a troop had in fact just raised the standard of the prince Farewell till the next time we meet cried Chatillon and he set off full gallop Athos and Aramis turned also and went to salute the coadjutor and the Duc de Beaufort As to the Duc de Bouillon he had such a fit of gout as obliged him to return to Paris in a litter but his place was well filled by the Duc d Elbeuf and his four sons ranged around him like a staff Meantime between Charenton and the royal army was left a space which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the dead Gentlemen cried the coadjutor tightening his sash which he wore after the fashion of the ancient military prelates over his archiepiscopal simar there s the enemy approaching Let us save them half of their journey And without caring whether he were followed or not he set off his regiment which bore the name of the regiment of Corinth from the name of his archbishopric darted after him and began the fight Monsieur de Beaufort sent his cavalry toward Etampes and Monsieur de Chanleu who defended the place was ready to resist an assault or if the enemy were repulsed to attempt a sortie The battle soon became general and the coadjutor performed miracles of valor His proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard no matter for whom or against whom Chanleu whose fire at one time repulsed the royal regiment thought that the moment was come to pursue it but it was reformed and led again to the charge by the Duc de Chatillon in person This charge was so fierce so skillfully conducted that Chanleu was almost surrounded He commanded a retreat which began step by step foot by foot unhappily in an instant he fell mortally wounded De Chatillon saw him fall and announced it in a loud voice to his men which raised their spirits and completely disheartened their enemies so that every man thought only of his own safety and tried to gain the trenches where the coadjutor was trying to reform his disorganized regiment Suddenly a squadron of cavalry galloped up to encounter the royal troops who were entering pele mele the intrenchments with the fugitives Athos and Aramis charged at the head of their squadrons Aramis with sword and pistol in his hands Athos with his sword in his scabbard his pistol in his saddle bags calm and cool as if on the parade except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the princes Aramis on the contrary struck right and left and was almost delirious with excitement His bright eyes kindled and his mouth so finely formed assumed a wicked smile every blow he aimed was sure and his pistol finished the deed annihilated the wounded wretch who tried to rise again On the opposite side two cavaliers one covered with a gilt cuirass the other wearing simply a buff doublet from which fell the sleeves of a vest of blue velvet charged in front The cavalier in the gilt cuirass fell upon Aramis and struck a blow that Aramis parried with his wonted skill Ah tis you Monsieur de Chatillon cried the chevalier welcome to you I expected you I hope I have not made you wait too long sir said the duke at all events here I am Monsieur de Chatillon cried Aramis taking from his saddle bags a second pistol I think if your pistols have been discharged you are a dead man Thank God sir they are not And the duke pointing his pistol at Aramis fired But Aramis bent his head the instant he saw the duke s finger press the trigger and the ball passed without touching him Oh you ve missed me cried Aramis but I swear to Heaven I will not miss you If I give you time cried the duke spurring on his horse and rushing upon him with his drawn sword Aramis awaited him with that terrible smile which was peculiar to him on such occasions and Athos who saw the duke advancing toward Aramis with the rapidity of lightning was just going to cry out Fire fire then when the shot was fired De Chatillon opened his arms and fell back on the crupper of his horse The ball had entered his breast through a notch in the cuirass I am a dead man he said and fell from his horse to the ground I told you this I am now grieved I have kept my word Can I be of any use to you Chatillon made a sign with his hand and Aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent shock twas a thrust from a sword but his cuirass turned aside the blow He turned around and seized his new antagonist by the wrist when he started back exclaiming Raoul Raoul cried Athos The young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the Chevalier d Herblay two officers in the Parisian forces rushed at that instant on Raoul but Aramis protected him with his sword My prisoner he cried Athos took his son s horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the melee At this crisis of the battle the prince who had been seconding De Chatillon in the second line appeared in the midst of the fight his eagle eye made him known and his blows proclaimed the hero On seeing him the regiment of Corinth which the coadjutor had not been able to reorganize in spite of all his efforts threw itself into the midst of the Parisian forces put them into confusion and re entered Charenton flying The coadjutor dragged along with his fugitive forces passed near the group formed by Athos Raoul and Aramis Aramis could not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutor s misfortune and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct when Athos stopped him On on he cried this is no moment for compliments or rather back for the battle seems to be lost by the Frondeurs It is a matter of indifference to me said Aramis I came here only to meet De Chatillon I have met him I am contented tis something to have met De Chatillon in a duel And besides we have a prisoner said Athos pointing to Raoul The three cavaliers continued their road on full gallop What were you doing in the battle my friend inquired Athos of the youth twas not your right place I think as you were not equipped for an engagement I had no intention of fighting to day sir I was charged indeed with a mission to the cardinal and had set out for Rueil when seeing Monsieur de Chatillon charge an invincible desire possessed me to charge at his side It was then that he told me two cavaliers of the Parisian army were seeking me and named the Comte de la Fere What you knew we were there and yet wished to kill your friend the chevalier I did not recognize the chevalier in armor sir said Raoul blushing though I might have known him by his skill and coolness in danger Thank you for the compliment my young friend replied Aramis we can see from whom you learned courtesy Then you were going to Rueil Yes I have a despatch from the prince to his eminence You must still deliver it said Athos No false generosity count the fate of our friends to say nothing of our own is perhaps in that very despatch This young man must not however fail in his duty said Athos In the first place count this youth is our prisoner you seem to forget that What I propose to do is fair in war the vanquished must not be dainty in the choice of means Give me the despatch Raoul The young man hesitated and looked at Athos as if seeking to read in his eyes a rule of conduct Give him the despatch Raoul you are the chevalier s prisoner Raoul gave it up reluctantly Aramis instantly seized and read it You he said you who are so trusting read and reflect that there is something in this letter important for us to see Athos took the letter frowning but an idea that he should find something in this letter about D Artagnan conquered his unwillingness to read it My lord I shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of Monsieur de Comminges the ten men you demand They are good soldiers fit to confront the two violent adversaries whose address and resolution your eminence is fearful of Oh cried Athos Well said Aramis what think you about these two enemies whom it requires besides Comminges s troop ten good soldiers to confront are they not as like as two drops of water to D Artagnan and Porthos We ll search Paris all day long said Athos and if we have no news this evening we will return to the road to Picardy and I feel no doubt that thanks to D Artagnan s ready invention we shall then find some clew which will solve our doubts Yes let us search Paris and especially inquire of Planchet if he has yet heard from his former master That poor Planchet You speak of him very much at your ease Aramis he has probably been killed All those fighting citizens went out to battle and they have been massacred It was then with a sentiment of uneasiness whether Planchet who alone could give them information was alive or dead that the friends returned to the Place Royale to their great surprise they found the citizens still encamped there drinking and bantering each other although doubtless mourned by their families who thought they were at Charenton in the thickest of the fighting Athos and Aramis again questioned Planchet but he had seen nothing of D Artagnan they wished to take Planchet with them but he could not leave his troop who at five o clock returned home saying that they were returning from the battle whereas they had never lost sight of the bronze equestrian statue of Louis XIII seventy nine The Road to Picardy On leaving Paris Athos and Aramis well knew that they would be encountering great danger but we know that for men like these there could be no question of danger Besides they felt that the denouement of this second Odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single effort to make Besides there was no tranquillity in Paris itself Provisions began to fail and whenever one of the Prince de Conti s generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult which he put down again and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his colleagues In one of these risings the Duc de Beaufort pillaged the house and library of Mazarin in order to give the populace as he put it something to gnaw at Athos and Aramis left Paris after this coup d etat which took place on the very evening of the day in which the Parisians had been beaten at Charenton They quitted Paris beholding it abandoned to extreme want bordering on famine agitated by fear torn by faction Parisians and Frondeurs as they were the two friends expected to find the same misery the same fears the same intrigue in the enemy s camp but what was their surprise after passing Saint Denis to hear that at Saint Germain people were singing and laughing and leading generally cheerful lives The two gentlemen traveled by byways in order not to encounter the Mazarinists scattered about the Isle of France and also to escape the Frondeurs who were in possession of Normandy and who never failed to conduct captives to the Duc de Longueville in order that he might ascertain whether they were friends or foes Having escaped these dangers they returned by the main road to Boulogne at Abbeville and followed it step by step examining every track Nevertheless they were still in a state of uncertainty Several inns were visited by them several innkeepers questioned without a single clew being given to guide their inquiries when at Montreuil Athos felt upon the table that something rough was touching his delicate fingers He turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the wood with a knife Port D Art twod February This is capital said Athos to Aramis we were to have slept here but we cannot we must push on They rode forward and reached Abbeville There the great number of inns puzzled them they could not go to all how could they guess in which those whom they were seeking had stayed Trust me said Aramis do not expect to find anything in Abbeville If we had only been looking for Porthos Porthos would have stationed himself in one of the finest hotels and we could easily have traced him But D Artagnan is devoid of such weaknesses Porthos would have found it very difficult even to make him see that he was dying of hunger he has gone on his road as inexorable as fate and we must seek him somewhere else They continued their route It had now become a weary and almost hopeless task and had it not been for the threefold motives of honor friendship and gratitude implanted in their hearts our two travelers would have given up many a time their rides over the sand their interrogatories of the peasantry and their close inspection of faces They proceeded thus to Peronne Athos began to despair His noble nature felt that their ignorance was a sort of reflection upon them They had not looked carefully enough for their lost friends They had not shown sufficient pertinacity in their inquiries They were willing and ready to retrace their steps when in crossing the suburb which leads to the gates of the town upon a white wall which was at the corner of a street turning around the rampart Athos cast his eyes upon a drawing in black chalk which represented with the awkwardness of a first attempt two cavaliers riding furiously one of them carried a roll of paper on which were written these words They are following us Oh exclaimed Athos here it is as clear as day pursued as he was D Artagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed very closely which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in escaping Aramis shook his head Had he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken of You are right Aramis let us travel on To describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be impossible Uneasiness took possession of the tender constant heart of Athos and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive Aramis They galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the wall All at once in a narrow pass they perceived that the road was partially barricaded by an enormous stone It had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength Aramis stopped Oh he said looking at the stone this is the work of either Hercules or Porthos Let us get down count and examine this rock 
1914_121449_000020_000000	train-clean-360	They both alighted 
none	none	The stone had been brought with the evident intention of barricading the road but some one having perceived the obstacle had partially turned it aside With the assistance of Blaisois and Grimaud the friends succeeded in turning the stone over Upon the side next the ground were scratched the following words Eight of the light dragoons are pursuing us If we reach Compiegne we shall stop at the Peacock It is kept by a friend of ours At last we have something definite said Athos let us go to the Peacock Yes answered Aramis but if we are to get there we must rest our horses for they are almost broken winded Aramis was right they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine they gave them three hours rest and then set off again The men themselves were almost dead with fatigue but hope supported them In six hours they reached Compiegne and alighted at the Peacock The host proved to be a worthy man as bald as a Chinaman They asked him if some time ago he had not received in his house two gentlemen who were pursued by dragoons without answering he went out and brought in the blade of a rapier Do you know that he asked Athos merely glanced at it Tis D Artagnan s sword he said Does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two asked the host To the smaller I see that you are the friends of these gentlemen
1914_121449_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Well what has happened to them 
none	none	They were pursued by eight of the light dragoons who rode into the courtyard before they had time to close the gate Eight said Aramis it surprises me that two such heroes as Porthos and D Artagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight men The eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of Italians in the king s service who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by numbers
1914_121449_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Arrested were they inquired Athos is it known why 
none	none	No sir they were carried off instantly and had not even time to tell me why but as soon as they were gone I found this broken sword blade as I was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded ones Tis still a consolation that they were not wounded said Aramis
1914_121449_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Where were they taken asked Athos 
none	none	Toward the town of Louvres was the reply The two friends having agreed to leave Blaisois and Grimaud at Compiegne with the horses resolved to take post horses and having snatched a hasty dinner they continued their journey to Louvres Here they found only one inn in which was consumed a liqueur which preserves its reputation to our time and which is still made in that town Let us alight here said Athos D Artagnan will not have let slip an opportunity of drinking a glass of this liqueur and at the same time leaving some trace of himself They went into the town and asked for two glasses of liqueur at the counter as their friends must have done before them The counter was covered with a plate of pewter upon this plate was written with the point of a large pin Rueil D They went to Rueil cried Aramis Let us go to Rueil said Athos It is to throw ourselves into the wolf s jaws said Aramis Had I been as great a friend of Jonah as I am of D Artagnan I should have followed him even into the inside of the whale itself and you would have done the same Aramis Certainly but you make me out better than I am dear count Had I been alone I should scarcely have gone to Rueil without great caution But where you go I go They then set off for Rueil Here the deputies of the parliament had just arrived in order to enter upon those famous conferences which were to last three weeks and produced eventually that shameful peace at the conclusion of which the prince was arrested Rueil was crowded with advocates presidents and councillors who came from the Parisians and on the side of the court with officers and guards it was therefore easy in the midst of this confusion to remain as unobserved as any one might wish besides the conferences implied a truce and to arrest two gentlemen even Frondeurs at this time would have been an attack on the rights of the people The two friends mingled with the crowd and fancied that every one was occupied with the same thought that tormented them They expected to hear some mention made of D Artagnan or of Porthos but every one was engrossed by articles and reforms It was the advice of Athos to go straight to the minister My friend said Aramis take care our safety lies in our obscurity If we were to make ourselves known we should be sent to rejoin our friends in some deep ditch from which the devil himself could not take us out Let us try not to find them out by accident but from our notions Arrested at Compiegne they have been carried to Rueil at Rueil they have been questioned by the cardinal who has either kept them near him or sent them to Saint Germain As to the Bastile they are not there though the Bastile is especially for the Frondeurs They are not dead for the death of D Artagnan would make a sensation As for Porthos I believe him to be eternal like God although less patient Do not let us despond but wait at Rueil for my conviction is that they are at Rueil But what ails you You are pale It is this answered Athos with a trembling voice I remember that at the Castle of Rueil the Cardinal Richelieu had some horrible oubliettes constructed Oh never fear said Aramis Richelieu was a gentleman our equal in birth our superior in position 
1914_121449_000055_000002	train-clean-360	He could like the king touch the greatest of us on the head and touching them make such heads shake on their shoulders 
none	none	But Mazarin is a low born rogue who can at the most take us by the collar like an archer Be calm for I am sure that D Artagnan and Porthos are at Rueil alive and well But resumed Athos I recur to my first proposal I know no better means than to act with candor I shall seek not Mazarin but the queen and say to her Madame restore to us your two servants and our two friends Aramis shook his head Tis a last resource but let us not employ it till it is imperatively called for let us rather persevere in our researches They continued their inquiries and at last met with a light dragoon who had formed one of the guard which had escorted D Artagnan to Rueil Athos however perpetually recurred to his proposed interview with the queen In order to see the queen said Aramis we must first see the cardinal and when we have seen the cardinal remember what I tell you Athos we shall be reunited to our friends but not in the way you wish Now that way of joining them is not very attractive to me I confess Let us act in freedom that we may act well and quickly I shall go he said to the queen Well then answered Aramis pray tell me a day or two beforehand that I may take that opportunity of going to Paris To whom Zounds how do I know perhaps to Madame de Longueville She is all powerful yonder she will help me But send me word should you be arrested for then I will return directly Why do you not take your chance and be arrested with me
1914_121449_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 No I thank you 
none	none	Should we by being arrested be all four together again we should not I am not sure be twenty four hours in prison without getting free My friend since I killed Chatillon adored of the ladies of Saint Germain I am too great a celebrity not to fear a prison doubly The queen is likely to follow Mazarin s counsels and to have me tried Do you think she loves this Italian so much as they say she does Did she not love an Englishman My friend she is a woman No no you are deceived she is a queen Dear friend I shall sacrifice myself and go and see Anne of Austria Adieu Athos I am going to raise an army For what purpose To come back and besiege Rueil Where shall we meet again At the foot of the cardinal s gallows 
1914_121449_000080_000000	train-clean-360	The two friends departed Aramis to return to Paris Athos to take measures preparatory to an interview with the queen 
none	none	eighty The Gratitude of Anne of Austria Athos found much less difficulty than he had expected in obtaining an audience of Anne of Austria It was granted and was to take place after her morning s levee at which in accordance with his rights of birth he was entitled to be present A vast crowd filled the apartments of Saint Germain Anne had never at the Louvre had so large a court but this crowd represented chiefly the second class of nobility while the Prince de Conti the Duc de Beaufort and the coadjutor assembled around them the first nobility of France The greatest possible gayety prevailed at court The particular characteristic of this was that more songs were made than cannons fired during its continuance The court made songs on the Parisians and the Parisians on the court and the casualties though not mortal were painful as are all wounds inflicted by the weapon of ridicule In the midst of this seeming hilarity nevertheless people s minds were uneasy Was Mazarin to remain the favorite and minister of the queen Was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there Every one hoped so so that the minister felt that all around him beneath the homage of the courtiers lay a fund of hatred ill disguised by fear and interest He felt ill at ease and at a loss what to do Conde himself whilst fighting for him lost no opportunity of ridiculing of humbling him The queen on whom he threw himself as sole support seemed to him now not much to be relied upon When the hour appointed for the audience arrived Athos was obliged to stay until the queen who was waited upon by a new deputation from Paris had consulted with her minister as to the propriety and manner of receiving them All were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day Athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his friends poor atoms lost in that raging whirlwind But Athos was a man of inflexible determination he firmly adhered to a purpose once formed when it seemed to him to spring from conscience and to be prompted by a sense of duty He insisted on being introduced saying that although he was not a deputy from Monsieur de Conti or Monsieur de Beaufort or Monsieur de Bouillon or Monsieur d Elbeuf or the coadjutor or Madame de Longueville or Broussel or the Parliament and although he had come on his own private account he nevertheless had things to say to her majesty of the utmost importance The conference being finished the queen summoned him to her cabinet Athos was introduced and announced by name It was a name that too often resounded in her majesty s ears and too often vibrated in her heart for Anne of Austria not to recognize it yet she remained impassive looking at him with that fixed stare which is tolerated only in women who are queens either by the power of beauty or by the right of birth It is then a service which you propose to render us count asked Anne of Austria after a moment s silence Yes madame another service said Athos shocked that the queen did not seem to recognize him Athos had a noble heart and made therefore but a poor courtier Anne frowned Mazarin who was sitting at a table folding up papers as if he had only been a secretary of state looked up Speak said the queen Mazarin turned again to his papers Madame resumed Athos two of my friends named D Artagnan and Monsieur du Vallon sent to England by the cardinal suddenly disappeared when they set foot on the shores of France no one knows what has become of them Well said the queen I address myself therefore first to the benevolence of your majesty that I may know what has become of my friends reserving to myself if necessary the right of appealing hereafter to your justice Sir replied Anne with a degree of haughtiness which to certain persons became impertinence this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing concerns an affair for the police Well sir you ought to know that we no longer have a police since we are no longer at Paris I think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know where my friends are but that if you will deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than into his own recollections But God forgive me cried Anne with that disdainful curl of the lips peculiar to her I believe that you are yourself interrogating Yes madame here I have a right to do so for it concerns Monsieur d Artagnan d Artagnan he repeated in such a manner as to bow the regal brow with recollections of the weak and erring woman The cardinal saw that it was now high time to come to the assistance of Anne Sir he said I can tell you what is at present unknown to her majesty These individuals are under arrest They disobeyed orders I beg of your majesty then said Athos calmly and not replying to Mazarin to quash these arrests of Messieurs d Artagnan and du Vallon What you ask is merely an affair of discipline and does not concern me said the queen Monsieur d Artagnan never made such an answer as that when the service of your majesty was concerned said Athos bowing with great dignity He was going toward the door when Mazarin stopped him You too have been in England sir he said making a sign to the queen who was evidently going to issue a severe order I was a witness of the last hours of Charles I Poor king culpable at the most of weakness how cruelly punished by his subjects Thrones are at this time shaken and it is to little purpose for devoted hearts to serve the interests of princes This is the second time that Monsieur d Artagnan has been in England He went the first time to save the honor of a great queen the second to avert the death of a great king Sir said Anne to Mazarin with an accent from which daily habits of dissimulation could not entirely chase the real expression see if we can do something for these gentlemen I wish to do madame all that your majesty pleases Do what Monsieur de la Fere requests that is your name is it not sir I have another name madame I am called Athos Madame said Mazarin with a smile you may rest easy your wishes shall be fulfilled You hear sir said the queen Yes madame I expected nothing less from the justice of your majesty May I not go and see my friends Yes sir you shall see them But apropos you belong to the Fronde do you not Madame I serve the king Yes in your own way My way is the way of all gentlemen and I know only one way answered Athos haughtily Go sir then said the queen you have obtained what you wish and we know all we desire to know Scarcely however had the tapestry closed behind Athos when she said to Mazarin Cardinal desire them to arrest that insolent fellow before he leaves the court Your majesty answered Mazarin desires me to do only what I was going to ask you to let me do These bravoes who resuscitate in our epoch the traditions of another reign are troublesome since there are two of them already there let us add a third Athos was not altogether the queen s dupe but he was not a man to run away on suspicion above all when distinctly told that he should see his friends again He waited then in the ante chamber with impatience till he should be conducted to them He walked to the window and looked into the court He saw the deputation from the Parisians enter it they were coming to assign the definitive place for the conference and to make their bow to the queen A very imposing escort awaited them without the gates Athos was looking on attentively when some one touched him softly on the shoulder Ah Monsieur de Comminges he said Yes count and charged with a commission for which I beg of you to accept my excuses What is it Be so good as to give me up your sword count Athos smiled and opened the window Aramis he cried A gentleman turned around Athos fancied he had seen him among the crowd It was Aramis He bowed with great friendship to the count Aramis cried Athos I am arrested Good replied Aramis calmly Sir said Athos turning to Comminges and giving him politely his sword by the hilt here is my sword have the kindness to keep it safely for me until I quit my prison I prize it it was given to my ancestor by King Francis I In his time they armed gentlemen not disarmed them Now whither do you conduct me Into my room first replied Comminges the queen will ultimately decide your place of domicile Athos followed Comminges without saying a single word eighty one Cardinal Mazarin as King The arrest produced no sensation indeed was almost unknown and scarcely interrupted the course of events To the deputation it was formally announced that the queen would receive it Accordingly it was admitted to the presence of Anne who silent and lofty as ever listened to the speeches and complaints of the deputies but when they had finished their harangues not one of them could say so calm remained her face whether or no she had heard them On the other hand Mazarin present at that audience heard very well what those deputies demanded It was purely and simply his removal in terms clear and precise The discourse being finished the queen remained silent Gentlemen said Mazarin I join with you in supplicating the queen to put an end to the miseries of her subjects I have done all in my power to ameliorate them and yet the belief of the public you say is that they proceed from me an unhappy foreigner who has been unable to please the French Alas I have never been understood and no wonder I succeeded a man of the most sublime genius that ever upheld the sceptre of France The memory of Richelieu annihilates me In vain were I an ambitious man should I struggle against such remembrances as he has left but that I am not ambitious I am going to prove to you I own myself conquered I shall obey the wishes of the people If Paris has injuries to complain of who has not some wrongs to be redressed Paris has been sufficiently punished enough blood has flowed enough misery has humbled a town deprived of its king and of justice Tis not for me a private individual to disunite a queen from her kingdom Since you demand my resignation I retire Then said Aramis in his neighbor s ear the conferences are over There is nothing to do but to send Monsieur Mazarin to the most distant frontier and to take care that he does not return even by that nor any other entrance into France One instant sir said the man in a gown whom he addressed a plague on t how fast you go one may soon see that you re a soldier There s the article of remunerations and indemnifications to be discussed and set to rights Chancellor said the queen turning to Seguier our old acquaintance you will open the conferences They can take place at Rueil The cardinal has said several things which have agitated me therefore I will not speak more fully now As to his going or staying I feel too much gratitude to the cardinal not to leave him free in all his actions he shall do what he wishes to do A transient pallor overspread the speaking countenance of the prime minister he looked at the queen with anxiety Her face was so passionless that he as every one else present was incapable of reading her thoughts But added the queen in awaiting the cardinal s decision let there be if you please a reference to the king only The deputies bowed and left the room What exclaimed the queen when the last of them had quitted the apartment you would yield to these limbs of the law these advocates To promote your majesty s welfare madame replied Mazarin fixing his penetrating eyes on the queen there is no sacrifice that I would not make Anne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual with her A recollection of Athos came into her mind His fearless deportment his words so firm yet dignified the shades which by one word he had evoked recalled to her the past in all its intoxication of poetry and romance youth beauty the eclat of love at twenty years of age the bloody death of Buckingham the only man whom she had ever really loved and the heroism of those obscure champions who had saved her from the double hatred of Richelieu and the king Mazarin looked at her and whilst she deemed herself alone and freed from the world of enemies who sought to spy into her secret thoughts he read her thoughts in her countenance as one sees in a transparent lake clouds pass reflections like thoughts of the heavens Must we then asked Anne of Austria yield to the storm buy peace and patiently and piously await better times Mazarin smiled sarcastically at this speech which showed that she had taken the minister s proposal seriously Anne s head was bent down she had not seen the Italian s smile but finding that her question elicited no reply she looked up Well you do not answer cardinal what do you think about it I am thinking madame of the allusion made by that insolent gentleman whom you have caused to be arrested to the Duke of Buckingham to him whom you allowed to be assassinated to the Duchess de Chevreuse whom you suffered to be exiled to the Duc de Beaufort whom you imprisoned but if he made allusion to me it was because he is ignorant of the relation in which I stand to you Anne drew up as she always did when anything touched her pride She blushed and that she might not answer clasped her beautiful hands till her sharp nails almost pierced them That man has sagacity honor and wit not to mention likewise that he is a man of undoubted resolution You know something about him do you not madame I shall tell him therefore and in doing so I shall confer a personal favor on him how he is mistaken in regard to me What is proposed to me would be in fact almost an abdication and an abdication requires reflection An abdication repeated Anne I thought sir that it was kings alone who abdicated Well replied Mazarin and am I not almost a king king indeed of France Thrown over the foot of the royal bed my simar madame looks not unlike the mantle worn by kings This was one of the humiliations which Mazarin made Anne undergo more frequently than any other and one that bowed her head with shame Queen Elizabeth and Catherine II of Russia are the only two monarchs of their set on record who were at once sovereigns and lovers Anne of Austria looked with a sort of terror at the threatening aspect of the cardinal his physiognomy in such moments was not destitute of a certain grandeur Sir she replied did I not say and did you not hear me say to those people that you should do as you pleased In that case said Mazarin I think it must please me best to remain not only on account of my own interest but for your safety Remain then sir nothing can be more agreeable to me only do not allow me to be insulted You are referring to the demands of the rebels and to the tone in which they stated them Patience They have selected a field of battle on which I am an abler general than they that of a conference No we shall beat them by merely temporizing They want food already They will be ten times worse off in a week Ah yes Good heavens I know it will end in that way but it is not they who taunt me with the most wounding reproaches but I understand you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually revived by these three gentlemen However we have them safe in prison and they are just sufficiently culpable for us to keep them in prison as long as we find it convenient One only is still not in our power and braves us But devil take him we shall soon succeed in sending him to join his boon companions We have accomplished more difficult things than that In the first place I have as a precaution shut up at Rueil near me under my own eyes within reach of my hand the two most intractable ones To day the third will be there also As long as they are in prison all will be well said Anne but one of these days they will get out Yes if your majesty releases them Ah exclaimed Anne following the train of her own thoughts on such occasions one regrets Paris Why so On account of the Bastile sir which is so strong and so secure Madame these conferences will bring us peace when we have peace we shall regain Paris with Paris the Bastile and our four bullies shall rot therein Anne frowned slightly when Mazarin in taking leave kissed her hand Mazarin after this half humble half gallant attention went away Anne followed him with her eyes and as he withdrew at every step he took a disdainful smile was seen playing then gradually burst upon her lips I once she said despised the love of a cardinal who never said I shall do but I have done so and so That man knew of retreats more secure than Rueil darker and more silent even than the Bastile Degenerate world eighty two Precautions After quitting Anne Mazarin took the road to Rueil where he usually resided in those times of disturbance he went about with numerous followers and often disguised himself In military dress he was indeed as we have stated a very handsome man In the court of the old Chateau of Saint Germain he entered his coach and reached the Seine at Chatou The prince had supplied him with fifty light horse not so much by way of guard as to show the deputies how readily the queen s generals dispersed their troops and to prove that they might be safely scattered at pleasure Athos on horseback without his sword and kept in sight by Comminges followed the cardinal in silence Grimaud finding that his master had been arrested fell back into the ranks near Aramis without saying a word and as if nothing had happened Grimaud had indeed during twenty two years of service seen his master extricate himself from so many difficulties that nothing less than Athos s imminent death was likely to make him uneasy At the branching off of the road toward Paris Aramis who had followed in the cardinal s suite turned back Mazarin went to the right hand and Aramis could see the prisoner disappear at the turning of the avenue Athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back also The two friends exchanged a simple inclination of the head and Aramis put his finger to his hat as if to bow Athos alone comprehending by that signal that he had some project in his head Ten minutes afterward Mazarin entered the court of that chateau which his predecessor had built for him at Rueil as he alighted Comminges approached him My lord he asked where does your eminence wish Monsieur Comte de la Fere to be lodged In the pavilion of the orangery of course in front of the pavilion where the guard is I wish every respect to be shown the count although he is the prisoner of her majesty the queen My lord answered Comminges he begs to be taken to the place where Monsieur d Artagnan is confined that is in the hunting lodge opposite the orangery Mazarin thought for an instant Comminges saw that he was undecided Tis a very strong post he resumed and we have forty good men tried soldiers having no connection with Frondeurs nor any interest in the Fronde If we put these three men together Monsieur Comminges said Mazarin we must double the guard and we are not rich enough in fighting men to commit such acts of prodigality Comminges smiled Mazarin read and construed that smile You do not know these men Monsieur Comminges but I know them first personally also by hearsay I sent them to carry aid to King Charles and they performed prodigies to save him had it not been for an adverse destiny that beloved monarch would this day have been among us But since they served your eminence so well why are they my lord cardinal in prison In prison said Mazarin and when has Rueil been a prison Ever since there were prisoners in it answered Comminges These gentlemen Comminges are not prisoners returned Mazarin with his ironical smile only guests but guests so precious that I have put a grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors that they may not refuse to continue my visitors So much do I esteem them that I am going to make the Comte de la Fere a visit that I may converse with him tete a tete and that we may not be disturbed at our interview you must conduct him as I said before to the pavilion of the orangery that you know is my daily promenade Well while taking my walk I will call on him and we will talk Although he professes to be my enemy I have sympathy for him and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall arrange matters Comminges bowed and returned to Athos who was awaiting with apparent calmness but with real anxiety the result of the interview Well he said to the lieutenant Sir replied Comminges it seems that it is impossible Monsieur de Comminges said Athos I have been a soldier all my life and I know the force of orders but outside your orders there is a service you can render me I will do it with all my heart said Comminges for I know who you are and what service you once performed for her majesty I know too how dear to you is the young man who came so valiantly to my aid when that old rogue of a Broussel was arrested I am entirely at your service except only for my orders Thank you sir what I am about to ask will not compromise you in any degree If it should even compromise me a little said Monsieur de Comminges with a smile still make your demand I don t like Mazarin any better than you do I serve the queen and that draws me naturally into the service of the cardinal but I serve the one with joy and the other against my will Speak then I beg of you I wait and listen Since there is no harm said Athos in my knowing that D Artagnan is here I presume there will be none in his knowing that I am here I have received no orders on that point Well then do me the kindness to give him my regards and tell him that I am his neighbor Tell him also what you have just told me that Mazarin has placed me in the pavilion of the orangery in order to make me a visit and assure him that I shall take advantage of this honor he proposes to accord to me to obtain from him some amelioration of our captivity Which cannot last interrupted Comminges the cardinal said so there is no prison here But there are oubliettes replied Athos smiling Oh that s a different thing yes I know there are traditions of that sort said Comminges It was in the time of the other cardinal who was a great nobleman but our Mazarin impossible an Italian adventurer would not dare to go such lengths with such men as ourselves Oubliettes are employed as a means of kingly vengeance and a low born fellow such as he is would not have recourse to them Your arrest is known that of your friends will soon be known and all the nobility of France would demand an explanation of your disappearance No no be easy on that score I will however inform Monsieur d Artagnan of your arrival here Comminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a pavilion at the end of the orangery They passed through a courtyard as they went full of soldiers and courtiers In the centre of this court in the form of a horseshoe were the buildings occupied by Mazarin and at each wing the pavilion or smaller building where D Artagnan was confined and that level with the orangery where Athos was to be From the ends of these two wings extended the park Athos when he reached his appointed room observed through the gratings of his window walls and roofs and was told on inquiry by Comminges that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where D Artagnan was confined Yes tis too true said Comminges tis almost a prison but what a singular fancy this is of yours count you who are the very flower of our nobility to squander your valor and loyalty amongst these upstarts the Frondists Really count if ever I thought that I had a friend in the ranks of the royal army it was you A Frondeur you the Comte de la Fere on the side of Broussel Blancmesnil and Viole For shame you a Frondeur On my word of honor said Athos one must be either a Mazarinist or a Frondeur For a long time I had these words whispered in my ears and I chose the latter at any rate it is a French word And now I am a Frondeur not of Broussel s party nor of Blancmesnil s nor am I with Viole but with the Duc de Beaufort the Ducs de Bouillon and d Elbeuf with princes not with presidents councillors and low born lawyers Besides what a charming outlook it would have been to serve the cardinal Look at that wall without a single window which tells you fine things about Mazarin s gratitude Yes replied De Comminges more especially if it could reveal how Monsieur d Artagnan for this last week has been anathematizing him Poor D Artagnan said Athos with the charming melancholy that was one of the traits of his character so brave so good so terrible to the enemies of those he loves You have two unruly prisoners there sir Unruly Comminges smiled you wish to terrify me I suppose When he came here Monsieur D Artagnan provoked and braved the soldiers and inferior officers in order I suppose to have his sword back That mood lasted some time but now he s as gentle as a lamb and sings Gascon songs which make one die of laughing And Du Vallon asked Athos Ah he s quite another sort of person a formidable gentleman indeed The first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his shoulder and I expected to see him leave Rueil in the same way as Samson left Gaza But his temper cooled down like his friend s he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about it So much the better said Athos Do you think anything else was to be expected of them asked Comminges who putting together what Mazarin had said of his prisoners and what the Comte de la Fere had said began to feel a degree of uneasiness Athos on the other hand reflected that this recent gentleness of his friends most certainly arose from some plan formed by D Artagnan Unwilling to injure them by praising them too highly he replied They They are two hotheads the one a Gascon the other from Picardy both are easily excited but they quiet down immediately You have had a proof of that in what you have just related to me This too was the opinion of Comminges who withdrew somewhat reassured Athos remained alone in the vast chamber where according to the cardinal s directions he was treated with all the courtesy due to a nobleman He awaited Mazarin s promised visit to get some light on his present situation eighty three Strength and Sagacity Now let us pass the orangery to the hunting lodge At the extremity of the courtyard where close to a portico formed of Ionic columns were the dog kennels rose an oblong building the pavilion of the orangery a half circle inclosing the court of honor It was in this pavilion on the ground floor that D Artagnan and Porthos were confined suffering interminable hours of imprisonment in a manner suitable to each different temperament D Artagnan was pacing to and fro like a caged tiger with dilated eyes growling as he paced along by the bars of a window looking upon the yard of servant s offices Porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just demolished The one seemed to be deprived of reason yet he was meditating The other seemed to meditate yet he was more than half asleep But his sleep was a nightmare which might be guessed by the incoherent manner in which he sometimes snored and sometimes snorted Look said D Artagnan day is declining It must be nearly four o clock We have been in this place nearly eighty three hours Hem muttered Porthos with a kind of pretense of answering Did you hear eternal sleeper cried D Artagnan irritated that any one could doze during the day when he had the greatest difficulty in sleeping during the night What said Porthos I say we have been here eighty three hours Tis your fault answered Porthos How my fault Yes I offered you escape By pulling out a bar and pushing down a door Certainly Porthos men like us can t go out from here purely and simply Faith said Porthos as for me I could go out with that purity and that simplicity which it seems to me you despise too much D Artagnan shrugged his shoulders And besides he said going out of this chamber isn t all Dear friend said Porthos you appear to be in a somewhat better humor to day than you were yesterday Explain to me why going out of this chamber isn t everything Because having neither arms nor password we shouldn t take fifty steps in the court without knocking against a sentinel Very well said Porthos we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his arms Yes but before we can kill him and he will be hard to kill that Swiss he will shriek out and the whole picket will come and we shall be taken like foxes we who are lions and thrown into some dungeon where we shall not even have the consolation of seeing this frightful gray sky of Rueil which no more resembles the sky of Tarbes than the moon is like the sun Lack a day if we only had some one to instruct us about the physical and moral topography of this castle Ah when one thinks that for twenty years during which time I did not know what to do with myself it never occurred to me to come to study Rueil What difference does that make said Porthos We shall go out all the same Do you know my dear fellow why master pastrycooks never work with their hands No said Porthos but I should be glad to be informed It is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked What then Why then they would be laughed at and a master pastrycook must never be laughed at And what have master pastrycooks to do with us We ought in our adventures never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at us In England lately we failed we were beaten and that is a blemish on our reputation By whom then were we beaten asked Porthos By Mordaunt Yes but we have drowned Monsieur Mordaunt That is true and that will redeem us a little in the eyes of posterity if posterity ever looks at us But listen Porthos though Monsieur Mordaunt was a man not to be despised Mazarin is not less strong than he and we shall not easily succeed in drowning him We must therefore watch and play a close game for he added with a sigh we two are equal perhaps to eight others but we are not equal to the four that you know of That is true said Porthos echoing D Artagnan s sigh Well Porthos follow my examples walk back and forth till some news of our friends reaches us or till we are visited by a good idea But don t sleep as you do all the time nothing dulls the intellect like sleep As to what may lie before us it is perhaps less serious than we at first thought I don t believe that Monsieur de Mazarin thinks of cutting off our heads for heads are not taken off without previous trial a trial would make a noise and a noise would get the attention of our friends who would check the operations of Monsieur de Mazarin How well you reason said Porthos admiringly Well yes pretty well replied D Artagnan and besides you see if they put us on trial if they cut off our heads they must meanwhile either keep us here or transfer us elsewhere Yes that is inevitable said Porthos Well it is impossible but that Master Aramis that keen scented bloodhound and Athos that wise and prudent nobleman will discover our retreat Then believe me it will be time to act Yes we will wait We can wait the more contentedly that it is not absolutely bad here but for one thing at least What is that Did you observe D Artagnan that three days running they have brought us braised mutton No but if it occurs a fourth time I shall complain of it so never mind And then I feel the loss of my house tis a long time since I visited my castles Forget them for a time we shall return to them unless Mazarin razes them to the ground Do you think that likely No the other cardinal would have done so but this one is too mean a fellow to risk it You reconcile me D Artagnan Well then assume a cheerful manner as I do we must joke with the guards we must gain the good will of the soldiers since we can t corrupt them Try Porthos to please them more than you are wont to do when they are under our windows Thus far you have done nothing but show them your fist and the more respectable your fist is Porthos the less attractive it is Ah I would give much to have five hundred louis only So would I said Porthos unwilling to be behind D Artagnan in generosity I would give as much as a hundred pistoles The two prisoners were at this point of their conversation when Comminges entered preceded by a sergeant and two men who brought supper in a basket with two handles filled with basins and plates What exclaimed Porthos mutton again My dear Monsieur de Comminges said D Artagnan you will find that my friend Monsieur du Vallon will go to the most fatal lengths if Cardinal Mazarin continues to provide us with this sort of meat mutton every day I declare said Porthos I shall eat nothing if they do not take it away Remove the mutton cried Comminges I wish Monsieur du Vallon to sup well more especially as I have news to give him that will improve his appetite Is Mazarin dead asked Porthos No I am sorry to tell you he is perfectly well So much the worse said Porthos What is that news asked D Artagnan News in prison is a fruit so rare that I trust Monsieur de Comminges you will excuse my impatience the more eager since you have given us to understand that the news is good Should you be glad to hear that the Comte de la Fere is well asked De Comminges D Artagnan s penetrating gray eyes were opened to the utmost Glad he cried I should be more than glad Happy beyond measure Well I am desired by him to give you his compliments and to say that he is in good health D Artagnan almost leaped with joy A quick glance conveyed his thought to Porthos If Athos knows where we are if he opens communication with us before long Athos will act Porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances but now since the name of Athos had suggested to him the same idea he understood Do you say asked the Gascon timidly that the Comte de la Fere has commissioned you to give his compliments to Monsieur du Vallon and myself Yes sir Then you have seen him Certainly I have Where if I may ask without indiscretion Near here replied De Comminges smiling so near that if the windows which look on the orangery were not stopped up you could see him from where you are He is wandering about the environs of the castle thought D Artagnan Then he said aloud You met him I dare say in the park hunting perhaps No nearer nearer still Look behind this wall said De Comminges knocking against the wall Behind this wall What is there then behind this wall I was brought here by night so devil take me if I know where I am Well said Comminges suppose one thing I will suppose anything you please Suppose there were a window in this wall Well From that window you would see Monsieur de la Fere at his The count then is in the chateau Yes For what reason The same as yourself Athos a prisoner You know well replied De Comminges that there are no prisoners at Rueil because there is no prison Don t let us play upon words sir Athos has been arrested Yesterday at Saint Germain as he came out from the presence of the queen The arms of D Artagnan fell powerless by his side One might have supposed him thunderstruck a paleness ran like a cloud over his dark skin but disappeared immediately A prisoner he reiterated A prisoner repeated Porthos quite dejected Suddenly D Artagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which scarcely even Porthos observed but it died away and he appeared more sorrowful than before Come come said Comminges who since D Artagnan on the day of Broussel s arrest had saved him from the hands of the Parisians had entertained a real affection for him don t be unhappy I never thought of bringing you bad news Laugh at the chance which has brought your friend near to you and Monsieur du Vallon instead of being in the depths of despair about it But D Artagnan was still in a desponding mood And how did he look asked Porthos who perceiving that D Artagnan had allowed the conversation to drop profited by it to put in a word or two Very well indeed sir replied Comminges at first like you he seemed distressed but when he heard that the cardinal was going to pay him a visit this very evening Ah cried D Artagnan the cardinal is about to visit the Comte de la Fere Yes and the count desired me to tell you that he should take advantage of this visit to plead for you and for himself Ah our dear count said D Artagnan A fine thing indeed grunted Porthos A great favor Zounds Monsieur the Comte de la Fere whose family is allied to the Montmorency and the Rohan is easily the equal of Monsieur de Mazarin No matter said D Artagnan in his most wheedling tone On reflection my dear Du Vallon it is a great honor for the Comte de la Fere and gives good reason to hope In fact it seems to me so great an honor for a prisoner that I think Monsieur de Comminges must be mistaken What I am mistaken Monsieur de Mazarin will not come to visit the Comte de la Fere but the Comte de la Fere will be sent for to visit him No no no said Comminges who made a point of having the facts appear exactly as they were I clearly understood what the cardinal said to me He will come and visit the Comte de la Fere D Artagnan tried to gather from the expression of his eyes whether Porthos understood the importance of that visit but Porthos did not even look toward him It is then the cardinal s custom to walk in his orangery asked D Artagnan Every evening he shuts himself in there That it seems is where he meditates on state affairs In that case said D Artagnan I begin to believe that Monsieur de la Fere will receive the visit of his eminence he will of course have an escort Yes two soldiers And will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers The soldiers are Swiss who understand only German Besides according to all probability they will wait at the door D Artagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too expressive Let the cardinal take care of going alone to visit the Comte de la Fere said D Artagnan for the count must be furious Comminges began to laugh Oh oh why really one would say that you four were anthropaphagi The count is an affable man besides he is unarmed at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his assistance Two soldiers said D Artagnan seeming to remember something two soldiers yes that then is why I hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour under my window That is it they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for Bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes out Fine looking men upon my word said D Artagnan They belong to the regiment that was at Lens which the prince assigned to the cardinal Ah monsieur said D Artagnan as if to sum up in a word all that conversation if only his eminence would relent and grant to Monsieur de la Fere our liberty I wish it with all my heart said Comminges Then if he should forget that visit you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it Not at all Ah that gives me more confidence This skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime manoeuvre to any one who could have read the Gascon s soul Now said D Artagnan I ve one last favor to ask of you Monsieur de Comminges At your service sir You will see the count again To morrow morning Will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained You want the cardinal to come here No I know my place and am not so presumptuous Let his eminence do me the honor to give me a hearing that is all I want Oh muttered Porthos shaking his head never should I have thought this of him How misfortune humbles a man I promise you it shall be done answered De Comminges Tell the count that I am well that you found me sad but resigned I am pleased sir to hear that And the same also for Monsieur du Vallon Not for me cried Porthos I am not by any means resigned But you will be resigned my friend Never He will become so monsieur I know him better than he knows himself Be silent dear Du Vallon and resign yourself Adieu gentlemen said De Comminges sleep well We will try De Comminges went away D Artagnan remaining apparently in the same attitude of humble resignation but scarcely had he departed when he turned and clasped Porthos in his arms with an expression not to be doubted Oh cried Porthos what s the matter now Have you gone mad my dear friend What is the matter returned D Artagnan we are saved I don t see that at all answered Porthos I think we are all taken prisoners except Aramis and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in Mazarin s mousetrap Which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned D Artagnan I don t understand said Porthos Never mind let s sit down to table and take something to strengthen us for the night What are we to do then to night To travel perhaps But Sit down dear friend to table When one is eating ideas flow easily After supper when they are perfected I will communicate my plans to you So Porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by D Artagnan s inventive imagination eighty four Strength and Sagacity Continued Supper was eaten in silence but not in sadness for from time to time one of those sweet smiles which were habitual to him in moments of good humor illumined the face of D Artagnan Not a scintilla of these was lost on Porthos and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his brain At dessert D Artagnan reposed in his chair crossed one leg over the other and lounged about like a man perfectly at his ease Porthos rested his chin on his hands placed his elbows on the table and looked at D Artagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of good fellowship Well said D Artagnan at last Well repeated Porthos You were saying my dear friend No I said nothing Yes you were saying you wished to leave this place Ah indeed the will was never wanting To get away you would not mind you added knocking down a door or a wall Tis true I said so and I say it again And I answered you Porthos that it was not a good plan that we couldn t go a hundred steps without being recaptured because we were without clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend ourselves That is true we should need clothes and arms Well said D Artagnan rising we have them friend Porthos and even something better Bah said Porthos looking around Useless to look everything will come to us when wanted At about what time did we see the two Swiss guards walking yesterday An hour after sunset If they go out to day as they did yesterday we shall have the honor then of seeing them in half an hour In a quarter of an hour at most Your arm is still strong enough is it not Porthos Porthos unbuttoned his sleeve raised his shirt and looked complacently on his strong arm as large as the leg of any ordinary man Yes indeed said he I believe so So that you could without trouble convert these tongs into a hoop and yonder shovel into a corkscrew Certainly And the giant took up these two articles and without any apparent effort produced in them the metamorphoses suggested by his companion There he cried Capital exclaimed the Gascon Really Porthos you are a gifted individual I have heard speak said Porthos of a certain Milo of Crotona who performed wonderful feats such as binding his forehead with a cord and bursting it of killing an ox with a blow of his fist and carrying it home on his shoulders et cetera I used to learn all these feat by heart yonder down at Pierrefonds and I have done all that he did except breaking a cord by the corrugation of my temples Because your strength is not in your head Porthos said his friend No it is in my arms and shoulders answered Porthos with gratified naivete Well my dear friend let us approach the window and there you can match your strength against that of an iron bar Porthos went to the window took a bar in his hands clung to it and bent it like a bow so that the two ends came out of the sockets of stone in which for thirty years they had been fixed Well friend the cardinal although such a genius could never have done that Shall I take out any more of them asked Porthos No that is sufficient a man can pass through that Porthos tried and passed the upper portion of his body through Yes he said Now pass your arm through this opening Why You will know presently pass it Porthos obeyed with military promptness and passed his arm through the opening Admirable said D Artagnan The scheme goes forward it seems On wheels dear friend Good What shall I do now Nothing It is finished then No not yet I should like to understand said Porthos Listen my dear friend in two words you will know all The door of the guardhouse opens as you see Yes I see They are about to send into our court which Monsieur de Mazarin crosses on his way to the orangery the two guards who attend him There they are coming out If only they close the guardhouse door Good They close it What then Silence They may hear us I don t understand it at all As you execute you will understand And yet I should have preferred You will have the pleasure of the surprise Ah that is true Hush Porthos remained silent and motionless In fact the two soldiers advanced on the side where the window was rubbing their hands for it was cold it being the month of February At this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned away Now said D Artagnan I am going to call this soldier and talk to him Don t lose a word of what I m going to say to you Porthos Everything lies in the execution Good the execution of plots is my forte I know it well I depend on you Look I shall turn to the left so that the soldier will be at your right as soon as he mounts on the bench to talk to us But supposing he doesn t mount He will rely upon it As soon as you see him get up stretch out your arm and seize him by the neck Then raising him up as Tobit raised the fish by the gills you must pull him into the room taking care to squeeze him so tight that he can t cry out Oh said Porthos Suppose I happen to strangle him To be sure there would only be a Swiss the less in the world but you will not do so I hope Lay him down here we ll gag him and tie him no matter where somewhere So we shall get from him one uniform and a sword Marvelous exclaimed Porthos looking at the Gascon with the most profound admiration Pooh replied D Artagnan Yes said Porthos recollecting himself but one uniform and one sword will not suffice for two Well but there s his comrade True said Porthos Therefore when I cough stretch out your arm Good The two friends then placed themselves as they had agreed Porthos being completely hidden in an angle of the window Good evening comrade said D Artagnan in his most fascinating voice and manner Good evening sir answered the soldier in a strong provincial accent Tis not too warm to walk resumed D Artagnan No sir And I think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you A glass of wine will be extremely welcome The fish bites the fish bites whispered the Gascon to Porthos I understand said Porthos A bottle perhaps A whole bottle Yes sir A whole bottle if you will drink my health Willingly answered the soldier Come then and take it friend said the Gascon With all my heart How convenient that there s a bench here Egad one would think it had been placed here on purpose Get on it that s it friend And D Artagnan coughed That instant the arm of Porthos fell His hand of iron grasped quick as lightning firm as a pair of blacksmith s pincers the soldier s throat He raised him almost stifling him as he drew him through the aperture at the risk of flaying him in the passage He then laid him down on the floor where D Artagnan after giving him just time enough to draw his breath gagged him with his long scarf and the moment he had done so began to undress him with the promptitude and dexterity of a man who had learned his business on the field of battle Then the soldier gagged and bound was placed upon the hearth the fire of which had been previously extinguished by the two friends Here s a sword and a dress said Porthos I take them said D Artagnan for myself If you want another uniform and sword you must play the same trick over again Stop I see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward us I think replied Porthos it would be imprudent to attempt the same manoeuvre again it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same way and a failure would be ruinous No I will go down seize the man unawares and bring him to you ready gagged That is better said the Gascon Be ready said Porthos as he slipped through the opening He did as he said Porthos seized his opportunity caught the next soldier by his neck gagged him and pushed him like a mummy through the bars into the room and entered after him Then they undressed him as they had done the first laid him on their bed and bound him with the straps which composed the bed the bedstead being of oak This operation proved as great a success as the first There said D Artagnan this is capital Now let me try on the dress of yonder chap Porthos I doubt if you can wear it but should it be too tight never mind you can wear the breastplate and the hat with the red feathers It happened however that the second soldier was a Swiss of gigantic proportions so save that some few of the seams split his uniform fitted Porthos perfectly They then dressed themselves Tis done they both exclaimed at once As to you comrades they said to the men nothing will happen to you if you are discreet but if you stir you are dead men The soldiers were complaisant they had found the grasp of Porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against it Now said D Artagnan you wouldn t be sorry to understand the plot would you Porthos Well no not very Well then we shall go down into the court Yes We shall take the place of those two fellows Well We will walk back and forth That s a good idea for it isn t warm In a moment the valet de chambre will call the guard as he did yesterday and the day before And we shall answer No on the contrary we shall not answer As you please I don t insist on answering We will not answer then we will simply settle our hats on our heads and we will escort his eminence Where shall we escort him Where he is going to visit Athos Do you think Athos will be sorry to see us Oh cried Porthos oh I understand Wait a little Porthos before crying out for on my word you haven t reached the end said the Gascon in a jesting tone What is to happen said Porthos Follow me replied D Artagnan The man who lives to see shall see And slipping through the aperture he alighted in the court Porthos followed him by the same road but with more difficulty and less diligence They could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear as they lay bound in the chamber Scarcely had the two Frenchmen touched the ground when a door opened and the voice of the valet de chambre called out Make ready At the same moment the guardhouse was opened and a voice called out La Bruyere and Du Barthois March It seems that I am named La Bruyere remarked D Artagnan And I Du Barthois added Porthos Where are you asked the valet de chambre whose eyes dazzled by the light could not clearly distinguish our heroes in the gloom Here we are said the Gascon What say you to that Monsieur du Vallon he added in a low tone to Porthos If it but lasts most capital responded Porthos These two newly enlisted soldiers marched gravely after the valet de chambre who opened the door of the vestibule then another which seemed to be that of a waiting room and showing them two stools Your orders are very simple he said don t allow anybody except one person to enter here Do you hear not a single creature Obey that person implicitly On your return you cannot make a mistake You have only to wait here till I release you D Artagnan was known to this valet de chambre who was no other than Bernouin and he had during the last six or eight months introduced the Gascon a dozen times to the cardinal The Gascon therefore instead of answering growled out Ja Ja in the most German and the least Gascon accent possible As for Porthos on whom D Artagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend which was to follow Mazarin in his visit to Athos he was simply mute All that he was allowed to say in case of emergencies was the proverbial Der Teufel Bernouin shut the door and went away When Porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed lest they should only have exchanged one prison for another Porthos my friend said D Artagnan don t distrust Providence Let me meditate and consider Meditate and consider as much as you like replied Porthos who was now quite out of humor at seeing things take this turn We have walked eight paces whispered D Artagnan and gone up six steps so hereabouts is the pavilion called the pavilion of the orangery The Comte de la Fere cannot be far off only the doors are locked That is a slight difficulty said Porthos and a good push with the shoulders For God s sake Porthos my friend reserve your feats of strength or they will not have when needed the honor they deserve Have you not heard that some one is coming here Yes Well that some one will open the doors But my dear fellow if that some one recognizes us if that some one cries out we are lost for you don t propose I imagine that I shall kill that man of the church That might do if we were dealing with Englishmen or Germans Oh may God keep me from it and you too said D Artagnan The young king would perhaps show us some gratitude but the queen would never forgive us and it is she whom we have to consider And then besides the useless blood never no never I have my plan let me carry it out and we shall laugh So much the better said Porthos I feel some need of it Hush said D Artagnan the some one is coming The sound of a light step was heard in the vestibule The hinges of the door creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier wrapped in a brown cloak with a lantern in one hand and a large beaver hat pulled down over his eyes Porthos effaced himself against the wall but he could not render himself invisible and the man in the cloak said to him giving him his lantern Light the lamp which hangs from the ceiling Then addressing D Artagnan You know the watchword he said Ja replied the Gascon determined to confine himself to this specimen of the German tongue Tedesco answered the cavalier va bene And advancing toward the door opposite to that by which he came in he opened it and disappeared behind it shutting it as he went Now asked Porthos what are we to do Now we shall make use of your shoulder friend Porthos if this door proves to be locked Everything in its proper time and all comes right to those who know how to wait patiently But first barricade the first door well then we will follow yonder cavalier The two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room as not only to make the passage impassable but so to block the door that by no means could it open inward There said D Artagnan we can t be overtaken Come forward eighty five The Oubliettes of Cardinal Mazarin At first on arriving at the door through which Mazarin had passed D Artagnan tried in vain to open it but on the powerful shoulder of Porthos being applied to one of the panels which gave way D Artagnan introduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the lock The bolt gave way and the door opened As I told you everything can be attained Porthos women and doors by proceeding with gentleness You re a great moralist and that s the fact said Porthos They entered behind a glass window by the light of the cardinal s lantern which had been placed on the floor in the midst of the gallery they saw the orange and pomegranate trees of the Castle of Rueil in long lines forming one great alley and two smaller side alleys No cardinal said D Artagnan but only his lantern where the devil then is he Exploring however one of the side wings of the gallery after making a sign to Porthos to explore the other he saw all at once at his left a tub containing an orange tree which had been pushed out of its place and in its place an open aperture Ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub but by some mechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it rested D Artagnan as we have said perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the steps of a winding staircase He called Porthos to look at it Were our object money only he said we should be rich directly How s that Don t you understand Porthos At the bottom of that staircase lies probably the cardinal s treasury of which folk tell such wonders and we should only have to descend empty a chest shut the cardinal up in it double lock it go away carrying off as much gold as we could put back this orange tree over the place and no one in the world would ever ask us where our fortune came from not even the cardinal It would be a happy hit for clowns to make but as it seems to be unworthy of two gentlemen said Porthos So I think and therefore I said Were our object money only but we want something else replied the Gascon At the same moment whilst D Artagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen a metallic sound as if some one was moving a bag of gold struck on his ear he started instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the staircase Mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walking about but he had with him a waxlight to help him to explore his mysterious strong box Faith he said in Italian as he was reascending the steps and looking at a bag of reals faith there s enough to pay five councillors of parliament and two generals in Paris I am a great captain that I am but I make war in my own way The two friends were crouching down meantime behind a tub in the side alley Mazarin came within three steps of D Artagnan and pushed a spring in the wall the slab turned and the orange tree resumed its place Then the cardinal put out the waxlight slipped it into his pocket and taking up the lantern Now he said for Monsieur de la Fere Very good thought D Artagnan tis our road likewise we will go together All three set off on their walk Mazarin taking the middle alley and the friends the side ones The cardinal reached a second door without perceiving he was being followed the sand with which the alleys were covered deadened the sound of footsteps He then turned to the left down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends but as he opened the door he paused as if in thought Ah Diavolo he exclaimed I forgot the recommendation of De Comminges who advised me to take a guard and place it at this door in order not to put myself at the mercy of that four headed combination of devils And with a movement of impatience he turned to retrace his steps Do not give yourself the trouble my lord said D Artagnan with his right foot forward his beaver in his hand a smile on his face we have followed your eminence step by step and here we are Yes here we are said Porthos And he made the same friendly salute as D Artagnan Mazarin gazed at each of them with an affrighted stare recognized them and let drop his lantern uttering a cry of terror D Artagnan picked it up by good luck it had not been extinguished Oh what imprudence my lord said D Artagnan tis not good to be about just here without a light Your eminence might knock against something or fall into a hole Monsieur d Artagnan muttered Mazarin unable to recover from his astonishment Yes my lord it is I I have the honor to present to you Monsieur du Vallon that excellent friend of mine in whom your eminence had the kindness to interest yourself formerly And D Artagnan held the lamp before the merry face of Porthos who now began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole undertaking You were going to visit Monsieur de la Fere said D Artagnan Don t let us disarrange your eminence Be so good as to show us the way and we will follow you Mazarin was by degrees recovering his senses Have you been long in the orangery he asked in a trembling voice remembering the visits he had been paying to his treasury Porthos opened his mouth to reply D Artagnan made him a sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually closed This moment come my lord said D Artagnan Mazarin breathed again His fears were now no longer for his hoard but for himself A sort of smile played on his lips Come he said you have me in a snare gentlemen I confess myself conquered You wish to ask for liberty and I give it you Oh my lord answered D Artagnan you are too good as to our liberty we have that we want to ask something else of you You have your liberty repeated Mazarin in terror Certainly and on the other hand my lord you have lost it and now in accordance with the law of war sir you must buy it back again Mazarin felt a shiver run through him a chill even to his heart s core His piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the Gascon and the unchanging countenance of Porthos Both were in shadow and the Sybil of Cuma herself could not have read them To purchase back my liberty said the cardinal Yes my lord And how much will that cost me Monsieur d Artagnan Zounds my lord I don t know yet We must ask the Comte de la Fere the question Will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the count s room and in ten minutes all will be settled Mazarin started My lord said D Artagnan your eminence sees that we wish to act with all formality and due respect but I must warn you that we have no time to lose open the door then my lord and be so good as to remember once for all that on the slightest attempt to escape or the faintest cry for help our position being very critical indeed you must not be angry with us if we go to extremities Be assured answered Mazarin that I shall attempt nothing I give you my word of honor D Artagnan made a sign to Porthos to redouble his watchfulness then turning to Mazarin Now my lord let us enter if you please eighty six Conferences Mazarin turned the lock of a double door on the threshold of which they found Athos ready to receive his illustrious guests according to the notice Comminges had given him On perceiving Mazarin he bowed Your eminence he said might have dispensed with your attendants the honor bestowed on me is too great for me to be unmindful of it And so my dear count said D Artagnan his eminence didn t actually insist on our attending him it is Du Vallon and I who have insisted and even in a manner somewhat impolite perhaps so great was our longing to see you At that voice that mocking tone and that familiar gesture accenting voice and tone Athos made a bound of surprise D Artagnan Porthos he exclaimed My very self dear friend Me also repeated Porthos What means this asked the count It means replied Mazarin trying to smile and biting his lips in the attempt that our parts are changed and that instead of these gentlemen being my prisoners I am theirs but gentlemen I warn you unless you kill me your victory will be of very short duration people will come to the rescue Ah my lord cried the Gascon don t threaten tis a bad example We are so good and gentle to your eminence Come let us put aside all rancor and talk pleasantly There s nothing I wish more replied Mazarin But don t think yourselves in a better position than you are In ensnaring me you have fallen into the trap yourselves How are you to get away from here remember the soldiers and sentinels who guard these doors Now I am going to show you how sincere I am Good thought D Artagnan we must look about us he s going to play us a trick I offered you your liberty continued the minister will you take it Before an hour has passed you will be discovered arrested obliged to kill me which would be a crime unworthy of loyal gentlemen like you He is right thought Athos And like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none but noble thoughts this feeling was expressed in his eyes And therefore said D Artagnan to clip the hope which Athos s tacit adhesion had imparted to Mazarin we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extremity If on the contrary resumed Mazarin you accept your liberty Why you my lord might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward and from my knowledge of you I believe you will so take it away from us No on the faith of a cardinal You do not believe me My lord I never believe cardinals who are not priests Well on the faith of a minister You are no longer a minister my lord you are a prisoner Then on the honor of a Mazarin as I am and ever shall be I hope said the cardinal Hem replied D Artagnan I have heard speak of a Mazarin who had not much religion when his oaths were in question I fear he may have been an ancestor of your eminence Monsieur d Artagnan you are a great wit and I am really sorry to be on bad terms with you My lord let us come to terms I ask nothing better Very well said Mazarin if I place you in security in a manner evident palpable Ah that is another thing said Porthos Let us see said Athos Let us see said D Artagnan In the first place do you accept asked the cardinal Unfold your plan my lord and we will see Take notice that you are shut up captured You well know my lord that there always remains to us a last resource What That of dying together Mazarin shuddered Listen he said at the end of yonder corridor is a door of which I have the key it leads into the park Go and take this key with you you are active vigorous and you have arms At a hundred steps on turning to the left you will find the wall of the park get over it and in three leaps you will be on the road and free Ah by Jove my lord said D Artagnan you have well said but these are only words Where is the key you speak of Here it is Ah my lord You will conduct us yourself then to that door Very willingly if it be necessary to reassure you answered the minister and Mazarin who was delighted to get off so cheaply led the way in high spirits to the corridor and opened the door It led into the park as the three fugitives perceived by the night breeze which rushed into the corridor and blew the wind into their faces The devil exclaimed the Gascon tis a dreadful night my lord We don t know the locality and shall never find the wall Since your eminence has come so far come a few steps further conduct us my lord to the wall Be it so replied the cardinal and walking in a straight line he went to the wall at the foot of which they all four arrived at the same instant Are you satisfied gentlemen asked Mazarin I think so indeed we should be hard to please if we were not Deuce take it three poor gentlemen escorted by a prince of the church Ah apropos my lord you remarked that we were all active vigorous and armed Yes You are mistaken Monsieur du Vallon and I are the only two who are armed The count is not and should we meet with one of your patrol we must defend ourselves Tis true Where can we find another sword asked Porthos My lord said D Artagnan will lend his which is of no use to him to the Comte de la Fere Willingly said the cardinal I will even ask the count to keep it for my sake I promise you my lord never to part with it replied Athos Well well cried D Artagnan this reconciliation is truly touching have you not tears in your eyes Porthos Yes said Porthos but I do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep I think it is the wind Now climb up Athos quickly said D Artagnan Athos assisted by Porthos who lifted him up like a feather arrived at the top Now jump down Athos Athos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the wall Are you on the ground asked D Artagnan Yes Without accident Perfectly safe and sound Porthos whilst I get up watch the cardinal No I don t want your help watch the cardinal I am watching said Porthos Well You are right it is more difficult than I thought Lend me your back but don t let the cardinal go Porthos lent him his back and D Artagnan was soon on the summit of the wall where he seated himself Mazarin pretended to laugh Are you there asked Porthos Yes my friend and now Now what asked Porthos Now give me the cardinal up here if he makes any noise stifle him Mazarin wished to call out but Porthos held him tight and passed him to D Artagnan who seized him by the neck and made him sit down by him then in a menacing tone he said Sir jump directly down close to Monsieur de la Fere or on the honor of a gentleman I ll kill you Monsieur monsieur cried Mazarin you are breaking your word to me I did I promise you anything my lord Mazarin groaned You are free he said through me your liberty was my ransom Agreed but the ransom of that immense treasure buried under the gallery to which one descends on pushing a spring hidden in the wall which causes a tub to turn revealing a staircase must not one speak of that a little my lord Diavolo cried Mazarin almost choked and clasping his hands I am a lost and ruined man But without listening to his protestations of alarm D Artagnan slipped him gently down into the arms of Athos who stood immovable at the bottom of the wall Porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall and by the aid of his friend s hand gained the summit I didn t understand it all he said but I understand now how droll it is You think so so much the better but that it may prove laughter worthy even to the end let us not lose time And he jumped off the wall Porthos did the same Attend to monsieur le cardinal gentlemen said D Artagnan for myself I will reconnoitre The Gascon then drew his sword and marched as avant guard My lord he said which way do we go Think well of your reply for should your eminence be mistaken there might ensue most grave results for all of us Along the wall sir said Mazarin there will be no danger of losing yourselves The three friends hastened on but in a short time were obliged to slacken the pace The cardinal could not keep up with them though with every wish to do so Suddenly D Artagnan touched something warm which moved Stop a horse he cried I have found a horse And I likewise said Athos I too said Porthos who faithful to the instructions still held the cardinal s arm There s luck my lord just as you were complaining of being tired and obliged to walk But as he spoke the barrel of a pistol was presented at his breast and these words were pronounced Touch it not Grimaud he cried Grimaud what art thou about Why thou art posted here by Heaven No sir said the honest servant it was Monsieur Aramis who posted me here to take care of the horses Is Aramis here Yes sir he has been here since yesterday What are you doing On the watch What Aramis here cried Athos At the lesser gate of the castle he s posted there Are you a large party Sixty Let him know This moment sir And believing that no one could execute the commission better than himself Grimaud set off at full speed whilst enchanted at being all together again the friends awaited his return There was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except Cardinal Mazarin eighty seven Thinking that Porthos will be at last a Baron and D Artagnan a Captain At the expiration of ten minutes Aramis arrived accompanied by Grimaud and eight or ten followers He was excessively delighted and threw himself into his friends arms You are free my brothers free without my aid and I shall have succeeded in doing nothing for you in spite of all my efforts Do not be unhappy dear friend on that account if you have done nothing as yet you will do something soon replied Athos I had well concerted my plans pursued Aramis the coadjutor gave me sixty men twenty guard the walls of the park twenty the road from Rueil to Saint Germain twenty are dispersed in the woods Thus I was able thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces to intercept two couriers from Mazarin to the queen Mazarin listened intently But said D Artagnan I trust that you honorably sent them back to monsieur le cardinal Ah yes said Aramis toward him I should be very likely to practice such delicacy of sentiment In one of the despatches the cardinal declares to the queen that the treasury is empty and that her majesty has no more money In the other he announces that he is about to transport his prisoners to Melun since Rueil seemed to him not sufficiently secure You can understand dear friend with what hope I was inspired by that last letter I placed myself in ambuscade with my sixty men I encircled the castle the riding horses I entrusted to Grimaud and I awaited your coming out which I did not expect till to morrow and I didn t hope to free you without a skirmish You are free to night without fighting so much the better How did you manage to escape that scoundrel Mazarin You must have much reason to complain of him Not very much said D Artagnan Really I might even say that we have some reason to praise him Impossible Yes really it is owing to him that we are free Owing to him Yes he had us conducted into the orangery by Monsieur Bernouin his valet de chambre and from there we followed him to visit the Comte de la Fere Then he offered us our liberty and we accepted it He even went so far as to show us the way out he led us to the park wall which we climbed over without accident and then we fell in with Grimaud Well exclaimed Aramis this will reconcile me to him but I wish he were here that I might tell him that I did not believe him capable of so noble an act My lord said D Artagnan no longer able to contain himself allow me to introduce to you the Chevalier d Herblay who wishes as you may have heard to offer his congratulations to your eminence And he retired discovering Mazarin who was in great confusion to the astonished gaze of Aramis Ho ho exclaimed the latter the cardinal a glorious prize Halloo halloo friends to horse to horse Several horsemen ran quickly to him Zounds cried Aramis I may have done some good so my lord deign to receive my most respectful homage I will lay a wager that twas that Saint Christopher Porthos who performed this feat Apropos I forgot and he gave some orders in a low voice to one of the horsemen I think it will be wise to set off said D Artagnan Yes but I am expecting some one a friend of Athos A friend exclaimed the count And here he comes by Jupiter galloping through the bushes The count the count cried a young voice that made Athos start Raoul Raoul he ejaculated For one moment the young man forgot his habitual respect he threw himself on his father s neck Look my lord cardinal said Aramis would it not have been a pity to have separated men who love each other as we love Gentlemen he continued addressing the cavaliers who became more and more numerous every instant gentlemen encircle his eminence that you may show him the greater honor He will indeed give us the favor of his company you will I hope be grateful for it Porthos do not lose sight of his eminence Aramis then joined Athos and D Artagnan who were consulting together Come said D Artagnan after a conference of five minutes duration let us begin our journey Where are we to go asked Porthos To your house dear Porthos at Pierrefonds your fine chateau is worthy of affording its princely hospitality to his eminence it is likewise well situated neither too near Paris nor too far from it we can establish a communication between it and the capital with great facility Come my lord you shall be treated like a prince as you are A fallen prince exclaimed Mazarin piteously The chances of war said Athos are many but be assured we shall take no improper advantage of them No but we shall make use of them said D Artagnan The rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling with the wonderful rapidity of former days Mazarin still sombre and pensive permitted himself to be dragged along in this way it looked a race of phantoms At dawn twelve leagues had been passed without drawing rein half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell down Horses nowadays are not what they were formerly observed Porthos everything degenerates I have sent Grimaud to Dammartin said Aramis He is to bring us five fresh horses one for his eminence four for us We at least must keep close to monseigneur the rest of the start will rejoin us later Once beyond Saint Denis we shall have nothing to fear Grimaud in fact brought back five horses The nobleman to whom he applied being a friend of Porthos was very ready not to sell them as was proposed but to lend them Ten minutes later the escort stopped at Ermenonville but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor guarding Mazarin carefully At noon they rode into the avenue of Pierrefonds Ah said Mousqueton who had ridden by the side of D Artagnan without speaking a word on the journey you may think what you will sir but I can breathe now for the first time since my departure from Pierrefonds and he put his horse to a gallop to announce to the other servants the arrival of Monsieur du Vallon and his friends We are four of us said D Artagnan we must relieve each other in mounting guard over my lord and each of us must watch three hours at a time Athos is going to examine the castle which it will be necessary to render impregnable in case of siege Porthos will see to the provisions and Aramis to the troops of the garrison That is to say Athos will be chief engineer Porthos purveyor in general and Aramis governor of the fortress Meanwhile they gave up to Mazarin the handsomest room in the chateau Gentlemen he said when he was in his room you do not expect I presume to keep me here a long time incognito No my lord replied the Gascon on the contrary we think of announcing very soon that we have you here Then you will be besieged We expect it And what shall you do Defend ourselves Were the late Cardinal Richelieu alive he would tell you a certain story of the Bastion Saint Gervais which we four with our four lackeys and twelve dead men held out against a whole army Such feats sir are done once and never repeated However nowadays there s no need of so much heroism To morrow the army of Paris will be summoned the day after it will be here The field of battle instead therefore of being at Saint Denis or at Charenton will be near Compiegne or Villars Cotterets The prince will vanquish you as he has always done Tis possible my lord but before an engagement ensues we shall move your eminence to another castle belonging to our friend Du Vallon who has three We will not expose your eminence to the chances of war Come answered Mazarin I see it will be necessary for me to capitulate Before a siege Yes the conditions will be better than afterward Ah my lord as to conditions you would soon see how moderate and reasonable we are Come now what are your conditions Rest yourself first my lord and we we will reflect I do not need rest gentlemen I need to know whether I am among enemies or friends Friends my lord friends Well then tell me at once what you want that I may see if any arrangement be possible Speak Comte de la Fere My lord replied Athos for myself I have nothing to demand For France were I to specify my wishes I should have too much I beg you to excuse me and propose to the chevalier And Athos bowing retired and remained leaning against the mantelpiece a spectator of the scene Speak then chevalier said the cardinal What do you want Nothing ambiguous if you please Be clear short and precise As for me replied Aramis I have in my pocket the very programme of the conditions which the deputation of which I formed one went yesterday to Saint Germain to impose on you Let us consider first the ancient rights The demands in that programme must be granted We were almost agreed on those replied Mazarin let us pass on to private and personal stipulations You suppose then that there are some said Aramis smiling I do not suppose that you will all be quite so disinterested as Monsieur de la Fere replied the cardinal bowing to Athos My lord you are right and I am glad to see that you do justice to the count at last The count has a mind above vulgar desires and earthly passions He is a proud soul he is a man by himself You are right he is worth us all and we avow it to you Aramis said Athos are you jesting No no dear friend I state only what we all know You are right it is not you alone this matter concerns but my lord and his unworthy servant myself Well then what do you require besides the general conditions before recited I require my lord that Normandy should be given to Madame de Longueville with five hundred thousand francs and full absolution I require that his majesty should deign to be godfather to the child she has just borne and that my lord after having been present at the christening should go to proffer his homage to our Holy Father the Pope That is you wish me to lay aside my ministerial functions to quit France and be an exile I wish his eminence to become pope on the first opportunity allowing me then the right of demanding full indulgences for myself and my friends Mazarin made a grimace which was quite indescribable and then turned to D Artagnan And you sir he said I my lord answered the Gascon I differ from Monsieur d Herblay entirely as to the last point though I agree with him on the first Far from wishing my lord to quit Paris I hope he will stay there and continue to be prime minister as he is a great statesman I shall try also to help him to down the Fronde but on one condition that he sometimes remembers the king s faithful servants and gives the first vacant company of musketeers to a man that I could name And you Monsieur du Vallon Yes you sir Speak if you please said Mazarin As for me answered Porthos I wish my lord cardinal in order to do honor to my house which gives him an asylum would in remembrance of this adventure erect my estate into a barony with a promise to confer that order on one of my particular friends whenever his majesty next creates peers You know sir that before receiving the order one must submit proofs My friends will submit them Besides should it be necessary monseigneur will show him how that formality may be avoided Mazarin bit his lips the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly All this appears to me to be ill conceived disjointed gentlemen for if I satisfy some I shall displease others If I stay in Paris I cannot go to Rome if I became pope I could not continue to be prime minister and it is only by continuing prime minister that I can make Monsieur d Artagnan a captain and Monsieur du Vallon a baron True said Aramis so as I am in a minority I withdraw my proposition so far as it relates to the voyage to Rome and monseigneur s resignation I am to remain minister then said Mazarin You remain minister that is understood said D Artagnan France needs you And I desist from my pretensions said Aramis His eminence will continue to be prime minister and her majesty s favorite if he will grant to me and my friends what we demand for France and for ourselves Occupy yourselves with your own affairs gentlemen and let France settle matters as she will with me resumed Mazarin Ho ho replied Aramis The Frondeurs will have a treaty and your eminence must sign it before us promising at the same time to obtain the queen s consent to it I can answer only for myself said Mazarin I cannot answer for the queen Suppose her majesty refuses Oh said D Artagnan monseigneur knows very well that her majesty refuses him nothing Here monseigneur said Aramis is the treaty proposed by the deputation of Frondeurs Will your eminence please read and examine I am acquainted with it Sign it then Reflect gentlemen that a signature given under circumstances like the present might be regarded as extorted by violence Monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely given Suppose I refuse Then said D Artagnan your eminence must expect the consequences of a refusal Would you dare to touch a cardinal You have dared my lord to imprison her majesty s musketeers The queen will revenge me gentlemen I do not think so although inclination might lead her to do so but we shall take your eminence to Paris and the Parisians will defend us How uneasy they must be at this moment at Rueil and Saint Germain said Aramis How they must be asking Where is the cardinal What has become of the minister Where has the favorite gone How they must be looking for monseigneur in all corners What comments must be made and if the Fronde knows that monseigneur has disappeared how the Fronde must triumph It is frightful murmured Mazarin Sign the treaty then monseigneur said Aramis Suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it Ah nonsense cried D Artagnan I can manage so that her majesty will receive me well I know an excellent method What I shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are exhausted And then asked Mazarin turning pale When I see her majesty embarrassed I shall conduct her to Rueil make her enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a box Enough sir muttered the cardinal you have said enough where is the treaty Here it is replied Aramis Sign my lord and he gave him a pen Mazarin arose walked some moments thoughtful but not dejected And when I have signed he said what is to be my guarantee My word of honor sir said Athos Mazarin started turned toward the Comte de la Fere and looking for an instant at that grand and honest countenance took the pen It is sufficient count he said and signed the treaty And now Monsieur d Artagnan he said prepare to set off for Saint Germain and take a letter from me to the queen eighty eight Shows how with Threat and Pen more is effected than by the Sword D Artagnan knew his part well he was aware that opportunity has a forelock only for him who will take it and he was not a man to let it go by him without seizing it He soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to Chantilly so that he might be in Paris in five or six hours But before setting out he reflected that for a lad of intelligence and experience he was in a singular predicament since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving certainty behind him In fact he said as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous mission Athos for generosity is a hero of romance Porthos has an excellent disposition but is easily influenced Aramis has a hieroglyphic countenance always illegible What will come out of those three elements when I am no longer present to combine them The deliverance of the cardinal perhaps Now the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of Hercules were pygmean He went to find Aramis You my dear Chevalier d Herblay he said are the Fronde incarnate Mistrust Athos therefore who will not prosecute the affairs of any one even his own Mistrust Porthos especially who to please the count whom he regards as God on earth will assist him in contriving Mazarin s escape if Mazarin has the wit to weep or play the chivalric Aramis smiled his smile was at once cunning and resolute Fear nothing he said I have my conditions to impose My private ambition tends only to the profit of him who has justice on his side Good thought D Artagnan in this direction I am satisfied He pressed Aramis s hand and went in search of Porthos Friend he said you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune that at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our labours it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow yourself to be controlled by Aramis whose cunning you know a cunning which we may say between ourselves is not always without egotism or by Athos a noble and disinterested man but blase who desiring nothing further for himself doesn t sympathize with the desires of others What should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let Mazarin go Why I should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so easily Bravo Porthos and you would be right my friend for in losing him you would lose your barony which you have in your grasp to say nothing of the fact that were he once out of this Mazarin would have you hanged Do you think so I am sure of it Then I would kill him rather than let him go And you would act rightly There is no question you understand provided we secure our own interests of securing those of the Frondeurs who besides don t understand political matters as we old soldiers do Never fear dear friend said Porthos I shall see you through the window as you mount your horse I shall follow you with my eyes as long as you are in sight then I shall place myself at the cardinal s door a door with glass windows I shall see everything and at the least suspicious sign I shall begin to exterminate Bravo thought D Artagnan on this side I think the cardinal will be well guarded He pressed the hand of the lord of Pierrefonds and went in search of Athos My dear Athos he said I am going away I have only one thing to say to you You know Anne of Austria the captivity of Mazarin alone guarantees my life if you let him go I am a dead man I needed nothing less than that consideration my dear D Artagnan to persuade myself to adopt the role of jailer I give you my word that you will find the cardinal where you leave him This reassures me more than all the royal signatures thought D Artagnan Now that I have the word of Athos I can set out D Artagnan started alone on his journey without other escort than his sword and with a simple passport from Mazarin to secure his admission to the queen s presence Six hours after he left Pierrefonds he was at Saint Germain The disappearance of Mazarin was not as yet generally known Anne of Austria was informed of it and concealed her uneasiness from every one In the chamber of D Artagnan and Porthos the two soldiers had been found bound and gagged On recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they could of course tell nothing but what they knew that they had been seized stripped and bound But as to what had been done by Porthos and D Artagnan afterward they were as ignorant as all the inhabitants of the chateau Bernouin alone knew a little more than the others Bernouin seeing that his master did not return and hearing the stroke of midnight had made an examination of the orangery The first door barricaded with furniture had aroused in him certain suspicions but without communicating his suspicions to any one he had patiently worked his way into the midst of all that confusion Then he came to the corridor all the doors of which he found open so too was the door of Athos s chamber and that of the park From the latter point it was easy to follow tracks on the snow He saw that these tracks tended toward the wall on the other side he found similar tracks then footprints of horses and then signs of a troop of cavalry which had moved away in the direction of Enghien He could no longer cherish any doubt that the cardinal had been carried off by the three prisoners since the prisoners had disappeared at the same time and he had hastened to Saint Germain to warn the queen of that disappearance Anne had enforced the utmost secrecy and had disclosed the event to no one except the Prince de Conde who had sent five or six hundred horsemen into the environs of Saint Germain with orders to bring in any suspicious person who was going away from Rueil in whatsoever direction it might be Now since D Artagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen since he was alone since he was not going away from Rueil and was going to Saint Germain no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any way On entering the courtyard of the old chateau the first person seen by our ambassador was Maitre Bernouin in person who standing on the threshold awaited news of his vanished master At the sight of D Artagnan who entered the courtyard on horseback Bernouin rubbed his eyes and thought he must be mistaken But D Artagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valet de chambre with a smile on his lips Monsieur d Artagnan cried the latter like a man who has the nightmare and talks in his sleep Monsieur d Artagnan Himself Monsieur Bernouin And why have you come here To bring news of Monsieur de Mazarin the freshest news there is What has become of him then He is as well as you and I Nothing bad has happened to him then Absolutely nothing He felt the need of making a trip in the Ile de France and begged us the Comte de la Fere and Monsieur du Vallon to accompany him We were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that sort We set out last evening and here we are Here you are His eminence had something to communicate to her majesty something secret and private a mission that could be confided only to a sure man and so has sent me to Saint Germain And therefore my dear Monsieur Bernouin if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master announce to her majesty that I have come and tell her with what purpose Whether he spoke seriously or in jest since it was evident that under existing circumstances D Artagnan was the only man who could relieve the queen s uneasiness Bernouin went without hesitation to announce to her this strange embassy and as he had foreseen the queen gave orders to introduce Monsieur d Artagnan at once D Artagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect and having fallen on his knees presented to her the cardinal s letter It was however merely a letter of introduction The queen read it recognized the writing and since there were no details in it of what had occurred asked for particulars D Artagnan related everything with that simple and ingenuous air which he knew how to assume on occasions The queen as he went on looked at him with increasing astonishment She could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish him How sir she cried as D Artagnan finished you dare to tell me the details of your crime to give me an account of your treason Pardon madame but I think that either I have expressed myself badly or your majesty has imperfectly understood me There is here no question of crime or treason Monsieur de Mazarin held us in prison Monsieur du Vallon and myself because we could not believe that he had sent us to England to quietly look on while they cut off the head of Charles I brother in law of the late king your husband the consort of Madame Henrietta your sister and your guest and because we did all that we could do to save the life of the royal martyr We were then convinced my friend and I that there was some error of which we were the victims and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and ourselves Now that an explanation may bear fruit it is necessary that it should be quietly conducted far from noise and interruption We have therefore taken away monsieur le cardinal to my friend s chateau and there we have come to an understanding Well madame it proved to be as we had supposed there was a mistake Monsieur de Mazarin had thought that we had rendered service to General Cromwell instead of King Charles which would have been a disgrace rebounding from us to him and from him to your majesty a dishonor which would have tainted the royalty of your illustrious son We were able to prove the contrary and that proof we are ready to give to your majesty calling in support of it the august widow weeping in the Louvre where your royal munificence has provided for her a home That proof satisfied him so completely that as a sign of satisfaction he has sent me as your majesty may see to consider with you what reparation should be made to gentlemen unjustly treated and wrongfully persecuted I listen to you and I wonder at you sir said the queen In fact I have rarely seen such excess of impudence Your majesty on your side said D Artagnan is as much mistaken as to our intentions as the Cardinal Mazarin has always been You are in error sir answered the queen I am so little mistaken that in ten minutes you shall be arrested and in an hour I shall set off at the head of my army to release my minister I am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence first because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous results Before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be dead and indeed so convinced is he of this that he entreated me should I find your majesty disposed to act in this way to do all I could to induce you to change your resolution Well then I will content myself with arresting you Madame the possibility of my arrest has been foreseen and should I not have returned by to morrow at a certain hour the next day the cardinal will be brought to Paris and delivered to the parliament It is evident sir that your position has kept you out of relation to men and affairs otherwise you would know that since we left Paris monsieur le cardinal has returned thither five or six times that he has there met De Beaufort De Bouillon the coadjutor and D Elbeuf and that not one of them had any desire to arrest him Your pardon madame I know all that And therefore my friends will conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to De Beaufort nor to De Bouillon nor to the coadjutor nor to D Elbeuf These gentlemen wage war on private account and in buying them up by granting them what they wished monsieur le cardinal has made a good bargain He will be delivered to the parliament members of which can of course be bought but even Monsieur de Mazarin is not rich enough to buy the whole body I think returned Anne of Austria fixing upon him a glance which in any woman s face would have expressed disdain but in a queen s spread terror to those she looked upon nay I perceive you dare to threaten the mother of your sovereign Madame replied D Artagnan I threaten simply and solely because I am obliged to do so Believe me madame as true a thing as it is that a heart beats in this bosom a heart devoted to you believe that you have been the idol of our lives that we have as you well know good Heaven risked our lives twenty times for your majesty Have you then madame no compassion for your servants who for twenty years have vegetated in obscurity without betraying in a single sigh the solemn and sacred secrets they have had the honor to share with you Look at me madame at me whom you accuse of speaking loud and threateningly What am I A poor officer without fortune without protection without a future unless the eye of my queen which I have sought so long rests on me for a moment Look at the Comte de la Fere a type of nobility a flower of chivalry He has taken part against his queen or rather against her minister He has not been unreasonably exacting it seems to me Look at Monsieur du Vallon that faithful soul that arm of steel who for twenty years has awaited the word from your lips which will make him in rank what he is in sentiment and in courage Consider in short your people who love you and who yet are famished who have no other wish than to bless you and who nevertheless no I am wrong your subjects madame will never curse you say one word to them and all will be ended peace succeed war joy tears and happiness to misfortune Anne of Austria looked with wonderment on the warlike countenance of D Artagnan which betrayed a singular expression of deep feeling Why did you not say all this before you took action sir she said Because madame it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you doubted that is that we still possess amongst us some valor and are worthy of some consideration at your hands And that valor would shrink from no undertaking according to what I see It has hesitated at nothing in the past why then should it be less daring in the future Then in case of my refusal this valor should a struggle occur will even go the length of carrying me off in the midst of my court to deliver me into the hands of the Fronde as you propose to deliver my minister We have not thought about it yet madame answered D Artagnan with that Gascon effrontery which had in him the appearance of naivete but if we four had resolved upon it we should do it most certainly I ought muttered Anne to herself by this time to remember that these men are giants Alas madame exclaimed D Artagnan this proves to me that not till to day has your majesty had a just idea of us Perhaps said Anne but that idea if at last I have it Your majesty will do us justice In doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar stamp You will see in me an ambassador worthy of the high interests he is authorized to discuss with his sovereign Where is the treaty Here it is Anne of Austria cast her eyes upon the treaty that D Artagnan presented to her I do not see here she said anything but general conditions the interests of the Prince de Conti or of the Ducs de Beaufort de Bouillon and d Elbeuf and of the coadjutor are herein consulted but with regard to yours We do ourselves justice madame even in assuming the high position that we have We do not think ourselves worthy to stand near such great names But you I presume have decided to assert your pretensions viva voce I believe you madame to be a great and powerful queen and that it will be unworthy of your power and greatness if you do not recompense the arms which will bring back his eminence to Saint Germain It is my intention so to do come let us hear you Speak He who has negotiated these matters forgive me if I begin by speaking of myself but I must claim that importance which has been given to me not assumed by me he who has arranged matters for the return of the cardinal ought it appears to me in order that his reward may not be unworthy of your majesty to be made commandant of the guards an appointment something like that of captain of the musketeers Tis the appointment Monsieur de Treville held you ask of me The place madame is vacant and although tis a year since Monsieur de Treville has left it it has not been filled But it is one of the principal military appointments in the king s household Monsieur de Treville was but a younger son of a simple Gascon family like me madame he occupied that post for twenty years You have an answer ready for everything replied the queen and she took from her bureau a document which she filled up and signed Undoubtedly madame said D Artagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office to morrow What more do you want asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own A hundred thousand francs for this poor captain of musketeers to be paid whenever his services shall no longer be acceptable to your majesty Anne hesitated To think of the Parisians soliloquized D Artagnan offering only the other day by an edict of the parliament six hundred thousand francs to any man soever who would deliver up the cardinal to them dead or alive if alive in order to hang him if dead to deny him the rites of Christian burial Come said Anne tis reasonable since you only ask from a queen the sixth of what the parliament has proposed and she signed an order for a hundred thousand francs Now then she said what next Madame my friend Du Vallon is rich and has therefore nothing in the way of fortune to desire but I think I remember that there was a question between him and Monsieur Mazarin as to making his estate a barony Nay it must have been a promise A country clown said Anne of Austria people will laugh Let them answered D Artagnan But I am sure of one thing that those who laugh at him in his presence will never laugh a second time Here goes the barony said the queen she signed a patent Now there remains the chevalier or the Abbe d Herblay as your majesty pleases Does he wish to be a bishop No madame something easier to grant What It is that the king should deign to stand godfather to the son of Madame de Longueville The queen smiled Monsieur de Longueville is of royal blood madame said D Artagnan Yes said the queen but his son His son madame must be since the husband of the son s mother is And your friend has nothing more to ask for Madame de Longueville No madame for I presume that the king standing godfather to him could do no less than present him with five hundred thousand francs giving his father also the government of Normandy As to the government of Normandy replied the queen I think I can promise but with regard to the present the cardinal is always telling me there is no more money in the royal coffers We shall search for some madame and I think we can find a little and if your majesty approves we will seek for some together What next What next madame Yes That is all Haven t you then a fourth companion Yes madame the Comte de la Fere What does he ask Nothing There is in the world then one man who having the power to ask asks nothing There is the Comte de la Fere madame The Comte de la Fere is not a man What is he then The Comte de la Fere is a demi god Has he not a son a young man a relative a nephew of whom Comminges spoke to me as being a brave boy and who with Monsieur de Chatillon brought the standards from Lens He has as your majesty has said a ward who is called the Vicomte de Bragelonne If that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say Perhaps he would accept Perhaps Yes if your majesty herself should beg him to accept He must be indeed a strange man Well we will reflect and perhaps we will beg him Are you satisfied sir There is one thing the queen has not signed her assent to the treaty Of what use to day I will sign it to morrow I can assure her majesty that if she does not sign to day she will not have time to sign to morrow Consent then I beg you madame to write at the bottom of this schedule which has been drawn up by Mazarin as you see I consent to ratify the treaty proposed by the Parisians Anne was caught she could not draw back she signed but scarcely had she done so when pride burst forth and she began to weep D Artagnan started on seeing these tears Since that period of history queens have shed tears like other women The Gascon shook his head these tears from royalty melted his heart Madame he said kneeling look upon the unhappy man at your feet He begs you to believe that at a gesture of your majesty everything will be possible to him He has faith in himself he has faith in his friends he wishes also to have faith in his queen And in proof that he fears nothing that he counts on nothing he will restore Monsieur de Mazarin to your majesty without conditions Behold madame here are the august signatures of your majesty s hand if you think you are right in giving them to me you shall do so but from this very moment you are free from any obligation to keep them And D Artagnan full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity placed in Anne s hands in a bundle the papers that he had one by one won from her with so much difficulty There are moments for if everything is not good everything in this world is not bad in which the most rigid and the coldest soul is softened by the tears of strong emotion heart arraigning sentiment one of these momentary impulses actuated Anne D Artagnan when he gave way to his own feelings which were in accordance with those of the queen had accomplished more than the most astute diplomacy could have attempted He was therefore instantly recompensed either for his address or for his sensibility whichever it might be termed You were right sir said Anne I misunderstood you There are the acts signed I deliver them to you without compulsion Go and bring me back the cardinal as soon as possible Madame faltered D Artagnan tis twenty years ago I have a good memory since I had the honor behind a piece of tapestry in the Hotel de Ville of kissing one of those lovely hands There is the other replied the queen and that the left hand should not be less liberal than the right she drew from her finger a diamond similar to the one formerly given to him take and keep this ring in remembrance of me Madame said D Artagnan rising I have only one thing more to wish which is that the next thing you ask from me shall be my life And with this conclusion a way peculiar to himself he rose and left the room I never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring from her presence and it is now too late for in a year the king will be of age In twenty four hours D Artagnan and Porthos conducted Mazarin to the queen and the one received his commission the other his patent of nobility On the same day the Treaty of Paris was signed and it was everywhere announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order to draw it up with the greatest care Here is what each of the parties concerned gained by that treaty Monsieur de Conti received Damvilliers and having made his proofs as general he succeeded in remaining a soldier instead of being made cardinal Moreover something had been said of a marriage with Mazarin s niece The idea was welcomed by the prince to whom it was of little importance whom he married so long as he married some one The Duc de Beaufort made his entrance at court receiving ample reparation for the wrongs he had suffered and all the honor due to his rank Full pardon was accorded to those who had aided in his escape He received also the office of admiral which had been held by his father the Duc de Vendome and an indemnity for his houses and castles demolished by the Parliament of Bretagne The Duc de Bouillon received domains of a value equal to that of his principality of Sedan and the title of prince granted to him and to those belonging to his house The Duc de Longueville gained the government of Pont de l Arche five hundred thousand francs for his wife and the honor of seeing her son held at the baptismal font by the young king and Henrietta of England Aramis stipulated that Bazin should officiate at that ceremony and that Planchet should furnish the christening sugar plums The Duc d Elbeuf obtained payment of certain sums due to his wife one hundred thousand francs for his eldest son and twenty five thousand for each of the three others The coadjutor alone obtained nothing They promised indeed to negotiate with the pope for a cardinal s hat for him but he knew how little reliance should be placed on such promises made by the queen and Mazarin Quite contrary to the lot of Monsieur de Conti unable to be cardinal he was obliged to remain a soldier And therefore when all Paris was rejoicing in the expected return of the king appointed for the next day Gondy alone in the midst of the general happiness was dissatisfied he sent for the two men whom he was wont to summon when in especially bad humor Those two men were the Count de Rochefort and the mendicant of Saint Eustache They came with their usual promptness and the coadjutor spent with them a part of the night eighty nine Difficult for Kings to return to the Capitals of their Kingdoms Whilst D Artagnan and Porthos were engaged in conducting the cardinal to Saint Germain Athos and Aramis returned to Paris Each had his own particular visit to make Aramis rushed to the Hotel de Ville where Madame de Longueville was sojourning The duchess loudly lamented the announcement of peace War had made her a queen peace brought her abdication She declared that she would never assent to the treaty and that she wished eternal war But when Aramis had presented that peace to her in a true light that is to say with all its advantages when he had pointed out to her in exchange for the precarious and contested royalty of Paris the viceroyalty of Font de l Arche in other words of all Normandy when he had rung in her ears the five hundred thousand francs promised by the cardinal when he had dazzled her eyes with the honor bestowed on her by the king in holding her child at the baptismal font Madame de Longueville contended no longer except as is the custom with pretty women to contend and defended herself only to surrender at last Aramis made a presence of believing in the reality of her opposition and was unwilling to deprive himself in his own view of the credit of her conversion Madame he said you have wished to conquer the prince your brother that is to say the greatest captain of the age and when women of genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it You have succeeded the prince is beaten since he can no longer fight Now attach him to our party Withdraw him gently from the queen whom he does not like from Mazarin whom he despises The Fronde is a comedy of which the first act only is played Let us wait for a denouement for the day when the prince thanks to you shall have turned against the court Madame de Longueville was persuaded This Frondist duchess trusted so confidently to the power of her fine eyes that she could not doubt their influence even over Monsieur de Conde and the chronicles of the time aver that her confidence was justified Athos on quitting Aramis went to Madame de Chevreuse Here was another frondeuse to persuade and she was even less open to conviction than her younger rival There had been no stipulation in her favor Monsieur de Chevreuse had not been appointed governor of a province and if the queen should consent to be godmother it could be only of her grandson or granddaughter At the first announcement of peace Madame de Chevreuse frowned and in spite of all the logic of Athos to show her that a prolonged war would have been impracticable contended in favor of hostilities My fair friend said Athos allow me to tell you that everybody is tired of war You will get yourself exiled as you did in the time of Louis XIII Believe me we have passed the time of success in intrigue and your fine eyes are not destined to be eclipsed by regretting Paris where there will always be two queens as long as you are there Oh cried the duchess I cannot make war alone but I can avenge myself on that ungrateful queen and most ambitious favorite on the honor of a duchess I will avenge myself Madame replied Athos do not injure the Vicomte de Bragelonne do not ruin his prospects Alas excuse my weakness There are moments when a man grows young again in his children The duchess smiled half tenderly half ironically Count she said you are I fear gained over to the court I suppose you have a blue ribbon in your pocket Yes madame I have that of the Garter which King Charles I gave me some days before he died Come I am growing an old woman said the duchess pensively Athos took her hand and kissed it She sighed as she looked at him Count she said Bragelonne must be a charming place You are a man of taste You have water woods flowers there She sighed again and leaned her charming head gracefully reclined on her hand still beautiful in form and color Madame exclaimed Athos what were you saying just now about growing old Never have I seen you look so young so beautiful The duchess shook her head Does Monsieur de Bragelonne remain in Paris she inquired What think you of it inquired Athos Leave him with me replied the duchess No madame if you have forgotten the history of Oedipus I at least remember it Really sir you are delightful and I should like to spend a month at Bragelonne Are you not afraid of making people envious of me duchess replied Athos No I shall go incognito count under the name of Marie Michon You are adorable madame But do not keep Raoul with you Why not Because he is in love He he is quite a child And tis a child he loves Athos became thoughtful You are right duchess This singular passion for a child of seven may some day make him very unhappy There is to be war in Flanders He shall go thither And at his return you will send him to me I will arm him against love Alas madame exclaimed Athos to day love is like war the breastplate is becoming useless Raoul entered at this moment he came to announce that the solemn entrance of the king queen and her ministers was to take place on the ensuing day The next day in fact at daybreak the court made preparations to quit Saint Germain Meanwhile the queen every hour had been sending for D Artagnan I hear she said that Paris is not quiet I am afraid for the king s safety place yourself close to the coach door on the right Reassure yourself madame I will answer for the king s safety As he left the queen s presence Bernouin summoned him to the cardinal Sir said Mazarin to him an emeute is spoken of in Paris I shall be on the king s left and as I am the chief person threatened remain at the coach door to the left Your eminence may be perfectly easy replied D Artagnan they will not touch a hair of your head Deuce take it he thought to himself how can I take care of both Ah plague on t I will guard the king and Porthos shall guard the cardinal This arrangement pleased every one The queen had confidence in the courage of D Artagnan which she knew and the cardinal in the strength of Porthos which he had experienced The royal procession set out for Paris Guitant and Comminges at the head of the guards marched first then came the royal carriage with D Artagnan on one side Porthos on the other then the musketeers for two and twenty years staunch friends of D Artagnan During twenty he had been lieutenant their captain since the night before The cortege proceeded to Notre Dame where a Te Deum was chanted All Paris were in the streets The Swiss were drawn up along the road but as the road was long they were placed at six or eight feet distant from each other and one deep only This force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with difficulty Whenever this occurred although it proceeded only from goodwill and a desire to see the king and queen Anne looked at D Artagnan anxiously Mazarin who had dispensed a thousand louis to make the people cry Long live Mazarin and who had accordingly no confidence in acclamations bought at twenty pistoles each kept one eye on Porthos but that gigantic body guard replied to the look with his great bass voice Be tranquil my lord and Mazarin became more and more composed At the Palais Royal the crowd which had flowed in from the adjacent street was still greater like an impetuous mob a wave of human beings came to meet the carriage and rolled tumultuously into the Rue Saint Honore When the procession reached the palace loud cries of Long live their majesties resounded Mazarin leaned out of the window One or two shouts of Long live the cardinal saluted his shadow but instantly hisses and yells stifled them remorselessly Mazarin turned pale and shrank back in the coach Low born fellows ejaculated Porthos D Artagnan said nothing but twirled his mustache with a peculiar gesture which showed that his fine Gascon humor was awake Anne of Austria bent down and whispered in the young king s ear Say something gracious to Monsieur d Artagnan my son The young king leaned toward the door I have not said good morning to you Monsieur d Artagnan he said nevertheless I have remarked you It was you who were behind my bed curtains that night the Parisians wished to see me asleep And if the king permits me returned the Gascon I shall be near him always when there is danger to be encountered Sir said Mazarin to Porthos what would you do if the crowd fell upon us Kill as many as I could my lord Hem brave as you are and strong as you are you could not kill them all Tis true answered Porthos rising on his saddle in order that he might appraise the immense crowd there are a lot of them I think I should like the other fellow better than this one said Mazarin to himself and he threw himself back in his carriage The queen and her minister more especially the latter had reason to feel anxious The crowd whilst preserving an appearance of respect and even of affection for the king and queen regent began to be tumultuous Reports were whispered about like certain sounds which announce as they whistle from wave to wave the coming storm and when they pass athwart a multitude presage an emeute D Artagnan turned toward the musketeers and made a sign imperceptible to the crowd but very easily understood by that chosen regiment the flower of the army The ranks closed firmly in and a kind of majestic tremor ran from man to man At the Barriere des Sergents the procession was obliged to stop Comminges left the head of the escort and went to the queen s carriage Anne questioned D Artagnan by a look He answered in the same language Proceed she said Comminges returned to his post An effort was made and the living barrier was violently broken through Some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the king as well as the minister Onward cried D Artagnan in a loud voice Onward cried Porthos But as if the multitude had waited only for this demonstration to burst out all the sentiments of hostility that possessed it exploded simultaneously Cries of Down with Mazarin Death to the cardinal resounded on all sides At the same time through the streets of Grenelle Saint Honore and Du Coq a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of Swiss guards and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of Porthos s horse and that of D Artagnan This new eruption was more dangerous than the others being composed of armed men It was plain that it was not the chance combination of those who had collected a number of the malcontents at the same spot but a concerted organized attack Each of these mobs was led by a chief one of whom appeared to belong not to the people but to the honorable corporation of mendicants and the other notwithstanding his affected imitation of the people might easily be discerned to be a gentleman Both were evidently stimulated by the same impulse There was a shock which was perceived even in the royal carriage Myriads of hoarse cries forming one vast uproar were heard mingled with guns firing Ho Musketeers cried D Artagnan The escort divided into two files One of them passed around to the right of the carriage the other to the left One went to support D Artagnan the other Porthos Then came a skirmish the more terrible because it had no definite object the more melancholy because those engaged in it knew not for whom they were fighting Like all popular movements the shock given by the rush of this mob was formidable The musketeers few in number not being able in the midst of this crowd to make their horses wheel around began to give way D Artagnan offered to lower the blinds of the royal carriage but the young king stretched out his arm saying No sir I wish to see everything If your majesty wishes to look out well then look replied D Artagnan And turning with that fury which made him so formidable he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents a man who with a huge sword in his hand was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the musketeers Make room cried D Artagnan Zounds give way At these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head but it was too late The blow was sped by D Artagnan the rapier had pierced his bosom Ah confound it cried the Gascon trying in vain too late to retract the thrust What the devil are you doing here count Accomplishing my destiny replied Rochefort falling on one knee I have already got up again after three stabs from you I shall never rise after this fourth Count said D Artagnan with some degree of emotion I struck without knowing that it was you I am sorry if you die that you should die with sentiments of hatred toward me Rochefort extended his hand to D Artagnan who took it The count wished to speak but a gush of blood stifled him He stiffened in the last convulsions of death and expired Back people cried D Artagnan your leader is dead you have no longer any business here Indeed as if De Rochefort had been the very soul of the attack the crowd who had followed and obeyed him took to flight on seeing him fall D Artagnan charged with a party of musketeers up the Rue du Coq and the portion of the mob he assailed disappeared like smoke dispersing near the Place Saint Germain l Auxerrois and taking the direction of the quays D Artagnan returned to help Porthos if Porthos needed help but Porthos for his part had done his work as conscientiously as D Artagnan The left of the carriage was as well cleared as the right and they drew up the blind of the window which Mazarin less heroic than the king had taken the precaution to lower Porthos looked very melancholy What a devil of a face you have Porthos and what a strange air for a victor But you answered Porthos seem to me agitated There s a reason Zounds I have just killed an old friend Indeed replied Porthos who That poor Count de Rochefort Well exactly like me I have just killed a man whose face is not unknown to me Unluckily I hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with blood And he said nothing as he died Yes he exclaimed Oh I suppose answered D Artagnan laughing if he only said that it did not enlighten you much Well sir cried the queen Madame the passage is quite clear and your majesty can continue your road In fact the procession arrived in safety at Notre Dame at the front gate of which all the clergy with the coadjutor at their head awaited the king the queen and the minister for whose happy return they chanted a Te Deum As the service was drawing to a close a boy entered the church in great excitement ran to the sacristy dressed himself quickly in the choir robes and cleaving thanks to that uniform the crowd that filled the temple approached Bazin who clad in his blue robe was standing gravely in his place at the entrance to the choir Bazin felt some one pulling his sleeve He lowered to earth his eyes beatifically raised to Heaven and recognized Friquet Well you rascal what is it How do you dare to disturb me in the exercise of my functions asked the beadle Monsieur Bazin said Friquet Monsieur Maillard you know who he is he gives holy water at Saint Eustache Well go on Well he received in the scrimmage a sword stroke on the head That great giant who was there gave it to him In that case said Bazin he must be pretty sick So sick that he is dying and he wants to confess to the coadjutor who they say has power to remit great sins And does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him To be sure the coadjutor has promised Who told you that Monsieur Maillard himself You have seen him then Certainly I was there when he fell What were you doing there I was shouting Down with Mazarin Death to the cardinal The Italian to the gallows Isn t that what you would have me shout Be quiet you rascal said Bazin looking uneasily around So that he told me that poor Monsieur Maillard Go find the coadjutor Friquet and if you bring him to me you shall be my heir Say then Father Bazin the heir of Monsieur Maillard the giver of holy water at Saint Eustache Hey I shall have nothing to do but to fold my arms All the same I should like to do him that service what do you say to it I will tell the coadjutor said Bazin In fact he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to him privately a few words to which the latter responded by an affirmative sign He then returned with the same slow step and said Go and tell the dying man that he must be patient Monseigneur will be with him in an hour Good said Friquet my fortune is made By the way said Bazin where was he carried To the tower Saint Jacques la Boucherie and delighted with the success of his embassy Friquet started off at the top of his speed When the Te Deum was over the coadjutor without stopping to change his priestly dress took his way toward that old tower which he knew so well He arrived in time Though sinking from moment to moment the wounded man was not yet dead The door was opened to the coadjutor of the room in which the mendicant was suffering A moment later Friquet went out carrying in his hand a large leather bag he opened it as soon as he was outside the chamber and to his great astonishment found it full of gold The mendicant had kept his word and made Friquet his heir Ah Mother Nanette cried Friquet suffocating ah Mother Nanette He could say no more but though he hadn t strength to speak he had enough for action He rushed headlong to the street and like the Greek from Marathon who fell in the square at Athens with his laurel in his hand Friquet reached Councillor Broussel s threshold and then fell exhausted scattering on the floor the louis disgorged by his leather bag Mother Nanette began by picking up the louis then she picked up Friquet In the meantime the cortege returned to the Palais Royal That Monsieur d Artagnan is a very brave man mother said the young king Yes my son and he rendered very important services to your father Treat him kindly therefore in the future Captain said the young king to D Artagnan on descending from the carriage the queen has charged me to invite you to dinner to day you and your friend the Baron du Vallon That was a great honor for D Artagnan and for Porthos Porthos was delighted and yet during the entire repast he seemed to be preoccupied What was the matter with you baron D Artagnan said to him as they descended the staircase of the Palais Royal You seemed at dinner to be anxious about something I was trying said Porthos to recall where I had seen that mendicant whom I must have killed And you couldn t remember No Well search my friend search and when you have found you will tell me will you not Pardieu said Porthos ninety Conclusion On going home the two friends found a letter from Athos who desired them to meet him at the Grand Charlemagne on the following day The friends went to bed early but neither of them slept When we arrive at the summit of our wishes success has usually the power to drive away sleep on the first night after the fulfilment of long cherished hopes The next day at the appointed hour they went to see Athos and found him and Aramis in traveling costume What cried Porthos are we all going away then I so have made my preparations this morning Oh heavens yes said Aramis There s nothing to do in Paris now there s no Fronde The Duchess de Longueville has invited me to pass a few days in Normandy and has deputed me while her son is being baptized to go and prepare her residence at Rouen after which if nothing new occurs I shall go and bury myself in my convent at Noisy le Sec And I said Athos am returning to Bragelonne You know dear D Artagnan I am nothing more than a good honest country gentleman Raoul has no fortune other than I possess poor child and I must take care of it for him since I only lend him my name And Raoul what shall you do with him I leave him with you my friend War has broken out in Flanders You shall take him with you there I am afraid that remaining at Blois would be dangerous to his youthful mind Take him and teach him to be as brave and loyal as you are yourself Then replied D Artagnan though I shall not have you Athos at all events I shall have that dear fair haired head by me and though he s but a boy yet since your soul lives again in him dear Athos I shall always fancy that you are near me sustaining and encouraging me The four friends embraced with tears in their eyes Then they departed without knowing whether they would ever see each other again D Artagnan returned to the Rue Tiquetonne with Porthos still possessed by the wish to find out who the man was that he had killed On arriving at the Hotel de la Chevrette they found the baron s equipage all really and Mousqueton on his saddle Come D Artagnan said Porthos bid adieu to your sword and go with me to Pierrefonds to Bracieux or to Du Vallon We will grow old together and talk of our companions No replied D Artagnan deuce take it the campaign is going to begin I wish to be there I expect to get something by it What do you expect to get Why I expect to be made Marechal of France Ha ha cried Porthos who was not completely taken in by D Artagnan s Gasconades Come my brother go with me added D Artagnan and I will see that you are made a duke No answered Porthos Mouston has no desire to fight besides they have erected a triumphal arch for me to enter my barony which will kill my neighbors with envy To that I can say nothing returned D Artagnan who knew the vanity of the new baron Then here s to our next merry meeting Adieu dear captain said Porthos I shall always be happy to welcome you to my barony Yes yes when the campaign is over replied the Gascon His honor s equipage is waiting said Mousqueton The two friends after a cordial pressure of the hands separated D Artagnan was standing at the door looking after Porthos with a mournful gaze when the baron after walking scarcely more than twenty paces returned stood still struck his forehead with his finger and exclaimed I recollect What inquired D Artagnan Who the beggar was that I killed Ah indeed and who was he Twas that low fellow Bonacieux And Porthos enchanted at having relieved his mind rejoined Mousqueton and they disappeared around an angle of the street D Artagnan stood for an instant mute pensive and motionless then as he went in he saw the fair Madeleine his hostess standing on the threshold Madeleine said the Gascon give me your apartment on the first floor now

of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected editions of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed Versions based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg org This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our
