none	none	should I be forced always to think of you as a long legged bird when even our mutual boss District Attorney William S Sanderson has the privilege of calling you what you are a bright and shining new penny I ve known Bill Sanderson since I was born the unseen lips informed him truculently even as the unseen fingers continued their fiercely staccato typing Ah That explains a lot Dundee conceded handsomely I just wondered amidst all this bonhommie of Bill and Penny why I I only call mister Sanderson Bill when I forget the small creature defended herself sharply Goodness knows I try to be an efficient private secretary And I could be a lot more efficient if lazy strangers didn t plump themselves down in our best visitors chair and try to flirt with me I don t flirt Do you hear I don t flirt with anybody Flirt with you you funny little Penny Dundee s voice was a little sad the voice of a man who finds himself grievously misunderstood I only want you to like me if you can and be a little nice to me for after all I Oh I know Penny Crain jerked the finished letter from her typewriter and spun about on her narrow backed swivel chair to face him I know you are mister James F Dundee Special Investigator attached to the office of the District Attorney and that you have a right to drive me crazy if you want to Crazy Dundee was genuinely amazed contrite I beg your pardon most humbly Miss Crain I ll go back to my cell Your office is almost as big and nice as this one Penny retorted but her sharp bright brown eyes really almost the color of a new penny softened until they took on a velvety depth Dundee did not fail to notice the softening nor did the little heart shaped face with its low widow s peak its straight short nose and its pointed little chin made almost childish by the deep cleft which cut through its obvious effort to look mature and determined fail to please him any more acutely than on the other days of the one short week he had been privileged at intervals to gaze upon it But the files and other things are in this office he told her his blue eyes twinkling happily once more Don t you dare touch my files again Penny cried springing to her feet and running toward the wall which was completely concealed by drawers cabinets and shelves filled with the records of which she was the proud custodian That s why I said just now that you were driving me crazy Thursday you took a whole folder of correspondence out of the letter files and put it back under the wrong initial I had to hunt for it for two hours with Bill I mean mister Sanderson gnawing his nails with impatience He thought I had filed it wrong and you might have made me lose my job Unconsciously her slightly husky contralto voice had sunk lower and trembled audibly I m awfully sorry I shan t touch your files again Miss Crain Oh go on and call me Penny she conceded impatiently What do you want now And you can get anything you need out of the files if you ll just put the folder in the bottom drawer of my desk so that I can file it myself correctly Thank you Penny Bonnie Dundee said gravely I d like awfully to have the complete transcript of The State versus Maginty mister Sanderson is determined to get a conviction where our former district attorney most ingloriously failed The new trial comes up in two weeks and he wants me to try to uncover a missing link of evidence I know she nodded and stretched her short slender body to pull down the two heavy volumes he required Without a by your leave Special Investigator Dundee resumed his comfortable seat and laid the first of the volumes open upon his knees But he did not seem to take a great deal of interest in the impanelling of jurors in the case of one Rufus Maginty who had won the temporary triumph of a hung jury under the handling of the state s case by District Attorney Sherwood deposed in November s election Rather his eyes followed the small brisk figure of Miss Penelope Crain as it moved about the room and his ears listened to the somehow charming though emphatic tapping of her French heels French heels Hadn t she been wearing sensible Cuban heeled Oxfords all other days of this first week of his attachment to the district attorney s office Cunning little thing for all her thorniness and her sharpness with him which he now saw that he had deserved Pretty too Damned pretty What color was that dress of hers Ummm let s see Chartreuse didn t they call it Chartreuse with big brown dots in it Bet it was sleeveless under that short little jacket of golden brown chiffon velvet By Jove and Dundee lapsed into one of the Englishisms he had picked up during his six months work in England as a tyro in the records department of Scotland Yard before he had come to Hamilton to make a humble beginning as a cub detective on the Homicide Squad

none	none	by Jove she was all dressed up for some reason or other Of course Because it s Saturday and you have the afternoon off Dundee finished his reverie aloud to the astonishment of the small person trying to reach a file drawer just a little too high for her I mean he hastened to explain that I ve just noticed how beautiful your costume is and found a reason for it There was sudden color in the creamy face The French heels tapped an angry progress across the big office and Penny sat down abruptly in her swivel chair reached across the immaculate desk snatched up a morning paper and tossed it without a glance in the general direction of her tormentor Page three column two first item she informed him ungraciously and then began to search with a funny sort of desperation for more work to consume her extraordinary energy Bonnie Dundee grinned indulgently as he opened The Hamilton Morning News and turned to the specified page and column Ah My old friend the society editress in her very best style he commented as he began to read aloud missus Juanita Selim new and charming member is entertaining the Forsyte Alumnae Bridge Club this afternoon luncheon to be served at the exclusive new Breakaway Inn on Sheridan Road I ve read it and I m busy so shut up Penny commanded as she gathered up pencils to sharpen Quite meekly Bonnie Dundee subsided into silent perusal of an item he was

none	none	could have no possible interest for himself in either a personal or professional capacity unless Penny s name was in it somewhere after which the jolly party of young matrons and maids will adjourn to missus Selim s delightful home in the Primrose Meadows Addition He chuckled and dared to interrupt the high importance of pointing up pencils I say
1845_145083_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 that s funny 
none	none	isn t it Primrose Meadows Addition I don t think it s funny Penny retorted coldly It so happens that my mother named it that my father went into bankruptcy trying to make a go of it and that missus Selim s delightful home was built to be our home and in which we were fortunate enough to live only two months before the crash came Oh Dundee groaned Penny Penny I m dreadfully sorry Shut up she ordered but her voice was huskier than ever with tears Dundee s now thoroughly interested eyes raced down the absurdly written paragraphs Although not an alumna of that famous and select school for girls Forsyte on the Hudson graduation from which places any Hamilton girl in the very inner circle of Hamilton society missus Selim has been closely identified with the school having for the past two years directed and staged Forsyte s annual play which ushers in the Easter vacation Indeed it was missus Selim s remarkable success with this year s play which caused missus Peter Dunlap long interested in a Little Theater for Hamilton to induce the beautiful and charming young directress to come to Hamilton with her Plans for the Little Theater are growing apace and it is safe to conjecture that not all the conversation flying thick and fast about Nita s bridge tables this afternoon will be concerned with contract conventions scores and finesses which failed Lovely Nita was elected to membership a fortnight ago when a vacancy occurred due to the resignation of Miss Alice Humphrey who has gone abroad for a year s study in the Sorbonne The two table club now includes Mesdames Hugo Marshall Tracey A Miles Peter Dunlap John C Drake Juanita Selim and Misses Polly Beale Janet Raymond and Penelope Crain Dundee lowered the paper and stared at the profile of District Attorney Sanderson s private secretary So she was a society girl a Forsyte girl Was that the reason perhaps why she had been so thorny with him a mere dick Well he wasn t just a dick any longer He was a Special Investigator A society girl playing at work But there was more and he read on As is well known the girls have their hen fight bridge luncheon every Saturday afternoon from the first of October to the first of June and a bridge dinner in which mere men are graciously included every other Wednesday evening during the season mister and missus Tracey A Miles are scheduled as next Wednesday s host and hostess I take off my hat to your society editress Dundee commented with false cheerfulness when he had laid the paper back upon Penny s desk She makes half a column of this one item in what must be a meager Saturday bunch of Society Notes then writes it all over again in the past tense for an equally meager Monday column Like bridge Miss Crain Penny snatched up the paper and crushed it into her wastebasket I do And I like my old friends even if I am not able financially to keep up with them If that s why you ve suddenly decided to stop being comrades Please forgive me again Penny he begged gently I was born into that crowd and I still belong to it because all of them are my real friends but get this into your thick Scotch Irish head mister Dundee I m working because I have to and and because I love it too and because I want to earn enough before I m many years older to give Mother some of the things she s missing so dreadfully since since my father failed and and ran away Ran away Dundee echoed incredulously How could any man desert a daughter like this Yes Ran away she repeated fiercely I might as well tell you myself Plenty of others will be willing to as soon as they know you are my friend As I told you my father her voice broke my father went bankrupt but before the courts knew it he had sent some securities to a to a woman in New York and when he left us he went to her because he left Mother a note saying so His defrauded creditors here have tried to to catch him but they haven t yet Very gently Bonnie Dundee took the small hand that was distractedly rumpling the brown waves which swept back from the widow s peak It lay fluttering in his bigger palm for a moment then snatched itself away I won t have you feeling sorry for me she cried angrily Who owns your the Primrose Meadows house now missus Selim he asked The lovely Nita Her voice was scornful No She rents it from Judge Hugo Marshall or is supposed to pay him rent she added with a trace of malice Hugo is an old darling but he is fearfully weak where pretty women are concerned Nita Selim had known Hugo in New York somehow and as soon as Lois missus Dunlap I mean had got Nita off the train the stranger in our midst hied herself to Hugo s office and he s been tagging after her ever since Though most of the men in our crowd are as bad as or worse than poor old Hugo How Karen keeps on looking so blissfully happy Karen Dundee interrupted missus Hugo Marshall she explained impatiently Karen Plummer made her debut a year ago this last winter a darling of a girl Judge Marshall retired judge you know had been proposing to the prettiest girl in each season s crop of debs for the last twenty years and Hugo must have been the most nonplussed perennial bachelor who ever led a grand march when Karen snapped him up Loved him actually And it seems to have worked out marvelously A baby boy three months old she concluded in her laconic style Then ashamed I don t know why I m gossiping like this Because you can t find another blessed scrap of work to do you little efficiency fiend Dundee laughed Come on Gossip some more My Maginty case will wait till afternoon to be mulled over while you re losing your hard earned salary at bridge with rich women We don t play for high stakes she corrected him Just a twentieth of a cent a point though contract can run into money even at that The winnings all go to the Forsyte Scholarship Fund On Wednesday evenings the crowd plays for higher stakes a tenth and winners keepers Therefore I can t afford to go unless I sink so low as to let my escort pay my losses which I sometimes do she confessed her brown head low for a moment Is this missus Peter Dunlap a deep bosomed club woman who starts Movements he asked more to bring her out of her depression than anything else Bigger and Better Babies Movements and Homes for Fallen Girls and Little Theater Movements The brown head flung itself up sharply and the brown eyes hardened into bright pennies again Lois Dunlap is the sweetest finest most comfortable woman in Hamilton and I adore her as does everyone else Peter Dunlap hardly more than the rest of us She is interested in a Little Theater for Hamilton but she won t manage it That s why she got hold of Nita Selim Lois will simply put up barrels of money without missing them and give a grand job to a little Broadway gold digger Funny thing is she really delights in Nita Thinks she s sweet and has never had a real chance And what do you think Dundee asked softly Oh I suppose I m a cat but I can see through her so clearly Not that she s bad she s simply an opportunist She s awfully sweet and deferential and frank with women but with men well she simply tucks her head so that her shoulder length black curls fall forward enchantingly gives them one wistful smile out of her big eyes that are like black pansies and the clink of slave chains Now go on and think I m catty which I suppose I am Bonnie Dundee grinned at her reassuringly Not for him to explain that practically all women and many men found themselves gossiping when he led them on adroitly for reasons of his own Which of course helped make him the excellent detective he was So all the men in your crowd have fallen for Nita Selim have they Practically all in varying degrees except Peter Dunlap who has never looked at another woman since he was lucky enough to get Lois and Clive Hammond who s engaged to Polly Beale Penny answered reluctantly her color high Including your young man I haven t a young man in the sense of being engaged Penny retorted then added honestly I have been letting Ralph Hammond that s Clive s brother you know take me about a good deal Ralph and Clive have plenty of money she defended herself hastily They are architects Clive being the head of the firm and Ralph who hasn t been out of college so very long a junior partner It was the Hammond firm that drew up the plans for Dad s I mean my father s Primrose Meadows Addition houses He had our house built as a sort of show place you know so that prospective builders out there could see how artistic a home could be put up for a moderate sum of money But he didn t quite finish even that left half the gabled top story unfinished and Nita has been teasing Hugo to finish it up for her It looks she added with a shrug as if Nita will get what she wants as usual And Ralph has acquired a set of slave chains Dundee suggested with just the slightest note of sympathy And how Penny assured him grimly A simile as out of date as my clothes are going to be if I don t get some new ones soon Not that the crowd minds what I wear she added loyally I could dress up in a window drape And be just as charming as you are in that grand new party dress you have on now Dundee finished for her gallantly New Penny snorted and turned back to her desk in a futile effort to find something left undone Dundee ignored the rebuff How many suckers I mean how many gentlemen with moderate incomes actually built in Primrose Meadows You are inquisitive aren t you None Our house or rather the one Nita Selim is living in now is the only house on what used to be a big farm Why I was just wondering Dundee said softly almost absent mindedly why the lovely Nita chose so isolated a place in which to live when Hamilton has rather a large number of For Rent signs out just now By the way know what time it is now Twenty to one Get your hat on young woman I m going to drive you out to Breakaway Inn You re not I m going to take a bus One runs from the Square right past the Inn she told him firmly And just as firmly Dundee escorted her out of the almost deserted rather dirty old courthouse to where his brand new sports roadster bought on time was awaiting them in the parking space devoted to the motors of those who officially served Hamilton County I know why you want to drive me out to the Inn Penny told him suddenly as the proud owner maneuvered his car through Saturday noon traffic You want to see Nita Selim Clank Clank I can hear the padlocks snapping on the slave chains right now Meow Dundee retorted then grinned down at her with as much comradely affection as if they had been friends for years instead of for a couple of hours Is Nita very small he added Little enough to tuck herself under the arm of a man a lot shorter than you Penny assured him with curious vehemence And if Penelope Crain is no mean prophet that s exactly what she ll do within five minutes after she meets you just as she is wistfully inviting you to join the other men for the cocktail party which is scheduled to break up the bridge game at five thirty Then of course you ll be urged to join us all at the dinner dance at the Country Club tonight Will she Dundee pretended to be vastly intrigued which caused the remainder of the drive to be a rather silent one due to Penny s unresponsiveness Breakaway Inn was intensely Spanish in architecture and transplanted shrubbery but its stucco walls were of a rather more violent raspberry color than is considered quite esthetic in Spain or Mexico There s Lois Dunlap s car just driving up Penny cried her face softening with the adoration she had freely professed for her friend But it clouded again almost instantly And Nita Selim I suppose Nita was a little ashamed to drive up in her own Ford coupe As Dundee helped his new friend to alight his eyes were upon the two women being assisted by a uniformed chauffeur from Lois Dunlap s limousine In a moment the four were a laughing exclamatory group Oh what a tall grand man you ve got yourself Penny darling the tiny beautiful creature who could only be missus Selim cried out happily May I meet him I shouldn t let you Penny answered frankly but I will missus Selim mister Dundee And missus Dunlap mister Dundee How are you Lois And Peter and the brats All well Penny Petey s off on a week end fishing trip and not one of the brats has measles scarlet fever or hay fever thank God Dundee heard missus Dunlap say in the comfortable affectionate voice that went with her comfortable pleasant face and body Nice woman But his eyes were of necessity upon Nita Selim for that miniature Venus was as Penny had predicted almost tucked under his arm by this time her black pansy eyes wide and wistful her soft black curls falling forward as she coaxed You ll come to the cocktail party at my house at five thirty won t you mister Dundee Afraid I can t make it Dundee smiled down at her I m a busy man missus Selim You see I m Special Investigator attached to the District Attorney s office he explained very deliberately O o oh Nita Selim breathed Than step by step she withdrew so that he was no longer submitted to the temptation to put his arm about her too intriguing little body And as she retreated Dundee s keen eyes noted a hardening of the black pansy eyes the sudden throbbing of a pulse in her very white neck No don t mind about calling for me Penny protested a moment later Ralph has already volunteered Thanks awfully As Dundee backed out of the driveway his last glance was for a very small figure in a brown silk summer coat and palest yellow chiffon frock slowly rejoining Penelope Crain and Lois Dunlap What the devil had frightened her so For she had been almost terrified Of course she might be one of those silly women who shudder at the sight of a detective because they ve smuggled in a diamond from Paris or a bottle of Bacardi from Havana But long before his car made the distance back to the city Dundee had shrugged off the riddle and was concentrating on all the facts he knew regarding the Maginty case It was his first real assignment from Sanderson and he was determined to make good Four hours later he was interrupted in his careful reading of the trial of Rufus Maginty by the ringing of the telephone bell That made four times he had had to snap out the fact that District Attorney Sanderson was playing some well earned golf on the Country Club links Dundee reflected angrily as he picked up the receiver But the call was for Dundee himself and the voice on the other end of the wire was Penny Crain s although almost unrecognizable Speak more slowly Penny Dundee urged What s that again Good Lord You say that Nita Selim After a minute of listening and a promise of instant obedience Dundee hung up the receiver My God he said slowly blankly Of all things murder at bridge CHAPTER TWO As Special Investigator Dundee drove through the city of Hamilton at a speed of sixty miles an hour his way being cleared by traffic policemen warned by the shrill official siren which served him as a horn he had little time to think connectedly of the fact that Nita Selim had been murdered during a bridge game in her rented home in Primrose Meadows Even after the broad sleekness of Sheridan Road stretched before him he could do little more than try to realize the shock which had numbed him Lovely Nita as the society editor of The Morning News had called her was dead How why he did not know He had asked no details of Penny Crain Funny thorny little Penny Loyal little Penny Judge Marshall has telephoned Police Headquarters she had told him breathlessly over the telephone but I made him let me call you as soon as he had hung up I wanted our office to be in on this right from the first Beautiful seductive Nita Selim almost cuddling under his arm within three minutes of meeting him dead A vision of her black pansy eyes so wide and luminous and wistful as they had looked sideways and upward to his pleading for him to join her after bridge cocktail party nearly made him crash into a lumbering furniture van Those eyes were luminous no longer could never again snap the padlocks of slave chains upon any man as Penny had expressed it Dead And she had been so warmly alive even as she had retreated from him at his mention of the fact that he was attached to the office of the district attorney as a special investigator What had she feared then Was her death a payment for some recent or long standing crime Or had she simply been withdrawing from contamination with a flat foot No She had been afraid horribly afraid of some ulterior purpose behind his innocent courtesy in driving Penelope Crain to Breakaway Inn Well speculation now was idle he told himself as he noted that his speedometer had dropped from sixty to thirty in his preoccupation He speeded again but was soon forced to stop and ask his way into Primrose Meadows The vague directions of a farmer s son lost him nearly eight precious minutes during which his friend Captain Strawn of the Homicide Squad might be bungling things rather badly But at last he found the ornate pair of pillars spanned by the painted legend Primrose Meadows and drove through them into what soon became a rutted lane Almost a quarter of a mile from the entrance he found the isolated house unmistakable because of the line up of private cars parked before the short stretch of paved sidewalk and the added presence of police cars and motorcycles Dundee turned his own car into the driveway leading from the street along the right side of the house toward the two car garage in the rear Ahead of his roadster were two other cars and a glance toward the open garage showed that a Ford coupe was housed there As he was descending Captain Strawn s voice hailed him from an open window of the room nearest the garage Hello Bonnie Been expecting you Damnedest business you ever saw There s a door from this room onto the porch Hop up and come on in Dundee obeyed Driving in he had noted that a wide porch upheld by round white pillars stretched across the front of the gabled brick house and extended halfway along its right side past a room which was obviously a solarium with its continuous windows gay awnings and visible through the glittering panes orange and black wicker furniture It was easy to swing himself up to the floor of the porch Strawn flung open the door which led into the back room remarking with a grin Don t be afraid I m gumming up any fingerprints Carraway has already been over the room The Selim woman s bedroom he explained The room she was killed in You have been on the job Dundee complimented his former chief Sure Strawn acknowledged proudly Can t be too quick on our stumps when it s one of these high sassiety murders doctor Price will be here any minute now and my men have been all over the premises basement to attic Of course it was an outside job plain as the nose on your face and we haven t found a trace of the murderer Although missus Selim had taken the house furnished it was obvious that this big bedroom of hers was not exactly as the Crain family had left it A little too pretty a little too aggressively feminine with its chaise longue heaped with silk and lace pillows its superfluity of big and little lamps its bed draped with golden yellow taffeta its dressing table But he could not let critical eyes linger on the triple mirrored vanity dresser For on the bench before it sat a tiny figure the head bowed so low that some of the black curls had fallen into a large open bowl of powder She was no longer wearing the brown silk summer coat whose open front had given him a glimpse of pale yellow chiffon He saw the dress now a low cut sleeveless fluffy affair but he really had eyes only for the brownish red hole on the left side of the back of the bodice about halfway between shoulder and waist a waist so small he could have spanned it with his two hands including its band of fuchsia velvet ribbon There also had been a bow of fuchsia velvet ribbon on the lace and straw hat she had swung so charmingly less than five hours ago Shot through the heart I guess Strawn commented Took a good marksman to find her heart shooting her through the back Funny thing too Nobody heard the shot leastways none of that crowd penned up in the living room will admit they did They ll all hang together and lie like sixty to keep us from finding out anything that might point to one of their precious bunch But if a gun with a Maxim silencer was used as it must have been if that whole crew ain t lying the gunman musta been good because you can t sight with a Maxim screwed onto a rod you know Have your men found the gun Dundee asked Of course not or I d know whether it had a Maxim on it or not Strawn retorted My theory is he added impressively that somebody with a grudge against this dame hired a gunman to hang around till he got her dead to rights then plop and he imitated the soft thudding sound made by the discharge of a bullet from a gun equipped with a silencer Doesn t it seem rather strange that a professional gunman should have chosen such a time with men arriving in cars and the house full of women who might wander into this room at any minute to bump off his victim Dundee asked Well there ain t no other explanation Captain Strawn contended Outside of the fact that my men have gone over the whole house and grounds without finding the gun I ve got other evidence it was an outside job Look Dundee followed the Chief of the Homicide Squad to one of the two windows that looked out upon the driveway Both were open since the May day was exceptionally warm even for the Middle West The unscreened window from which he obediently leaned was almost directly in line with the vanity dressing table across the room Look See how them vines have been torn Strawn directed pointing to a rambler rose which hugged the outside frame of the window And look hard enough at the flower bed down below and you ll see his footprints Of course we ve measured them and Cain as you see is guarding them till my man comes to make plaster casts of them Yes sir he hoisted himself up to the window ledge aimed as best he could then slipped down and beat it across the meadow Then Dundee began slowly I wonder why missus Selim didn t see that figure crouched in the window since she must have been powdering her face and looking into the middle of the three mirrors the one which reflects this very window How do you know she was powdering her face not looking for something in a drawer Strawn demanded truculently For three reasons Dundee answered almost apologetically First her powder puff as I m sure you noticed is still clutched in her right hand second there is no drawer open and no drawer was open unless someone has closed it since the murder whereas on the other hand her powder box is open third the left side of her face is unevenly coated with powder while the other is heavily but evenly powdered Therefore I can t see why she didn t scream or turn around when she heard your gunman clambering up to her window or even when he had crouched in it I don t see how she could help seeing him Well what do you think Strawn asked sourly after he had tested the visibility of the window from the dressing table mirror I m afraid Captain Strawn that there are only two explanations possible The first of course is that Nita Selim was quite deaf or very nearsighted I happen to know from having met her today You met her today Strawn interrupted incredulously Dundee explained briefly then went on As I was saying I have good reason to know she was not deaf but I can t say as to her being nearsighted except that it is my observation that people who are extremely nearsighted do not have very wide eyes and no creases between the brows I am fairly sure she did not wear glasses at all because glasses worn even a few hours a day leave a mark across the nose or show pinched red spots on each side of the bridge of the nose You must have had a good hard look at her Strawn gibed his grey eyes twinkling and his harsh thin lipped mouth pulling down at one corner in what he thought was a genial smile I did Dundee retorted Well conceding that she was neither deaf nor half blind she would necessarily have heard and seen her assailant before he shot her What s the other explanation Strawn was becoming impatient That the person who killed her was so well known to her and his or her presence in this room so natural a thing that she paid no attention to his or her movements and was concentrating on the job of powdering her very pretty face You mean one of that gang of society folks in there and Strawn jerked a thumb toward the left side of the house Very probably Dundee agreed But where s the gun Strawn argued I tell you my men This was a premeditated murder of course Dundee interrupted The Maxim silencer unless they are all lying about not hearing a shot proves that Silencers are damned hard to get hold of but people with plenty of money can manage most things And since the murder was premeditated it is better to count on the fact that the murderer or murderess had planned a pretty safe hiding place for the gun and the silencer Oh not necessarily in the house or even near the house he hastened to assure Strawn who was trying to break in By the way how long after missus Selim was killed was her death discovered Or do you know I haven t been able to get much out of that bunch in there not even out of Penelope Crain who ought to be willing to help seeing as how she works for the district attorney But I guess she s waiting to spill it all to you if she knows anything so you and Sanderson will get all the credit Now look here chief Dundee protested laying a hand on Strawn s shoulder as he reverted to the name by which he had addressed the head of the Homicide Squad for nearly a year we re going to be friends aren t we Same as always We know pretty well how to work together don t we No use to begin pulling against each other Guess so Strawn growled but he was obviously pleased and relieved Maybe you d better have a crack at that crowd yourself I hear Doc Price s car always has a bum spark plug I ll stick around with him until he gets going good on his job then if you ll excuse me for butting in I ll join your party in the living room And good luck to you Bonnie Dundee took the door he knew must lead into the central hall but found himself in an enclosed section of it a small foyer between the main hall and Nita Selim s bedroom There was room for a telephone table and its chair as well as for a small sofa large enough for two to sit upon comfortably He paused to open the door across from the telephone table and found that it opened into a closet whose hangers and hat forms now held the outdoor clothing belonging to Nita s guests Nice clothes the smart but unostentatious hats and coats of moneyed people of good taste he observed a little enviously before he opened the door which led into the main hall which bisected the main floor of the house until it reached Nita s room Another door in the section behind the staircase leading to the gabled second story next claimed his attention Opening it he discovered a beautifully fitted guests lavatory There was even a fully appointed dressing table for women s use so that none of her guests had had the slightest excuse to invade the privacy of missus Selim s bedroom and bath unless specifically invited to do so Rather a well planned house this Dundee concluded as he closed the door upon the green porcelain fixtures and walked slowly toward the wide archway that led from the hall into a large living room He had a curious reluctance to intrude upon that assembled and guarded company of Hamilton s real society They were all Penny s friends and Penny was his friend But his first swift all seeing glance about the room reassured him No hysterics here These people brought race and breeding even into the presence of death Whatever emotions had torn them when Nita Selim s body was discovered were almost unguessable now A stout short woman of about thirty was tapping a foot nervously as she talked to the man who was bending over her chair John C Drake that was Dundee had met him knew him to be a vice president of the Hamilton National Bank in charge of the trust department Penelope Crain was occupying half of a love seat with Lois Dunlap the hands of the girl and of the woman clinging together for mutual comfort That tall thin oldish man with the waxed grey mustache must be Judge Hugo Marshall and the pretty girl leaning trustingly against his shoulder must be his wife Karen Marshall who had jumped at her first proposal during her first season Yes well bred people he concluded as his eyes swept on and then stopped a little bewildered Who was that man He didn t belong somehow and his hands trembled visibly as he tried to light a cigarette Leaning not nonchalantly but actually for support against the brocaded coral silk drapes of a pair of wide long windows set in the east wall Suddenly Dundee had it Broadway This was no Hamiltonian no comfortably rich and socially secure Middle westerner Broadway in every line of his too well tailored clothes in the polished smoothness of his dark hair Why it s mister Dundee at last Penny cried turning in the S shaped seat before he had time to finish his mental inventory of the room s occupants She jumped to her feet and threaded a swift way over Oriental rugs and between the two bridge tables still occupying the center of the big room still cluttered with score pads tally cards and playing cards I ve been wondering if you had stopped to have dinner first she taunted him Then laying a hand on his arm she faced the living room eagerly This is mister Dundee folks special investigator attached to the district attorney s office and a grand detective He solved the Hogarth murder case you know and the Hillcrest murder And he s my friend so I want you all to trust him and tell him things without being afraid of him Then rather ceremoniously but swiftly she presented her friends Judge and missus Hugo Marshall mister and missus Tracey Miles mister and missus John C Drake missus Dunlap Janet Raymond Polly Beale Clive Hammond and At that point Penny hesitated then rather stiffly included the Broadway man as mister Dexter Sprague of New York Thank you Miss Crain Dundee said Now will you please tell me if you know whether all those invited to both the bridge party and the cocktail party are here Penny s face flamed Ralph Hammond Clive s brother hasn t come yet I I rather imagine I ve been stood up she confessed with a faint attempt at gayety And Ralph Hammond was the man who had once belonged rather exclusively to Penny and who according to her own confession had succumbed most completely to Nita Selim s charms Dundee noted filing the reflection for further reference Please mister Dundee won t you detain us as short a time as possible Lois Dunlap asked as she advanced toward him mister Dunlap is away on a fishing trip and I don t like to leave my three youngsters too long They are really too much of a handful for the governess over a period of hours I shall detain all of you no longer than is absolutely necessary Dundee told her gently but I am afraid I must warn you that I can t let you go home very soon unless one or more of you has something of vital importance to tell something which will clear up or materially help to clear up this bad business He paused a long half minute then asked curtly I am to conclude that no one has anything at all to volunteer 
1845_145088_000008_000001	train-clean-360	There was no answer 
none	none	other than a barely perceptible drawing together in self defence of the minds and hearts of those who had been friends for so long Very well Dundee conceded abruptly Then I must put all of you through a routine examination since every one of you is of course a possible suspect CHAPTER THREE Good by dinner groaned the plump blond little man who had been introduced as Tracey Miles as he sorrowfully patted his rather prominent stomach Don t worry darling begged the dark neurotic looking woman who was Flora Miles his wife I m sure mister Dundee will ask Lydia poor Nita s maid you know she explained in an aside to Dundee to prepare a light supper for us if he really needs to detain us long which I am sure he won t How can you think of food now Polly Beale the tall sturdy girl with an almost masculine bob and a quite masculine tweed suit demanded brusquely Her voice had an unfeminine lack of modulation but when Dundee saw her glance toward Clive Hammond he realized that she was wholly feminine where he was concerned at least Of course we are all dreadfully cut up over poor Nita s death gasped a rather pretty girl whose most distinguishing feature was her crop of crinkly light red hair I assume that to be true Miss Raymond Dundee answered But we must lose no more time getting at the facts Just when was missus Selim murdered At the brutal use of the word a shudder rippled over the small crowd Dexter Sprague of New York dropped his lighted cigarette where it would have burned a hole in a fine Persian rug if Sergeant Turner on guard over the room for Captain Strawn had not slouched from his corner to plant a big foot upon it We don t know exactly when it happened Penny volunteered We were playing bridge the last hand of the last rubber because the men were arriving for cocktails when Nita became dummy and went to her bedroom to To make herself pretty pretty for the men missus Drake mimicked then realizing the possible effect of her cattiness on Dundee she defended herself volubly Of course I liked Nita but she did think so terribly much about her effect on men and all that and was always fixing her make up and besides you can t suspect me because I was playing against Karen and Nita Thank you missus Drake Dundee cut in Does anyone know the exact time missus Selim left the room when she became dummy I can tell you because I had just arrived the first of the men to get here Tracey Miles volunteered obviously glad of the chance to talk a characteristic of the man Dundee decided I looked at my watch just after I stepped out of my car because I like to be on time to the dot and Nita missus Selim had said five thirty Well it was exactly five twenty five so I had five minutes to spare Yes Dundee speeded him up impatiently Well I came right into the hall and hung my hat in the closet out there and then came in here It must have been about five twenty seven by that time he explained with the meticulousness of a man on the witness stand I shouted Hello everybody How s tricks That s a joke you know How s tricks meaning tricks in bridge Yes yes Dundee admitted frowning but the rest of the company exchanged indulgent smiles and Flora Miles patted her husband s hand fondly Well Nita jumped up from the bridge table that one right there Miles pointed to the table nearer the arched doorway and she said Good heavens Is it half past five already I ve got to run and make myself pretty pretty for just such great big men as you Tracey Tracey darling Judge Marshall corrected with a chuckle that sounded odd in the tensely silent room Tracey Miles flushed a salmon pink and his wife s fingers clutched at his hand warningly Oh Nita called everybody darling and didn t mean anything by it I guess he explained uneasily Just one of her cute little ways Well anyway she came up to me and straightened my necktie another one of her funny little ways and said Tracey my own lamb won t you shake up the cocktails for poor little Nita You know a sort of way she had of coaxing people Yes I know Dundee agreed with a trace of a grin Go on as rapidly as you can please I thought you wanted to know everything Miles was a little peevish he had evidently been enjoying himself Of course I said I d make the cocktails she said everything was ready on the sideboard That s the dining room right behind this room he explained unnecessarily since the French doors were open Well Nita blew me a kiss from her fingertips and ran out of the room Now let s see he ruminated creasing his sunburned forehead beneath his carefully combed blond hair that must have been at exactly five thirty that she left the room I went on into the dining room and Lois I mean missus Dunlap came with me because she said she was simply dying for a caviar sandwich and a nip of of Of Scotch Tracey Lois Dunlap cut in grinning I m sure mister Dundee won t think I m a confirmed tippler so you might as well tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth Poor Tracey has a deadly fear that we are all going to lose the last shred of our reputations in this deplorable affair mister Dundee she added in a rather shaky version of the comfortable rich voice he had heard earlier in the day I m not going to pry into cellars Dundee assured her in the same spirit What else mister Miles Nothing much Tracey Miles confessed with apparent regret I was still mixing no I d begun to shake the cocktails when I heard a scream Whose scream Dundee demanded looking about the room and dismissing Miles thankfully It was I Judge Marshall s fair haired blue eyed little bride volunteered in a voice that threatened to rise to hysteria Tell me all about it Dundee urged gently Yes sir she quavered while her husband s arm encircled her shoulders in courtly fashion As Tracey told you Nita was dummy and I was declarer that is I got the bid and played the hand It it was quite an exciting end for me to the afternoon of bridge for I m not usually awfully lucky so when Penny had figured up the score because I m not good at arithmetic and I knew Nita and I had rolled up an awfully big score I jumped up and ran into her room to tell her the good news because she hadn t come back And and there she was all bowed over her dressing table and she she was was She was dead when you reached her Dundee assisted her Yes Karen Marshall answered faintly and turned to hide her face against her elderly husband s breast Dundee s swift eyes took in the varying degrees of whiteness and sick horror that claimed every face in the room as surely as if all present had not already heard Karen tell her story to Captain Strawn Tracey Miles looked as if he would have no immediate craving for his dinner and Judge Marshall s fine thin face no longer looked so well preserved as he prided himself that it did As for Dexter Sprague he almost folded up against the coral brocade draperies It was the women oddly enough who kept the better control over their emotions Of course you all rushed in when missus Marshall screamed he asked casually Twelve heads nodded mutely Did any or all of you touch the body or things in the room mister Sprague touched her hair and and lifted one of her hands Penny contributed quietly But you know how it must have been We can t any of us tell exactly every move we made but there was some rushing about The men mostly looking for for whoever did it missus Marshall did you see anyone anyone at all in or near that room when you entered it The white faced young wife lifted her head and looked at him dazedly with drowned blue eyes There wasn t anyone in in that room I know she faltered It felt horrible being in there with with her all alone But near the room In the main hall or in the little foyer where the telephone is Dundee persisted I don t think so I can t remember seeing anyone Oh Hugo and again she crouched against her husband who soothed her with trembling hands that looked incongruously old against her childish fair hair and face Where were the rest of you exactly where I mean Dundee demanded conscious that Captain Strawn had entered the room and was standing slightly behind him There was such a babel of answers given and then hastily corrected that Dundee broke in suddenly I want a connected story of the events leading up to the tragedy And I want someone to tell it who hasn t lost his or her head at all He looked about the company as if speculatively but his mind was already made up Miss Crain will you tell the story beginning with the moment I left you and missus Dunlap and missus Selim today Penny nodded miserably and was about to begin Just a minute before you begin Miss Crain Dundee requested I d like to make notes on your story and he drew from a coat pocket a shorthand book hastily filched from Penny s own tidy desk Yes he answered the girl s frank stare of amazement I can write shorthand of a sort and pretty fast at that though no other human being I am afraid could read it but myself As for you folks he addressed the uneasy silent group of men and women in dead Nita s living room I shall ask you not to interrupt Miss Crain unless you are very sure that her memory is at fault Penelope Crain was about to begin for the second time when again Dundee interrupted Another half second please On the first sheet of the new shorthand notebook Dundee scribbled Suggest you try to locate Ralph Hammond immediately Very much in love with missus Selim Invited to cocktail party did not show up Tearing the sheet from the notebook he passed it to Captain Strawn who read it frowning and then nodded Doc Price has done all he can here Strawn whispered huskily Wants to know if you d like to speak to him before he takes the body to the morgue Certainly Dundee answered as he grinned apologetically to the girl who was waiting white faced but patiently to tell the story of the afternoon Quickly suppressed shudders and low exclamations of horror followed him and the chief of the Homicide Squad from the room Well Bonnie boy we meet again for the usual reason old doctor Price greeted the district attorney s new special investigator Another shocking affair that A nice clean wound one of the neatest jobs I ever saw Shot entered the back and penetrated the heart Very nicely calculated If the bullet had struck a quarter of an inch higher it would have been deflected by the But the path of the bullet doctor Dundee broke in Have you made any calculations as to the place and distance at which the shot was fired Roughly speaking yes the coroner answered The gun was fired at a distance probably of ten or fifteen feet perhaps closer but I don t think so he amended meticulously As for the path of the bullet I have fixed it judging from the position of the body which I am assured had not been moved before my arrival as coming from a point somewhere along a straight line drawn from the wound with the body upright of course to here Dundee and Strawn followed the brisk little white haired old doctor across the bedroom to a window opening upon the drive the one nearest the door leading out upon the porch I ve marked the end of the line here doctor Price went on pointing to a faint pencil mark made upon the window frame the pale green strip of woodwork near the chaise longue which was set between the two windows I told you she was shot from the window Strawn reminded Dundee triumphantly You see doc it s my theory that the murderer climbed up to the sill of this window which was open as it is now crouched in it and shot her while she sat there powdering her face Not necessarily Captain not necessarily doctor Price deprecated I merely say that this pencil mark indicated the end of the line showing the path of the bullet Certainly she was not shot through the frame of the window but she might have been shot by anyone stationed just in front of it or anywhere along the line up to say within ten feet of the woman Now if that s all Captain I ll be getting this corpse into the morgue for an autopsy And I ll send you both a copy of my findings Just a minute doctor Price Dundee detained him How old would you say missus Selim was The little doctor pursed his wrinkled lips and considered for a moment eyeing the body stretched upon the chaise longue speculatively We ell between thirty and thirty four years old he answered finally Of course you understand that that estimate is unofficial and must remain so until I have completed the autopsy Dundee stared down at the upturned face of the dead woman with startled incredulity Between thirty and thirty four years old That tiny lovely But she was not quite so lovely in death in spite of the serenity it had brought to those once vivacious features Peering more closely he could see without those luminous wide eyes to center his attention numerous fine lines on the waxen face the slackness of a little pouch of soft flesh beneath her round chin an occasional white hair among the shoulder length dark curls Dundee sighed How easy it was for a beautiful woman to deceive men with a pair of wide velvety black eyes But he d bet the women had not been quite so thoroughly taken in by her cuddly childishness her odd mixture of demureness and youthful impudence Back in the living room whose occupants stopped whispering and grew taut with suspense Dundee seated himself at a little red lacquer table notebook spread while Strawn settled himself heavily in the nearest overstuffed armchair Now Miss Crain I am quite ready if you will forgive me for having kept you waiting In a very quiet voice slightly husky as always Penny began her story I think it lacked two or three minutes of one o clock when you drove away Nita Lois do you mind if I use the names I am most accustomed to Thank you and I went immediately into the lounge of Breakaway Inn where we found Carolyn Drake and Flora Miles waiting for us Nita soon left us to see about the arrangement of the table and while she was away the rest of the girls arrived Except a woman s voice broke in I was going to say all eight of us were ready for lunch except Polly Beale She hadn t come Penny went on her husky voice a little sharp with annoyance When Nita came to ask us into the private dining room one of the Inn s employees came and told her there was a call for her and showed her to the private booth in the lounge In a minute Nita returned and told us that Polly wasn t coming to the luncheon but would join us later for bridge here Why don t you tell him how funny Nita acted Janet Raymond prompted Penny flushed but she accepted the prompting I think any of us might have been a little annoyed she said steadily as if striving to be utterly truthful Nita told us she turned to Dundee whose pencil was flying that Polly had made no excuse at all in fact she quoted Polly exactly Sorry Nita Can t make it for lunch I ll show up at your place at two thirty for bridge Nita couldn t bear the least hint of being slighted Janet Raymond explained with a malicious gleam in her pale blue eyes If it hadn t been for Lois and Hugo Judge Marshall I mean Nita Selim would never have been included in any of our affairs and she knew it The Dunlaps can do anything they please because they re Please Janet Lois Dunlap cut in her usually placid voice becoming quite sharp You must know by this time that I make friends wherever I please and that I liked yes I was extremely fond of poor little Nita In fact I am forced to believe that of all the women she met in this town I was her only real friend There was a flush of anger on her lovably plain face as her grey eyes challenged first one and then another of the Forsyte girls One or two looked a little ashamed but there was not a single voice to contradict Lois Dunlap s flat assertion Will you please go on Pen Miss Crain Dundee urged but he had missed nothing of the little by play I wish you would call me Penny so I d feel more like a person than a witness Penny retorted thornily Where was I Oh yes Nita cooled right off when Lois reminded her that Polly was always abrupt like that and here Penny paused to grin apologetically at the girl with the masculine looking haircut and then we all went into the private dining room where Nita had ordered a perfectly gorgeous lunch with a heavenly centerpiece of green striped yellow orchids Well I don t suppose you re interested in what we ate and things like that she hesitated Was there anything unusual in the conversation anything like a quarrel Dundee prompted Oh no Penny protested Nothing happened out of the ordinary at all No wait Nita received a letter by messenger or rather a note when we were about half through luncheon There was a low strangled in the throat cry from someone Who had uttered it Dundee could not be sure since his eyes had been on his notebook But what had really interrupted Penny Crain was a crash CHAPTER FOUR Pardon Awfully sorry Clive Hammond muttered as he bent to pick up the fragments of a colored pottery ashtray which he and his fiancee Polly Beale had been sharing Don t worry about picking it up Polly commanded in her brusque voice but Dundee listening acutely was sure of a very slight pause between the two parts of her sentence He glanced at the couple the tall masculine looking girl lounging deep in an armchair Clive Hammond rather unusually good looking with his dark red hair brown eyes and a face and body as compactly and symmetrically designed as one of the buildings which had been pointed out to Dundee as the product of the young architect s genius now resuming his seat upon the arm of the chair His chief concern seemed to be for another ashtray which Sergeant Turner with a grin produced from one of the many little tables with which the room was provided Rather strange that those two should be engaged Dundee mused Go on Miss Crain the detective urged as if he were impatient of the delay About that note or letter It was in a blue grey envelope with printing or engraving in the upper left hand corner Penny went on half closing her eyes to recapture the scene in its entirety Like business firms use she amended I couldn t help seeing since I sat so near Nita She seemed startled or well maybe I d better say surprised and a little sore but she tore it open and read it at a glance almost which is why I say it must have been only a note But while she was reading it she frowned then smiled as if something had amused or or She smiled like any woman reading a love letter Carolyn Drake interrupted positively I myself was sure that one of her many admirers had broken an engagement but had signed himself With all my love darling your own So and so Dundee wondered if even Carolyn Drake s husband the carefully groomed and dignified John C Drake bank vice president had ever sent her such a note but he did not let his pencil slow down for Penny was talking again I think you are assuming a little too much Carolyn But let that pass At any rate Nita didn t say a word about the contents of the note and naturally no one asked a question She simply tucked it into the pocket of her silk summer coat which was draped over the back of her chair and the luncheon went on Then we all drove over here and found Polly waiting in her own coupe in the road in front of the house She told Nita she had rung the bell but the maid Lydia didn t answer so she had just waited Nita didn t seem surprised said she had a key if Lydia hadn t come back yet You see she interrupted herself to explain to Dundee Nita had already told us at luncheon that poor darling Lydia as she called her had had to go in to town to get an abscessed tooth extracted and was to wait in the dentist s office until she felt equal to driving herself home again in Nita s coupe Yes Nita had taken her in herself she answered the beginning of a question from Dundee At what time Dundee queried I don t know exactly but Nita said she d had to dash away at an ungodly hour so that Lydia could make her ten o clock dentist s appointment and so that she herself could get a manicure and a shampoo and have her hair dressed so I imagine she must have left not later than fifteen or twenty minutes to ten How did missus Selim get out to Breakaway Inn if she left her own car with the maid You saw her arrive with Lois Penny reminded him Nita had told us all about Lydia s dentist s appointment when she was at my house for dinner Wednesday night Lois Dunlap contributed I offered to call for her anywhere she said and take her out to Breakaway Inn in my car today I met her at her suggestion in the French hat salon of the shop where she got her shampoo and manicure Redmond s department store A large dinner party missus Dunlap Dundee asked Not large at all Just twelve of us the crowd here except for mister Sprague Penny and Janet Who was missus Selim s dinner partner Dundee asked That s right He isn t here Lois Dunlap corrected herself Ralph Hammond brought her and was her dinner partner Thank you Now Penny You were saying the maid had not returned Oh but she had Penny answered impatiently If I m going to be interrupted so much Well Nita rang the bell and Lydia came tying on her apron Nita kissed her on the cheek that wasn t swollen and asked her why she hadn t let Polly in And Lydia said she hadn t heard the bell because she had dropped asleep in her room in the basement dopey from the local anesthetic you know she explained to Dundee I see Dundee acknowledged and underlined heavily another note in his scrawled shorthand So Lydia took our hats and summer coats and put them in the hall closet and then followed Nita who was calling to her on into Nita s bedroom We thought she either wanted to give directions about the makings for the cocktails and the sandwiches or to console poor Lydia for the awful pain she had had at the dentist s so we didn t intrude We made a dive for the bridge tables found our places and were ready to play when Nita joined us Nita and Karen Just a minute Penny Did any of you then or later until missus Marshall discovered the tragedy go into missus Selim s bedroom There was no need for us to Penny told him There s a lavatory with a dressing table right behind the staircase I for one didn t go into Nita s room until after Karen screamed There was a chorus of similar denials on the part of every woman present At Dundee s significant pressing of the same question upon the men he was met with either laconic negatives or sharply indignant ones All right Penny Go ahead please I was going to tell you how we were seated for bridge if that interests you Penny said rather tartly It interests me intensely Dundee assured her smiling Then it was this way began Penny thawing instantly Karen and Nita Carolyn and I were at this table and she pointed to the table nearer the hall Flora Polly Janet and Lois were at the other We played at those tables all afternoon We simply pivoted at our own table after the end of each rubber When Nita became dummy Forgive me Dundee begged as he interrupted her again I d like to ask a question missus Dunlap since you were at the other table perhaps you will tell me what your partner and opponents were doing just before missus Selim became dummy Lois Dunlap pressed her fingertips into her temples as if in an effort to remember clearly It s rather hard to think of bridge now mister Dundee she said at last But yes of course I remember We had finished a rubber and had decided there would be no time for another since it was so near five thirty That last rubber please missus Dunlap Dundee suggested Who were partners and just when was it finished Flora Lois turned toward missus Miles who had sat with her hands tightly locked and her great haggard dark eyes roving tensely from one to another you and I were partners weren t we Of course Remember you were dummy and I played the hand You went out to telephone didn t you That s right I remember clearly now Flora said she had to telephone the house to ask how her two babies six and four years old they are mister Dundee and the rosiest dumplings Well anyway Flora went to telephone In the little foyer between the main hall and missus Selim s room Yes of course Lois Dunlap answered but Dundee s eyes were upon Flora Miles and he saw her naturally sallow face go yellow under its too thick rouge I played the hand and made my bid although Flora and I had gone down four hundred on the hand before Lois continued with a rueful twinkle of her pleasant grey eyes When the score was totted up I found I d won a bit after all Our winnings go to the Forsyte Alumnae Scholarship Fund she explained Yes I know Dundee nodded And then Polly asked the other table how they stood and Nita said One game to go on this rubber provided we make it Karen was dealing the cards then and Nita was looking very happy she d been winning pretty steadily I think Pardon missus Dunlap How did the players at your table dispose of themselves then that is immediately after you had finished playing the last hand and missus Marshall was dealing at the other table Lois screwed up her forehead Let me think I know what I did I went over to watch the game at the other table and stayed there till Tracey mister Miles came in for cocktails I can t tell you exactly what the other three did There was a strained silence Dundee saw Polly Scale s hand tighten convulsively on Clive Hammond s saw Janet Raymond flush scarlet watched a muscle jerk in Flora Miles otherwise rigid face Suddenly he sprang to his feet I am going to make what will seem an absurd request he said tensely I am going to ask you all the women I mean to take your places at the bridge tables And then he paused for an instant his blue eyes hard I want to see the death hand played exactly as it was played while Nita Selim was being murdered CHAPTER FIVE Shame on you Bonnie Dundee cried Penny Crain her small fists clenched belligerently Death hand indeed You talk like a New York tabloid And if you don t realize that all of us have stood pretty nearly as much as we can without having to play the hand at bridge the very hand we played while Nita Selim was being murdered then you haven t the decency and human feelings I ve credited you with A murmur of indignant approval accompanied her tirade and buzzed on for a moment after she had finished but it ceased abruptly as Dundee spoke Who s conducting this investigation Penny Crain you or I You will kindly let me do it in my own fashion and try to be content when I tell you that in my humble opinion what I propose is absolutely necessary to the solution of this case Bickering Dundee grinned to himself exactly as if they had known each other always had quarreled and made up with fierce intensity for years Really mister Dundee Judge Hugo Marshall began pompously embracing his young wife protectingly I must say that I agree with Miss Crain This is an outrage sir an outrage to all of us and particularly to this frail little wife of mine already half hysterical over the ordeal she has endured Take your places Dundee ordered curtly After all there was a limit to the careful courtesy one must show to Hamilton s inmost circle of society Penny led the way to the bridge tables the very waves of her brown bob seeming to bristle with futile anger But she obeyed Dundee exulted The way to tame this blessed little shrew had been solved by old Bill Shakespeare centuries ago As the women took their places at the two tables arguing a bit among themselves with semi hysterical edges to their voices Dundee watched the men but all of them with the exception of Dexter Sprague that typical son of Broadway so out of place in this company had managed at least a fine surface control their lips tight their eyes hard narrowed and watchful Sprague slumped into a vacated chair and closed his eyes revealing finely wrinkled yellowish lids Where shall we begin Polly Beale demanded brusquely Remember this table had finished playing when Karen began to deal what you call the death hand she reminded him scornfully And Flora wasn t here at all she had been dummy for our last hand And had gone out to telephone Dundee interrupted missus Miles will you please leave the room and return exactly when you did return or as nearly so as you can remember Dundee was sure that missus Miles sallow face took on a greyish tinge as she staggered to her feet and wound an uncertain way toward the hall Tracey Miles sprang to his wife s assistance but Sergeant Turner took it upon himself to lay a detaining hand on the too anxious husband s arm With no more than the lifting of an eyebrow Dundee made Captain Strawn understand that Flora Miles movements were to be kept under strict observation and the chief of the Homicide Squad as unobtrusively conveyed the order to a plainclothesman loitering interestedly in the wide doorway Now he was answering Polly Beale s question I should like the remaining three of you to behave exactly as you did when your last hand was finished Did you keep individual score as is customary in contract or were you playing auction Contract Polly Beale answered curtly And when we re playing among ourselves like this one at each table is usually elected to keep score Janet was score keeper for us this afternoon but we all waited after our last hand was played for Janet to give us the result for our tally cards Dundee drew near the table picked up the three tally cards ornamental little affairs and rather expensive glanced over the points recorded then asked abruptly Where is missus Miles tally I don t see it here There was no answer to be had so he let the matter drop temporarily though his shorthand notebook received another deeply underlined series of pothooks Go on please at both tables Dundee commanded Your table he nodded toward Penny who was already over her flare of temper will please select the cards each held at the conclusion of missus Marshall s deal Oooh I d never remember all my cards in the world Carolyn Drake wailed I know I had five Clubs Ace King Queen You had the Jack not the Queen for I held it myself Penny contradicted her crisply Until this matter of who held which cards after missus Marshall s deal is settled I shall have to ask you all to remain as you are now Dundee said to the players seated at the other table At last it was threshed out largely between Penny Crain and Karen Marshall the latter proving to have a better memory than Dundee had expected At last even Carolyn Drake s querulous fussiness was satisfied or trampled down Both Judge Marshall and John Drake started forward to inspect the cards which none of the players was trying to conceal but Dundee waved them back Please I want you men all of you to take your places outside and return to this room in the order of your arrival this afternoon Try to imagine that it is now if I can trust mister Miles apparently excellent memory exactly five twenty five Pretty hard to do considering it s now a quarter past seven and there s still no dinner in sight Tracey Miles grumbled then brightened I can come right back in then at five twenty seven can t I That point settled and the men sent away to be watched by several pairs of apparently indolent police eyes Dundee turned to the bridge table Nita s leaving of which had provided her murderer with his opportunity The cards are dealt Penny reminded him Now I want you other three to scatter exactly as you did before Dundee commanded hurry and excitement in his voice Lois Dunlap rose laid down her tally card and strolled over to the remaining table After a moment s hesitation Polly Beale strode mannishly out of the room straight into the hall Dundee watching as the bridge players earlier that afternoon certainly had not was amazed to see Clive Hammond beckoning to her from the open door of the solarium So Clive Hammond had arrived ahead of Tracey Miles Had somehow entered the solarium unnoticed and had managed to beckon his fiancee to join him there Prearranged And why had Clive Hammond failed to enter and greet his hostess first Moreover how had he entered the solarium But things were happening in the living room Janet Raymond flushing so that her sunburned face outdid her red hair for vividness was slowly leaving the room also Through a window opening upon the wide front porch Dundee saw the girl take her position against a pillar then a thing she had not done before very probably press her handkerchief to her trembling lips But the bidding was going on Karen Marshall piping in her childish treble Three spades Dundee took his place behind her chair then silently beckoned to Penny to shift from her own chair opposite Carolyn Drake to the chair Nita Selim had left to go to her death She nodded understandingly Double quavered Carolyn Drake next on the left to the dealer and managed to raise her eyebrows meaningly to Penny her partner who had not yet changed places Penny throwing herself into the spirit of the thing scowled warningly No exchanging of illicit signals for Penny Crain But the instant she slipped into Nita Selim s chair her whole face and body took on a different manner underwent almost a physical change She was Nita Selim now She tucked her head considered her cards laughed a little breathless note then cried triumphantly And I say five spades What do you think of that partner Then the girl who was giving an amazing imitation of Nita Selim changed as suddenly into her own character as she changed chairs Nita I don t think it s quite Hoyle to be so jubilant about the strength of your hand she commented tartly I pass Karen Marshall pretended to study her hand for a frowning instant then under Penny s spell announced with a pretty air of bravado Six spades Your raise to five makes a little slam obligatory doesn t it Nita Carolyn Drake flushed and looked uneasily toward Penny a bit of by play which Dundee could see had not figured in the original game But she bridled and shifted her plump body in her chair as she must have done before I double a little slam she declared Then still acting the role she had played in earnest that afternoon she explained importantly I always double a little slam on principle Penny in the role of Nita redoubled with an exultant laugh then as herself said Pass with a murderous glance at missus Drake Let s see your hand partner Karen quavered addressing a woman who had been dead nearly two hours then she shuddered Oh this is too horrible as Penny Crain again slipped into Nita Selim s chair and prepared to lay down the dummy hand And it was horrible even if vitally necessary for these three to have to go through the farce of playing a bridge hand while one of the original players was lying on a marble slab at the morgue her cold flesh insensible to the coroner s expert knife But Dundee said nothing for Tracey Miles was already hovering in the doorway ready for his cue to enter Penny or rather Nita was saying How s this Karen darling as she laid down the Ace and deuce of Spades Karen s trumps I hope you remember you are vulnerable as well as we Carolyn remarked in a sorry imitation of her original cocksureness as she opened the play by leading the Ace of Clubs And how s this partner A singleton in Clubs Nita s imitator demanded triumphantly as she continued to lay down her dummy hand slapping the lone nine of Clubs down beside trumps and this little collection of Hearts as she displayed and arranged the King Jack eight and four of Hearts and this as a length of Diamonds Ace Jack ten eight seven and six slithered down the glossy linen cover of the bridge table toward Karen Marshall Now if you don t make your little slam infant don t dare say I shouldn t have jumped you to five I figured you for a blank or a singleton in Diamonds and at least the Ace of Hearts or you cautious as you are wouldn t have made an original three Spade bid without the Ace Hop to it darling This is where I enter Tracey Miles whispered to Dundee and at a nod from the young detective the pudgy little blond man strode jauntily into the living room proud of himself in the role of actor Hello everybody How s tricks he called genially but there was a quiver of horror in his voice under its blitheness Penny was quite pale when she sprang from her chair but her voice seemed to be Nita s very own as she sang out It can t be five thirty already Thank heaven I m dummy and can run away and make myself pretty pretty for you and all the other great big men Tracey darling Dundee s keen memory registered the slight difference in the wording of the greeting as reported by this pseudo Nita and the man she was running to meet But Penny as Nita was already straightening Tracey Miles necktie with possessive coquettish fingers was coaxing with head tucked alluringly Tracey my ownest lamb won t you shake up the cocktails for Nita The makings are all on the sideboard or I don t know my precious old Lydia even if her poor jaw does ache most horribly Then Penny as Nita was on her way pausing in the doorway to blow a kiss from her fingertips to the fatuously grinning but now quite pale Tracey Miles She was out of sight for only an instant then reappeared and very quietly retraced her steps to the bridge table Unobtrusively Dundee drew his watch from his pocket palmed it as he noted the exact minute then commanded curtly On with the game As Tracey Miles passed the first bridge table Lois Dunlap linked her arm in his saying in a voice she tried to make gay and natural I m trailing along Tracey Simply dying for a nip of Scotch Nita s is the real stuff which is more than my fussy old Pete can get half the time and you know I loathe cocktails The two passed on into the dining room the players scarcely raising their eyes from their cards which they held as if the game were real Dundee his watch still in his hand advanced to the bridge table Strolling from player to player he made mental photographs of each hand then took his stand behind Penny s chair to observe the horribly farcical playing of it Poor little Penny he reflected She hadn t had a chance against that dumb bell across the table from her Fancy anyone s doubling a little slam bid on a hand like Carolyn Drake s or even calling an informatory double in the first place Why hadn t she bid four Clubs after Karen s original three Spade bid if she simply wanted to give her partner information Not that she really had a bid Karen s hand trembled as she drew the lone nine of Clubs from the dummy to place beside Carolyn s Ace but Penny s fingers were quite steady as she followed with the deuce of Clubs to which Karen added with a trace of characteristic uncertainty the eight There s our book Carolyn Drake exulted obediently but she cast an apologetic glance toward Penny If we take one more trick we set them Fat chance Penny obligingly responded and Dundee relieved knew that the farcical game would now be played almost exactly and with the same comments as it had been played while Nita Selim was being murdered Thanks to Penny Crain With a shamefaced glance upward at Dundee Carolyn Drake then led the deuce of Diamonds committing the gross tactical error of leading from the Queen Karen added the Jack from the dummy and Penny shruggingly contributed her King to find the trick as she had suspected in the original game trumped by the five of Spades since Karen had no Diamonds So that settles us Carolyn Penny commented acidly Her partner rose to the role she was playing Well as I said I always double a little slam on principle Besides how could I know they would have a chance for cross ruffing in both Clubs and Diamonds I thought you would at least hold the Ace of Diamonds and that Karen would certainly have one as I only had four Penny shrugged Oh well Let s play bridge for Karen was staring at her cards helplessly Sorry Karen I realize a post mortem is usually held after the playing of a hand not before I I guess I d better get my trumps out Karen now almost a genuine actress too breathed tremulously I do wish Nita were playing this hand I know I ll muff it somehow Good kid Dundee commented silently and allowed himself the liberty of patting Karen on her slim shoulder The girl threw an upward glance of gratitude through misty eyes then led the six of Spades missus Drake contributing the four dummy taking the trick with the Ace and Penny relinquishing the three Let s see that makes five of em in since I trumped one trick Karen said as she reached across the table to lead from dummy As if the words were a cue which they probably were Judge Marshall entered the room at that moment making a great effort to be as jaunty debonair and young for his age as he must have thought he looked when he made his entrance when the real game was being played At his step Karen lifted her head and greeted her elderly husband with a curious mixture of childlike joy and womanly tenderness Hullo darling I m trying to make a little slam I may have been foolish to bid but Nita jumped me from three to five Spades Let s have a look sweetheart the retired judge suggested pompously and Dundee gave way to make room for him behind Karen s chair But before Judge Marshall looked at his wife s cards he bent and kissed her on her flushed cheek and Karen raised a trembling hand to tweak his grey mustache Dundee with uplifted eyebrow queried Penny who nodded shortly conveying the information that this was the way the scene had really been played when there was no question of acting I m getting out my trumps darling Karen confided sweetly as she reached for the deuce of Spades the only remaining trump in the dummy What s your hurry child her husband asked indulgently Lead this and he pointed toward the six of Diamonds I wish you d got a puncture Hugo so you couldn t have butted in before this hand was played Carolyn Drake spluttered Remember this is a little slam bid doubled and redoubled I should think you would like to forget that Carolyn Penny commented bitingly But I agree with Carolyn Hugo that Karen is quite capable of making her little slam without your assistance Please don t mind Karen begged Hugo just wanted to help me because I m such a dub at bridge The finest little player in town Judge Marshall encouraged her gallantly but with a jaunty wink at the belligerent Penny Smiling adoringly at him again Karen took his suggestion and led the six of Diamonds from the dummy Penny covered it with the nine Karen ruffed with the seven of Spades from her own hand and missus Drake lugubriously contributed the four of Diamonds I can get my trumps out now can t I Hugo Karen asked deprecatingly and at her husband s smiling permission she led the King of Spades Carolyn had to give up the Jack which she must have foolishly thought would take a trick the dummy contributed the deuce and Penny followed with her own last trump the eight Karen counted on her fingers her eyes on the remaining trumps in her hand then smiled triumphantly up at her husband Why not simply tell us Karen that the rest of the trumps are in your own hand Penny suggested caustically I I didn t mean to do anything wrong Karen pleaded as she led now with the ten of Hearts which drew in Carolyn s Queen to cover Carolyn murmuring religiously Always cover an honor with an honor or should I have played second hand low Penny topped by the King in the dummy the trick being completed by Penny s three of Hearts At that point John C Drake marched into the room strode straight to Dundee and spoke with cold anger Enough of this nonsense I for one refuse to act like a puppet for your amusement If you are so vitally interested in contract bridge I should advise you to take lessons from an expert not from three terrified women who are rather poor players at best I also advise you to get about the business you are supposed to be here for the finding of a murderer CHAPTER SIX Before Drake had reached his side his purpose plain upon his stern rather ascetic features Dundee had taken a hasty glance at the watch cupped in his palm and noted the exact minute and second of the interruption Time out One moment mister Drake he said calmly I quite agree with you from your viewpoint What mine is you can t be expected to know But believe me when I say that I consider it of vital importance to the investigation of the murder of missus Selim that this particular bridge hand with all its attending remarks the usual bickering and its interruptions of arriving guests for cocktails be played out exactly as it was this afternoon I thought I had made myself clear before If you don t wish me to believe that you have something to conceal by refusing to take part in a rather grisly game Certainly I have nothing to conceal John C Drake snorted angrily Then please bow as gracefully as possible to necessity Dundee urged without rancor And may I ask before we go on if you made your entrance at this time and the facts of your arrival Drake considered a moment gnawing a thin upper lip Beads of sweat stood on his high narrow forehead I walked over from the Country Club after eighteen holes of golf with your superior the district attorney Drake answered with nasty emphasis I left the clubhouse at five ten calculating that it would take me about twenty minutes for the walk of of about a mile Dundee made a mental note to find out exactly how far from this lonely house in Primrose Meadows the Country Club actually was but his next question was along another line You walked mister Drake after eighteen holes of golf on a warm day Drake flushed My wife had the car I had driven out with mister Sanderson but he was called away by a long distance message I lingered at the club for a while chatting and er having a cool drink or two then I set out afoot No one offered you a lift Dundee inquired suavely No I presume my fellow members thought I had my car with me and I asked no one for a lift for I rather fancied the idea of a walk across the meadows I see said Dundee thoughtfully Now as to your arrival here I walked in The door had been left on the latch as it usually is when a party is on Drake explained coldly And I was just entering the room when I heard my wife make the remark about covering an honor with an honor and then her question of Penny as to whether she should have played second hand low So you entered this time at the correct moment said Dundee Now mister Drake I am going to ask you to re enter the room and do exactly as you did upon your arrival at approximately five thirty three I am sure you would not willingly hamper me or my superior in this investigation Drake wheeled ungraciously and returned to the doorway while Dundee again consulted his watch mentally subtracting the minutes which had been wasted upon this interruption from the time he had marked upon his memory as the moment at which Drake had interfered But an undercurrent of skepticism nagged at his mind Why had Drake chosen to walk And why had it taken him from five ten to approximately five thirty three to walk a mile or less The average walker and especially one accustomed to playing golf could easily have covered a mile in fifteen minutes instead of the twenty three minutes Drake had admitted to If it was a mile Was it possible that the banker loved wildflowers With head up aggressively Drake was undoubtedly making an effort to throw himself into the role or perhaps into a role chosen on the spot Where s everybody he called from the doorway Am I early Don t interrupt please dear Carolyn Drake answered her voice trembling now where before it must have been sharp and querulous Silently Drake took his place behind his wife s chair laying a hand affectionately upon her shoulder Dundee watching closely saw Penny s eyes widen with something like shocked surprise So Drake was trying to deceive him counting on the oneness of this group his closest friends Karen obviously flustered too reached to the dummy for the Ace of Diamonds to which Penny played the three Karen herself discarding the ten of Clubs and missus Drake the five of Diamonds You asked no questions mister Drake Dundee interpolated The banker flushed again I yes I believe I did Carolyn missus Drake explained that Karen was playing for a little slam in Spades and that she had doubled on principle he added acidly a voice which missus Drake must be very well accustomed to Dundee surmised And when I told you that Nita had redoubled and it looked as if she was going to make it Carolyn Drake whimpered and shifted her short stout body in the little bridge chair you said why not tell the truth you said it was just like me and I might as well take to tatting at bridge parties That was said jokingly my dear Drake retorted with a coldness that tried to be affectionate warmth Play bridge Dundee commanded sure that the approximate length of the previous dispute had now been taken up whatever retort Carolyn Drake had made Then he checked himself again looking at his watch And just what did you answer to your husband s little joke missus Drake I I The woman looked helplessly around the table her slate colored eyes reddened with tears then she plunged recklessly after a fearful glance at Dundee s implacable face I said that if it was Nita he was talking to he wouldn t speak in that tone that she could make all the foolish mistakes of over bidding or revoking or doubling that she wanted to and he wouldn t say a word except to praise her Then I may as well confess Drake said acidly that I answered substantially as follows Nita is an intelligent bridge player as well as a charming woman my dear Now make the most of that little family tiff sir and be damned to you Did that end the scene missus Drake Dundee asked gently I I said something about all the men thinking Nita was perfect missus Drake confessed and I cried a little but we went on with the hand And Johnny mister Drake went away walking up and down the room waiting for Nita to come back I suppose Then go on with the game Dundee ordered Silently now as silently as the real game must have been played because of the embarrassing scene between husband and wife the sinister game was carried to its conclusion Karen led the Jack of Hearts from the dummy Penny played her seven Karen contributed her own deuce and missus Drake followed suit with the five Again Karen led from the dummy with the four of Hearts followed by Penny s nine taking it with her own Ace missus Drake throwing off the five of Clubs Karen then led the six of Hearts Carolyn Drake discarded the six of Clubs dummy took the trick with the eight of Hearts and Penny sloughed the three of Clubs With a faint imitation of the triumph with which she had played the hand the first time Karen threw down her remaining three trumps I ve made it a little slam she tried to sound very triumphant Doubled and redoubled How much did I did Nita and I make Penny Plenty But before putting pencil to score pad Penny cupped her chin in her hands and stared at Carolyn Drake I d like to know Carolyn if it isn t one of your most cherished secrets what possessed you to double in the first place Carolyn Drake flushed scarlet as she protested feebly I thought of course I could take two Club tricks with my Ace and King That s why I doubled the little slam of course And my first double simply meant that I had one good suit I thought if you could bid at all that my two doubletons Oh what s the use Penny groaned But may I remind you that it is not bridge to lead from a Queen You led the deuce of Diamonds when of course the play since you had seen the Ace in the dummy was to lead your Queen forcing the Ace and leaving my King guarded to take a trick later But Karen didn t have any Diamonds at all Carolyn defended herself A secret you weren t in on when you led from your Queen Penny reminded her Oh well We ll pay up and shut up and she made a pretense of totting up the score while Karen who had risen stood over her like a bird poised for flight At that instant Dexter Sprague began to advance into the room Janet Raymond at his side her face flaming Behave exactly as you did before Dundee commanded in a harsh whisper No time for coddling these people now Dexter Sprague s face took on a yellower tinge but he obeyed Greetings he called in the jaunty over cordial tones of a man who knows himself not too welcome Where s Nita and everybody Isn t that the cocktail shaker I hear Having received no answer from anyone present Sprague strolled through the living room and on into the dining room Janet following Judge Marshall had nodded stiffly and John C Drake had muttered the semblance of a greeting Were they all overdoing it a bit this reacting of their hostility to the sole remaining outsider of their compact little group Dundee stroked his chin thoughtfully But Penny was saying in her abrupt husky voice Above the line twelve fifty below the line seven hundred twenty making a total of nineteen seventy on this hand Karen Won t Nita be glad Karen gasped then began to run totteringly calling Nita Nita But in the hall she collapsed shuddering crying in a child s whimper No no I can t go in there again It was Dundee who reached her first Dundee and not her outraged and excited old husband missus Marshall listen please he begged in a low voice as he lifted her so that her head rested against his arm You have been splendid wonderful Please believe that I am truly sorry to distress you so and that very soon I hope you may go home and rest I can t bear any more Karen whimpered Ignoring Judge Marshall s blustering Dundee continued softly You don t want the wrong person to be accused of this terrible crime do you missus Marshall Of course not And you do want to help us all you can to discover who really killed missus Selim I I suppose so Karen conceded on a sob Then I ll help you I ll go to the bedroom with you Dundee promised her with a sigh of relief To the others he spoke sharply Go back to the exact positions in living room and dining room and solarium that you occupied when missus Marshall ran from the room I think you re overdoing it Bonnie Captain Strawn protested But sure I ll see that they mind you With Karen Marshall clinging to his arm Dundee walked down the hall beyond the staircase to an open door on his left a door guarded by a lounging plainclothesman Seated at the dressing table of the guests lavatory was Flora Miles her sallow dark face so ravaged that she looked ten years older than when he had first seen her an hour before So you were in here when you heard missus Marshall scream missus Miles Dundee paused to ask Yes yes she gasped rising And that horrible man has made me stay in here Of course the door was closed before I telephoned home to ask about my children and then I came in here to to do my face over You didn t hear your husband arrive No I didn t hear him arrive Flora Miles faltered her handkerchief dabbing at her trembling over rouged lips I see Dundee said slowly He stepped into the little room leaving Karen to stand weakly against the door frame Without a word to missus Miles he looked closely at the top of the dressing table and into the small wastebasket that stood beside it You you can see that I cold creamed my face before I put on fresh powder and and rouged Flora Miles pointed out with an obvious effort at offended dignity After I came back while you were making those poor girls play the hand over again I went through the same motions because you told all of us to behave exactly as we had done before I see Dundee agreed Pretty clever in spite of being almost frightened to death Dundee said to himself But he had been just a shade cleverer than she for he had been in this room ahead of her and there had been no balls of greasy face tissue in the wastebasket then He was passing out of the room offering his arm to Karen when one of his underlined notes thrust itself upon his memory May I see your bridge tally please missus Miles My bridge tally she echoed blankly Why it must be on the table where I was playing It is not Dundee assured her quietly Perhaps it is in your handbag and he glanced at the rather large raffia bag that lay on the table She snatched it up slightly averting her body as she looked hastily through its contents It isn t here Oh I don t know where it is What does it matter Without replying Dundee escorted the trembling little discoverer of Nita Selim s body into the large ornate bedroom murmuring as he did so Don t be frightened missus Marshall The bod I mean missus Selim isn t here now And you shan t have to scream I ll give the signal myself I just want you to go through the same motions you did before On jerky feet the girl advanced to Nita s now deserted vanity dresser I I was calling to her all the time she whispered I didn t even wait to knock and I I began to tell her how much we d made off that hand when I when she didn t answer I didn t touch her but I saw I saw Again she gripped her face with her hands and was about to scream I know Dundee assured her gently Then he shouted Ready Herded by Strawn the small crowd of men and women came running into the room Judge Marshall leading the way Penny being second in line Penny second Why not Flora Miles who had been nearer to that room than any of the others if her story was true Dundee asked himself But all had crowded into the room including Polly Beale and Clive Hammond before missus Miles crept in Is this the order of your arrival Dundee asked them all Penny who was standing against the wall just inside the doorway spoke up staring at Flora with frowning intentness You re sort of mixed up aren t you Flora I was standing right here until the worst of it was over I didn t even go near Nita and I know you didn t pass me I remember that Tracey stepped away from the body and called you and you weren t here And then almost the next minute I saw you coming toward him from from over there And Penny pointed toward that corner of the room which held on one angle the door leading to the porch and on its other angle the window from which or from near which Nita Selim had been shot You re lying Penny Crain I did no such thing Flora Miles cried hysterically I came running in with with the rest of you and I rushed over there just to see if I could see anybody running away across the meadow My wife is right sir Tracey Miles added his word aggressively I saw what she was doing the most sensible of all of us and I ran to join her We looked out of the windows both the side windows and the rear ones and out onto the porch But we didn t see anything Surprisingly Dundee abandoned the point And you were the only one to touch her Sprague I believe so Dexter Sprague answered in a strained voice I laid my hand on her her hair for an instant then I picked up her hand to see if if there was any pulse left Yes She she was dead And her hand did it feel cold Neither cold nor warm just cool Sprague answered in a voice that was nearly strangled with emotion She she always had cool hands What did you do Judge Marshall Dundee asked abruptly I took my poor little wife away from this room laid her on a couch in the living room and then telephoned the police Miss Crain stood at my elbow urging me to hurry so that she might ring you as she did Your line was busy and she lost about five minutes before getting you And the rest of you Dundee asked Nothing spectacular I m afraid mister Dundee Polly Beale answered in her brusque deep voice now edged with scorn Further questioning elicited little more beyond the fact that Clive Hammond had dashed out to circle the house and look over the grounds and that John Drake had been fully occupied with an hysterical wife Better let this bunch go for the present hadn t we boy Captain Strawn whispered uneasily Not a thing on any of them Not quite yet sir if you don t mind Dundee answered in a low voice Will you take them back into the living room and put them under Sergeant Turner s charge for a while Then there are one or two things I d like to talk over with you Mollified by the younger man s deference and persuasiveness Strawn obeyed the suggestion to return within five minutes his grey brows drawn into a frown I hope you ll be willing to take full credit for that fool bridge game Bonnie he worried I don t want to look a chump in the newspapers I ll take the blame Dundee assured him with a grin But that fool bridge game and I admit it was a horrible thing to have to do told me a whole bunch of facts that ought to be very very useful For instance Strawn growled For instance Dundee answered it told me that it took approximately eight minutes to play out a little slam bid when ordinarily it would have taken not more than two or three minutes Not only that but it told me the names of everyone in this party who could have killed Nita Selim and Good Lord Of course And to Captain Strawn s amazement Dundee threw open the door of Nita s big clothes closet jerked on the light and stooped to the floor CHAPTER SEVEN Almost immediately Special Investigator Dundee rose from his crouching position on the floor of Nita Selim s closet and faced the chief of the Homicide Squad of Hamilton s police force I think he said quietly for all the excitement that burned in his blue eyes that we d better have missus Miles in for a few questions What have you got there a dance program Strawn asked curiously but as Dundee continued to stare silently at the thing he held the older man strode to the door and relayed the order to a plainclothes detective I sent for Mrs Miles Dundee said coldly when husband and wife appeared together Flora s thin tense shoulders encircled by Tracey s plump arm If you re going to badger my wife further I intend to be present sir Miles retorted thrusting out his chest Very well Dundee conceded curtly missus Miles why didn t you tell me in the first place that you were in this room when Nita Selim was shot Because I wasn t in in the room Flora protested clinging with both thin big veined hands to her husband s arm Sir you have no proof of this absurd accusation and I shall personally take this matter up I have the best of proof Dundee said quietly and took his hand from his pocket You recognize this missus Miles You admit that it is the tally card you used while playing bridge this afternoon No no It isn t mine Flora cried hysterically cringing against her husband who began to protest in a voice falsetto with rage Dundee ignored his splutterings May I point out that it is identical with the other tally cards used at missus Selim s party today and that on its face it bears your name Flora and he politely extended the card for her inspection I yes it must be mine but I was not in this room when Nita was was shot But you will admit that you were in her clothes closet at some time during the twenty or more minutes that elapsed between your leaving the bridge game when you became dummy and the moment when Karen Marshall screamed As Flora Miles said nothing staring at him with great terrified black eyes Dundee went on relentlessly missus Miles when you left the bridge game you did not intend to telephone your house You came here into this room and you lay in wait hiding in her closet until Nita Selim appeared as you knew she would sooner or later No no That s a lie a lie I tell you the woman shrilled at him I did telephone my house and I talked to Junior when the maid put him up to the phone You can ask her yourself if you don t believe me But after you telephoned you stole into this room No no I I made up my face all fresh just as I told you Dundee did not bother to tell her how well he knew she was lying for suddenly something knocked on the door of his mind He strode to the closet searched for a moment among the multitude of garments hanging there then emerged with the brown silk summer coat which Nita Selim had worn to Breakaway Inn that noon Before the terrified woman s eyes he thrust a hand first into one deep pocket and then another finding nothing except a handkerchief of fine embroidered linen and a pair of brown suede gauntlet gloves Will you let me have the note please missus Miles The note Nita received during her luncheon party and which she thrust before your eyes into a pocket of this coat It is in your handbag I am sure since you have had no opportunity unobserved to destroy it What ghastly nonsense is this Dundee Tracey Miles demanded furiously But Dundee again ignored him His implacable eyes held Flora Miles until the woman broke suddenly piteously She fumbled in the raffia bag which had been hanging from her arm Good God Flora What does it all mean Tracey Miles collapsed like a pricked pink balloon That s my stationery one of my business envelopes Flora Miles dropped the bag which she need no longer watch and clutch with terror as she dug her thin fingers into her husband s shoulders and looked down at his puzzled face for she was a little taller than he Forgive me darling Oh I knew God would punish me for being jealous I thought you were writing love letters to to that woman Dundee did not miss the slightest significance of that scene as he retrieved the blue grey envelope she had dropped It was inscribed in a curious handwriting missus Selim Private Dining Room Breakaway Inn Let s see boy Strawn said with respect in his harsh voice Dundee withdrew the single sheet of business stationery and obligingly held it so that the chief of detectives could read it also Nita my sweet the note began without date line Forgive your bad boy for last night s row but I must warn you again to watch your step You ve already gone too far Of course I love you and understand but Be good Baby and you won t be sorry The note was signed Dexy Dundee tapped the note for a long minute while Tracey Miles continued to console his wife A new avenue he thought perhaps a long long avenue missus Miles he began abruptly and the tear streaked face turned toward him You say you thought this letter to missus Selim had been written by your husband Yes She gasped I m jealous natured I admit it and when I saw one of our own I mean one of Tracey s business envelopes You made up your mind to steal it and read it Yes I did A wife has a right to know what her husband s doing if it s anything like that Her haggard black eyes again implored her husband for forgiveness before she went on I did slip into Nita s room and go into her closet to see if she had left the letter in her coat pocket I closed the door on myself thinking I could find the light cord but it was caught in one of the dresses or something and it took me a long time to find it in the dark of the closet but I did find it at last and was just reading the note You read it even after you saw that the handwriting on the envelope wasn t your husband s Dundee queried in assumed amazement Flora s thin body sagged I I thought maybe Tracey had disguised his Handwriting So I read it and saw it was from Dexter mister Miles do you know how some of your business stationery got into Sprague s hands He s had plenty of opportunity to filch stationery or almost anything he wants hanging around my offices as he does an idler But Dundee was in a hurry He wheeled from the garrulity of the husband to the tense terror of the wife missus Miles I want you to tell me exactly what you know unless you prefer to consult a lawyer first Sir if you are insinuating that my wife Oh let me tell him Tracey missus Miles capitulated suddenly completely I was in the closet when Nita was killed I suppose but I didn t know she was being killed Because I was lying in there on the closet floor in a dead faint Dundee stared at the woman incredulously then suppressed a groan of almost unbearable disappointment If Flora Miles was telling the truth here went a flying his only eye witness probably or rather his only ear witness Just when did you faint missus Miles he asked struggling for patience Before or after Nita came into this room I was just finishing the note with the light on in the closet and the door shut when I heard Nita come into the room I knew it was Nita because she was singing one of those Broadway songs she is was so crazy about I jerked off the light and crouched way back in a corner of the closet A velvet evening wrap fell down over my head and I was nearly smothering but I was afraid to try to dislodge it for fear a hanger would fall to the floor and make an awful clatter And then and then She shuddered and clung to her husband What caused you to faint missus Miles Sir my wife has heart trouble What did you hear missus Miles Dundee persisted I couldn t hear very well all tangled up in the coat and way back in the closet but I did hear a kind of bang or bump no no not a pistol shot and because it came from so near me I thought it was Nita or Lydia coming to get something out of the closet and I d be discovered so I I fainted She drew a deep breath and went on When I came to I heard Karen scream and then people running in But all the time that awful tune was going on and on Tune Dundee gasped Do you mean Nita Selim s song Flora Miles seemed to be dazed by Dundee s vehement question Why yes Nita s own tune That s what she called it her own tune But missus Miles Dundee protested ashamed that his scalp was prickling with horror do you mean to tell me that Nita was not dead then when Karen Marshall screamed Dead Flora repeated more bewildered Of course she was or at least they all said so Oh I know what you mean And you don t mean what I mean at all Steady honey girl Tracey Miles urged putting his arm about his wife I d better tell you Dundee When we all came running into the room there was Nita s powder box playing its tune over and over Oh Dundee wiped his forehead You mean it s a musical box Yes and plays when the lid is off Tracey answered obviously delighted to have the limelight again Well of course since Nita couldn t put the lid back on it was still playing What was the tune honey he asked his wife tenderly I haven t much ear for music at best but at a time like that It was playing Juanita Flora answered wearily Over and over Nita Jua a n ita be my own fair bride she quavered obligingly Only not the words of course just the tune That s why Nita bought the box I suppose because it played her namesake song Maybe one of her beaus gave it to her Tracey suggested lightly patting his wife s trembling shoulder Anyway Dundee the thing ran on and on until it ran down I suppose I confess I wanted to put the lid back on to stop the damned thing but Hugo said we mustn t touch anything And quite right Dundee cut in Now missus Miles about that noise you heard Did you hear anyone enter the room No Well then did you hear Nita speak to anyone You said you thought it might be Lydia coming to get something out of the closet I didn t hear Nita speak a word to anybody though she might have and I wouldn t have heard all muffled up in that velvet evening wrap and so far back in the closet Did you hear the door onto the porch it s quite near the closet The door was open when we came in Dundee Tracey interposed It must have been open all the time I didn t hear it open missus Miles confirmed him wearily I tell you I didn t hear anything except Nita s coming in singing then the powder box playing its tune and that bang or bump I told you about And just where was that Dundee persisted I don t know she shrilled hysteria rising in her voice again I told you it sounded fairly near the closet as if as if somebody bumped into something That s what it was like That s exactly what it was like And I was so frightened of being found in the closet that I fainted and didn t come to until Karen screamed She was babbling on but Dundee was thinking hard A very convenient faint that For the murderer at least But why not for missus Miles herself Odd that she should faint Why hadn t she trumped up some excuse immediately and left the closet as Nita was entering the room Was it possibly because she could think of nothing but the great relief of finding that it was Sprague not her husband who had been writing love letters to Nita Selim A jealous woman Miles he began abruptly I think you d better tell me how your wife became so jealous of you and Nita Selim that she could get herself into such a false position Tracey Miles reddened but a gesture of one of his sunburned hands restrained his wife s passionate defense of him It s the truth that Flora is jealous natured And I suppose he faltered a moment and his eyes did not meet his wife s that I liked seeing her a little bit jealous of her old man Sort of makes a man feel well big you know And pretty important to somebody So you were just having a bit of fun with your wife so far as missus Selim was concerned Dundee asked coldly The blood flowed through the thinning blond hair We el not exactly he admitted frankly You see I did take a shine to Nita and if I do say so myself she liked me a lot Oh nothing serious Just a little flirtation like most of our crowd have with each other missus Miles Dundee interrupted with sudden harshness are you sure you did not know that that letter was from Dexter Sprague before you looked for it Sir if you are insinuating that my wife carried on a flirtation or an an affair with that Sprague insect Tracey began to bluster But Dundee s eyes were on Flora Miles and he saw that her sallow skin had tightened like greyish silk over her thin cheek bones and that her eyes looked suddenly dead and glassy You fainted you say missus Miles Dundee went on inexorably Was it because by any chance this note and he tapped the sheet which had caused so much trouble revealed the fact that Nita Selim and Dexter Sprague were sweethearts or lovers It was a battle between those two now Both ignored Tracey s red faced rage Flora licked her dry lips No no she whispered No It was because I was jealous of Tracey and Nita Yes and I d given her cause to be jealous too Tracey forced himself into the conversation One night at the Country Club Flora saw me and Nita stroll off the porch and down onto the grounds and she had a right to be sore at me when I got back because I d cut a dance with her my own wife And it was only this very morning that I made a point of driving out of my way too by this house to see Nita Not that I meant any harm but I was being a little silly about her and she was about me too Not that I d leave my wife and babies for any Broadway beauty under the sun Oh Tracey And you weren t going to tell me Was there real jealousy now or just pretense on Flora s part You understand don t you Dundee Tracey demanded man to man I was just having a little fun on the side nothing serious mind you But of course I didn t tell Flora every little thing No man does There ve been other girls other women Tracey isn t worse than the other men Flora flamed up He s such a darling that all the girls pet him and spoil him Dundee could stand no more of Miles complacent acceptance of his own rakishness And certainly a girl like Nita Selim would have been able to bear precious little of it Conceited ass But Flora Miles was another matter and so was Dexter Sprague You can join me in the living room if you like Dundee said shortly as he wheeled and strode toward the door Was that quick passionate kiss between husband and wife being staged for his benefit Pretty near through boy Strawn who had been silent and bewildered for a long time asked anxiously as the two detectives passed into the hall Not quite I ve got to know several things yet Dundee answered absently But in the living room his mind was wholly upon the business in hand I ll keep you all no longer than is absolutely necessary he began and again the close knit group in which only Dexter Sprague was an alien grew taut with suspense From the playing out of the death hand at bridge he went on using the objectionable phrase again very deliberately I found that no two of you men arrived together mister Hammond you were the first to arrive I believe It seems that I was Clive Hammond answered curtly And yet you did not enter the living room to greet your hostess I wanted a private word with Polly Miss Beale my fiancee Hammond explained briefly How and when did you arrive I don t know the exact time Never thought of looking at my watch Hammond offered I came out in my own roadster that tan Stutz you may have noticed in the driveway As for how I entered the house I leaped upon the porch and opened a door of the solarium I walked across the solarium saw Polly just finishing with bridge for the afternoon and beckoned to her She joined me in the solarium and we stayed there until Karen screamed That s all Have you been engaged long mister Hammond you and Miss Beale Dundee asked as if quite casually Nearly a year if it s any of your business Dundee And just when had you seen Miss Beale last before late this afternoon Dundee asked I refuse to answer Hammond flared That at least is none of your damned business I believe I can answer my own question mister Hammond Dundee said very softly CHAPTER EIGHT Then why ask me Hammond shrugged but his eyes flickered toward Polly Beale I thought perhaps you could give me a little additional information Dundee soothed him You see it happens that I saw you Miss Beale and another young man come into the Stuart House dining room about half past one today just when I was thinking of lunch for myself The mysterious other young man was Clive s brother Ralph Hammond Polly Beale cut in brusquely Your decision to lunch with your fiance and his brother was quite a sudden one Dundee asked courteously Just when did you change your mind about missus Selim s luncheon party at Breakaway Inn Miss Beale The tall girl threw up her mannishly cropped chestnut head There is nothing at all sinister or even queer about it mister Dundee I was on my way to the luncheon when I decided to drive past Nita s house on the chance that she might like me to drive her over Then you didn t know that missus Dunlap had already arranged to meet missus Selim downtown this morning and to take her to the Inn Dundee asked No I didn t hear of the arrangement Polly answered decidedly You were a close friend of missus Selim s perhaps Dundee prodded Not at all But that would not keep me from doing my hostess a courtesy She hated her Ford and liked expensive cars Polly added unemotionally It was about a quarter to one when I got here I should say Nita wasn t here nor was her maid but I saw Ralph s car parked in front of the house Ralph Hammond s car a woman squealed but Dundee let Polly continue I rang and he answered the door Said he was alone in the house going over the premises at Judge Marshall s request Polly said evenly That s right that s right Judge Marshall agreed hastily Nita missus Selim wanted the unfinished half of the gabled top story finished up Wanted a maid s room and bath and a guest room and bath added to the living quarters already completed I gave the commission for an estimate at least to the Hammond firm since they had built the house originally for Crain Penny s father I see Dundee agreed And you sent your brother mister Hammond He was the natural one to send Clive Hammond retorted Small job All he had to do was to get together an estimate on additional furnace lines and radiators electric wiring plumbing plastering et cetera Go on Miss Beale Dundee directed Thanks There was sarcasm in her brusque voice But that s really about all I have to tell Ralph complained that he was hungry and charged me with giving him too little of my time the usual thing I picked up Nita s phone called Clive and made the date for the three of us Then I called Breakaway Inn cancelled the luncheon part of the bridge party with Nita and Ralph and I drove back to Hamilton Dundee studied her strong clever almost plain face for a long minute Certainly Polly Beale did not look like a liar but he would have taken his oath that she was lying now Or rather not revealing the whole truth behind the actual facts of her movements that day For instance could a simple plea of her future brother in law make her do so discourteous a thing as to break a luncheon appointment especially when such a course would not only disappoint her hostess and her friends but disarrange the seating plan of a rather formal party Of course the explanation was obvious She had wanted first to see Nita and remonstrate privately with her for having so enslaved Ralph Hammond when he was tacitly known to belong to Penny Crain one of the sacred crowd Failing that she had found Ralph himself and had not expected to find him had talked with him about Nita and had quarreled a bit with him perhaps over his love sodden behavior And the crisis had become so acute that Polly had arbitrarily called upon Clive Hammond and then had forced Ralph to accompany her Do you know Miss Beale why Ralph Hammond did not keep his engagement with missus Selim this afternoon Or rather his promise to appear for cocktails and to be Miss Crain s partner for the rest of the evening dinner and dancing at the Country Club I do not Polly said crisply Hammond Neither do I Hammond retorted angrily Then it was not to discuss Ralph Hammond and his affairs that you beckoned Miss Beale to meet you in the solarium upon your arrival It was not A shade too much anger and emphasis Dundee decided And he wished heartily that Strawn s detectives would not delay much longer in bringing the missing young man into this already involved examination You say that you both were in the solarium from the time of your arrival Hammond until missus Marshall screamed Dundee continued Just what did you see and hear Dundee watched their faces keenly but again they were well bred expressionless It was Polly Beale who answered Naturally there was not absolute silence but I am afraid we were not listening We were rather engrossed in our conversation We were seated near no windows and I for one saw nothing as well as heard nothing that I can recall Hammond That goes for me too absolutely Abruptly abandoning the engaged couple Dundee returned to Miles You were the second arrival then Yes I parked my car along the curb in front of the house Tracey answered readily And I came right on in and Nita jumped up Yes We ve had all that twice before Dundee interrupted cruelly Now Judge Marshall One of my friends gave me a lift from town Judge Marshall volunteered pompously Chap named Sampson You may have heard of him fine fellow splendid lawyer We played billiards together at the Athletic Club and when I was about to call a taxi my wife having the car here he offered to drop me here on his way to the Country Club N no I don t remember the exact time did not consult my watch You came directly from the road into the house Judge Marshall Certainly sir Did you er see anyone You mean sir did anyone see me Judge Marshall demanded with pompous indignation No no one sir If my word is not good enough for you you can think what you damned please I think we are all getting a little too tired mister Dundee Penny Crain suggested almost humble in her weariness I m truly sorry the young detective apologized But I can t leave things like this mister Drake you have said you walked over from the Country Club You must have approached the house from the driveway side the side of the house which contains missus Selim s bedroom Is that right More or less except that I skirted the house rather widely and arrived from the road stepping upon the front porch and walking directly into the hall I saw no one outside or near the house when I arrived Drake answered with less than his usual nastiness And saw no one running away across the meadows Dundee pressed No one at all Drake retorted I wish to God I could truthfully say that I saw a gunman with a mask and a smoking revolver skulking through the wildflowers but the absolute truth is that I saw no one Thank you mister Drake Now mister Sprague of New York Sprague s nervously twitching face reddened darkly I I took a bus I have no car of my own I got off the bus on Sheridan Road at the entrance to Primrose Meadows I see And you walked the quarter of a mile to this house Sprague s hand fumbled with his cravat I of course I did I see Now Miss Raymond Dundee pounced unexpectedly so that the red haired girl went very white beneath her freckles you observed mister Sprague toiling down the rutty road hot and weary but romantic in the sunset missus Drake let out a nervous giggle then clapped her hand over her mouth I I wasn t looking that way Janet Raymond stammered I I just went out on the porch for a breath of fresh air And you were completely surprised when mister Sprague came walking up the flagstone path Dundee persisted for he knew she was lying knew that she had stationed herself there to watch for Sprague I yes I was He stopped and talked for a while before we came in and joined Tracey and Lois in the dining room where Tracey was mixing cocktails But she flared suddenly I don t see why you have to badger all of us when it must have been Lydia the maid who killed Nita because Oh Janet Shame on you Penny cried furiously Where is the maid now Captain Strawn Dundee asked I haven t seen her yet Because she s in her room in the basement Bonnie Strawn answered Sort of forgot about her didn t you and he chuckled at the younger man s discomfiture But I got her story out of her you bet Nothing to it though One of my boys Collins it was found her in that short dark hall that runs between the Selim woman s bedroom and the kitchen Sicker n a pup she was it was a mess Said she d I d better have her up and question her if she s well enough Dundee interrupted as tactfully as possible It seems that she had an abscessed tooth out today with gas and a local anesthetic Now Miss Raymond will you tell me exactly what you meant by saying it must have been Lydia who killed her mistress I certainly will the red haired girl cried defiantly What I can t see is why Tracey and Lois and Dex mister Sprague didn t think of it too It s as plain as Yes as the nose on my face Dundee cut in grimly but with a glance at Strawn Just stick to the facts however Miss Raymond and maybe we can all agree with you Well when mister Sprague and I went into the dining room there were Lois and Tracey cutting up like a couple of children Janet began determined to take her time When they saw us Lois said Good Lord Tracey Get busy Or your job as bartender will be taken away from you and Tracey began to shake cocktails at the sideboard Guess I d better tell it Janet for what it s worth Lois cut in impatiently It s nothing more nor less than that I had to ring twice for poor Lydia before she came she explained to Dundee Tracey is full of original ideas about cocktails and wanted some sort of bitters He was going to shout for Lydia but I stepped on the button under the dining table and the poor thing in the basement nursing her jaw probably didn t hear Tracey and I got to kidding as Janet says and had scarcely noticed how long Lydia was in coming I rang again and she came That s all That isn t all Janet denied angrily I was there when Lydia came in and she was looking white as a ghost except for her swollen jaw What s more she acted so dumb Tracey had to tell her twice what he wanted And then she said Nita didn t have any of those bitters anyway An open and shut case against poor Lydia Penny Crain broke in derisively Go pluck daisies Janet You d be of a lot more help Here s your maid Bonnie Captain Strawn announced lazily as one of his plainclothesmen appeared in the arch between dining and living room dragging by the hand a woman who was resisting strangely her apron pressed to her face You are Lydia Dundee asked his voice kinder than it had been for many minutes Oh it s Lydia Carr Captain Strawn Thank you Don t be afraid And I m sorry about the tooth Come along in I ll not keep you long The woman s knees seemed about to fail her but with a sudden effort she released the detective s grip on her wrist Very tall she was very bony in her black cotton dress Pathetic too with her thin iron grey hair and that apron concealing the left half of her face It was odd Dundee thought that it was not the swollen jaw she chose to cover missus Dunlap sprang to her feet and hurried across the room Don t mind Lydia please You must not be so sensitive she said gently and even more gently pulled down the concealing apron Good God Dundee breathed and Strawn nodded his understanding of the younger man s horror For the left half of Lydia Carr s face was drawn and puckered and ridged almost out of human semblance Even the eye was ruined a milky ball which the puckered hairless eyelid could never cover again Poor Lydia is ashamed of her scarred face Lois Dunlap explained her arm still about the maid s shoulder She isn t quite used to it yet but none of us mind You were burned recently Lydia Dundee asked pityingly That s my business the woman astounded him by retorting harshly How did it happen Lydia Dundee persisted puzzled I had an accident It was my own fault Lois Dunlap s kind grey eyes caught and held Dundee s firmly I think if Nita could speak to you now mister Dundee that she would beg you not to try to force Lydia s confidence on this subject Nita was devoted to Lydia we can all testify to that and one of the sweetest things about her was her constant effort to protect Lydia from questions and curious glances I for one know that Nita often begged Lydia to submit to a skin grafting operation regardless of expense When that kind voice choked on tears Dundee abruptly abandoned his intention to press the matter further Lydia your mistress had been married or was still married wasn t she The woman s single slate grey eye stared into his expressionlessly She had missus in front of her name to use when she felt like it That s all I know I never saw her husband if she had one I only worked for her about five years You say she used her married name when she felt like it What do you mean by that Lydia I mean she was an actress and used her stage name Juanita Leigh pronounced like it was spelled plain Lee but she was mostly called Nita Leigh An actress you say Dundee repeated thoughtfully I had heard of her only as director of the Forsyte School plays What shows was she in She was what they call a specialty dancer in musical comedy Lydia answered Sometimes she had a real part and sometimes she only danced She was a good hoofer and a good trouper she added the Broadway terms falling strangely from those austere lips And when she wasn t in a show she sometimes got a job in the pictures She never had a real chance in the movies though because they mostly wanted her to double for the star in long shots where dancing comes into the picture or in close ups where they just show the legs you know I see Dundee agreed gravely Where were you during the fifteen minutes or so before your mistress was shot Lydia I was down in my room in the basement the woman answered Nita I mean Miss Nita was going to get Judge Marshall to build me a room on the top floor She hated for me to have to sleep in the basement but I didn t mind You were not required to be on duty for the party No she answered in her harsh flat voice I d fixed the sandwiches and put out the liquors for the cocktails set them all out on the dining table and sideboard and Miss Nita had told me to go and lie down as soon as I was through So I did I had an abscessed tooth pulled this morning and I was feeling sick Did you hear the kitchen bell at all Dundee went on I dropped off to sleep that fool dentist had shot me full of dope but I did hear the bell and I come up to answer it missus Dunlap said she d rung twice and I said I was sorry Lydia did you go into your mistress bedroom before or after you answered that bell Dundee asked with sudden sharpness I did not I didn t even know she was in her bedroom until I saw her sitting at her dressing table dead The harsh voice hesitated over the last word but it did not break And just when did you first see her after she was dead I went into the kitchen thinking something else might be needed Then I heard a scream It sounded like it come from Nita s Miss Nita s bedroom and I run along the back hall that leads from the kitchen to her bedroom I heard a lot of people running and yelling Nobody paid any attention to me You came into the room No sir I did not I stopped in the doorway I heard mister Sprague say she was dead I was sick and dizzy anyway and I couldn t move for a minute I sort of slipped down to the floor and I guess I must have passed out And then I was sick to my stomach and I didn t seem to care if I never moved again Why Lydia Dundee asked gently Because she was the only friend I had in the world and I couldn t have loved her better if she d been my own child Lydia answered And the stern voice had broken at last I was still there in the back hall when a cop come and asked me a lot of questions and then that man she pointed to Captain Strawn said I could go and lay down He helped me down the basement stairs Dundee tapped his teeth with the long pencil he had kept so busy that evening tapped them long and thoughtfully Then Lydia did you see anyone anyone at all from your basement room window before you answered missus Dunlap s ring CHAPTER NINE For the first time during the difficult interview Dundee was sure that Lydia Carr was lying For a fraction of a second her single eye wavered the lid flickered then came her harsh flat denial I didn t see nobody I presume your basement room has a window looking out upon the back garden Dundee persisted Yes it has but I didn t waste no time looking out of it Lydia answered grimly I was laying down with an ice cap against my jaw She had seen someone Dundee told himself But the truth would be harder to extract from that stern scar twisted mouth than the abscessed tooth had been Finally when her lone eye did not again waver under his steady gaze he dismissed her or rather returned her to Captain Strawn s custody Well Janet I hope you re satisfied Penny Crain said bitingly as she dashed unashamed tears from her brown eyes If ever a maid was absolutely crazy about her mistress I m not satisfied Janet Raymond retorted furiously She s just the sort that would harbor a grudge for years and then all hopped up with dope Stop it Janet Lois Dunlap commanded with a curtness that set oddly upon her kind pleasant face Listen here Dundee Tracey Miles broke in almost humbly My wife is getting pretty anxious about the kiddies The nurse quit on us yesterday and And my little wife is worrying herself sick over our boy just three months old Judge Marshall joined the protest I m all for assisting justice sir having served on the bench myself as you doubtless know but I m all right really Hugo Karen Marshall faltered Please be patient a little longer Dundee urged apologetically After all only one of these people could be guilty of Nita Selim s murder and it was beastly to have to hold them like this But one was guilty You knew missus Selim in New York Sprague he asked whirling suddenly upon the man with the Broadway stamp I met Nita Leigh as I always heard her called when I was assistant director in the Altamont Studios out on Long Island Sprague answered his black eyes trying to meet Dundee s with an air of complete frankness Wonderful little girl and a great dancer Screened damned well too I had hoped to give her a break some day at something better than doubling for stars who can t dance But it happened that Nita who never forgot even a casual friend had a chance to give me a leg up herself a chance to show what I can really do with a camera I knew I d seen your name somewhere Dundee exclaimed So you re the man the Chamber of Commerce is dickering with Going to make a movie of the founding growth and beauties of the city of Hamilton aren t you If I get the contract yes Sprague answered with palpably assumed modesty My plans naturally call for a great deal of research work a large expenditure of money a very careful selection of stars
1845_145083_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I see Dundee interrupted 
none	none	Then his tone changed became slow and menacing in its terrible emphasis And you really couldn t let even a good friend like Nita Selim upset those fine plans of yours could you Sprague Even as he put the sinister question the detective was exulting to himself Light at last Now I know why this Broadway bounder was received into an exclusive crowd like this Every last female in the bunch hoped to be the star of Sprague s motion picture I don t know what you re driving at Dundee Sprague was on his feet his black eyes blazing out of a chalky face If you re accusing me of of Of killing Nita Selim Dundee asked lazily Oh no Not yet Sprague I was just remembering a rather puzzling note of yours I happened to read this afternoon That note you sent by special messenger to Breakaway Inn this noon you know He had little interest for the sudden crumpling of Dexter Sprague into the chair from which he had risen Instead as Dundee drew the note from his coat pocket his eyes swept around the room noted the undisguised relief on every face the almost ghoulish satisfaction with which that close knit group of friends seized upon an outsider as the probable murderer of that other outsider whom they had rashly taken into their sacred circle Even Penny Crain thorny little stickler for fair play that she was relaxed with a tremulous sigh You admit that this note signed by what I take to be your pet name was written by your hand Sprague Dundee asked matter of factly as he extended the sheet of bluish notepaper I no yes I wrote it Sprague faltered But it doesn t mean a thing not a damned thing Just a little private matter between Nita and myself Rather queer wording for an unimportant message Sprague Dundee interrupted Let me refresh your memory Nita my sweet he began to read slowly Forgive your bad boy for last night s row but I must warn you again to watch your step You ve already gone too far Of course I love you and understand but Be good Baby and you won t be sorry Dexy Well Sprague Sprague wiped his perspiring hands on his handkerchief I know it sounds odd under the circumstances he admitted desperately but listen Dundee and I ll try to make that damned note as clear as possible to a man who doesn t know his Broadway Why man it isn t even a love letter Everybody on Broadway talks and writes to each other like that without meaning a thing As I told you Nita Leigh or missus Selim remembered some little kindnesses I had done her on the Altamont lot when they got her to take up that Little Theater work missus Dunlap is interested in and found that the Chamber of Commerce was interested in putting Hamilton into the movies in a big booster campaign She wired me and I thought it looked good enough to drop everything and come Of course Nita and I got to be closer friends but I swear to God we were just friends And what was the friendly row about last night Sprague There wasn t a row really Sprague protested with desperate earnestness It was merely that Nita insisted on my casting her for the heroine of the movie a thing I knew would alienate the whole crowd that s been so kind to us Why since she was a professional actress Dundee demanded Because she isn t a Hamilton girl of course and the Chamber of Commerce wants the cast to be all local talent Sprague answered lapsing unconsciously into the present tense And just what were you warning her against I d told her before to watch her step Sprague went on more easily You see Dundee Nita Leigh is was a first class little vamp and I could see she was playing her cards with the men here he indicated four of Hamilton s most prominent Chamber of Commerce members with a wave of his hand to get them all so crazy about her that they d vote for her as the star of the picture I could see her point all right It would have been a big chance for her to show how she could act Well I could see it was dangerous business and that the girls and he smiled jerkily at the tense women in the living room were getting pretty wrought up over the way Nita was behaving All except missus Dunlap he added She didn t want to act in the picture and Nita didn t make any headway at all with Peter Dunlap Thanks mister Sprague Lois Dunlap drawled with an amused quirk of her broad mouth Get along with the row Sprague Dundee commanded impatiently As I said it wasn t really a row I just pleaded with Nita last night to smooth down the girls rumpled feathers and to make it clear to them that she didn t want the star part in the picture any more than she wanted any other woman s husband or sweetheart Just a friendly warning Sprague drew a deep breath And that s all the note meant absolutely I see Dundee said quietly then quoted Be good Baby and you won t be sorry That meant of course Sprague took him up eagerly that I d see she got a real part in a regular movie after I d made my hit with the Hamilton picture Very plausible very plausible indeed Dundee reflected And yet Finally he lifted his head and let his eyes dart from face to face All of you have stated separately and collectively that you heard no shot fired in Nita Selim s bedroom this afternoon he said sharply Is that true He was answered by weary nods or sullen affirmations Then he continued I must conclude that you are all lying or that Nita Selim was killed with a gun equipped with a Maxim silencer Never was a detective more unprepared for the effect of his words upon a group of possible suspects than was Special Investigator Dundee CHAPTER TEN As Dexter Sprague had glibly and plausibly explained away every sinister aspect of the note he had written to Nita Selim that day Special Investigator Dundee was recalling with verbatim vividness his argument with Captain Strawn of the Homicide Squad immediately after his arrival into the house of violent death He had said then The person who killed Nita Selim was so well known to her and his or her presence in this room so natural a thing that she paid no attention to his or her movements and was concentrating on the job of powdering her very pretty face And he had said further in face of the disappearance of the gun and in explanation of the fact that all twelve of these people had immediately protested to Strawn that they had heard no shot This was a premeditated murder of course The Maxim silencer unless they are all lying about not hearing a shot proves that Silencers are damned hard to get hold of but people with plenty of money can manage most things And as Dexter Sprague had talked on more and more glibly Dundee had suddenly found an explanation which fitted his own argument with such perfection that he wondered naively if he were perhaps gifted with clairvoyance Of all these twelve people whom he had questioned so relentlessly only Dexter Sprague could easily have come into possession of a Maxim silencer He had dilated proudly upon the fact that he had been an assistant director at the Altamont Studios on Long Island And the Altamont company had recently finished making a series of underworld motion pictures crook dramas featuring gunmen with rods made eerily noiseless by Maxim silencers A bit of information he had picked up in a motion picture magazine had hurtled into the logical chain of Dundee s reasoning assistant directors were in charge of props it was their business to see that no article needed for the production of a picture was lost or missing when the director needed it Dexter Sprague had said that he had dropped everything to come when Nita Selim wired him of the Chamber of Commerce project to make a booster movie of Hamilton Perhaps he had dropped everything But had he hesitated long enough to pick up a Maxim silencer and a blunt nosed automatic And was the row which Sprague had been so glibly explaining away an ancient one a row so deadly that when Nita Selim had refused to heed his written warning her murder had become necessary It was with all this in mind that Bonnie Dundee flung his challenge I must conclude that you are all lying or that Nita Selim was killed with a gun equipped with a Maxim silencer And his eyes terrible with their command that the weakling should break and confess were upon Dexter Sprague But Sprague did not break He stared back blankly If his eyes and his attention had included the whole group it is possible that what happened would not have taken Dundee so completely by surprise He had paid little attention to a sort of concerted gasp a slight movement among the group farthest from him But not even his intense concentration upon Sprague could prevent his hearing Karen Marshall s childish voice tremulous with fear No no Hugo Don t don t He whirled from Sprague in time to see Judge Marshall disengaging his arm from his young wife s clinging fingers to note with profound astonishment that Drake was stepping hastily aside so that not even his coat sleeve might be brushed by the advancing figure of the elderly retired judge And before Judge Marshall had time to speak Dundee saw that a blight had touched at last the solid friendship of the women that they did not look at each other with that air of standing together whatever happened but that their eyes not meeting at all became secret calculating afraid Sir Judge Marshall began pompously when he had planted himself squarely before the young detective It shall never be said of me that I have tried even in the slightest way to hamper the course of justice I am sure of that Judge Marshall Dundee replied courteously but his pulses were hammering What in God s name did this long winded old fool have to tell him You have some information you believe may be valuable Judge I do not believe it will be at all valuable sir On the contrary the old man retorted indignantly But to suppress the fact at this juncture might lead to grave misunderstandings later when it inevitably comes to light So sir it is my duty to inform you that I myself own a Colt s thirty two as well as a Maxim silencer What Dundee exclaimed incredulously He was conscious that behind him Captain Strawn was getting to his feet There is no need to get out your handcuffs Captain Strawn Judge Marshall warned him majestically I assure you that I have not violated the law Every judge active and retired is entitled to a permit to carry a weapon and I long ago availed myself of the privilege Nor am I about to make a confession of murder There ain t no permit so far as I know Judge Strawn growled for any man whoever he may be God A mighty himself not excepted to tote a gun with a silencer on it Karen Marshall was crying now with the abandoned grief of a petted child Granted Captain Judge Marshall snapped But it happens that I do not tote my gun with the silencer on it If it interests you I may as well explain that I came by the silencer several years ago when I was on the bench A notorious Chicago gunman on trial for murder here and acquitted by a feeble minded jury made me a present of the very silencer he had used in killing his victim an ironic gesture a gesture of supreme insolence but an entirely safe gesture since he well knew that a man once acquitted of a crime cannot again be placed in jeopardy for the same offence So you kept the silencer as a curiosity Judge Marshall Dundee interrupted the pompous flow of rhetoric For years yes the ex judge answered then his face went yellow and very old As I told you just now I will withhold no fact that may be of any relevance whatever About two months ago in March I believe our little group here took up target shooting as a fad Several of us became quite expert with revolver and rifle mister Drake and he nodded toward the banker who instantly averted his eyes conceived the idea of practising the draw from the hip sort of revolver shooting the kind one sees in Wild West movies you know I think you might add Hugo Drake cut in angrily that I had in mind the hope of being able to protect the bank in case of a holdup And the silencer Judge Marshall Captain Strawn prodded Judge Marshall flushed and fingered the end of a waxed mustache The silencer sir was my wife s idea You see sir we are fortunate enough to be the parents of an infant son He was just a month old when I painted a bull s eye upon the brick wall of our back garden and invited our friends to indulge their fad as our guests The shooting awakened the baby so frequently that Karen missus Marshall dug up the silencer which I had shown her as a memento of my career on the bench Thereafter we confined our practice almost exclusively to drawing from the hip and shooting without sighting It is impossible to sight with a gun equipped with a silencer you know since the silencer covers the sighter on the barrel It sure does Strawn drawled So every last one of you folks had a good deal of this sort of practice I take it Judge Marshall glanced about the room as if he could not recall the face of everyone present Yes all of us except mister Sprague and Penny my dear did you join us at all The girl who had once been in on every sport that this crowd of Hamilton s socially elect indulged in flushed a painful red No Hugo I I have to stay with Mother on Sunday mornings you know Your target practice was a Sunday morning diversion then Judge Marshall Dundee asked Yes We usually have an hour of the sport between eleven and noon on Sundays We ve been having a sort of tournament quite sharply competitive When did you and your friends practise last Dundee asked Last Sunday Tomorrow was to mark the end of the tournament the Judge answered And when did you last see your gun and silencer Dundee persisted Last Sunday of course Why Good Lord Marshall ejaculated It was Nita herself who put the gun away There was a collective gasp of relief Eyes could meet eyes now But it was Flora Miles who voiced the thought or hope that seemed apparent on every face That s why I didn t hear anyone talking when I was in the closet she cried her voice almost hysterical in its vehemence There wasn t anybody but Nita in the room She committed suicide She stole poor Hugo s gun and the silencer and committed suicide At a distance of from ten to fifteen feet Dundee asked with ill concealed sarcasm And when she was powdering her face And just after entering the room blithely singing a Broadway hit Maybe the lady is right boy Captain Strawn interposed mildly I ve heard of people rigging up contrivances Which make the gun and the silencer disappear by magic Dundee demanded No folks I m afraid the suicide theory is no good Now Judge Marshall and he turned again to the creator of the biggest sensation since the investigation into Nita Selim s death had got under way you say that missus Selim herself put the gun away Will you explain the circumstances The elderly man s face had gone yellowish again Certainly Nita Selim and I were the last to leave the back garden She was particularly poor at the sport never made a bull s eye during the four or five Sunday mornings after Lois missus Dunlap drew her into our set She begged for a few more shots and I stayed with her after the others had gone into the house for er refreshment She fired the last bullet in the chamber of the Colt s and together we walked to the house entering the little room at the rear where all sorts of sports equipment are kept fishing rods and tackle golf clubs bows and arrows skis et cetera She was carrying the gun unscrewing the silencer as we walked It is my habit to keep the pistol and the silencer in a drawer in a little corner cupboard Locked up Dundee asked sharply Usually locked but not always I am afraid Judge Marshall answered reluctantly And you saw missus Selim place the gun and the silencer in the drawer I thought I did but I was really not watching closely As a matter of fact I stopped to look over a fishing rod with a view to trying it out the first good fishing weather Was missus Selim wearing a coat or cloak Dundee cut in impatiently Why I don t know Yes she was Hugo Karen cried out eagerly It was quite chilly last Sunday morning Remember We all had on coats or sweaters Nita wore a dark green leather jacket with big pockets And she left in a great hurry without even waiting for a drink Flora Miles contributed triumphantly I tell you she took them away in her pockets Your guess may be correct missus Miles Dundee agreed but I think we had better not come to any definite conclusion until we know that Judge Marshall s automatic and silencer are really missing Is there anyone at your house now Judge whom you can ask to look for it Certainly The butler Shall I telephone him Accompanied by Captain Strawn the ex judge went to the telephone in the little foyer between Nita Selim s bedroom and the main hall And within five minutes he was back nodding his head gravely Hinson tells me that the Colt s and the silencer are both missing sir May I express my profound regret that my possession of Some other time Judge Marshall Dundee interrupted curtly and hurried from the room followed by Strawn who nodded to Sergeant Turner still lounging wearily in a far corner of the living room to stand guard vigilantly Well Bonnie here s the devil to pay Strawn gloomed but Dundee made for the telephone without answering He called a number then curtly demanded doctor Price please Yes I know he s busy on an autopsy Just tell him that Dundee of the district attorney s office wants to speak to him There was a long pause then Hello doctor Price Dundee What are the caliber and type of bullet that killed Nita Selim Thanks much doctor Anything new Fine Thanks again He hung up the receiver and faced Strawn Bullet from a Colt s thirty two he said grimly I suggest you send one of your men around to the Marshall home to pick up a bullet that was shot in their damned target practice If you send the two bullets tonight registered mail to Wright the ballistics expert in Chicago he can probably wire you tomorrow morning as to whether the same gun was used to fire both Sure Bonnie Strawn agreed lugubriously I was going to do just that Say this town is getting to be worse than Chicago When he re entered the living room Dundee began upon the judge again regardless of the fact that the elderly husband was murmuring consolatory endearments to his young wife Judge Marshall how many keys are there to the cupboard drawer in which your gun and silencer were kept Just one I have it with me the old man answered wearily Then when Hinson your butler looked for them he found the drawer unlocked He did I confess to almost criminal negligence Then so far as you know the gun and silencer could have been removed at any time by any guest of yours between noon last Sunday and today Dundee went on relentlessly I suppose so But these people have been my close friends for years the judge answered Not one of them sir After missus Selim s departure last Sunday did your other guests remain for any length of time For an hour or more I think Lois and Peter Dunlap remained for our two o clock Sunday dinner but the others drifted away to various engagements Did any of you return to the room where the gun was kept I can speak only for myself and Peter mister Dunlap Judge Marshall answered flushing with indignation The two of us went down just before dinner was served I wanted to show him some new flies for trout casting Your home is a popular rendezvous for your intimates is it not I pride myself that it is sir And guests run in and out having the freedom of the place Certainly sir And since I am not so stupid as you imagine I can tell you now that I understand the drift of your questions and can forestall them Yes all of these people my friends have had opportunity to take the gun and the silencer from the cupboard since it was placed there last Sunday if it was placed there by missus Selim But may I remind you sir that opportunity alone is not sufficient that motive Since missus Selim is dead murdered by the weapon which was stolen we can assume Judge Marshall that someone had motive Dundee reminded him implacably for in his mind there was no doubt that the ballistics expert would bear him out There was a heavy throbbing silence The group that with the exception of Dexter Sprague had been so united so cemented with long sustained friendship again dissolved visibly before Dundee s eyes into eleven individuals each shrinking into himself mentally drawing away from any possible contamination with a murderer You have said Judge Marshall Dundee went on at last that Miss Crain and mister Sprague were not at your home for target practice Sunday Has either of them been in your home during this past week Penny Miss Crain spent an evening with my wife when I was er away from home on business That was last Tuesday I believe Yes it was Tuesday Hugo Penny Crain interrupted firmly And Karen can vouch for the fact that I did not go into the gun room Don t be silly Penny Carolyn Drake scolded as if she had long been bursting to speak Giving an alibi As if any of us who were playing bridge while that woman was being shot needs any alibi But I ll tell you what I think mister Detective I think Nita herself stole the gun and the silencer to kill Dexter Sprague with and that he stole it from her and murdered her Nobody else has the slightest scrap of a motive and that note he wrote her ought to be enough to hang him on Dexter Sprague had struggled to his feet during the woman s hysterical attack his face like chalk his eyes blazing But Dundee waved him aside peremptorily One more question Judge Marshall he said suavely as if he had not heard a word that Carolyn Drake had said You knew missus Selim before her arrival in Hamilton with missus Dunlap I believe Just when and where did you meet her CHAPTER ELEVEN You are damned impertinent sir Judge Marshall shouted the ends of his waxed grey mustache trembling with anger Then I take it that you do not wish to divulge the circumstances of your friendship with missus Selim Dundee asked Friendship the old man snorted Your implications sir are dastardly I met missus Selim or rather Nita Leigh as she was introduced to me only once several years ago when I was in New York Naturally Just a moment Judge You say she was introduced to you as Nita Leigh Then you knew her as an actress I presume I refuse to submit to such a cowardly attack sir Attack Judge Dundee repeated with assumed astonishment I merely thought you might be able to shed a little light on the past of the woman who has been murdered here today with a weapon you admit to having owned However The elderly ex judge stared at his tormentor for a moment as if murder was in his heart He gasped twice then suddenly his whole manner changed I apologize Dundee You must realize how But that is beside the point I met Nita Leigh at er at a social gathering arranged by some New York friends of mine She was young attractive more refined than er than the average young woman in musical comedy Naturally I told her if she was ever in Hamilton to look me up And she did And because she was more refined than the average young woman in musical comedy than the average chorus girl to put it simply Dundee took him up you company operated with missus Dunlap to introduce her to your most intimate friends including your wife Oh Hugo Why didn t you tell me Karen Marshall wailed You see sir what you are doing Judge Marshall stormed I am truly sorry if I have distressed you missus Marshall Dundee protested sincerely But He shrugged and turned again to the husband I understand you were missus Selim s landlord May I ask how much rent she paid The house rents for one hundred dollars a month furnished And did missus Selim pay her rent promptly Dundee persisted Since this is the twenty fourth of May sir missus Selim s rent for June was not yet due Not before poor little Karen could Dundee force himself to ask what inevitably would have been his next question one which could not have been evaded as the ex judge had evaded the other two questions Is it not true Judge Marshal that Nita Leigh Selim paid you no rent at all But there were other ways to find out Look here Dundee a brusque voice challenged and the detective whirled to face Polly Beale It was like her he thought with a slight grin to address him as one man to another Yes Miss Beale I m no fool and I don t think any of my friends here are either though two or three of them have acted like it today the masculine looking girl stated flatly You ve made it very plain that any one of us here except the Sprague man could have stolen Hugo s gun and silencer Has the gun been found It has not Miss Beale O K The queer girl snapped her fingers I move that you or Captain Strawn search the men for the weapon and that I search the Women Wait she harshly stopped a flurry of feminine protests I ll ask you Dundee to search me first yourself I believe the technical term is frisking isn t it Then frisk me Here is my handbag I wore no coat except this and she pointed to the jacket of her tweed suit As she strode toward the detective Clive Hammond sprang after her with an oath and a sharp command Shut up Clive I m not married to you yet she retorted but her eyes were gentler than her voice His face burning with embarrassment Dundee went through the traditional gestures of police frisking running his hands rapidly down the girl s tall sturdy body slapping her pockets And his fingers fumbled sadly as he opened her tooled leather handbag Satisfied Polly Beale demanded and at Dundee s miserable nod the girl faced her friends Well come along girls Lord What a girl Dundee muttered to Strawn as the young Amazon herded Flora Miles Penny Crain Karen Marshall Carolyn Drake Lois Dunlap and Janet Raymond into the dining room Silently and almost meekly as if shamed into submission by Polly Beale s example John Drake Tracey Miles Clive Hammond Judge Marshall and Dexter Sprague permitted Captain Strawn and Sergeant Turner to search them How about the guest closet and the cars Dundee asked of Strawn in a low voice when the fruitless unpleasant task was finished Gone over with a fine tooth comb long ago Strawn assured him gloomily And not a hiding place in or outside the house that the boys haven t poked into including the meadow as far as anyone could throw from the bedroom window The women were filing back into the room some pale some flushed but all able to look each other in the eye again With surprising jauntiness Polly Beale saluted Dundee Nothing more deadly on any of us than Flora s triple deck compact I thank you with all my heart Miss Beale Dundee said sincerely And now I think you may all go to your homes Of course you understand he interrupted a chorus of relieved ejaculations that all of you will be wanted for the inquest which will probably be held Monday And what s more Captain Strawn cut in to show his authority I want all of you to hold yourselves ready for further questioning at any time There was a stampede for coats and hats a rush for cars as if the house were on fire or Dundee reflected wryly as if those he had tortured were afraid he would change his mind Rushing away with hatred of him in their hearts Only Penny Crain held back maneuvering for a chance to speak with him I don t have to go with the rest do I she begged in a husky whisper And why not Dundee grinned at her but he was glad there was no hatred in her eyes I m attached to the district attorney s office too aren t I Right And you ve been a brick this evening I don t know what I should have done without you Well I can t see that you ve done much with me she gibed But I d like to stick around if you re going to do some real Sherlocking Can t be done Penny I want to stay here alone for a while and mull things over But I d like to have a long talk with you tomorrow Come to Sunday dinner Mother loves murder mysteries she suggested Then realization swept over her Her brown eyes widened filled with terror Stop thinking one of us did it Stop I tell you Can you stop Penny he asked gently But she fled from him sobbing wildly for the first time that long horrible evening Dundee watching from the doorway of the lighted hall saw the chauffeur open the rear door of the Dunlap limousine saw Penny catapult herself into Lois Dunlap s outstretched arms When did the Dunlap chauffeur call for his mistress he asked Strawn who stood beside him About ten minutes after you arrived Strawn answered wearily Said he d dropped missus Dunlap and the Selim woman at about two thirty and had been ordered to return around six thirty Knows nothing of course The chief of the Homicide Squad drew a deep breath Well Bonnie he has nothing on me In spite of all the palaver I don t know nothing either You need some dinner chief Dundee suggested And the boys must be getting hungry too Somebody s got to guard the house I suppose Strawn gloomed Not that it will do any good And what about that maid that Carr woman Shall I lock her up on general principles No I want to have another talk with her and if she bucks at spending the night here I ll take her to the Rhodes House and turn her over to my old friend Mother Rhodes We haven t anything on her you know No nor on anybody else except that old fool Marshall and we can t clap him into jail yet Strawn agreed his grey eyes twinkling Take your crew on in chief Dundee urged I ll stick till midnight or longer if you don t mind You can arrange to have a couple of the boys to relieve me about twelve And by the way will you telephone me the minute you get hold of Ralph Hammond Well maybe not so quick as all that Strawn drawled I ll take the first crack at that baby my lad Not so dumb am I Bonnie boy Not so dumb I can put two and two together as well as the next one pretty near as well as the district attorney s new special investigator Although Bonnie Dundee had taken Captain Strawn s none too gentle parting gibe with good grace it was a very thoughtful young detective who set about locking himself into the house in which Nita Selim had been murdered Captain Strawn had beaten him to the job that evening by at least twenty minutes Had the old detective stumbled upon something which Dundee for all his spectacular thoroughness had overlooked or had been unable to turn up because Strawn had suppressed it What if Strawn s parting boast was not an idle one and he really had the goods on Ralph Hammond Had the old chief been laughing up his sleeve during the farce of playing out the death hand at bridge and during the merciless quizzing of old Judge Marshall But Dundee s native common sense quickly routed his gloom Captain Strawn was too direct in his methods too afraid of antagonizing the rich and influential to have permitted even a special investigator from the district attorney s office to torment those twelve people needlessly Probably Strawn feeling a little hurt at having played second fiddle all evening had simply wanted to get him fussed was even now chuckling over the effect of his parting boast Much cheered Dundee lingered in the dining room whose windows he had made fast against any intrusion so that his task of guarding the house alone might be minimized As he glanced at the table with its silver plates heaped with tiny sandwiches of caviar and anchovy paste its little silver boats of olives and sweet pickles he discovered that he was very hungry indeed As he munched the drying sandwiches and sipped charged water the various liquors for cocktails on the sideboard offered a temptation which he sternly resisted Dundee s thought boiled and churned throwing up picture after picture of Nita Selim alive and then dead of Penny Crain bless her helping him at the expense of her loyalty to life long friends of Flora Miles lying desperately and then confessing to a shameful theft of Karen Marshall gallantly playing out the death hand of Karen s stricken childish face when she learned that her elderly husband had met and at least flirted with Nita Selim at a chorus girls party At that last picture Dundee flushed so that his skin prickled Had he made a fool of himself or was he right in his suspicion that Hugo Marshall had given Nita Selim this cottage rent free That point should be easily settled at any rate Ruefully reflecting that appetizers do not make a satisfactory meal he betook himself to the dead woman s bedroom Yes his memory had served him well Here was her desk a small feminine affair of rosewood set in the corner of the room nearest the porch door The desk was not locked As Dundee let down the slanting lid whose polish was marred with many fingerprints he saw that its contents were in a hopeless jumble So Strawn had beaten him to this too Had he found an all important clue in one of the many little pigeon holes and drawers stuffing it into his pocket just before a bumptious young special investigator had arrived But Dundee s returning gloom was instantly dispelled Here was Nita s checkbook a flutter of filled in stubs attached to only one remaining blank check So Nita had banked with the Hamilton National Bank of which John C Drake who apparently hated his fattish fussy wife was a vice president Another tiny fact to be tucked away She had opened her account apparently on April twenty one the day of her arrival in Hamilton the guest and employe of missus Peter Dunlap Probably Lois Dunlap had advanced her the two hundred dollars as first payment for her prospective work in organizing a Little Theater movement in Hamilton Turning rapidly through stubs Dundee stopped twice whistling softly with amazement each time For on April twenty eighth and again on May fifth Nita Selim had deposited five thousand dollars Where had she got the money Were the sums transfers from accounts in New York banks But it was hardly likely that a little Broadway hanger on had had so much hard cash on deposit Then where had she got it five thousand dollars at a time here in Hamilton Blackmail Hastily but thoroughly Dundee ran through the remaining check stubs No record at all of a check for rent made out to Judge Hugo Marshall But there was a stub that interested him Check No seventeen Nita had spent her money lavishly was filled in as follows in Nita s pretty backhand No seventeen nine thousand dollars May nine nineteen thirty To Trust Dept For Investment Had John C Drake who as vice president in charge of trusts and investments had doubtless handled the check wondered at all where the nine thousand dollars had come from One other revelation came out of the twenty three filled in stubs On every Monday Nita Selim had drawn a check for forty dollars to her maid Lydia Carr Again Dundee whistled Forty dollars a week was he wagered to himself more money than any other maid in Hamilton was lucky enough to receive Nita in a new light an over generous Nita Or was Nita herself paying blackmail on a small scale He reached into a pigeon hole whose contents a thick packet of unused envelopes had not been disturbed by Strawn and was about to remove an envelope in which to place the all important checkbook when he noticed something slightly peculiar An envelope in the middle of the packet looked rather thicker than an empty case should But it was not empty And across the face of the expensive cream colored linen paper was written in that same pretty very legible backhand TO BE OPENED IN CASE OF MY DEATH JAUNITA LEIGH SELIM His heart hammering painfully and his fingers trembling Dundee drew out the two close written sheets of creamy notepaper After all who had better right than he to open it Was he not the representative of the district attorney And he hadn t damaged the envelope It had opened very easily indeed its flap had yielded instantly to his thumb nail Wait It had been too easy Before unfolding the letter or whatever it was Dundee examined the flap of the envelope Yes He was not the first to open it since its original sealing God grant he hadn t destroyed any tell tale fingerprints in his criminal haste to learn any secret that Nita Selim had recorded here Perhaps Nita herself had unsealed the letter to make an addition or a correction Well whatever damage had been done was done now and he might as well read Five minutes later Bonnie Dundee was racing through the dining room pushing open the swinging door that led into the butler s pantry Where the devil were the steps that led down into the basement A precious minute was lost before he discovered that a door in the dark back hall opened upon the steep stairs An unshaded light dangling from the ceiling revealed the furnace in one corner of the big basement laundry equipment in another He plunged on That must be the maid s room behind that closed door God What if she had escaped while he had been munching caviar and anchovy sandwiches A fine guard he d been And it wasn t as if he hadn t had a dim suspicion of the truth The knob turned easily He flung open the door And then his knees nearly gave way so tremendous was his relief For there on the thin mattress of a white enameled iron bed lay the woman he so ardently desired to see She had apparently been asleep and the noise he had made had startled her into panicky wakefulness Instinctively her hand flew to the ruined left side of her face that hideous expanse of livid flesh scarred and ridged so that it did not look human What Who Lydia Carr gasped struggling to a sitting position only to fall back as nausea swept over her You remember me Dundee panted Dundee of the district attorney s office I questioned you this afternoon The woman closed the single eye that had escaped the accident which had marred her face so hideously I remember I m sick I told you all I know Lydia why didn t you tell me that it was your mistress missus Selim who did that Dundee demanded sternly pointing to the woman s sightless left eye and ruined cheek CHAPTER TWELVE Lydia Carr still clothed in the black cotton dress and white apron of her maid s uniform struggled to a sitting position on the edge of her basement room bed No no That s a lie It was an accident I tell you my own fault Who dared to say Nita Miss Nita did it Better lie down Lydia Dundee suggested gently I won t want you fainting You ve had a hard day with the abscessed tooth the dope the dentist gave you and other things I don t wonder that you lost your head went a little crazy perhaps The detective s sinister implication seemed to make no impression at all upon the woman with the scarred face I asked you she gasped her single eye glaring at him who dared say Nita burned me It was Nita herself who told me Dundee answered softly Just a few minutes ago Holy Mother the maid gasped and crossed herself dazedly Let her think the dead woman had appeared to him in a vision Dundee told himself Perhaps her confession would come the quicker The maid began to rock her gaunt body her arms crossed over her flat chest My poor little girl Even in death she thinks of me she s sorry She sent me a message didn t she Tell me She was always trying to comfort me sir The poor little thing couldn t believe I d forgiven her as soon as she done it Tell me Yes Dundee agreed his eyes watching her keenly She sent you a message of a sort But I can t give it to you until you have told me all about the accident in which you were burned I ll tell Lydia promised eagerly Gone were the harshness and secretiveness with which she had met his earlier questioning You see sir I loved Miss Nita I called her Nita if you don t mind sir I loved her like she was my own child And she was fond of me too fonder of me than of anybody in the world she used to tell me when some man had hurt her bad And there was always some man or other she was so sweet and so pretty Well I found her in the bathroom one day just ready to drink carbolic acid to kill her poor little self When was that Lydia Dundee interrupted It was in February Sunday the ninth of February Lydia went on still rocking in an agony of grief I tried to take the glass out of her hands She d poured a lot of the stuff out of the bottle You see she was already in a fit of hysterics or she d never have tried to kill herself It was my own fault trying to take the glass away from her like I did She flung the acid into your face Dundee asked shuddering She didn t know what she was doing the woman cried glaring at him Nearly went out of her mind they told me at the hospital because she d hurt me A private room in the best hospital in New York she got for me trained nurses night and day and so many doctors fussing around me I wanted to fire the whole outfit and save some of my poor girl s money which I don t know till this day how she got hold of Dundee let her sob and rock her arms for a while unmolested In February Nita Selim had had to borrow money to pay doctor and hospital bills Had borrowed it or gold dug it And in May she had been rich enough to have nine thousand dollars to invest Lydia you never forgave Nita Selim for ruining your life as well as your face Dundee charged her suddenly You re a liar she cried passionately I know what I felt It s my face and my life ain t it I tell you I didn t even bear a grudge against her the poor little thing Eating her heart out with sorrow for what she d done till the very day of her death Always trying to make it up to me paying me too much money for the handful of work I had to do what with her eating out nearly all the time and throwing away stockings the minute they got a run in em Forgive her I d have crawled from here to New York on my hands and knees for Nita Leigh Dundee studied her horribly scarred face made more horrible now by what looked like genuine grief Lydia who was the man over whom your mistress wanted to commit suicide The single tear reddened eye glared at him suspiciously then became wary I don t know Was it Dexter Sprague Lydia Sprague She spat the name out contemptuously No She didn t know him then except to speak to at the moving picture studio When did he become her lover Lydia Dundee asked casually The woman stiffened became menacingly hostile Who says he was her lover You can t trick me mister Detective I d cut my tongue out before I d let you make me say one word against my poor girl Dundee shrugged He knew a stone wall when he ran up against one Lydia he began again after a thoughtful pause I have proof that Nita Selim was sure you had never forgiven her for the injury she did you His fingers touched the letter in his pocket that incredible Last Will and Testament which Nita had written the day before she was murdered And that s another lie the woman cried shaking with anger She struggled to her feet stood swaying dizzily a moment Come upstairs with me to her room and I ll show you some proof that I had forgiven her Come along I tell you Trying to make me say I killed my poor girl when I d have died for her Come on I tell you And Dundee wondering beginning to doubt his own conviction a little that conviction which had sprung full grown out of Nita s strange informal will and which had seemed to explain everything followed Lydia Carr from her basement room to the bedroom in which Nita had been murdered See this and Lydia Carr snatched up the powder box from the dressing table Her long bony fingers busied themselves with frantic haste and suddenly into the silence of the room came the tinkle of music I bought her this for a present out of my own money soon as I got out of the hospital the maid s voice shrilled over the slow sweet tinkly notes It s playing her name song Juanita It was playing that song when she died I stood there in the doorway and heard it and she pointed toward the door leading from Nita s room into the back hall She loved it and used it all the time because I gave it to her And this She set the musical powder box upon the dressing table and rushed across the room to one of the several lamps that Dundee had noticed on his first survey of the room It was the largest and gaudiest of the collection a huge bowl of filigreed bronze set with innumerable stones as large as marbles or larger Red yellow and green stones that must have cast a strange radiance over the pretty head that had been wont to lie just beneath it on the heaped lace pillows of the chaise lounge Dundee reflected As if Lydia had read his thoughts she jerked at the little chain which hung from the bottom of the big bronze bowl against the heavy metal standard I gave her this saved up for it out of my own money she was assuring him with savage triumph in proving her point And she loved it so she brought it with us when we came from New York It won t light It was working all right last night because my poor little girl was lying there looking so pretty under the colored lights With strong twists of her big hands Lydia began to unscrew the filigreed bronze bowl As she lifted it off she exclaimed blankly Why look The light bulb s broke But Dundee had already seen not only the broken light bulb but the explanation of the queer noise that Flora Miles had described hysterically over and over as a bang or a bump The chaise lounge stood between the two windows that opened upon the drive And at the head of it stood the big lamp just a few inches from the wall and only a foot from the window frame upon which doctor Price had pencilled the point to indicate the end of the imaginary line along which the shot which killed Nita Leigh Selim had traveled The bang or bump which Flora Miles had heard had been made by the knocking of the big lamp against the wall Undoubtedly the one who had bumped into the lamp was Nita s murderer or murderess in frantic haste to make an escape And that meant that the murderer had fled toward the back hall not through the window in front of which he had stood not through the door leading onto the front porch A little progress at least But Lydia was not through proving that she had forgiven her mistress She was snatching things from Nita s clothes closet See these mules with ostrich feathers I give em to my girl And this bed jacket I embroidered the flowers on it with my own hands Through her flood of proof Dundee heard the whir of a car s engine then the loud banging of a car s door Running footsteps on the flagstone path Dundee reached the front door just as the bell pealed shrilly Hello Dundee Awfully glad I caught you before you left Is poor Lydia still here Come in mister Miles Dundee invited searching with a puzzled frown the round blond face of Tracey Miles Yes Lydia is still here Why Then I m in luck and I think Lydia is too poor old girl You see Dundee Miles began to explain as he took off his new straw hat to mop his perspiring forehead the crowd all ganged up when our various cars reached Sheridan Road and by unanimous vote we elected to drive over to the Country Club for a meal in one of the small private dining rooms to escape the questions of the morbidly curious you know Yes What about it Dundee interrupted impatiently Well I admit we were all pretty hungry in spite of well of course we were all fond of Nita but What about Lydia Dundee cut him short I m getting to it old boy Miles protested with the injured air of an unappreciated small boy While we were waiting for our food somebody said Poor Lydia What s going to become of her And somebody else said that it was harder on her Nita s death I mean than on anybody else because Nita was all she had in the world and then Lois Lois is always practical you know ran to telephone Police Headquarters to see what had been done with Lydia and to see if it would be all right for Flora and me to take her home with us Just a minute Miles Whom did missus Dunlap talk to at Headquarters Why Captain Strawn of course Miles answered He told Lois that you were still out here questioning Lydia again and that it was all right with him whatever you decided So as soon as I had finished eating I drove over Is missus Miles with you Dundee interrupted again Well no Miles admitted uncomfortably You see the girls felt a little squeamish about coming back even on an errand of mercy Dundee grinned He had no doubt that Flora Miles had emphatically refused the possibility of another gruelling interview Why do you and missus Miles want to take Lydia home with you he asked To give her a home and a job Miles answered promptly She knows us we re used to her poor old scarred face and the youngsters Tam and Betty are not a bit afraid of her In fact Betty pats that scarred cheek and says over and over Poo Lyddy Poo Lyddy Betty oves Lyddy and Tam he s T A Miles junior you know and we call him Tam from the initials because he hates being called Junior and two Tracey s are a nuisance I gather that you want to hire Lydia as a nurse for the children Dundee interrupted the fond father s verbose explanations Right old man You see our nurse left us yesterday Wait here Miles I ll speak to Lydia She s in missus Selim s bedroom By the way Miles since you and your wife are kind enough to want to take Lydia in and give her a home and a job I think it only fair to tell you that it is highly improbable that Lydia Carr will take any job at all You mean Miles gasped his ruddy face turning pale I say Dundee it s absurd to think for a minute that good old faithful Lydia had a thing to do with Nita s murder I rather think you re right about that Miles Dundee interrupted Now will you excuse me He found Lydia where he had left her in her dead mistress bedroom The tall gaunt woman was crouching beside the chaise longue her arms outstretched to encircle a little pile of the gifts she claimed to have given Nita Selim to prove that she bore no grudge for the terrible injury her mistress had done her At Dundee s entrance she flung up her head and the detective saw that tears were streaming from both the sightless eye and the unharmed one Taking his seat on the chaise longue Dundee explained gently but briefly the offer which Tracey Miles had just made They want me she gasped brokenly incredulously and her fingers faltered to her horrible cheek I didn t think anybody but my poor girl would have me around It is true they want you Dundee assured her But you don t have to take a job now unless you wish Lydia What do you mean the maid demanded harshly her good eye hardening with suspicion Lydia the young detective began slowly and almost praying that he was doing the right thing when I woke you up tonight to question you I said that Nita herself had just told me that it was she who had burned your face And you asked me if she had also given you a message Yes sir the maid interrupted with pitiful eagerness And you ll tell me now You don t still think I killed her do you No I don t think you killed your mistress Lydia but I think if you would you could help me find out who did Dundee assured her gravely No wait and he drew from his pocket the envelope inscribed To Be Opened In Case of My Death Juanita Leigh Selim Do you recognize this handwriting Lydia It was wrote by her own hand the maid answered her voice husky with tears Is that the message sir You never saw it before Dundee asked sharply No no I didn t know my poor girl was thinking about death Lydia moaned I thought she was happy here She was tickled to pieces over being taken up by all them society people and on the go day and night Lydia this is missus Selim s last will and testament Dundee interrupted withdrawing the sheets slowly and unfolding them It was written yesterday and it begins Knowing that any of us may die any time and that I Juanita Leigh Selim have good cause to fear that my own life hangs by a thread that may break any minute What did my poor girl mean Lydia Carr cried out vehemently She wasn t sick ever I think Lydia that she feared exactly what happened today murder And I want you to tell me who it was she feared For I believe you know The woman shrank from him until she was sitting on her lean haunches her hands flattening against her cheeks For a long minute she did not attempt to answer Her right eye widened enormously then slowly grew as expressionless as the milky left ball I don t know she said dully Then with vehement emphasis I don t know If I did I d kill him with my own hands Dundee had no choice but to take her word You said there was a message for me Lydia reminded him I ll read you her will first Dundee said quietly lifting the sheets again I am herewith setting down my last will and testament in my own handwriting I do here and now solemnly will and bequeath to my faithful and beloved maid Lydia Carr all property including all moneys stocks and personal belongings of which I die possessed To me Lydia whispered To me To you Lydia Dundee assured her gravely Then I can have all her pretty clothes to keep always And her money to do as you like with if the court accepts this will for probate as I think it will regardless of the fact that it is very informal and was not witnessed But she didn t have any money Lydia protested Nothing but what missus Dunlap paid her in advance for the work she was going to do Lydia your mistress died possessed of nearly ten thousand dollars Dundee fixed her bewildered grey eye with his blue ones Ten thousand dollars All of which she got right here in Hamilton And I want you to tell me how she got it But I don t know I don t believe she had it Dundee shrugged Either this woman would perjure her soul to protect her mistress name from scandal or she really knew nothing That is all of the will itself Lydia he went on finally except her command that her body be cremated without funeral services of any kind and that nobody be allowed to accompany the remains to the crematory except yourself and missus Peter Dunlap in case her death takes place in Hamilton She did love missus Dunlap Lydia sobbed Oh my poor little girl And there is also a note for you which I took the liberty of reading in which missus Selim minutely describes the clothes in which she wishes to be cremated as well as the fashion in which her hair is to be dressed Let me see it Lydia plunged forward on her knees and snatched at the papers he held For God s sake let me see CHAPTER THIRTEEN I ll read you the note Lydia but I can t let you touch it Dundee said sternly taking good care that she should not touch either the paper on which the note to herself had been written or the sheet which contained that strange informal will Informal in spite of the dead woman s obvious effort to couch it in legal phraseology Was Lydia s frenzy assumed Did she hope to leave fingerprints now which would account for fingerprints she had already left upon it Was it not possible that Lydia s had been the prying fingers which had opened the envelope after Nita Selim had sealed it with God only knew what fears in her heart If so Lydia Carr had found that she was her mistress sole legatee Revenge coupled with greed What better motive for murder could a detective ask And who had had so good an opportunity as Lydia Carr to dispose of the weapon The woman crouched back on her haunches an agony of pleading in her single eye Lydia I think you know already what this note tells you Dundee said slowly To his astonishment the maid nodded the tears starting again I asked her once what she wanted to keep that old dress for and she she said I d find out some day but I never dreamed she d want it for a oh my God for a shroud For the second time that evening Lydia Carr completely routed Dundee s carefully worked up case against her It was inconceivable he told himself that a mind cunning enough to have executed this murder would give itself away in such a fashion If she had indeed pried among her mistress papers and found the will and note would she not from the most primitive instinct of self preservation have pretended total ignorance of the note s contents I ll read the note Lydia he said gently It is addressed My precious old Lydia She was always calling me that the maid sobbed And she writes If you ever read this it will be because I m dead and you ll know that I ve tried to make it up to you the only way I knew I never could believe you really forgave me but maybe you will now And there is one last thing I want you to do for me Lydia darling You remember that old royal blue velvet dress of mine that you were always sniffing at and either trying to make me give away or have made over And remember that I told you that you d know some time why I kept it Well I want you to lay me out in it Lydia Such a funny old fashioned shroud isn t it But with dresses long again maybe it won t look so funny and there ll be nobody but you and Lois to see me in it because I ve said so in my will And I want my hair dressed as it was the only time I ever wore the royal blue velvet A French roll Lydia with little curls coming out the left side of it and hanging down to the left ear You brush the hair straight up the back of the head gather it together and tie a little bit of black shoestring around it then you twist the hair into a roll and spread it high pinning it down on each side of the head And don t forget the little curls on the left side I hope I have enough hair but if it hasn t grown long enough you know where those switches are that I had made when I first bobbed my hair You won t mind touching me when I m dead will you Lydia I do love you Nita Dundee was silent for a minute after he had finished reading the strange note and had returned it to the envelope along with the will At last speaking against a lump in his throat he broke in on the desolate sobbing of Nita s maid Lydia how old was your mistress You won t put it in the papers will you Lydia pleaded She she was thirty three But not a soul knew it except me And will you tell me how old the royal blue velvet dress is he continued Also how long since girls dressed their hair in a French roll The dress is twelve or thirteen years old Lydia said her voice dull now with grief I know because I used to do dressmaking during the war And it was during the war that girls wore their hair that way I did mine in a Psyche knot but the French roll was more stylish Did your mistress ever tell you about the one time she wore the dress Lydia shook her head No She wouldn t talk about it just said I d know sometime why she kept it Royal blue velvet it is the skirt halfway to the ankles and sleeves with long pointed ends lined with gold taffeta and finished off with gold tassels It s in a dress bag hanging in her closet Do you think it was her wedding dress Lydia Dundee suggested the idea suddenly flashing into his mind I don t know I didn t ask her that Lydia denied dully Can I take it with me and the switches she had made out of her curls I ll have to get authority to remove anything from the house Lydia Dundee told her But I am sure you will be permitted to follow missus Selim s instructions So you re going to accept the Miles offer of a job as nurse Yes I d rather work mister and missus Miles have always been specially nice to me and I I could love their children They re not afraid of me Perhaps you re wise Dundee agreed By the way Lydia did missus Selim have a pistol in her possession at any time during the past week The maid shook her head Not that I seen And if she d got one because she was afraid she d a kept it handy and I d a been bound to see it Convinced of her sincerity he was about to let her go to pack her bag when another belated question occurred to him Lydia will you tell me what engagements missus Selim had this last week The woman scowled fanatically jealous Dundee guessed of her mistress reputation but at last she answered defiantly Let me see mister Sprague had Sunday dinner here and spent the afternoon but Sunday night it was young mister Ralph Hammond He come whenever she d let him Monday night Oh yes She had dinner at the Country Club with the Mileses and the Drakes and the Dunlaps mister Miles brought her home because mister Sprague wasn t invited Tuesday night let me think Yes that s the night Judge Marshall was here Nita had sent for him to talk about finishing up the attic So that was the business engagement which Judge Marshall had hemmed and hawed over Dundee reflected triumphantly and Wednesday night Lydia was continuing with a certain pride in her mistress popularity she was at a dinner party at the Dunlaps Did mister Peter Dunlap ever call on missus Selim alone Him Lydia was curiously resentful He wasn t ever here Nita said to me she wished mister Peter liked her as well as Mis Lois did Thursday night mister Ralph Hammond took her somewhere to dinner to some other town I think but I wasn t awake when they got home Nita never would let me set up for her said I needed my rest So I always went to bed early And yesterday Friday Dundee demanded tensely For Friday she had been driven to making her last will and testament She was home all day but about half past four mister Drake came Lydia said slowly as if she too were wondering She was awfully restless couldn t set still or eat I ought to have suspicioned something but she was often like that lately mister Drake stayed about an hour I didn t see him leave because I was cooking Nita s dinner But little good it did because she didn t eat it so there was plenty for mister Sprague when he dropped in about seven Did Sprague spend the evening I guess so but I don t know Nita made me take the Ford and drive into town for a picture show She was

none	none	when I got back and but she checked herself hastily Did Nita seem strange troubled excited Did she look as if she d been crying Dundee prodded I didn t see her the maid acknowledged I knocked on her door but she told me to go on to bed that she wouldn t need me But now I think back her voice sounded queer Maybe she was crying but I don t know And this morning She seemed all right just excited about the party and worried about my tooth mister Ralph Hammond come to make the estimates on finishing up the top floor and we left him here What was her attitude toward mister Miles when he dropped in on her this morning Dundee interrupted mister Miles Lydia echoed frowning He wasn t here this morning or if he was it was after Nita and I left for town While the maid was packing a bag which Dundee would examine before she was allowed to take it away with her the detective rejoined Tracey Miles who had made himself as comfortable as possible in the living room Lydia s going with you and is grateful for your wife s kindness Dundee informed him and felt his heart warm to the boresome egotistical little cherub of a man when he saw how Miles face lit up with real pleasure By the way Miles you saw Ralph Hammond when you called here this morning didn t you Yes Miles answered with some reluctance He answered the door when I rang and told me Lydia and Nita had gone into town mister Miles Dundee began slowly throwing friendliness and persuasion into his voice I know how all you folks stick together but I d appreciate it a lot if you d tell me frankly whether you noticed anything unusual in Hammond s manner this morning Unusual Miles repeated frowning He was a little short with me because he was busy and I suspect a little jealous because I d come calling on Nita He broke off abruptly in obvious distress Look here Dundee I didn t mean to say that but I suppose you ll find out sooner or later Well the fact is the whole crowd knows Ralph Hammond was absolutely mad about Nita Selim Wanted to marry her and made no secret of it though we all thought or hoped it would be little Penny Crain He s been devoted to Penny for years and since Roger Crain made a mess of things and skipped out leaving Penny and her poor mother high and dry we ve all done our best to throw Penny and Ralph together But since Nita came to town Was Nita in love with Ralph Dundee cut in rather curtly for he had a curious distaste for hearing Penny Crain discussed in this manner Sometimes we were sure she was Miles answered She flirted with all of us men had a way with her of making every man she talked to think he was the only pebble on the beach But there was something special in the way she looked at Ralph Yes I think she was in love with him But then again he frowned she would treat him like a dog Seemed to want to drive him away from her but she always called him back Oh Lord he interrupted himself with a groan Now I suppose I have put my foot in it You ve got the damnedest way of making a chap tell everything he would cut his tongue out rather than spill Dundee But just because a young man s in love and happens not to show up at a party is no reason to think he sneaked up to the house and killed the woman he loved and wanted to marry For I m not so dumb that I haven t seen the drift of your damnable questions Dundee Do you know Ralph Hammond by any chance he concluded his round face red with anger No but I should like to meet him Dundee retorted He seems quite hard to locate this evening Well when you do meet him Tracey Miles began violently his blue eyes blazing with anger you ll soon find you ve been barking up the wrong tree There s not a cleaner finer straighter In fact he is a friend of yours Miles Dundee answered soothingly and I respect you for every word you ve said By the way did all of you go to the Country Club for dinner after you left here Somewhat mollified Miles answered All of us but Clive Hammond He said he was going to have a look around for Ralph himself Seemed to have an idea where he might find him And oh yes Sprague disappeared in the scramble He hasn t a car and nobody thought of offering him a lift Guess he took a bus into Hamilton Ah Here s Lydia Hello Lydia he called heartily to the woman who was standing tall and gaunt in the doorway Mighty glad you re coming to look after the kids From behind the black veil which draped her ugly black hat and hid her scarred face Lydia answered in the dull harsh voice that was characteristic of her Thank you sir I ll do my best She made no protest when Dundee with a word of embarrassed apology went rapidly through the heavy suitcase she had brought up from the basement with her And when he had finished his fruitless search she knelt and silently smoothed the coarse utilitarian garments he had disarranged Five minutes later Dundee was alone in the house where murder had been committed under such strange and baffling circumstances that afternoon He was not nervous but again he made a tour of inspection of the first floor and basement looking into closets and testing windows to make sure they were all locked Everywhere there were evidences of the thoroughness of the police detectives who had searched for the weapon with which Nita Selim had been murdered In the basement as he had subconsciously noted on his headlong dash to question Lydia Carr the furnace doors swung open and the lids of the laundry tubs had been left propped up after the unavailing search He plodded wearily up the basement stairs and on into the kitchen Perhaps the ice box had something fit to eat in it the fruit intended for Nita s and Lydia s Sunday breakfast Those caviar and anchovy sandwiches had certainly not stuck with him long He was making his way toward the electric refrigerator when he stopped as suddenly as if he had been shot The kitchen door which he had taken especial pains to assure himself was locked when he had made the rounds immediately after the departure of Captain Strawn and his men was standing slightly ajar Someone had entered this house Dundee stared blankly at the door which was equipped with a Yale lock Someone with a key But why had the door been left ajar To make escape more noiseless With the toe of his shoe Dundee pushed the door to and heard the click of the lock then all thought of food routed from his mind made a quick but almost silent dash into the dining room to secure one of the pair of tall wax tapers which in their silver candlesticks served as ornaments for the sideboard If the intruder was still in the house he could be nowhere but in that unfinished half of the gabled top story The nearer stairs were those in the back hall and Dundee took them two at a time regardless of the noise Who had preceded him stealthily By the aid of his lighted candle he discovered an electric switch at the head of the stairs flicked it on and found himself in a wide hall one wall of which was finished with buff tinted plaster and with three doors the other of rough boards with but a single door With his candle held high so that its light should not blind him and well aware that it made him a perfect target Dundee opened the unpainted door and found himself in the dark musty smelling room that had served Nita Selim and the Crains before her as a storeroom From the ceiling dangled a green cord ending in a cheap clear glass bulb but its light was sufficient to penetrate even the farthest low nooks made by the three gables He blew out his candle and dropped it as useless now A quick tour convinced him that nothing human was concealed behind one of Nita Selim s empty wardrobe trunks or behind one of the several pieces of heavy old furniture undoubtedly left behind by the dispossessed Crain family Big footprints on the thick dust which coated the floor showed him that he was being no more thorough than Captain Strawn s brace of plainclothes detectives had been much earlier that evening Two pairs of giant footprints With an exclamation he discovered a smaller narrow pair of prints and followed their winding trail all around and across the attic And then he remembered Ralph Hammond s footprints of course made that morning as he went about his legitimate business of measuring and estimating for the job of turning the storeroom into bedrooms and bathrooms Dundee had not realized that he was frightened until he was in the hall again facing one of the three doors in the plastered wall With surprise and some amusement he became aware that his hands were trembling and that his knees had a curious tendency to buckle The fact that the door directly in front of him was open about two inches served for some odd reason to steady his nerves Pushing the door wide open with his foot for he never forgot the possibility of incriminating fingerprints which might easily be obliterated he discovered a light switch near the door frame The instant illumination from a ceiling cluster revealed a large bedroom and less clearly another and smaller room beyond it facing as the house faced toward the south Knees and hands steady again he investigated the finished portion of the gabled story swiftly A charming layout he told himself Had Penny Crain once enjoyed this delightful little sitting room with its tiny balcony built out upon the sloping roof And it gave him pleasure to think that this big well furnished but not fussily feminine bedroom had once been hers as well as the small but perfect bathroom whose high narrow window overlooked the back garden The closets dresser drawers and highboy drawers were completely empty however of any traces of her occupancy or that of any other With these rooms going to waste why he suddenly asked himself had Nita Selim coaxed Judge Marshall to have the unfinished half of the gabled attic turned into bedrooms and baths Why couldn t Lydia have slept up here if Nita thought so much of her faithful and beloved maid But even as he asked himself the question Dundee realized that the answer to it had been struggling to attract his attention These rooms had not been wasted Someone had been occupying them as late as last night Weaving swiftly through the three rooms like a bloodhound on the scent Dundee collected the few but sufficient proofs to back up his intuitive conviction A copy of The Hamilton Evening Sun dated Friday May twenty three left in an armchair in the sitting room All windows raised about six inches from the bottom so that the night breeze stirred the hand blocked linen drapes And clinging to these drapes the faint but unmistakable odor of cigarette smoke Finally with a low cry of triumph Bonnie Dundee flung back the colored linen spread which covered the three quarter bed and discovered that the sheets and pillow cases though clean had beyond the shadow of a doubt been slept upon Bending so that his nose almost touched a pillow case he sniffed Pomade Who was the man who had slept in this bed last night CHAPTER FOURTEEN With the thrill of his discovery singing blithely along his nerves Bonnie Dundee Special Investigator for the District Attorney had at first hugged the intention of following the new trail alone Hadn t Captain Strawn taunted him not too good naturedly about his ability to get along without the younger man s help But he was glad both selfishly and unselfishly when half an hour later he threw open the front door of dead Nita s house to the chief of the Homicide Squad Carraway the fingerprint expert and the two plainclothesmen who had searched the top floor for the missing weapon or the murderer himself soon after the murder had been committed For if Strawn needed his help Dundee needed the expert machinery which Strawn captained And it was good to feel the grip of gratitude in the old chief s handclasp and to see the almost shy twinkle of apology in his hard old grey eyes Dundee led the way up the front stairs to the upper floor glad to hear the heavy tread of official feet behind him I guess you ve got it all doped out who the Selim woman s gentleman friend was Strawn commented genially as he followed Dundee into the pleasant big bedroom I believe I have but I need Carraway to prove my hunch Dundee acknowledged Eagerly swiftly he displayed his first tangible finds the open windows the drapes smelling of cigarette smoke the evening paper of the day before the faint odor and greasiness of barber s pomade upon the pillow case of the bed which had clearly been slept in since the linen was changed Now Collins Harmon Dundee whirled upon the two silent plainclothesmen I want to know what you saw in these rooms when you searched them early this evening that you don t see now You looked into the closets and drawers of course Yes sir Collins answered And they was all empty Dundee Me and Harmon didn t waste time smelling pillow cases and I admit we didn t pay no attention to that there newspaper Empty Dundee echoed Are you sure You too Harmon What are you driving at boy Captain Strawn asked indulgently Briefly with disappointment flattening his voice Dundee told of his finding the kitchen door ajar after he had made sure it was locked on his first rounds of the house I worked it out this way he continued despite Strawn s grin Dexter Sprague was Nita s lover as I had thought all along He was in the habit of spending the night here whenever Nita would give him an evening of her company He was here last night according to the maid Lydia Carr Nita sent her into Hamilton to a picture show Nita and Sprague quarreled last night but I am positive he spent the night here anyway Certainly there was no actual rupture since Sprague worded his note to her as he did I have another strong reason for thinking his belongings were here at least until noon today but that can wait for the moment Furthermore I am positive that Sprague descended by the backstairs and went around the house to join the cocktail party which was to follow the hen bridge party How do you make that out Bonnie Strawn asked his grin wiped away Try to remember how Sprague looked when you first got here Dundee suggested I saw him twenty minutes after you did but he was wearing an immaculate stiff collar and there were still traces of talcum powder over a close shave And you will remember that he said he had made a half hour s trip by bus and had walked the quarter of a mile from the bus stop on Sheridan Road to this house It was a mighty hot afternoon chief Not conclusive Strawn growled Then here s another straw to add to the weight of my conclusion Dundee went on unshaken You remember that Janet Raymond was on the front porch watching for Sprague while the death hand of bridge was being played Oh she tried to protect him Wait I ll read you the notes I made when I was questioning her I looked them up while I was waiting for you Here I had said to Miss Raymond You observed mister Sprague toiling down the rutty road hot and weary but romantic in the sunset And she answered stammering I I wasn t looking that way And I knew she was lying knew that she had been taken completely by surprise when Sprague suddenly appeared from the rear of the house What s more she betrayed herself and him by admitting that she was surprised Then because the girl is undoubtedly in love with Sprague and was mortally afraid he had killed Nita Selim she tried frantically to throw suspicion on Lydia Carr by telling how Lydia had failed to answer missus Dunlap s first ring Good Lord Wait a minute I want to think he interrupted himself to exclaim After a full minute while he had stood very still with his fingers pressed against his closed eyes Dundee began slowly I believe that s it Listen boys He turned to the two plainclothesmen urgent pleading in his voice Would you both take your oath that there was no bag say a small Gladstone overnight bag anywhere in these rooms when you searched them this evening The two detectives glanced at each other their faces reddening It was Harmon the older of the pair who swallowed hard before answering We d been told to look for a man hiding and for a gun Then he squared his shoulders as if to receive the blame like a man Yes sir There was a little black grip on the closet shelf I went through it myself but there wasn t no gun in it Just a pair of pajamas and a couple of shirts one of em dirty some socks and collars and a shaving kit Dundee drew a deep breath and clapped the red faced detective on the back in high good humor There simply had to be a bag somewhere he laughed This is the way of it Strawn Nita and Sprague rowed last night Sprague tried to make it up but Nita must have been through with him Probably told him last night to clear his things out and not come back She thought he had done so probably he did leave before she got up At any rate she was so sure he was gone and his things with him that she and Lydia went to town this morning and left Ralph Hammond here to go through the place as freely as he liked making his estimates on the job of finishing up the other half of this floor And Ralph but let that wait for the moment Got any real proof that it was Sprague who stayed here and not the Hammond boy Strawn interrupted shrewdly I m coming to the proof Dundee assured him or rather the rest of the proof that I haven t already given you You re damned hard to convince chief But let me go on with my theory which I think covers the facts At luncheon when Nita received that note from Sprague I imagine she got a hunch that he hadn t taken her seriously that he had not removed his belongings You remember Penny Crain said Nita had Lydia follow her into her bedroom as soon as Nita got home from the luncheon Well it s my hunch that Nita asked Lydia if Sprague s things were gone when she cleaned these rooms this morning and that Lydia said no Nita then probably told Lydia to pack them herself and I feel positive that Lydia did so for she must have felt safe when she protested to me that Sprague was not Nita s lover I also feel sure that Sprague arrived at least half an hour before he said he did by some back path across the meadow that he came up to these rooms that he considered his found his things packed but went about shaving and changing his shirt and collar regardless I also feel sure that Lydia followed him upstairs to explain and impress upon him that Nita had meant what she said And it is quite likely that she was not through picking up after him when he descended by the back stairs and surprised Janet Raymond on the front porch That accounts of course for Lydia s not hearing the kitchen bell the first time missus Dunlap rang Umm Strawn grunted What about the proofs you re holding back Come along chief you too Carraway Dundee answered and led the way into the bathroom I felt sure these rooms would yield a very definite clue even though Sprague when he sneaked back tonight to get his tell tale bag apparently made every effort to wipe his fingerprints off the furniture and bathroom fixtures Now Carraway if you ll step upon this little stool and look along the top of this medicine cabinet you ll find what I found and didn t touch The fingerprint expert did as he was told When he stepped down he was holding between the very tips of his fingers a safety razor blade No dust on it you see Dundee pointed out Now if you don t find Dexter Sprague s fingerprints on it my whole theory topples How am I going to know whose fingerprints they are till we get hold of Sprague Carraway asked reasonably We don t need him for that purpose at least Dundee assured him Downstairs in the living room on a little table in the southeast corner of the room you ll find a red glass ashtray which no one but Dexter Sprague used all evening It was clean and empty when I saw him use it first I think you ll find on it all the prints you need So you think Sprague killed her because she was through with him Strawn asked Dundee shook his head Since I don t like Dexter Sprague a little bit chief I d like to think so but CHAPTER FIFTEEN Bonnie Dundee s first thought upon awakening that Sunday morning was that it might prove to be rather a pity that his new bachelor apartment as he loved to call his three rooms at the top of a lodging house which had once been a fashionable private home faced south and west rather than east At the Rhodes House whose boarding house clamor and lack of privacy he had abandoned upon taking the flattering job and decent salary of Special Investigator attached to the District Attorney s office he had grown accustomed to using the hot morning sun upon his reluctant eyelids as an alarm clock But he continued the train of thought after discovering by his watch that it was not late only eight forty it was pretty darned nice having diggings like these Quiet and private For he was the only tenant now on the top floor His pleased lazy eyes roved over the plain severity but solid comfort of his bedroom and on past the open door to take in appreciatively the equally comfortable and masculine living room Pretty nice That leather upholstered couch and armchair had been a real bargain and he liked them all the better for being rather scuffed and shabby Then his eyes halted upon a covered cage swung from a pedestal Poor old Cap n Must be wondering when the devil I m going to get up and he swung out of bed lounged sleepily into the small living room and whisked the square of black silk from the cage The parrot formerly the property of murdered old missus Hogarth of the Rhodes House but for the past year the young detective s official Watson ruffled his feathers poked his green and yellow head between the bars of his cage and croaked hoarsely Hullo Hullo Hullo yourself my dear Watson Dundee retorted Your vacation is over old top It s back on the job for you and me both Which reminds me that I ought to be taking a squint at the Sunday papers to see how much Captain Strawn thought fit to tell the press He found The Hamilton Morning News in the hall just outside his living room door Listen Cap n NITA SELIM MURDERED AT BRIDGE Probably the snappiest streamer headline the News has had for many a day Now let s see He was silent for two minutes while his eyes leaped down the lesser headlines and the column one page one story of the murder Then Good old Strawn Not a word my dear Watson about your absurd master s absurd performance in having the death hand at bridge replayed Not a word about Ralph Hammond the missing guest Not a word about missus Tracey Miles being hidden away in the clothes closet while her hostess was being murdered In fact my dear Watson not a word about anything except Strawn s own theory that a hired gunman from New York or Chicago preferably Nita s home town New York of course sneaked up crouched in her window and bumped her off And life size photographs of the big footprints under the window to prove his theory By golly Cap n I clean forgot to tell my former chief that I d found Nita s will and note to Lydia He ll think I deliberately held out on him Well I can t sit here all day gossiping with you my dear Watson Work much work to be done then Sunday dinner with poor little Penny Four hours later a tired and dispirited young detective was climbing the stairs of an ugly five story walk up apartment house in which Penny Crain and her mother had been living since the financial failure and flight of the husband and father Roger Crain Hello there It was Penny s friendly voice hailing him from the topmost landing of the steep stairs All winded poor thing His tired unhappy eyes drank her in the freshness and sweetness of a domestic Penny so different from the thorny little office Penny who prided herself on her efficiency as secretary to the district attorney Penny in flowered voile with a saucy ruffled white apron But there were purplish shadows under her brown eyes and her gayety lasted only until he had reached her side Sh h h Have they found Ralph she whispered anxiously He could only answer No and he almost choked on the word Mother s all of a twitter at my having a detective to dinner she whispered trying to be gay again She fancies you ll be wearing size eleven shoes and a six shooter at your belt Yes Mother It s mister Dundee She did not look all of a twitter this pretty but rather faded middle aged little mother of Penny s A gentle dignity and patient sadness which Dundee was sure were habitual to her lay in the faded blue eyes and upon the soft sweet mouth But missus Crain was ushering him into the living room and its charm made him forget for the moment that the Crains were to be pitied because of their come down in life For every piece of furniture seemed to be authentic early American and the hooked rugs and fine brocaded damasks allied themselves with the fine old furniture to defeat the ugliness with which the Maple Court Apartments architect had been fiercely determined to punish its tenants Scuse me Gotta dish up Penny flung over her shoulder as she ran away and left him alone with her mother Dundee liked missus Crain for making no excuses about a maid they could not afford liked the way she settled into a lovely ancient rocking chair and set herself to entertain him while her daughter made ready the dinner Not a word was said about the horrible tragedy which had occurred the day before in the house which had once been her home They talked of Penny s work and the little gentlewoman listened eagerly with only the faintest of sighs as Dundee humorously described Penny s fierce efficiency and District Attorney Sanderson s keen delight in her work Bill Sanderson is a nice boy the woman of perhaps forty eight said of Hamilton s thirty five year old district attorney It is nice for Penny to work with an old friend of the family or was until And that was the nearest she came to mentioning the murder before Penny summoned them to the little dining room Because Penny was watching him and was obviously proud of her skill as a cook skill recently acquired he was sure Dundee ate as heartily as his carefully concealed depression would permit There was a beautifully browned two rib roast of beef pan browned potatoes new peas escalloped tomatoes and for dessert a gelatine pudding which Penny proudly announced was Spanish cream the secret of which she had mastered only that morning I was up almost at dawn to make it so that it would set in time she told him and by the quiver of her lip Dundee knew that it was not Spanish cream which had got her up I m going to help wash dishes he announced firmly and Penny with a quick intake of breath agreed Hadn t you better take a nap Mother she added a minute later as missus Crain with a slight flush on her faded cheeks began to stack the dessert dishes You mustn t lay a hand on these dishes or Bonnie and I will have our dishwashing picnic spoiled Run along now You need sleep dear Not any more than you do poor baby missus Crain quavered and then hurried out of the room since gentlewomen do not weep before strangers I called you Bonnie so Mother would know we are really friends Penny explained her cheeks red as she preceded him through the swinging door into the miniature kitchen You ll stick to that being friends I mean no matter what happens won t you Penny Dundee said in a low voice setting the fragile crystal dishes he carried upon the porcelain drainboard of the sink I knew you had something bad to tell me It s about Ralph I suppose Her husky voice was scarcely audible above the rush of hot water into the dishpan You d better tell me straight off Bonnie I m not a very patient person Are they going to arrest Ralph when they find him There wasn t a word in the paper about him this morning I m afraid they are Penny Dundee told her miserably Captain Strawn has a warrant ready but of course Oh you don t have to tell me you hope Ralph isn t guilty she cut in with sudden passionate vehemence Don t I know he couldn t have done it They always arrest the wrong person first the blundering idiots It was the thorny Penny again the Penny with glittering eyes which matched her nickname But Dundee felt better able to cope with this Penny I m afraid I m the chief idiot but you must believe that I m sorry it should be a friend of yours he told her and reached for the plate she had rinsed of its suds under the hot water tap Shoot the works she commanded with hard flippancy Of course I might have known that Captain Strawn s theory about a gunman was just dust in our eyes and that only a miracle could keep you from fastening on poor Ralph since he and the gun are both missing Naturally it wouldn t occur to you that it might be an outsider someone who had followed Nita and her lover Sprague from New York to kill her for having left him for Sprague Oh no Certainly not she gibed to keep from bursting into tears An outsider would hardly have had access to Judge Marshall s pistol and Maxim silencer he reminded her And Captain Strawn received a wire from a ballistics expert in Chicago this morning confirming our conviction that the same gun which fired the bullets against Judge Marshall s target fired the bullet which killed Nita Selim You ve washed that plate long enough Let me dry it now And there are other things Penny Such as she challenged in her angry husky contralto Sprague admitted to me this morning after I had confronted him with proofs that he sometimes slept in the upstairs bedroom I told you they were lovers Penny interrupted and that he slept there Friday night after he and Nita had quarreled He still contends that the row was over that movie of Hamilton business Dundee went on as if she had not spoken He admitted also that Nita had told him to take his things away when he left Saturday morning but he says it was only because she didn t want Ralph Hammond to find a man s belongings there if he had occasion to go into the upstairs rooms in making his estimates for the finishing up of the other side But he contends and Lydia Carr whom I also saw again this morning supports him in it that he stayed in the house occasionally when Nita was particularly nervous about being alone and that they were not lovers Pooh Don t wipe the flowers off that plate Here s another I m inclined to say Pooh too Penny Dundee assured her but Tracey Miles told me last night when he came to get Lydia that Nita really seemed to be in love with Ralph part of the time at least Nita thought enough of Dexter Sprague to send for him to come down here and to root her head off for him to get the job of making the movie Penny reminded him fiercely making a great splashing in the dishpan Then you don t think she was in love with Ralph Dundee asked Oh I don t know the girl cried I thought so sometimes had the grace to hope so anyway since Ralph was so crazy about her That s the point Penny Dundee told her gently Everyone I ve talked to this morning including Sprague seems sure that Ralph Hammond was mad about Nita Selim So of course he would kill her Penny scoffed bitterly Yes Penny when he discovered Sprague s easily recognized cravats draped over the mirror frame in a bedroom in Nita s house For they were there to be seen when Ralph went into that bedroom yesterday morning How do you know he saw them Because he left this behind him Dundee admitted reluctantly and wiped his hands before drawing an initialed silver pencil from his breast pocket I found it under the edge of the bed The initials are R H Yes I recognize it Penny admitted turning sharply away I gave it to him myself for a Christmas present I thought I could afford to give silver pencils away then Dad hadn t bolted yet She crooked an elbow and leaned her face against it for a moment Then she flung up her brown bobbed head defiantly Well Ralph must have been well in a pretty bad way since he loved Nita and wanted to marry her Dundee persisted painfully Remember that Polly Beale found him still there when she stopped to offer Nita a lift to Breakaway Inn It is not hard to imagine what took place We know that Polly curtly cancelled her luncheon engagement with Nita and the rest of you and went into town with Ralph after making sure that Clive would join them I saw young Hammond myself for an instant without knowing who he was and I remember now thinking that he looked far too ill to eat I was lunching at the Stuart House myself when they came into the dining room you know Plenty to hang him on I see Penny cried furiously There s a little more Penny Dundee went on Polly Beale and Clive Hammond were mortally afraid that Ralph would come to the cocktail party I m sure Clive made Ralph promise to stay away and that both Clive and Polly did not trust him to keep his promise That is why I am sure Clive beckoned Polly to join him in the solarium without entering the living room to speak to Nita You remember they said they stayed there all during the playing of If you call it the death hand again I ll scream All right They stayed there until Karen discovered the murder I am sure they chose that place because of its many windows they could watch for Ralph s car dash out and head him off Take him away by force if necessary to keep him from making a scene I believe they knew he had murder in his heart and that he would find a way to get a gun Have you also found out that he stole Hugo s gun yesterday I have found that it was possible for him to do so Dundee said slowly The butler was off for the afternoon until six o clock There was no one in the house but the nursemaid and the three months old baby Well And I suppose you think Clive and Polly didn t have a chance to head Ralph off as you say but that they did see him running away after he killed her Her voice was still brittle with anger but there were indecision and fear in it too No Dundee replied I don t think they saw him I feel pretty sure he came into the house by the back way and through the back hall into Nita s room He must have known Clive and Polly would be on the lookout for him At any rate I have proof that whoever shot Nita from in front of that window near the porch door fled toward the back hall And he told her of the big bronze lamp whose bulb had been broken reminding her of its place at the head of the chaise longue which was set between the two west windows That was the bang or bump Flora Miles heard while she was hiding in the closet he explained I suppose Flora has told all of you about it I thought so Muffled as she was in the closet it is unlikely that she could have heard Nita s frantic whisperings to Ralph I doubt if he spoke at all Nita must have been sure he was about to leave by the porch door Dimly there came the ring of the telephone With a curt word Penny excused herself to answer it Dundee went on polishing glasses with a fresh towel Bonnie Penny was coming back walking like a somnambulist her brown eyes wide and fixed That was Ralph And he doesn t even know Nita is dead CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
1084-145077-0000	train-other-500	Of course I recognized his voice instantly when he said That you Penny
none	none	 and it s a wonder I didn t scream said Penny Crain fighting her way up through dazed bewilderment to explain in detail in answer to Dundee s pelting questions 
1084-145077-0001	train-other-500	I said Of course Ralph Where have you been And he said in that coaxing teasing voice of his that I know so well Peeved Penny I don t blame you honey You really ought
none	none	 not to let me come over and explain why I stood you up last night but you will won t you Ni i ze Penny 
1084-145077-0002	train-other-500	That s exactly how he talked Bonnie Dundee Exactly
none	none	 Oh don t you see he couldn t know that Nita is dead 
1084-145077-0003	train-other-500	Did you ask him where he was Dundee asked finally No I just told him to come on over and he said I could depend on it that he wouldn t waste any time Oh Bonnie What shall we do
1084-145077-0004	train-other-500	Listen Penny Dundee urged rapidly You must realize that I ve got to see and hear but I don t want Ralph Hammond to see me until after he s had a talk with you Will you let me eavesdrop behind these portieres
1084-145077-0005	train-other-500	I know it s a beastly thing to do but Penny agreed at last and within ten minutes after that amazing telephone call Dundee
none	none	 from behind the portieres that separated the dining and living room 
1084-145077-0006	train-other-500	heard Penny greeting her visitor in the little foyer She had played fair had not gone out into the hall to whisper a warning
none	none	 if any warning was needed 
1084-145077-0007	train-other-500	He had seen Ralph Hammond enter the dining room of the Stuart House the day before in company with Clive Hammond and Polly Beale when the three had been strangers to him but Dundee told himself now that he would hardly have recognized the young man whom Penny was preceding into her living room
1084-145077-0008	train-other-500	The Ralph Hammond of Saturday had had a white drawn face and sick eyes But this boy Like his older brother Clive Ralph Hammond had dark red curling hair But unlike his brother s his eyes were a wide candid hazel
1084-145077-0009	train-other-500	the green iris thickly flecked with brown A little shorter than Clive a trifle more slender But that which held the detective s eyes was something less tangible but at once more evident than superlative masculine good looks
1084-145077-0010	train-other-500	It was a sort of shy joyousness and buoyance which flushed the tan of his cheeks sang in his voice made his eyes almost unbearably bright Before Penny Crain very pale and quiet could sink into the chair she was groping toward
1084-145077-0011	train-other-500	Ralph Hammond was at her side one arm going out to encircle her shoulders Don t look like that Penny Dundee heard him plead his voice suddenly humble You ve every right to be sore at me honey but please don t be
1084-145077-0012	train-other-500	I know I ve been an awful cad these last few weeks but I m myself again I m cured now Penny Wait Ralph Penny protested faintly holding back as he would have hugged her hard against his breast
1084-145077-0013	train-other-500	What about Nita Dundee saw the young man s face go darkly red but heard him answer almost steadily
none	none	 I hoped you d understand without making me put it into words honey 
1084-145077-0014	train-other-500	I m cured of Nita I can t express it any other way except to say I was sick and now I m cured You mean Penny faltered but with a swift imploring glance toward Dundee you don t love Nita any more
1084-145077-0015	train-other-500	You can t deny you were terribly in love with her Ralph
none	none	 Lois told us told me last night that Nita had told her in strictest confidence 
1084-145077-0016	train-other-500	that she had promised to marry you just Thursday night The boy s face was very pale as he dropped his hands from Penny s shoulders but Dundee from behind the portieres was not troubling to spy for the moment
1084-145077-0017	train-other-500	He was too indignant with Penny for having withheld from him the vital fact of Nita s engagement to Ralph Hammond That s true Penny Ralph was saying dully You have a right to know because I m asking you to marry me now
1084-145077-0018	train-other-500	I did propose to Nita again Thursday night and she did accept me I confess now I was wild with happiness Why did she refuse you before Penny cut in
1084-145077-0019	train-other-500	and Dundee silently thanked her for asking the question he would have liked to ask himself Was it because she wasn t sure she was in love with you You re making it awfully hard for me honey the boy protested then admitted humbly
1084-145077-0020	train-other-500	Of course you want to know and you should know No she said all along almost from the first that she loved me more than I could love her but that there were reasons Two reasons she always said
1084-145077-0021	train-other-500	and once I asked her jealously if they were both men but she looked so startled and then laughed so queerly that I didn t ask again Then I thought it might be because I was younger than she was
1084-145077-0022	train-other-500	though I can t believe she is more than twenty three or so and I m twenty five you know And once I got cold sick because I thought she might still be married but she said her husband was married again
1084-145077-0023	train-other-500	and I wasn t to ask questions or worry about him But she did accept you Thursday night Penny persisted Yes the boy admitted his face darkly flushed again This is awfully hard honey
1084-145077-0024	train-other-500	but I ll tell you once for all and get it over with I took her to dinner We drove to Burnsville because she said she was sick of Hamilton When we were driving back she suddenly became very queer reckless defiant
none	none	 And she asked me if I still wanted to marry her 
1084-145077-0025	train-other-500	and I said I did I asked her right then to say when and she said she d marry me June first but she added
none	none	 and the boy to Dundee s watching eyes seemed to be genuinely puzzled again by what must have sounded so odd at the time 
1084-145077-0026	train-other-500	that she d marry me June first if she lived to see the day Oh Penny gasped then controlling her horror she asked with what sounded like real curiosity Then what happened Ralph
none	none	 Why do you propose to her on Thursday and to me 
1084-145077-0027	train-other-500	on on Sunday A gorgeous actress sacrificed to the typewriter Dundee told himself as he waited for Ralph Hammond s reluctant reply Can t we forget it honey
1084-145077-0028	train-other-500	You do love me a little don t you Can t you take my word for it that I m cured now forever Penny s hands went up to cover her face and Dundee had the grace to feel very sorry indeed for her
1084-145077-0029	train-other-500	sorry even if she intended to give her promise to Ralph Hammond as a sick feeling in his stomach prophesied that she was about to do How can I know you re really cured if I don t know what cured you
1084-145077-0030	train-other-500	I suppose you re right the boy admitted miserably There s no need to ask you not to tell anyone else Although I don t want to see her again ever
none	none	 Why Penny I wouldn t even tell Polly and Clive yesterday after it happened though Polly guessed and went upstairs 
1084-145077-0031	train-other-500	I tried to keep her back I don t quite understand Ralph Penny interrupted You mean something happened when you were at Nita s house yesterday morning Yes
1084-145077-0032	train-other-500	Judge Marshall had promised Nita to have the unfinished half of the top story turned into a maid s bedroom and bath and a guest bedroom and bath Clive let me go to make the estimates Of course I was glad of the chance to see Nita again
1084-145077-0033	train-other-500	I hadn t been with her since Thursday night But she had to take Lydia in for a dentist s appointment and they left me alone in the house I had to go into the finished half to make some measurements and in the bedroom I found oh God
1084-145077-0034	train-other-500	he groaned and pressed a fist against his trembling mouth You found that Dexter Sprague was staying there
none	none	 was using the bedroom that used to be mine 
1084-145077-0035	train-other-500	didn t you Penny helped him at last in desperation
none	none	 How did you know The boy stared at the girl blankly for a moment 
1084-145077-0036	train-other-500	then seemed to crumple as if from a new blow I suppose it was common gossip that Nita and Sprague were lovers and I was the only one she fooled My God To think all of you would stand by and let me marry her a cheap little gold digger from Broadway
1084-145077-0037	train-other-500	living with a cheap four flusher she couldn t get along without and had to send for Did you want to kill her Ralph Penny whispered touching one of his knotted fists with a trembling hand Kill her
1084-145077-0038	train-other-500	Good Lord no the boy flung at her violently I m not such an ass as that You girls are all alike Polly had so little sense as to think I d want to kill Nita and Sprague both She couldn t see and neither could Clive
1084-145077-0039	train-other-500	that all I wanted was to get away from everybody and get so drunk I could forget what a fool I d been What did you do Ralph Penny asked urgently Why I got drunk of course the boy answered as if surprised at her persistence
none	none	 Darling you wouldn t believe me if I told you how much rot gut Scotch it took to put me under but that filthy bootlegging hotel clerk would have charged me twice what he did for the stuff 
1084-145077-0040	train-other-500	if he had known how much good it would do me Hotel Penny snatched at the vital word Where did you go to get drunk Ralph
none	none	 I never realized before you had so much curiosity honey the boy grinned at her 
1084-145077-0041	train-other-500	After I shook Clive Polly went on to Nita s bridge party because she couldn t throw her down at the last minute I wandered around till I came to the Railroad Men s Hotel down on State Street you know the other side of the tracks
1084-145077-0042	train-other-500	It s a miserable dump but I sort of hankered for a place to hide in that was as miserable and cheap as I felt Did you register under your own name Ashamed of me Penny No I registered under my first two names Ralph Edwards
1084-145077-0043	train-other-500	And the rat faced filthy little hotel clerk turned out to be a bootlegger Well when I woke up about eleven this morning I give you my word I wasn t sick and headachy
none	none	 though God knows I d drunk enough to put me out for a week 
1084-145077-0044	train-other-500	Penny I woke up feeling well I can t explain it
none	none	 but to say I felt light and new and and clean 
1084-145077-0045	train-other-500	All washed up At first I thought my heart was empty it felt so free of pain But as I lay there thanking God that that was that I found my heart wasn t empty at all It was brimming full of love Gosh honey I sound
1084-145077-0046	train-other-500	like a Laura Jean Libbey hero don t I But before I rang you from the lunch room where I ate breakfast I wrote Nita a special delivery note telling her it was all off I had to be free actually before I could ask you
1084-145077-0047	train-other-500	You will marry me won t you Penny honey I knew this morning I had never really loved anyone else Penelope Crain remained rigid for a moment
none	none	 then very slowly she laid both her hands on his head for he had knelt and buried his face against her skirt But as she spoke her brown eyes enormous in her white face were upon Dundee who had stepped silently from behind the portieres Yes I ll marry you Ralph You may come in now mister Dundee CHAPTER SEVENTEEN It was nearly nine o clock Monday morning and Special Investigator Dundee sat alone in the district attorney s office impatiently awaiting Sanderson s arrival Coroner Price with the approval of Captain Strawn of the Homicide Squad had set the inquest into the murder of Juanita Leigh Selim for ten o clock and there was much that Dundee wished to say to the district attorney before that hour arrived When the thoroughly tired and dispirited young detective had returned to his apartment late Sunday afternoon after having seen Ralph Hammond completely exonerated of any possible complicity in the murder of Nita Selim he had found a telegram from the district attorney filed in Chicago CALLED CHICAGO SERIOUS ILLNESS OF MOTHER STOP RETURNING HAMILTON EIGHT TEN MONDAY MORNING STOP SEE BY PAPERS YOU ARE ON SELIM JOB STOP GOOD BUT WATCH YOUR STEP SANDERSON Well and Dundee grinned ruefully he had been on the job all right but would Sanderson consider that he had watched his step At any rate he had been thorough he congratulated himself as he weighed the big manilla envelope containing his own transcription of the copious shorthand notes he had taken during the first hours of the investigation A smaller envelope held Nita s tell tale checkbook her amazing last will and testament and the still more startling note she had written to Lydia Carr The last two Dundee had retrieved from Carraway only this morning after having submitted them to the fingerprint expert on Sunday Carraway s report had rather dashed him at first for it proved that no other hands than Nita s and his own of course had touched either envelope or contents But he was content now to believe that Nita herself had unsealed the envelope she had inscribed To Be Opened in Case of My Death Why Had she been moved by an impulse to give a clue to the identity of the person of whom she stood in fear but had stifled the impulse Strawn had said too that the little rosewood desk had been in a fairly orderly condition before his big official hands had clawed through it in search of a clue or the gun itself Well Strawn had been properly chagrined when Dundee had produced the will and note Why did she stick it away in a pack of new envelopes if she wanted it to be found Strawn had demanded irritably and had not been appeased by Dundee s suggestion Because she did not want Lydia in dusting the desk to see it and be alarmed Yes he had been busy enough but what actually had he to show for his industry He had worked up three good cases the first against Lydia Carr the second against Dexter Sprague and the third against Ralph Hammond only to have them knocked to pieces almost as fast as he had conceived them Of course Lydia Carr might be lying to give Sprague an alibi but Dundee was convinced that she was telling the truth and that she hated Sprague too much to fake an alibi for him Of course there was always Judge Marshall but Through the closed door came sounds which Dundee presently identified as connected with Penny Crain s arrival the emphatic click of her heels the quick opening and shutting of desk drawers The down hearted young detective debated the question of taking his perplexities out to her but decided against it She probably wanted to hear no more of his theories was undoubtedly burning with righteous indignation against him because of Ralph Hammond Did she still consider herself engaged to Ralph in spite of the fact that young Hammond had gallantly insisted upon releasing her from her promise as soon as he suspected that it had been given merely to prove her faith in his innocence It was a decidedly unhappy young detective whom Sanderson greeted upon his arrival at nine o clock The new district attorney who had held office since November was a big good natured tolerant man who looked younger than his thirty five years because of his freckles and his always rumpled mop of sandy hair But those who sought to take advantage of his good nature in the courtroom found themselves up against as keen a lawyer and prosecutor as could be found in the whole state or even in the Middle West Well boy he greeted Dundee genially but with an undertone of solemnity in his rich jury swaying baritone Looks like we ve got a sensational murder on our hands It s not every day Hamilton can rate a headline like BROADWAY BELLE MURDERED AT BRIDGE to quote a Chicago paper But I m afraid there s not enough mystery in it to suit your tastes Dundee grinned wryly I ve been pretty down in the mouth all morning because there s a little too much mystery chief Fairly open and shut isn t it Sanderson asked obviously surprised New York gets too hot for this Selim baby probably mixed up with some racketeer racketeers being the favorite boy friends of Broadway belles if one can believe the tabloids Lois Dunlap offers her a job to organize a Little Theater in Hamilton which the fair Nita would certainly have described as a hick town and which she wouldn t have been found dead in if she could have helped it and the district attorney grinned at his own witticism but Broadway Nita jumps at it Her racketeer sweetie has a long arm however and Nita gets hers Justly enough probably but I wish to the Lord she had chosen some other town to hide in Lois Dunlap is the finest woman in Hamilton but she s too damned promiscuous in her friendships As it is now some of the best friends I have in the world are mixed up in this mess even if it is only as innocent victims of circumstance Until then Dundee had let his chief express his pent up convictions without interruption and indeed Sanderson s courtroom training had fitted him admirably for long speeches But he could keep silent no longer That is what has been worrying me chief he interrupted Captain Strawn has given the papers very little real information but the truth is I am afraid one of your friends was not an innocent victim of circumstance District Attorney Sanderson sat down abruptly in the swivel chair at his desk Just what do you mean Dundee I mean I am convinced that one of missus Selim s guests was her murderer but I d like to tell you the whole story and let you judge for yourself My God Sanderson ejaculated Slowly he drew out a handkerchief and mopped his freckled brow If I hadn t had a good many years of experience with criminals Dundee I d say it is obvious on the face of it that none of those four men Judge Marshall Tracey Miles Johnny Drake Clive Hammond could have committed such a cheap sensational crime as murdering a hostess during a bridge game Not that I haven t wanted to commit murder myself over many a game of bridge he added with the irrepressible humor for which he was famous Then he groaned the rueful twinkle still in his eye I m afraid we re in for a lot of gruesome kidding Why last night in the club car of my train three tables of bridge players could scarcely play a hand for wisecracking about the dangers of being dummy Well boy now that I ve talked myself past the worst shock suppose you give me the low down But I warn you I m going to take a powerful lot of convincing Painstakingly and in the greatest detail Dundee told the whole story beginning with his arrival Saturday evening at the Selim house including the ghastly replaying of the death hand at bridge a phrase by the way which the prosecutor instantly adopted and ending with Ralph Hammond s establishing of an alibi to the entire satisfaction of Captain Strawn as well as of Dundee himself He was interrupted frequently of course scoffingly at first then with deepening solemnity and respect on the part of the district attorney Let me see the plan of the house again he said when Dundee had finished Also that table you ve worked up showing the approximate time and order of arrival of the four men Thanks Hmm Hmm You see sir Dundee repeated at last the list of possible suspects includes Lydia Carr Dexter Sprague John C Drake Judge Marshall Polly Beale Flora Miles Janet Raymond Clive Hammond But Polly and Clive were in the solarium together all the time Sanderson objected So they said Dundee agreed But it is a very short trip from the solarium by way of the side porch into Nita s bedroom And either Polly Beale or Clive Hammond could have made that trip on the pretext of speaking to Nita about Ralph Motive murder to end blackmail Naturally such a theory would not include both of them but if one of them was being blackmailed and made use of the pretext of warning Nita of Ralph s overwrought condition Sprague s your man Sanderson interrupted with relief Motive jealousy because Nita was ditching him to marry Ralph As for the gun and silencer it seems pretty clear to me that Nita herself stole it from Judge Marshall and that Sprague got it away from her You say the maid Lydia went upstairs to tell Sprague he had to pack his things and take them away for good Very well Sprague goes down the backstairs with the gun in his pocket through the back hall into Nita s bedroom shoots her bumps into the lamp goes out by the back door and comes around front to join the party You say yourself he has admitted to everything but the trip to Nita s room and the shooting even to sneaking back to get his bag which I believe also contained the gun until he had a chance to dispose of it on his way to his hotel in Hamilton Dundee shook his head I d like to agree chief but I believe Lydia is telling the truth She says she was in the upstairs bedroom with Sprague and remained behind only two or three minutes at most to put his shaving kit into the packed bag and to clean up the bathroom basin On her way down the backstairs she says she heard Lois Dunlap s second ring and went to answer it Sprague and Janet Raymond with whom Janet says he stopped to talk a minute on the front porch were in the dining room before Lydia entered it I m convinced Lydia hates Sprague and would be glad to believe him guilty No mister Sanderson I don t believe Sprague did it but I do believe it was Sprague s revenge that Nita was afraid of when she made her will Friday night Naturally she figured she d have time to tell the person she was blackmailing that she was through with him or her but I believe Sprague and Nita were lovers even partners in blackmail and that she feared he would kill her when he knew she was going to marry Ralph Hammond and give up their source of income Sanderson considered for a long minute pulling at his full lower lip Well thank God for those precious footprints Strawn is building on Don t think I fail to follow your reasoning that the crime must have been committed in the bedroom and not from the window sill but those footprints may save us yet and will certainly get us through the inquest You agree of course that none of all this you ve told me must even be hinted at during the inquest Good Let s be going It s nearly ten Dundee s whole soul revolted at the very thought of the barbaric farce of an inquest the small morgue chapel crowded to the doors with goggle eyed blood loving humanity the stretcher with its sheeted corpse reporters avid of sensation and primed with questions which if answered by indiscreet witnesses would defeat the efforts of police and district attorney news photographers with their insatiable cameras aimed at every person connected with the case in any way Mercifully this particular inquest upon the body of Juanita Leigh Selim promised to be quickly over For Coroner Price in conference with Sanderson Dundee and Captain Strawn had gladly agreed to call only those witnesses and extract from them only such information as the authorities deemed advisable Lydia Carr whose black veil had defeated the news camera levelled at her poor scarred face was the first witness called by Coroner Price and she was required for the single purpose of identifying the body as that of her mistress To two perfunctory questions Have you any information to give this jury regarding the cause and manner of the deceased s death and Have you any personal knowledge of the identity of any person man or woman of whom the deceased stood in fear of her life Lydia answered a flat No and was then dismissed Karen Marshall looking far too young to be the wife of the elderly ex judge Hugo Marshall was the second witness called doctor Price guided her gently to a brief recital of her discovery of the dead body of her hostess emphasizing only the fact that so far as she could see the bedroom was unoccupied except by the corpse at the time of the discovery He then handed her the photostatic copy of a blueprint of the ground floor of the Selim house with a pencilled ring drawn around the bedroom Karen falteringly identified it as well as the pencil drawn furniture and was immediately dismissed to the packed rows of spectators and reporters doctor Price himself took the stand next and described in technical terms the wound which had caused death and the caliber of the bullet he had extracted from the dead woman s heart I find also from the autopsy he concluded that the bullet traveled a downward slanting path I should add moreover that I have made exact mathematical calculations using the position of the body and of the wound as a basis and found that a line drawn from the wound and extended at the correct slant ends at a point fifty one point eight inches high upon the right hand side of the frame of the window nearest the porch door And he obligingly passed the marked blueprint among the jury When it was in his own hands again he added It is impossible to state the exact distance the bullet traveled more nearly than to say the shot was fired along the line I have indicated at a distance of not more than fifteen feet and not less than ten Captain Strawn rose and was permitted to question the witness doctor Price that blueprint shows that the bedroom is fifteen feet in width don t it That is correct Have you also measured the height of that window sill from the floor I have the coroner answered The height from floor to sill is twenty six inches Now doctor from your calculations would it be possible for a man crouching in the open window to fire a shot along the path you have calculated It would doctor Price answered But as I have pointed out it is impossible for me to say at exactly what distance from the body the shot was fired But Strawn of course was amply satisfied And so were Dundee and the district attorney for it suited their purposes admirably for the public to be convinced at this time that an intruding gunman had murdered Nita Selim Captain Strawn sworn in told briefly of his being called to the scene of the crime of the activities of Carraway the fingerprint expert and of the exhaustive search of his squad of detectives Did you find any person concealed upon the premises that is within the house itself or in the garage or on the grounds doctor Price asked No sir Did you or your men discover the weapon with which the deceased was killed No sir Did you question all persons in the house at the time of the crime as to whether or not a shot had been heard I did The answer in every case was that they heard no shot And you also questioned every person present in an effort to place responsibility for the death of missus Selim I did I couldn t find that anyone present had anything to do with it Who were these persons doctor Price then asked Judge and missus Hugo Marshall mister and missus Tracey A Miles mister and missus John C Drake missus Peter Dunlap Miss Janet Raymond Miss Polly Beale Miss Penelope Crain mister Clive Hammond mister Dexter Sprague of New York and missus Selim s maid Lydia Carr Captain Strawn answered promptly rolling out the names of Hamilton s elect with sonorous satisfaction which obviously had the desired effect in convincing the jury that not among those proud names at least could be found the name of the murderer Did you find on the premises any clue which you consider of importance to this jury I did A bunch of footprints under the window you ve been talking about Here are life size photographs of em doctor And the rambler rose vines that climb up the outside of the window had been torn After the photographs had been duly inspected by the jury of six doctor Price said That is all and thank you Captain Strawn mister Dundee As had been agreed between the coroner and the district attorney Dundee s testimony after the preliminary questions was confined to the offering of Nita Selim s last will and testament and the note to Lydia The reporters who had obviously feared that nothing new would eventuate sat up with startled interest then their pencils flew as Dundee read the two documents after he had told when and where he had discovered them As District Attorney Sanderson had said Better give the press something new to chew on but for God s sake don t mention that checkbook of Nita s It s dynamite boy dynamite While the morgue chapel was still in a buzz of excitement Dundee was dismissed and District Attorney Sanderson requested an adjournment of the inquest for one week The police were urging the crowd upon its way before it became fully aware that it had been cheated of the pleasure of hearing at first hand the stories of that fatal bridge and cocktail party from the guests themselves Tell the Carr woman I want to speak to her Sanderson directed Dundee She ll thank you for rescuing her from the reporters As Dundee pushed his way through the jam he heard a reporter earnestly pleading with Lois Dunlap But I m sure you can remember the cards each player held in that death hand missus Dunlap Cheerfully sure that he could trust Lois Dunlap s discretion and distaste for publicity Dundee went on grinning at the reporter s use of his own lurid phrase Two minutes later Sanderson Strawn and Dundee were closeted in doctor Price s own office with Lydia Carr First Lydia began Sanderson I want to warn you to give the reporters no information at all regarding the nature or extent of your mistress bequest It was little enough she had poor girl beyond her clothes and a few pieces of jewelry Lydia answered stubbornly Are you going to let me do what she told me to in that note Not that I hold with burning I see no reason why you should not take charge of the body Lydia and arrange it immediately for cremation Do you Captain Strawn Sanderson answered No sir The quicker the better Then Lydia if Captain Strawn will send you out to the Selim house with one of his boys you may get the dress described in missus Selim s note And the curls she cut off and had made into switches Lydia interrupted I can t dress my poor girl s hair in a French roll without them The curls too Sanderson agreed Now as to the cremation missus Miles let me come in early to see about that Lydia interrupted again They can do it this afternoon and you don t need to worry about the expense I ve got money enough of my own to pay my girl s funeral expenses Good Sanderson applauded The will shall be probated as soon as possible of course but it makes it simpler if you will pay the necessary expenses now Just a minute chief Dundee halted the district attorney as he was about to leave Under the circumstances I think it highly advisable that we get pictures of the burial dress I suggest you have Lydia bring the things to your office before she lays out the body and that Carraway photograph the dress there from all angles I should also like to have a picture of the body after Lydia has finished her services The maid s scarred face flushed a deep angry red but she offered no protest when the district attorney accepted both of Dundee s suggestions Then you ll have Carraway with his camera at my office in about an hour Sanderson turned to Captain Strawn Let s say twelve o clock By the way Lydia you may bring in with you the few pieces of jewelry you mentioned I ll keep them safely in my offices until the will is probated and they are turned over to you I don t know where she kept them Lydia answered What exclaimed Bonnie Dundee I said I don t know where she kept her jewelry Lydia Carr retorted It wasn t worth much not a hundred dollars altogether I ll be bound because Nita sold her last diamond not a week before we left New York She owed so many bills then that the money she got for directing that play at the Forsyte School hardly made a dent on them Do you know whether the jewelry was kept in the house or in a safe deposit box Dundee asked excitement sharpening his voice It must have been in the house because she wore the different pieces any time she pleased the maid answered I didn t ask no questions and I didn t happen to see her get it out or put it away I didn t ever do much lady s maid work for her like dressing her or fixing her hair just kept her clothes and the house in order and did what little cooking there was to do Her dressing table Dundee prodded Her desk The maid shook her head I was always straightening up the drawers in both her dressing table and her desk and she didn t keep the jewelry in either one of them places Captain Strawn when you searched the dressing table and desk for the gun or anything of importance did you have any reason to suspect a secret drawer in either of them No Bonnie They re just ordinary factory furniture I tapped around for a secret drawer of course but there wasn t even any place for one Strawn assured him with an indulgent grin I want to see Penny Crain Dundee cried making for the door Then you d better come along to the courthouse with me Sanderson called after him I sent her back to the office as soon as the inquest was adjourned The two men passed through the now deserted morgue chapel and almost bumped into a middle aged man obviously of the laboring class in spite of his slicked up Sunday appearance You re the district attorney ain t you sir he addressed Sanderson in a nervous halting undertone Yes What is it I come to the inquest to give some information sir but it was adjourned so quick I didn t have time Who are you Sanderson interrupted impatiently I m Rawlins sir I worked for the poor lady missus Selim gardening one day a week Come to my office Sanderson commanded quickly as a lingering reporter approached on a run No no I m sorry Harper he said hastily cutting into the reporter s questions Nothing new You may say that the police have thrown out a dragnet and he grinned at the trite phrase for the gunman who killed missus Selim and will offer a reward for the recovery of the weapon a Colt s thirty two equipped with a Maxim silencer Come along George and I ll explain just what missus Sanderson and I have in mind The district attorney and Dundee strode quickly away and the man Rawlins after a moment of indecision trotted after them I don t understand sir and my name ain t George It s Elmer You don t have to understand anything except that you re not to answer any question that any reporter asks you Sanderson retorted When the trio entered the reception room of the district attorney s suite in the courthouse Sanderson paused at Penny Crain s desk Bring in your notebook Penny This man has some information he considers important A minute later Sanderson had begun to question his voluntary but highly nervous witness Your name It s Elmer Rawlins like I told you sir the man protested and flinched as Penny recorded his words in swift shorthand It was my wife as made me come She said as long as me and her knowed I didn t do nothing wrong I d oughta come forward and tell what I knowed Yes yes Sanderson encouraged him impatiently You say you worked for missus Selim as gardener one day a week Yes sir but I tended to her hot water and her garbage too twice a day it was I had to go and stoke the little laundry heater that heats the hot water tank in summertime when the steam furnace ain t being used I live about a mile beyant the Crain place that is the house the poor lady was killed in Did you come to stoke the laundry heater Saturday evening Dundee interrupted Excuse me sir he turned to the district attorney but this is the first time I ve seen this man No sir I didn t stoke it Sat dy night Rawlins answered uneasily You see I was comin up the road to do my chores at half past six like I always do but before I got to the house I seen a lot of policemen s cars and motorcycles and I didn t want to get mixed up in nothing so I turned around and went home again I didn t know what was up but when me and the wife went into Hamilton Sat dy night in our flivver we seen one of the extries and read about how the poor lady was murdered But that ain t what I was gittin at sir Well what are you getting at Sanderson urged Well the extry said the police had found some footprints under the frontmost of them two side windows to Mis Selim s bedroom and went on to talk about the rose vines being tore and straight off I said to the missus Them s my footprints Minnie Minnie s my wife s name Your footprints Sanderson ejaculated then shook with silent laughter There goes Strawn s case Bonnie But immediately he was serious again as the import of this new evidence came to him Tell us all about it Rawlins When did you make those footprints Friday sir That s the day I gardened for Mis Selim You see sir the poor little lady told me she was kept awake nights when they was a high wind by the rose vines tapping against the windows Says she I think they s somebody tryin to git into my room Elmer and I could see the poor little thing was mighty nervous anyway so I didn t waste no time I cut away a lot of the rose vine and burned it when I was burnin the garbage and papers in the cinerator out back Is that all Rawlins Sanderson asked Bout all that mounts to anything the laborer deprecated But they was somethin else that struck me as a little funny when I come to think of it Well Sanderson prodded as the man halted uncertainly Well it s like I told you it was my job to burn the papers That scar face maid of Mis Selim s put everything garbage and trash in a big garbage can outside the back door and I burnt em up So I was kinder surprised Sat dy mornin when I went to stoke up the laundry heater to find somebody d been meddlin with my drafts and had let the fire go clean out I had to clean out the ashes and build a new fire You re trying to say I suppose that you could tell by the ashes that someone had been burning papers in the laundry heater Sanderson asked with a quick glance at Dundee s tense face That s right sir Rawlins agreed eagerly You know what kind of ashes a mess o paper makes layers of white ashes sir that kinder looks like papers yit Yes I know And you found layers of white ashes which you took particular pains to clean out Sanderson asked bitterly Yes sir So s I could build a new fire Did you speak to the maid ask her if she d been meddlin with your drafts Yes sir I did the man answered with a trace of the belligerence he had undoubtedly shown to Lydia She said she didn t open no dampers claimed the heater was the same as usual when she left Friday night to go to a movie So I reckin it was the poor lady herself burnin up love letters maybe or some such truck You re to keep your reckins to yourself Rawlins Sanderson cut in emphatically Remember now you re not to tell anybody else what you ve just told me If that s all you can go now and I m much obliged to you Leave your address with the young lady here You ll be needed later of course The relieved man hurried out of the room on Penny s heels Sanderson shrugged then when the door had closed began heavily It looks like you re right Bonnie about that blackmail business As the astute Rawlins says love letters maybe or some such truck Of course it all fits in with your theory that Nita had made up her mind to reform marry Ralph Hammond and be a very good girl indeed All right You can have Penny in now I think I know pretty well what you re going to ask her And I may as well tell you that when Roger Crain skipped town with some securities he was known to possess he hadn t got them from a safe deposit box because he didn t have one and Sanderson pressed a button on the edge of his desk Penny do you know whether there is a concealed safe in the Selim house The girl startled began to shake her head then checked herself Not that I ever saw or knew of when Dad and Mother and I lived there but She hesitated her cheeks turning scarlet Out with it Penny Sanderson urged his voice very kind It s just that if you really think there s a secret hiding place in the house I believe I understand something that puzzled me when it happened Penny confessed her head high I was at the Country Club one night a Saturday night when the whole crowd is usually there for the dinner and dance I d been dancing with with Ralph and when the music stopped we went out on the porch where several of our crowd were sitting It was just two or three weeks after after Dad left town Lois wouldn t let me drop out of things Anyway it was dark and I heard Judge Marshall saying something about the simplest and most ingenious arrangement you ever saw Of course that s where the rascal kept his securities I knew they were talking about Dad from the way Judge Marshall shut up and changed the subject as soon as he saw me Who was on the porch Penny Dundee asked tensely Why let s see Flora and Johnny Drake and Clive she answered slowly I think that was all besides Judge Marshall The others hadn t come out from dancing Of course I don t know whether or not it was some arrangement in the house Where are you going boy Sanderson checked Dundee who was already on his way to the door To find that gun of course Well if it s tucked away in the simplest and most ingenious arrangement you ever saw it will stay put for a while Sanderson said Lydia s due here within half an hour and you don t want to miss her do you CHAPTER EIGHTEEN It was exactly twelve o clock when Lydia Carr accompanied by Detective Collins of the Homicide Squad carrying a small suitcase arrived at the district attorney s office I kept my eye on her every minute of the time to see that there wasn t no shenanigans Collins informed Dundee and Sanderson importantly callous to the fact that the maid could hear him But I let her bring along everything she said she needed to lay the body out in Was that right Right agreed the district attorney as Dundee opened the suitcase upon Sanderson s desk The royal blue velvet dress lay on top neatly folded Dundee shook out its folds It looked remarkably fresh and new in spite of the years it had hung in Nita Selim s various clothes closets preserved because of God alone knew what tender memories Perhaps the beautiful little dancer had intended all those years that it should be her shroud Oh it s lovely Penny Crain who was looking on cried out involuntarily It looks like a French model It s a copy of a French model You can see by the label on the back of the neck Lydia answered her one good eye softening for Penny So it is Dundee agreed and took out his penknife to snip the threads which fastened the white satin gold lettered label to the frock Pierre Model Copied by Simonson s New York City he read aloud and slipped the little square of satin into the envelope containing the murdered woman s will Well Penny I m glad you like the dress for I m going to ask you to do the mannikin stunt in it as soon as Carraway arrives with his camera Penny turned very pale but she said nothing in protest and Dundee continued to unpack the suitcase His masculine hands looked clumsy as they lifted out the costume slip and miniature dancing set brassiere and step ins all matching of filmiest white chiffon and lace His fingers flinched from contact with the switch of long silky black curls She bought them after we came to Hamilton Lydia informed him pointing to the undergarments Them black moire pumps and them French stockings are brand new too hundred gauge silk them stockings are and never on her feet Ready for me Carraway had appeared in the doorway with camera and tripod Yes Carraway Just the dress Penny I want full length front back and side views of Miss Crain wearing this dress Carraway Flashlights of course Better take the pictures in Miss Crain s office Dundee directed You stay here Lydia I want to talk with you while that job is being done Yes sir Lydia answered and accepted without thanks the chair he offered I suppose you have read The Hamilton Morning News today Lydia I have May I have that paper chief Thanks Now Lydia I want you to read again the paragraphs that are headed New York May twenty five and tell us if the statements are correct Lydia accepted the paper and her single eye scanned the following lines obediently New York May twenty five UP missus Juanita Leigh Selim who was murdered Saturday afternoon in Hamilton was known along Broadway as Nita Leigh chorus girl and specialty dancer Her last known address in New York was No West fifty fourth saint where she had a three room apartment According to the superintendent E J Black Miss Leigh as he knew her lived there alone except for her maid Lydia Carr and entertained few visitors Irving Wein publicity director for Altamont Pictures when interviewed by a reporter in his rooms at the Cadillac Hotel late today said that Nita Leigh had been used for bits and as a dancing double for stars in a number of recent pictures including Night Life and Boy Howdy both of which have dancing sequences Musical comedy programs for the last year carry her name only once in the list of Ladies of the Ensemble of the revue What of it Miss Eloise Pendleton head mistress of Forsyte on the Hudson mentioned in the dispatches from Hamilton confirms the report that missus Selim as she was known there twice directed the annual Easter musical comedy presented by that fashionable school for young ladies but could add nothing of interest to the facts given above beyond asserting that missus Selim had proved to be an unusually competent and popular director of their amateur theatricals Yes that s correct as far as it goes Lydia commented resentment strong in her harsh voice as she returned the paper to Dundee Have you anything to add Dundee caught her up quickly No sir Lydia shook her head her lips in a grim line Then resentment burst through They don t have to talk like she was a back number on Broadway just because she was tired of the stage and going in for movies District Attorney Sanderson took her in hand then pelting her with questions about Nita s New York gentlemen friends but he made no more headway than Dundee We know that Nita Selim was afraid of someone Sanderson began again angrily Who was it someone she d known in New York or somebody in Hamilton I don t know Lydia told him flatly But you do know she was living in fear of her life don t you Dundee interposed I well yes I suppose she was Lydia admitted reluctantly But I thought she was just afraid to live out there in that lonesome house away off at the end of nowhere Was she afraid of Dexter Sprague Sanderson shot at her Would she have asked him to stay all night if she d been afraid of him Lydia demanded scornfully And would she have asked him to rig up a bell from her bedroom to mine if it was him she was afraid of A bell Dundee echoed Yes sir It has a contraption under the rug right beside her bed so s she could step on it and it would ring in my room which was underneath hers mister Sprague bought the wire and stuff bored a hole through her bedroom floor and fixed it all hisself Did anyone know Nita had taken this precaution to protect herself Dundee asked Mis Lois did because one day not long ago she stepped on it accidentally when she was in Nita s room The bell buzzed in my room and I come up to answer it and Nita explained it to Mis Lois So that was why no attempt had been made to murder Nita while she slept Dundee told himself triumphantly For of course it was more than probable that Lois Dunlap had innocently spread the news of Nita s nervousness and her ingenious method of summoning help instantly There was a knock at the door Come in All finished Carraway Fine I d like to see the prints as soon as possible and now I d like you to go over to the morgue with Lydia and wait there until she has the body dressed in these clothes and the hair done according to the instructions missus Selim left I ll leave the posing to you but I want a full length picture as well as a head portrait As Lydia s work roughened knuckly hands were returning the funeral clothes to the suitcase another question occurred to Dundee Lydia did you know before I questioned you at the Miles home yesterday that Sprague had returned for that bag he had left in the bedroom upstairs Her scarred cheek flushed livid but the maid answered with defiant honesty Yes I did He spoke to me through my basement window just before you come running down to talk to me He d sneaked back but he could tell from seeing your car outside that you was there and he asked me to go up and get the bag and set it outside the kitchen door for him I said I wouldn t do it it was too risky Then you were pretending to be asleep when I entered your room Yes I was But I had been asleep before mister Sprague called me While you was ding donging at me about Nita burning my face I heard mister Sprague open the kitchen door He had a key Nita had give him so s he could slip in unnoticed if he happened to come when Nita had other company He didn t hardly make any noise at all but I heard it because I was listening for it You d left the door to the basement stairs open and my door too so I heard him Did you hear him come down Yes I did There s a board on the backstairs that squeaks and I heard it plain while you was still at me hammer and tongs Lydia answered He was in the house not more n two minutes all told and when I figured he was safely out I went upstairs with you to show you the presents I d give Nita after she burnt me to prove I d forgive her Why didn t you tell me Lydia Why did you protect Sprague I know you don t like him Dundee puzzled I wasn t thinking about him Lydia told him flatly I was thinking about Nita I didn t want any scandal on her and I knew what the police and the newspapers would say if they found out mister Sprague had been staying all night sometimes Are you prepared to swear Sprague had time to do nothing but go up to the bedroom and get his bag I am When Lydia and Carraway had left together Dundee rose and addressed the district attorney I m going out to the Selim house now to look for that secret hiding place where Roger Crain kept his securities and which Judge Marshall evidently displayed to Nita as one of the charms of the house when she rented it Why not simply telephone Judge Marshall and ask him where and what it is Sanderson asked reasonably Do you think he d tell Dundee retorted The old boy s no fool Even if he didn t kill Nita himself and hide the gun there my question would throw him into a panic of fear lest one of his best friends had done just that No I ll find it myself if it s all right with you But after a solid hour of hard and fruitless work Bonnie Dundee was forced to admit ruefully to himself that his parting words to the district attorney might have been the youthful and empty boast that Sanderson had evidently considered them For nowhere in the house Roger Crain had built and in which Nita Selim had been murdered could the detective find anything remotely resembling a concealed safe The two plainclothesmen whom Strawn had detailed to guard the house and to continue the search for the missing gun and silencer looked on with unconcealed amusement as Dundee tapped walls floors and ceilings in a house that seemed to be exceptionally free of architectural eccentricities Finally Dundee grew tired of their ribald comments and curtly ordered them to make a new and exhaustive search of the unused portions of the basement those dark earth banks with their overhead networks of water and drain pipes heavily insulated cables of electric wires cobwebby rafters and rough shelves holding empty fruit jars and liquor bottles which contrasted sharply with the neatly ceiled and cement floored space devoted to furnace laundry and maid s room Dundee himself had given those regions only a cursory inspection with his flashlight for it was highly improbable that Nita Selim would have made use of a secret hiding place for her jewelry and valuable papers if that hiding place was located in such dark awesome surroundings No The hiding place if it really existed and it must exist had been within easy reach of Nita dressing and bedecking herself for a party or Lydia Carr could not have been kept in complete ignorance of its location With that conviction in mind Dundee returned to Nita s bedroom to which he had already devoted at least half an hour Nothing in the big clothes closet where Flora Miles had been hiding while Nita was being murdered No secret drawers in desk or dressing table or bedside table No false bottom in boudoir chair or chaise longue He had even taken every book out of the four shelf bookcase which stood against the west wall near the north corner of the room and had satisfied himself that no book was a leafless fake His minute inspection of the bathroom and back hall upon which Nita s bedroom opened had proved as fruitless although he had removed every drawer from the big linen press which stood in the hall and measured spaces to a fraction of an inch As for the walls they were except for the doors unbroken expanses of tinted plaster And yet He stepped into the clothes closet again hammer in hand for a fresh tapping of the cedar board walls Nothing here And then he tapped again his ear against the end wall of the closet the wall farthest from the side porch Yes There was a faintly hollow echo of the hammer strokes Excitement blazing high again he took the tape measure with which he had provided himself on his way out and calculated the length of the closet from end to end Six feet Emerging from the closet he closed his eyes in an effort to recall in exact detail the architect s blueprint of the lower floor which Coroner Price had submitted to his jury at the inquest that morning Yes that was right The inner end wall of Nita s clothes closet was also the back of the guest closet in the little foyer that lay between Nita s bedroom and the main hall Within ten minutes much laying on of the tape measure had produced a startling result Instead of having a wall in common the guest closet and Nita s clothes closet were separated by exactly eleven inches Why the waste space The blueprint bearing the imprint of the architects Hammond Hammond showed no such walled up cubbyhole Exultantly Dundee again entered Nita s closet and went over every inch of the narrow horizontal cedar boards which formed the end wall But he met with no reward Not through this workmanlike solidly constructed wall had an opening been made But in the foyer closet he read a different story Its back wall had an amateurish look This closet was not cedar lined as was Nita s but was painted throughout in soft ivory But it was the back wall of the closet in which Dundee was interested Unlike the other walls which were of plaster the back was constructed of six inch wide boards the cheapness of the lumber not concealed by its coat of ivory paint No self respecting builder had put in that wall of broad horizontal boards And then directly beneath the shelf which was set regulation height just above the pole on which swung a dozen coat hangers Dundee found what he was looking for A short length of the cheap board a queer scrap to have been used even in so shoddy a job as that wall was Eight inches long And set square in the center of the wall just below the shelf and pole If he had not been looking for something odd however Dundee acknowledged to himself he would not have noticed it Did anyone ever notice the back walls of closets Sure of the result he pressed with his finger tips upon the lower end of that short piece of board And slowly it swung inward the top slanting outward He had found the secret hiding place And Dundee silently agreed with Judge Marshall that it was the simplest and most ingenious arrangement you ever saw for it was nothing more nor less than a shelf set between the two closets in those eleven inches of unaccounted for space I take off my hat to Roger Crain Dundee reflected No burglar in the world would ever have thought of pressing upon a short piece of board in a foyer closet in search of a safe But how did Judge Marshall know of its existence The only answer Dundee could think of was that Crain overseeing the building of his house had suddenly conceived this brilliant and simple plan and had tipped one of the carpenters to carry it out for him Possibly or probably he had bragged to Clive or Ralph Hammond his architects of his clever invention And the Hammond boys had passed on the information to Judge Marshall when after Crain s failure and flight the house had become the property of the ex judge These thoughts rushed through his mind as his flashlight explored the shelf through the tilted opening The gun and silencer must be here since they could be no place else But the shelf was bare except for a small brass box fastened only by a clasp In his acute disappointment Dundee took little interest in the collection of pretty but inexpensive jewelry Nita s trinkets undoubtedly which the brass box contained No wedding ring among them In spite of his chagrin at not finding the gun Dundee studied the simple mechanism which Roger Crain s ingenuity had conceived From the outside the eight inch length of board fitted smoothly giving no indication whatever that it was otherwise than what it seemed part of a cheaply built wall But Dundee s flashlight played upon the beveled edges of both the short board and the two neighboring planks between which it was fitted The pivoting arrangement was of the simplest the small nickel plated pieces being set into the short board and the other two planks with small screws which did not pierce the painted outside surface His curiosity satisfied Dundee stepped out of the closet into the tiny foyer He was about to leave when a terrific truth crashed through his mind and froze his feet to the floor Of course the gun and silencer were not there This was the guest closet In it had hung the hat of every person who had been Nita s guest either for bridge or cocktails that fatal Saturday afternoon And to this closet to retrieve hat stick or in the case of the women summer coat and hat had come every person who had been questioned and then searched by the police Dundee tried to recapture the picture of the stampede which had followed upon his permission for all guests to go to their homes But it was useless He had stayed in the living room with Strawn had taken not the slightest interest in the scramble for hats coats and sticks For Strawn had previously assured him that the guest closet had been thoroughly searched So quickly that he felt slightly dizzy Dundee s thoughts raced around the new discovery This changed everything of course Any one of half a dozen persons could have arrived with the gun and silencer not screwed together of course because of the ungainly length and seized the opportunity presented by Nita s being alone in her bedroom to shoot her What easier then than to hide the weapon on this secret shelf the door of which yielded to the slightest pressure And what easier than to retrieve the weapon after permission had been granted to all to return to their homes Easy enough to manage to go alone to the closet for a hat the extra minute of time unnoticed in the general excitement It had been vitally necessary too to retrieve the weapon since any innocent member of that party might have remembered later to mention the secret hiding place to the police secret no longer since Judge Marshall had gossiped about it Then another thought boiled up and demanded attention In the new theory what place did the bang or bump have that noise which Flora Miles concealed in Nita s closet had dimly heard Dundee had been positive when Lydia had discovered the shattered electric bulb in the big bronze lamp that its position in Nita s room indicated the progress of the flight of the murderer flight diagonally across the room toward the back hall But now A little dashed Dundee returned to the bedroom The big lamp was where he had first seen it about a foot beyond the window nearest the porch and at the head of the chaise longue which was set between the two west windows where according to Lydia the lamp always stood The too long cord lay slackly along the floor near the west wall and extended to the double outlet on the baseboard behind the bookcase A slack cord Down on his hands and knees Dundee went to peer under the low bottom shelf of the bookcase Yes The pronged plug of the lamp cord had been jerked almost out of the baseboard outlet It was easy to visualize what had happened The murderer after firing the shot had involuntarily taken a step or even several steps backward until his foot had caught in the loop of electric cord causing the big lamp to be thrown violently against the wall near which it stood But who Any one of half a dozen people But who CHAPTER NINETEEN Having ticketed the big bronze lamp which he had brought with him from the Selim house and locked it away in the room devoted to exhibits for the state Bonnie Dundee hurried into Penny s office primed with the news of his discovery of the secret hiding place and eager to lay his new theory before the district attorney Bill s gone Penny interrupted her swift typing to inform him To Chicago He had only fifteen minutes to make the three o clock train after he received a wire saying his mother is not expected to live He tried to reach you at the Selim house but one of Captain Strawn s men said you had left I stopped on my way in to get a bite to eat Dundee explained mechanically I d dashed off without my lunch you know Did you find the gun and silencer Penny asked No Whoever used it Saturday afternoon walked out of the house with it in plain view of the police and still has it Very convenient too in case another murder seems to be expedient or amusing Don t joke Penny shuddered But what in the world do you mean Briefly Dundee told her minimizing the hard work the concentrated thinking and the meticulous use of a tape measure which had resulted in the discovery of the shelf between Nita s bedroom closet and the guest closet in the little foyer I see Penny agreed her husky voice slow and weighted with horror She sat in dazed thought for a minute That rather brings it home to my crowd doesn t it To think that Dad Probably everyone at the party except me had heard all about Dad s simple and ingenious arrangement for hiding the securities he sent on to New York before he ran away And no outsiders nobody but us had a legitimate excuse for entering that closet Not even Dexter Sprague It s one of his affectations not to wear a hat Is it Dundee pounced You re sure he wore no hat that afternoon Did you notice him when he left after I had dismissed you all Yes Penny acknowledged honestly I paid attention to him because I was hating him so I believed then that he was the murderer and I was furious with you and Captain Strawn for not arresting him He was the first to leave just walked straight out wouldn t even stop to talk with Janet Raymond who was trying to get a word with him I saw him start toward Sheridan Road walking He had no car you know Did you observe the others Dundee demanded eagerly Do you know who went alone to the guest closet Penny shook her head Everybody was milling around in the hall and I paid no attention Lois said she would drive me home and then I went in to ask you to let me stay behind with you I remember Listen Penny I m going to tell you something else that nobody knows yet but Sanderson Lydia and me I don t have to ask you not to tell any of your friends You know well enough that anything you learn from either Sanderson or me is strictly confidential Penny nodded her face very white and her brown eyes big with misery I have every reason to believe that Nita Selim was a blackmailer that she came to Hamilton for the express purpose of bleeding someone she had known before or someone on whom she had the goods from some underworld source or other At any rate Nita banked ten thousand mysterious dollars five thousand dollars on April twenty eight and five thousand dollars on May five I talked to Drake last night and I have his word for it that the money was in bills of varying denomination none large when Nita presented it for deposit Therefore it seems clear to me that Nita got the money right here in Hamilton otherwise it would have come to her in the form of checks or drafts or money orders And it seems equally clear to me that she did not bring that large amount of cash from New York with her or she would have deposited it in a lump sum in the bank immediately after her arrival Yes Penny agreed But why are you telling me Of course I m interested Because I want you to tell me the financial status of each of your friends Dundee said gently I know how hard it is for you You could find out from others so I might as well tell you Penny interrupted with a weary shrug Judge Marshall is well to do and Karen s father her mother is dead settled one hundred thousand dollars on her when she married She has complete control of her own money The Dunlaps are the richest people in Hamilton and have been for two or three generations Lois was first family but poor when she married Peter but he s been giving her an allowance of twenty thousand dollars a year for several years not for running the house but for her personal use Clothes charities hobbies like the Little Theater she brought Nita here to organize I wouldn t say she spends a great deal of it on dress Dundee interrupted with a grin Lois doesn t give a hang how she looks or what anyone thinks of her which is probably one reason she is the best loved woman in our crowd Penny retorted loyally The Miles money is really Flora s and she has the reputation of being one of the shrewdest business men in town When she married Tracey nearly eight years ago he was just a salesman in her father s business the biggest dairy in the state Cloverblossom butter cream milk and cheese you know Well when Flora married Tracey her father retired and let Tracey run the business for Flora and he s still managing it but Flora is the real head Now let s see Oh yes the Drakes Johnny is vice president of the Hamilton National Bank as you know and owns a big block of the stock Carolyn has no money of her own except what Johnny gives her and I rather think he isn t any too generous They don t get along very well together do they N no Penny agreed reluctantly You see Johnny Drake was simply not cut out for love and marriage He s a born ascetic would have been a monk two or three centuries ago but he cares as much for Carolyn as he could for any woman The Hammond boys have some inherited money and Clive has made a big financial success of architecture That leaves only Janet and Polly doesn t it Polly s an orphan and has barrels of money and will have barrels more when her aunt with whom she lives dies and leaves her the fortune she has always promised her And Janet Raymond Janet s father is pretty rich owns a big wire fence factory but Janet has only a reasonable allowance Penny answered As for me I m very rich I get thirty five whole dollars a week to support myself and Mother on Dundee remained thoughtfully silent for a long minute Then All you girls are alumnae of Forsyte on the Hudson and Nita Selim came here immediately after she had directed a Forsyte play Tell me Penny was any of the Hamilton girls ever in disgrace while in the Forsyte School Penny s face flamed I m sorry to disappoint you but so far as I know there was never anything of the sort Of course we all graduated different years except Karen and I and I might not have heard But no she denied vehemently There wasn t any scandal on a Hamilton girl ever I m sure of it But her very vehemence convinced Bonnie Dundee that she was not at all sure He looked at his watch Four o clock By this time Nita Selim tiny cold body royal blue velvet dress black curls piled high in an old fashioned French roll bullet torn heart were nothing more than a little heap of grey ashes Would Lydia Carr have them put in a sealed urn and carry them about with her always I m going out now Penny and I shan t be back today he told the girl who had returned to her furious typing I ll telephone in about an hour to see if anything has come up By the way how do I get to the Dunlap house It s in the Brentwood section You know that cluster of hills around Mirror Lake Most of the crowd live out there the Drakes the Mileses the Beales the Marshalls The Dunlap house stands on the highest hill of all It s grey stone a little like a French chateau We used to live out there too in a Colonial house my mother s father built but Dad persuaded Mother to sell when he went into that Primrose Meadows venture The Raymonds bought it But why do you want to see Lois Thanks much Penny I don t know what I should do without you Dundee said without answering her question and reached for his hat After ten minutes of driving the last mile of which had circled a smooth silver coin of a lake Dundee stopped his car and let his eyes rove appreciatively He had made this trip the day before to question Lydia already installed as nurse for the Miles children but he had been in too great a hurry then to see much of this section consecrated to Hamilton s socially elect Georgian cottage Spanish hacienda Italian villa Tudor mansion that was the Miles home Colonial mansion where Penny had once lived grey stone chateau Not one of them blatantly new or marked with the dollar sign Dundee sighed a little enviously as he turned his car into the winding driveway that led up the highest hill to the Dunlap home Lois Dunlap betrayed no surprise when the butler led Dundee to the flag stoned upper terrace overlooking Mirror Lake where she was having tea with her three children and their governess For a moment the detective had the illusion that he was in England again How do you do mister Dundee This is Miss Burden My three offspring Peter the third Eleanor and Bobby Will you please take the children to the playroom now Miss Burden Thank you Tea mister Dundee Or shall I order you a highball Nothing thanks Dundee answered grateful for her friendliness but nonplussed by it Not for the first time he felt a sick distaste for the profession he had chosen It s all over Lois Dunlap said in a low voice as the butler retreated Lydia made her look very beautiful I thought it would be rather horrible having to see her as the poor child requested in her note to Lydia but I m glad now I did She looked as sweet and young and innocent as she must have been when she first wore the royal blue velvet I m glad Dundee said sincerely Then he leaned toward her across the tea table missus Dunlap will you please tell me just how you persuaded missus Selim to come to Hamilton so far from Broadway Why certainly Lois Dunlap looked puzzled But it really did not take much persuasion after I showed her some group photographs we had made when we Forsyte girls put on The Beggar s Opera here last October a benefit performance for the Forsyte Alumnae Scholarship fund With difficulty Dundee controlled his excitement May I see those photographs please I had to hunt quite a bit for them his hostess apologized ten minutes later as she spread the glossy prints of half a dozen photographs for Dundee s inspection Do you know The Beggar s Opera John Gay eighteenth century isn t it As I remember it it is quite and Dundee hesitated grinning Bawdy Lois laughed Oh very We couldn t have got away with it if it hadn t been a classic As it was we had to tone down some of the naughtiest passages and songs But it was lots of fun and the boys enjoyed it hugely because it gave them an opportunity to wear tight satin breeches and lace ruffles This is my husband Peter He adored being the highwayman Robin of Bagshot and she pointed out a stocky belligerent looking man near the end of the long row of costumed players in a photograph which showed the entire cast You say that missus Selim accepted your proposal after she saw these photographs Dundee asked Had she refused before Yes I d gone to New York for the annual Easter Play which the Forsyte School puts on because I m intensely interested in semi professional theatricals Lois explained Nita had done a splendid job with the play the year before and I spoke to her after this year s show was over about coming to Hamilton She was not at all interested but polite and sweet about it so I invited her to have lunch with me the next day and showed her these photographs of our own play in the hope that they would make her take the idea more seriously We had borrowed a Little Theater director from Chicago and I knew we had done a really good job of The Beggar s Opera The local reviews These stills look extremely professional I don t wonder that they interested Nita Dundee cut in Will you tell me what she said She rather startled me Lois Dunlap confessed I first showed her this picture of the whole cast and as I was explaining the play a bit she didn t know The Beggar s Opera she almost snatched the photograph out of my hands As she studied it her lovely black eyes grew perfectly enormous I ve never seen her so excited since What did she say Dundee interrupted tensely Why she said nothing just at first then she began to laugh in the queerest way almost hysterically I asked her why she was laughing I was a little huffy I m afraid and she said the men looked so adorably conceited and funny Then she began to ask the names of the players I told her that Macheath he s the highwayman hero you know was played by Clive Hammond that my Peter was Robin of Bagshot that Johnny Drake was another highwayman Mat of the Mint that Tracey Miles played the jailor Lockit Did she show more interest in one name than another Yes When I pointed out Judge Marshall as Peachum the fence she cried out suddenly Why I know him I met him once on a party Is he really a judge and she laughed as if she knew something very funny about Hugo as no doubt she did He was an inveterate lady killer before his marriage as you may have heard Do you think her first excitement was over seeing Judge Marshall among the players Dundee asked No Lois answered after considering a moment I m sure she didn t notice him until I pointed him out The face in this group that seemed to interest her most was Flora Miles Flora played the part of Lucy Lockit the jailor s daughter and Karen Marshall the other feminine lead Polly Peachum you know But it was Flora s picture she lingered over so I showed her this picture and Lois Dunlap reached for the portrait of Flora Miles unexpectedly beautiful in the eighteenth century costume tight bodice and billowing skirts She questioned you about missus Miles Dundee asked Yes All sorts of questions her name and whether she was married and then who her husband was and if she had had stage experience Lois answered conscientiously She explained her interest by saying Flora looked more like a professional actress than any of the others and that we should give her a real chance when we got our Little Theater going I asked her if that meant she was going to accept my offer and she said she might but that she would have to talk it over with a friend first Just before midnight she telephoned me at my hotel that she had decided to accept the job Dundee s heart leaped It was very easy to guess who that friend was But he controlled his excitement asked his next question casually Did she show particular interest in any other player Yes She asked a number of questions about Polly Beale and seemed incredulous when I told her that Polly and Clive were engaged Polly played missus Peachum and was a riot in the part But Nita s intuition was correct Flora carried off the acting honors Oh yes she also asked quite naively if all my friends were rich too and could help support a Little Theater I reassured her on that point And Dundee reflected silently upon a point much more important to Nita Selim Aloud he said I don t see you among the cast Oh I haven t a grain of talent Lois Dunlap laughed I can t act for two cents can I Peter darling Here s the redoubtable Robin of Bagshot in person mister Dundee my husband The detective rose to shake hands with the man he had been too absorbed to see or hear approaching You re the man from the district attorney s office Peter Dunlap scowled his hand barely touching Dundee s I suppose you re trying to get at the bottom of the mystery of why my wife brought that Selim woman Don t call her that Selim woman Peter Lois Dunlap interrupted with more sharpness than Dundee had ever seen her display You never liked the poor girl were never just to her Well it looks as if my hunch was correct doesn t it the stocky rugged faced man retorted I told you at the beginning to pay her off and send her back to New York You knew I couldn t do that even to please you dear Lois said But please don t let s quarrel about poor Nita again She s dead now and I want to do anything I can to help bring her murderer to justice There s nothing you can do Lois and I hope mister ah Dundee will not find it necessary to quiz you again Dundee reached for his hat I hope so too mister Dunlap By the way you are president of the Chamber of Commerce aren t you Yes I am And we re having a meeting tonight at which that Sprague man s bid on making a historical movie of Hamilton will be turned down unanimously Now that the Selim woman isn t here to vamp my fellow members into doing anything she wants I think I can safely promise you that Dexter Sprague will have no further business in Hamilton unless it is police business Thanks for the tip mister Dunlap Dundee said evenly I hope you enjoyed your fishing trip Where do you fish sir A tactful way of asking for my alibi eh Dunlap was heavily sarcastic I left Friday afternoon for my own camp in the mountains up in the northwest part of the state I drove my own car went alone spent the week end alone and got back this noon I read of the murder in a paper I picked up in a village on my way home I didn t like Nita Selim and I don t give a damn about her being murdered except that my wife s name is in all the papers Any questions None thanks Dundee answered curtly then turned to Lois Dunlap who was watching the two men with troubled embarrassed eyes I am very grateful to you missus Dunlap for your kindness The detective s angry resentment of Peter Dunlap s attitude lasted until he had circled Mirror Lake and was on the road into Hamilton Then commonsense intervened Dunlap was undoubtedly devoted to his wife Penny had said that he had never looked at another woman It was rather more than natural that he should be in a futile blustering rage at the outcome of Lois friendship for the little Broadway dancer Free of anger his mind reverted to the story Lois Dunlap had told him For in it he was sure was hidden the key to the mystery of Nita Selim s murder Not at all interested in the proposition to organize a Little Theater in Hamilton Nita had been seized with a strange excitement as soon as she was shown photographs of a large group of Hamilton s richest and most prominent inhabitants But there was the rub A large group Would that group of possible suspects never narrow down to one Of course there was Judge Marshall but if Lois Dunlap s memory was to be trusted Nita had not noticed the elderly Beau Brummel s picture until after that strange hysterical excitement had taken possession of her And if it had been Judge Marshall whom she had come to Hamilton to blackmail would Nita not have guarded her tongue before Lois The same was true about her extraordinary interest in Flora Miles Dundee tried to put himself in Nita s place confronted suddenly with a group picture containing the likeness of a person man or woman against whom she knew something so dreadful and so secret that her silence would be worth thousands of dollars Would he have chattered of that very person No Of anyone else but that particular person It was easy to picture Nita her head whirling with possibilities hitting upon the most conspicuous player in the group dark tense theatrical Flora already pointed out to her as one of the two female leads in the opera But of whom had she really been thinking Again a blank wall For in that group photograph of the cast of The Beggar s Opera had appeared every man woman and girl who had been Nita s guest on the day of her murder Dundee paying more attention to his driving now that he was in the business section of the city saw ahead of him the second rate hotel where Dexter Sprague had been living since Nita had wired him to join her in Hamilton On a sudden impulse the detective parked his car in front of the hotel and five minutes later was knocking upon Sprague s door Well what do you want now the unshaven pallid man demanded ungraciously Dundee stepped into the room and closed the door I want you to tell me the name of the man Nita Selim came here to blackmail Sprague Blackmail Sprague echoed his pallid cheeks going more yellow You re crazy Nita came here to take a job She came here to blackmail someone and I am convinced that she sent for you to act as a partner in her scheme No wait I m convinced I tell you Dundee assured him grimly But I ll make a trade with you in behalf of the district attorney Tell me the name of the person she blackmailed and I will promise you immunity from prosecution as her accomplice Get out of my room and Dexter Sprague s right forefinger trembled violently as it pointed toward the door in a melodramatic gesture Very well Sprague Dundee said But let me give you a friendly warning Don t try to carry on the good work Nita got ten thousand dollars but she also got a bullet through her heart And the gun which fired that bullet is safely back in the hands of the killer You re not going to get that movie job and I was just afraid you might be tempted Good afternoon CHAPTER TWENTY It was Wednesday evening four whole days since Nita Leigh Selim Broadway dancer had been murdered while she was dummy at bridge Plainclothesmen in pairs day and night shifts still guarded the lonely house in Primrose Meadows but Dundee had taken no interest in the actual scene of the crime since Carraway fingerprint expert had reported negatively upon the secret shelf between Nita s bedroom closet and the guest closet So far as any tangible evidence went only Dundee s fingers had pressed upon the pivoting panel and explored the narrow shelf The very lack of fingerprints had of course confirmed Dundee s belief that the murderer s hand had pressed upon that swinging panel had quested in vain for the incriminating documents or letters which had been the basis of Nita s blackmail scheme had deposited upon the shelf the gun and silencer with which the murder had been accomplished and had later retrieved the weapon in perfect safety A hand loosely wrapped in a handkerchief or protected by a glove The hand of a cunning careful cold blooded murderer or murderess But who Who Bonnie Dundee brooding at his desk in the living room of his small apartment reflected bitterly that he was no nearer the answer to that question than he had been an hour after Nita Selim s death Well my dear Watson he addressed his caged parrot finally What do you say Who killed Nita Selim The parrot stirred on his perch thrust out his hooked beak to nip his master s prodding finger then disdainfully turned his back I don t blame you Cap n Dundee chuckled You must be as sick of that question as I am And what a pity it ever had to be asked If the murderer had not been so hasty or so pressed for time that he really could not wait to listen to Nita he would have learned from Nita herself that she had decided to be a very good girl and had burned the papers all because she was genuinely in love with Ralph Hammond One comfort we have my dear Watson the murderer still does not know that Nita burned the papers Friday night Sooner or later when he believes police vigilance has been relaxed he ll go prowling about that house and to Captain Strawn who doesn t take the slightest stock in my theory will go credit for the arrest Unless Dundee reached for a telegraph form and again scanned the pencilled message Only that afternoon had it occurred to him to ask the telegraph company for a copy of the wire by which Dexter Sprague according to his own story had been summoned to Hamilton by Nita Selim The manager had been obliging had looked up the message and copied it with his own hand It was a night letter and had been filed in Hamilton April twenty four the third day after Nita s arrival Addressed to Dexter Sprague at a hotel in the theatrical district New York City the message read EVERYTHING JAKE SO FAR BUT WOULD FEEL SAFER YOU HERE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE PLANNING BOOSTER MOVIE FOUNDING AND DEVELOPMENT OF HAMILTON LOOKING GOOD DIRECTOR WHY NOT TRY FOR JOB AS GOOD EXCUSE ALL MY LOVE NITA Dundee laid the paper on his desk locked his hands behind his head and addressed the parrot again The habit of using the bird for an audience and as an excuse for puzzling and mulling aloud had grown on him during the year he had owned the doughty old Cap n As I was about to say my dear Watson Captain Strawn s boys out at the Selim house will have their chance to nab our man or woman unless Dexter Sprague ignores my warning pretends to have the papers himself and tries to carry on the blackmail scheme which he undoubtedly knew all about and which most probably he encouraged Nita to undertake the friend she had to consult you know before she decided to accept Lois Dunlap s offer The parrot interrupted with a hoarse cackle Have you gone over to the enemy Cap n Dundee reproved the bird You sound exactly like Strawn when he laughed at my interpretation of this message this afternoon My late chief contends and it is just possible of course that he is right that Nita was afraid she couldn t swing the job of organizing and directing Lois Little Theater and wanted Sprague here both as lover and unofficial assistant But that s a pretty thin explanation don t you think my dear Watson Oh all right Laugh damn you But I d feel better if Strawn had taken my advice and set a dick to trail Sprague to see that he keeps out of mischief All this however gets us no nearer to answering that eternal question Who With a deep sigh the troubled young special investigator reached for the Time Table he had drafted from his notes made during the grisly replaying of the death hand at bridge and scanned it again five twenty Flora Miles dummy Table No one leaves living room to telephone five twenty two Clive Hammond arrives and goes directly into solarium five twenty three End of rubber at Table No one Players Polly Beale Janet Raymond Lois Dunlap Flora Miles dummy Polly Beale leaves living room to join Clive Hammond in solarium five twenty four Janet Raymond leaves room says she went straight to front porch five twenty five Tracey Miles parks car at curb walks up to the house hangs up hat in clothes

and Karen leaves room to tell Nita the score five thirty eight Karen screams upon discovering the dead body at the dressing table Dundee laid aside the typed sheet and reached for another the typing of which was perfect since Penny s efficient fingers had manipulated the keys When he had telephoned to the office just before five o clock Monday afternoon to see if anything had come up Dundee had learned from Penny that Peter Dunlap had issued an informal call to the crowd for a meeting at his home that evening You re going of course Dundee had asked Then during the discussion of the case I wish you d try to get the answers to some questions which need clearing up if you can do so without getting yourself in Dutch with your friends Fine Got a pencil Here goes And now he was re reading the report she had conscientiously written and left on his desk Tuesday morning Peter declaring he wanted to get at the bottom of this case presided almost like a judge on the bench and asked nearly every question you wanted the answer to Everyone in the crowd adores gruff old Peter and no one dreamed of resenting his barrage of questions What a detective he would make First Janet admitted that she did not go directly to the front porch when she left the living room after her table finished the last rubber Went first to the hall lavatory to comb her hair and renew her make up Said she was there alone about five minutes then went to the front porch Revised her story after Tracey had said he did not see her on the porch when he arrived Second Judge Marshall said he glanced into the living room when he arrived saw Karen Carolyn and me absorbed in our game and went on down the hall to hang up his hat and stick Proceeded immediately to the living room Third John Drake told Peter he entered the front hall and passed on to the lavatory to wash up Felt sticky after his walk from the Country Club Hung up hat in the guest closet Went to living room within three minutes after reaching the house Fourth Polly and Clive told Peter they stayed together in the solarium the whole time stationed at a front window watching for Ralph When Peter asked them if they could confirm Judge Marshall s story and Johnny Drake s story they said they had seen them both arrive but had paid no attention to them after they were in the house It occurred to Peter too to wonder if either Polly or Clive went to Nita s room to warn her that Ralph knew about Sprague s having slept the night before in the upstairs bedroom They both denied emphatically that they had done so Fifth Judge Marshall the pompous old darling still smarting under the insinuations you made about him and Nita right after the murder volunteered the information to Peter that Nita had not paid her rent on the plea that she was short of funds and that he had told her to let it go until it was quite convenient Sixth The word blackmail was not mentioned and Johnny Drake because of professional ethics I suppose did not tell about Nita s two deposits of five thousand dollars each in his bank Seventh The secret shelf in the foyer closet was not mentioned Peter s verdict after he got through with us was that only Sprague could have done it using the gun and silencer which Nita herself had stolen from Hugo I couldn t tell him that you are convinced that Lydia s alibi for him is a genuine one for apparently Lydia hasn t told either Flora or Tracey that she was able to furnish Sprague an alibi And that s all except that Peter asked me to convey to you his apologies for his rudeness Monday afternoon Penelope Crain With a deep sigh Dundee laid Penny s report aside And that does seem to be all my dear Watson he told the parrot Exactly half a dozen possible suspects and not an atom of actual evidence against one of them except that Judge Marshall owned the gun Six count em Judge Marshall John Drake Flora Miles Clive Hammond Polly Beale Janet Raymond Every single one of them a possible victim of blackmail since the girls all attended the Forsyte School where Nita directed the Easter play for two years and since the men make several trips a year to New York Six people all of whom probably knew of the existence of the secret shelf Six people who knew Nita was in her bedroom either from having seen her go or from hearing her powder box tinkling its damnable tune Yes Penny You re right That s all so far as Hamilton is concerned If Sanderson won t let me go to New York which is where this damned business started I ll resign and go on my own without wasting another day here But Dundee did not go to New York the next morning He was far too busy in Hamilton CHAPTER TWENTY ONE Hello Penny Dundee greeted the district attorney s private secretary Thursday morning at five minutes after nine Any news from Sanderson Yes Penny Crain answered listlessly A night letter He says his mother is still very low and that we re to wire him at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Chicago if anything turns up Then I suppose I can reach him there by long distance and Dundee lifted the telephone from Penny s desk to put in the call What s happened Penny demanded her brown eyes wide and startled And hurry it up will you please Dundee urged the long distance operator before hanging up the receiver and answering Penny s question That s just the trouble nothing s happened and nothing is very likely to happen here I m determined to go to New York and work on this pesky case from that end Then you ve come around to Captain Strawn s theory that it was a New York gunman Penny asked hopefully Not by a jugful But what s the matter with you this morning young woman You re looking less like a new penny and more like one that has been too much in circulation Thanks Penny retorted sarcastically then she grinned wryly You are right as a matter of fact I was up too late last night bridge at the Mileses Bridge Dundee ejaculated incredulously So the bridge party did take place in spite of the society editor s discreet announcement yesterday that owing to the tragic death of missus Selim the regular every other Wednesday dinner bridge of the Forsyte Alumnae Association will not be held this evening at the home of mister and missus Tracey Miles as scheduled It wasn t a dinner bridge and it really wasn t intended to be a party Penny corrected him It just sort of happened and of all the ghastly evenings Tell me about it Dundee suggested Knowing this town s telephone service as I do I ll have plenty of time to listen and you don t know how all agog I am for inside gossip on Hamilton s upper crust Idiot Penny flung at him scornfully You know society would bore you to death but I don t think you would have been exactly bored last night knowing as I do your opinion of Dexter Sprague Sprague Good Lord Was he there This does promise to be interesting Tell me all Give me time Penny snapped I might as well talk since there s almost no work for me to do with Bill away Ralph called me up last night at dinner time and asked me if I felt equal to playing bridge again He said that he Clive Tracey and Johnny Drake had lunched together yesterday as they frequently do at the Athletic Club and that Judge Marshall who had been lunching at another table with his friend Attorney Sampson stopped at their table and suggested a bridge game at his home for last night Hugo said he wanted to coax Karen into playing again so she would get over her hysterical aversion to the game since she had to replay that awful death hand You see Penny explained parenthetically Hugo is a regular bridge fiend and naturally he doesn t want to be kept out of his game Brute Dundee cried disgustedly Why couldn t he give the poor girl a few days more That s what I thought Penny acknowledged But I didn t get an inhibition against bridge and the idea rather appealed to me personally The last few days haven t been particularly cheerful ones so I told Ralph I d be glad to go Tracey had suggested his house instead of Hugo s because Betty wasn t well yesterday and Flora wouldn t want to leave her for a whole evening Well Ralph and I Are you going to marry Ralph Hammond Penny Dundee interrupted as if prompted by casual interest Penny s pale face flushed vividly No I m not in love with him and I m sure he realizes I m not and won t ask me again But I had to say yes Sunday I simply couldn t let you walk in on us after I d permitted you to eavesdrop while he was talking without first saying the one thing that would convince him that I believed in his innocence and hadn t set a trap for him I see Dundee acknowledged soberly but his blue eyes shone with sudden joy Oh There s long distance Just a minute darling Hello Hello Yes this is Dundee Oh All right Try again in fifteen minutes will you He hung up the receiver and explained to Penny Sanderson hasn t reached the hospital yet but is expected soon Go on with your story Who all played bridge at the Mileses You don t mean to say Dexter Sprague was invited too Penny s face was still a brilliant pink as she answered I refuse to have my climax spoiled When Ralph and I got there at eight we found that Peter and Lois had dined with Tracey and Flora and that they were delighted at the prospect of bridge as a relief from endless discussions of the murder We d hardly got there when the Marshalls came poor little Karen not suspecting that she was going to have to play Then came Johnny Drake alone with the news that Carolyn was in bed and very miserable with a summer cold Polly walked over from her house which is on the next hill to the right you know She said Clive had decided to work late at the office and had promised to call for her about eleven to take her home What about Janet Raymond Was she left out Dundee asked I told you it wasn t a planned affair Penny reminded him But Flora did telephone her and she said she didn t feel like coming She s been moping about like a sick cat since Nita s death We all knew she was idiotically in love with Dexter Sprague and it must have been an awful blow to her to hear you read aloud that note Nita received from Sprague So I noticed Dundee nodded recalling the deathly pallor of the girl s face as Sprague had glibly explained away that damning note and all its implications Well Penny continued Tracey suggested bridge and at first Karen flatly refused to play but Hugo finally persuaded her Karen would do absolutely anything for that ridiculous old husband of hers I simply can t understand it how she can be in love with him I mean I thought you liked Judge Marshall Dundee laughed Oh I do in a way But fancy a young girl like Karen being in love with him Well anyway we all went out to the east porch which is kept in readiness for bridge all summer Iron bridge tables covered with oilcloth and with oilcloth pouches for the cards and score pads so there s never any bother about scurrying in with things on account of rain It s a roofed stone floored porch right outside the living room and under it are the garages so it s high and cool with a grand view of Mirror Lake down below and of the city in the distance She sighed and Dundee knew that she was thinking of her own lost home in Brentwood the fine old Colonial mansion which had been sacrificed to her father s disastrous Primrose Meadows venture Then she went on I don t know why I am telling you all this except that the setting was so pleasant that we should have had a much better time than we did You re an artful minx Penny Dundee chuckled You re working up suspense for the entrance of the villain Then let me do it justice Penny retorted Lois and Peter Ralph and I made up one table for bridge Tracey and Polly Judge Marshall and Karen the other Flora said she didn t want to play because she wanted to be free to keep an eye on Betty although she protested she had perfect faith in Lydia who Flora says is proving to be a marvel with the children And Johnny Drake asked her to play anagrams with him in between trips to the nursery Johnny has a perfect pash for anagrams and is a wow at em So Tracey got the box of anagrams out of the trophy room The trophy room Dundee repeated amused That s what Tracey calls it Penny explained impatiently because he has a couple of golf cups and Flora has an immense silver atrocity which testifies to the fact that she was the lady s tennis champion of the state for one year There are also some mounted fish and some deer heads with incredible antlers but the room is really used as a catch all for all the sports things racquets golf clubs skis ping pong table et cetera Anyway Tracey brought out the box of anagrams and we were all having a pretty good time when at half past eight the butler announced Mr Dexter Sprague Your tone makes me wish I d been there Dundee acknowledged What happened You know how slap em on the back Tracey always is Penny asked grinning Well you should have seen him and heard him as he dismissed poor Whitson the butler as if he were giving him notice instead of letting him off for the night And the icy dignity with which he greeted poor Sprague Poor Sprague Dundee echoed Well after all Sprague had been received by all the crowd before Nita s death Penny retorted I think it was rather natural for him to think he d still be welcome He began to apologize for his uninvited presence saying he had felt lonesome and depressed and had just jumped into a taxi and come along hoping to find the Mileses in Flora tried to act the lady hostess but Peter got up from his bridge table and said in tones even icier than Tracey s Will you excuse me Flora And will you take my place Drake I m going into the library I don t enjoy the society of murderers Good Lord Dundee ejaculated shocked but admiring Did Sprague make a quick exit Not just then Penny said mysteriously Of course everyone was simply stunned but Sprague retorted cheerfully Neither do I Dunlap Peter stalked on into the living room on his way to the library Johnny took his place at the bridge table and Tracey at an urgent signal from Flora offered his seat at the other table to Sprague as if he were making way for a leper Poor Polly had to be Sprague s partner Flora as if she were terrified at what might happen you know how frightfully tense and nervous she is made an excuse to run upstairs for a look at Betty And something terrible did happen Dundee guessed You re looking positively ghoulish Out with it After about half an hour of playing without pivoting Penny went on imperturbably Hugo bid three spades Karen raised him in a trembling voice to five spades Hugo of course went to a little slam and Dexter Sprague if you can believe me said Better not leave the table Karen A little slam bid in spades has been known to be fatal to the dummy No Dundee was genuinely shocked but before he could say more the telephone rang Sanderson at last Hello Chicago Oh hello Captain Strawn What s that Oh my God Where did you say the body is He listened for a long minute then with a dazed Thanks I ll be over he hung up the receiver Sprague murdered he answered the horrified question in Penny s eyes Body discovered this morning about nine by one of the Miles maids in what you described just now as the trophy room Shot just below the breastbone Captain Strawn says The trophy room Penny cried Then that s where he was all the time after he disappeared so strangely last night Whoa Penny Dundee commanded Get hold of yourself You re shaking all over I want to know everything you know as quickly and as accurately as you can tell it Go right on Poor Dexter Penny groaned covering her convulsed face with her hands To think that he was dead when we were saying such horrid things about him Don t waste sympathy on him honey Dundee cut in his voice very gentle but urgent If he had heeded my warning Monday he wouldn t be dead now What do you mean Penny gasped but she was already calmer Your warning I had a strong suspicion that he was mixed up with Nita in her blackmail scheme and I took the trouble to warn him not to try to carry on with it Yesterday afternoon I begged Strawn to have him shadowed to see that he kept out of mischief I was afraid the temptation would be too strong for him but Strawn wouldn t listen to me still clinging to his theory of a New York gunman Feeling better now honey Can you go on I want to get out to the Miles house as soon as I can You re getting very affectionate aren t you Penny gave him a wobbly smile in which however there was no reproof I think I can go on now Where was I Good girl Dundee applauded but his heart was beating hard with something more than excitement over Sprague s murder You d just told me about Sprague s warning Karen not to leave the table when she became dummy after Judge Marshall s little slam bid in spades I remember Penny said pressing her fingers into her temples But Karen did leave the table When Sprague said that awful thing poor Karen burst into tears and ran from the porch into the living room Hugo started to follow her but Sprague halted him by apologizing very humbly and then by adding I d really like to see you play this hand sir I believe I ve got the cards to set you with Of course he could not have said anything better calculated to hold Hugo who as I said is a regular fiend when it comes to bridge Well Hugo played the hand and made his little slam and then he again started to go look for Karen but Polly who was Sprague s partner you know told him in that brusque way of hers to go on with the game and give Karen a chance to have her little weep in peace Probably Hugo would have gone to look for her anyway but just then Flora came back She said Betty was asleep at last and that her temperature was normal and when she heard about Karen she offered to take her hand until Karen felt like coming back What did Drake do then He d been playing anagrams with missus Miles you said Dundee interrupted Don t you remember I told you Johnny had taken Peter s place at our table after Peter refused to breathe the same air as Dexter Sprague Penny reminded him Ralph and I Lois and Johnny were playing together and just at the time I became dummy Sprague became dummy at the other table He rose saying he had to go telephone for a taxi and passed from the porch into the living room Where is the telephone The one the guests use is on a table in the hall closet where we put our things Penny explained You can shut the door and hold a perfectly private conversation Well we never saw Dexter Sprague again Good Lord Another bridge dummy murdered Dundee groaned At least the newspapers will be happy Didn t anyone go to look for him after the hand was played Not straight off Penny answered with an obvious effort to remember clearly every detail Let s see Oh yes That hand was played out before Ralph had finished playing his at our table so I was free to pay attention to the other table Flora said that since they couldn t play another hand until Dexter came back she thought she d better hunt up Karen who hadn t come back yet How long was missus Miles away from the porch Dundee asked quickly Oh I don t know ten minutes maybe She came back alone saying she had found Karen in her bedroom Flora s room of course crying inconsolably Flora told Hugo he d better go up to her himself since she evidently had her feelings hurt because he hadn t followed her in the first place Tracey who wasn t playing bridge you remember because he had given up his place to Sprague asked Flora if she d seen Sprague and Flora said in a surprised voice No I wonder where he is all this time and Polly said that probably he d gone to the lavatory which opens into the main hall and is next to the library Well pretty soon Judge Marshall and Karen came back Pretty soon Just how long was Judge Marshall gone Dundee pressed her his pencil which had been flying to take down her every word poised over the notebook he had snatched from her desk I can t say exactly Penny protested thornily I was playing again at the other table I suppose it was about ten minutes for Ralph and I had made another rubber I remember Anyway Karen was smiling like a baby that has had a lot of petting but she said Hugo had promised her she wouldn t have to play bridge any more that evening so Flora remained at that table playing opposite Hugo while Tracey played with Polly As soon as Tracey became dummy Flora suggested he go look for Sprague And how long was he gone from the porch Dundee asked Less than no time Penny assured him He was back before Polly had finished playing the hand He said he d gone to the hall closet where Whitson the butler would have put Sprague s hat and stick and that he had found they were gone Well and you needn t put down well every time I say it Penny interrupted herself tartly Tracey said he supposed Sprague had ordered his taxi and had decided to walk down the hill to meet it and he added that that was exactly the kind of courtesy you could expect from a cad and a bounder like Sprague walking in uninvited making Karen cry then walking out without a word leaving the game while he was dummy Flora spoke up then and said it was no wonder Dexter had left without saying good by considering how he d been treated Then Tracey said something ugly and sarcastic about Flora s being disappointed because Sprague had decided not to spend the whole evening A first class row eh Dundee interrupted with keen interest Rather Flora almost cried said Tracey knew good and well that she had only been playing up to Sprague before Nita s death in the hope of getting the lead in the Hamilton movie if Sprague got the job of directing it and Tracey said So you call it playing up do you It looked like high powered flirting to me or maybe it was more than a flirtation Then Flora told him he hadn t acted jealous at the time and that he knew he d have been glad if she d got the lead Well just then along came Janet Janet Raymond Dundee ejaculated I thought you said she had refused the invitation when missus Miles phoned her So she had but she said she changed her mind had been blue all evening and needed cheering up How did she get in She walked over from her house which isn t very far from the Mileses and simply came up the path to the porch Penny explained Tracey asked her if she had seen Sprague on the road it s the same road Dexter would have had to take going down the hill to the main road and she acted awfully queer How Dundee demanded Exactly as she would act since she was in love with him Penny retorted She turned very red and asked if Sprague had inquired for her and Flora quite sharply told her he hadn t Then Janet said she was very much surprised that Sprague had been there and that she couldn t understand why he had behaved so strangely Then Lois said she might as well go fetch Peter from the library since Sprague was no longer there to contaminate the atmosphere She came back After how long a time Oh about five minutes I suppose Penny answered wearily She came in her arm linked with Peter s and laughing Said she had found him reading a Deadwood Dick thriller One of Tracey s hobbies she broke off to explain is collecting old fashioned thrillers like the Nick Carter Diamond King Brady Buffalo Bill and Deadwood Dick paper bound books Of course he didn t take up that hobby until a lot of other rich men had done it first There was never anybody less original than poor Tracey Well Flora gave up her place to Janet and again played anagrams with Johnny Peter taking his original place at our table Suddenly Polly threw down her cards she d been having rotten luck and seemed out of sorts and said she didn t want to play bridge any more So poor Flora again had to be the perfect hostess and switch from anagrams to bridge And Polly played anagrams with Drake Dundee prompted No She said she thought anagrams were silly and wandered off the porch and down the path calling over her shoulder that she was going to take a walk Tracey asked Johnny if he d mind mixing the highballs and bringing out the sandwiches Said Whitson had left a thermos bucket of ice cubes on the sideboard some bottles of ginger ale and a tray of glasses and sandwiches Told him he d find decanters of Scotch and rye and to bring out both So Drake left the room too Dundee mused Oh Lord I knew I d find that every last one of the six had a chance to kill Sprague as well as Nita How long was Polly Beale gone on this walk of hers She came in with a pink water lily said she d been down to the lily ponds and that Flora had enough to spare her one Penny answered She couldn t have been away more than ten minutes because Johnny was just mixing the highballs according to our preference for Scotch or rye or plain ginger ale which both Ralph and I chose After we d had our drinks and the sandwiches we went on with bridge Polly and Johnny just wandered about the porch or watched the game at the two tables And about five minutes after eleven Clive Hammond arrived coming up the path to the porch just as Janet had After he came there was no more bridge but we sat around on the porch and talked until midnight Clive said he was too tired to play bridge that he d been struggling all evening with a knotty problem I can sympathize with him Dundee said grimly as he rose I ve got my own knotty problem awaiting me When that call comes through from Chicago tell Sanderson the bad news and say I ll telephone him later CHAPTER TWENTY TWO The Miles home still known in Hamilton as the Hackett place since it had been built more than thirty years before by Flora s father old Silas Hackett dead these seven years dominated one of the most beautiful of the wooded hills which encircled Mirror Lake in the Brentwood section 
1845_145083_000001_000001	train-clean-360	Of modified Tudor architecture its deep red mellowed bricks had achieved in three decades almost the same aged dignity and impressiveness as characterized the three century old mansion in England which Silas Hackett s architect had used as an inspiration 
none	none	The big house faced the lake a long series of landscaped terraces leading down to the water s edge but the driveway wound from the state road up a side of the hill to the main entrance at the rear of the house 
1845_145083_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Once before on Sunday the day after Nita Selim s murder when he had come to interview Lydia Carr and had secured the alibi which had eliminated Dexter Sprague as a suspect Dundee had driven his car up this hill between the tall yew hedges 
none	none	But then he had taken the fork which led to the hooded doorway over the kitchen had descended the kitchen stairs with Lydia to the servants sitting room in the basement Now he continued along the main driveway to the more impressive entrance whose flanking slim turrets frowned down upon a line of police cars and motorcycles 
1845_145083_000004_000000	train-clean-360	His approach must have been expected and observed for it was the master of the house who opened the great iron studded doors and invited the detective into the broad main hall at the end of which down three steps lay the immense living room 
1845_145083_000004_000001	train-clean-360	The detective s first glance took in stately armchairs of the Cromwell period thick mellow toned rugs and in the living room beyond splendid examples of Jacobean furniture 
1845_145083_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 A horrible thing to happen in a man s home Dundee Miles was saying his plump rosy face blighted with horror 
none	none	I can t realize yet that we actually slept as usual with a corpse lying down here all night And I have only myself to blame
1845_145083_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you mean Dundee asked 
1845_145083_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Why that the the body wasn t discovered sooner Miles explained 
none	none	If it had occurred to me that Whitson hadn t closed the trophy room windows I should have gone in to close and lock them when I made the rounds of living room dining room and library after our guests were gone last night 
1845_145083_000008_000000	train-clean-360	A pale faced bald headed butler had materialized while his master was speaking 
1845_145083_000008_000001	train-clean-360	 Beg pardon sir but I did not close the trophy room windows because I thought you might be using the room again 
none	none	You see sir and Whitson turned to Dundee mister Miles and mister Dunlap played ping pong in the trophy room after dinner until the other guests began to arrive and I did not want them to find the room stuffy it was a warm night if any of the guests I see Dundee interrupted Who to your knowledge was the last person to enter the trophy room last night mister Miles
1845_145083_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 I was except Sprague of course and I had no idea he d gone there Drake wanted to play anagrams and before the bridge game started I went to the trophy room to get the box Miles explained 
1845_145083_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 I turned off the light when I left and there was no light burning in there this morning when Celia the parlor maid went there to put the anagram box back in the cabinet and found the body 
1845_145083_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Flora missus 
1845_145083_000010_000003	train-clean-360	Miles had brought the anagrams in from the porch and left them on a table in the living room as our guests were getting ready to leave 
none	none	There was nothing else to bring in in case of rain The bridge tables are of iron covered with oilcloth and fitted with oilcloth bags for the cards score pads and pencils
1845_145083_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I know Dundee interrupted 
none	none	Miss Crain has already told me all about that and a good many details of the party itself 
1845_145083_000011_000002	train-clean-360	By the way where is missus Miles now 
none	none	In bed The doctor is with her 
1845_145083_000012_000002	train-clean-360	She is prostrated from the shock 
none	none	Where is this room you call the trophy room Dundee asked No don t bother to come with me 
1845_145083_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Just point it out 
1845_145083_000013_000003	train-clean-360	It s on this floor I understand 
none	none	Miles pointed past the great circular staircase that wound upward from the main hall You can t see the door from here but it s behind the staircase Celia found the door closed this morning and no light on as I said 
1845_145083_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Dundee cut him short by marching toward the door which was again closed He entered so noiselessly that Captain Strawn doctor Price and the fingerprint expert Carraway did not hear him 
none	none	For a moment he stood just inside the door and let his eyes wander about the room which Penny Crain had already described 
1845_145083_000015_000002	train-clean-360	It was not a large room twelve by fourteen feet possibly but it looked even smaller crowded as it was with the long ping pong table bags of golf clubs fishing tackle tennis racquets skis and sleds 
none	none	There were two windows in the north wall of the room looking out upon the yew hedged driveway and between them stood a cabinet of numerous big and little drawers 
1845_145083_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Not until he had taken in the general aspect of the room did Dundee look at the thing over which Captain Strawn and the coroner were bending the body of Dexter Sprague 
none	none	The alien from New York had fallen about four feet from the window nearer the east wall of the trophy room 
1845_145083_000017_000001	train-clean-360	He lay on his side his left cheek against the floor the fingers of his left hand still clutching the powder burned bosom of his soft shirt now stiff with dried blood a pool of which had formed and then half congealed upon the rug 
none	none	The right hand the fingers curled but not touching each other lay palm upward on the floor at the end of the rigid outstretched arm 
1845_145083_000017_000003	train-clean-360	The one visible eye was half open but on the sallow thin face which had been strikingly handsome in an obvious sort of way was a peace and dignity which Dundee had never seen upon Sprague s face when the man was alive 
1845_145083_000017_000004	train-clean-360	The left leg was drawn upward so that the knee almost touched the bullet pierced stomach 
1845_145083_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 How long has he been dead doctor Dundee asked quietly 
1845_145083_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Hello boy doctor Price greeted him placidly 
none	none	Always the same question I ve been here only a few minutes and I ve already told Strawn that I shall probably be unable to fix the hour of death with any degree of accuracy Took your time didn t you Bonnie Captain Strawn greeted his former subordinate on the Homicide Squad Doc says he s been dead between ten and twelve hours Since it s nearly ten now that means Sprague was killed some time between nine and eleven o clock last night Better say between nine o clock and midnight last night doctor Price suggested
1845_145083_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 He may have lived an hour or more unconscious of course For the indications are that he did not die instantly but staggered a few steps clutching at the wound 
none	none	But of course I shall have to perform an autopsy first 
1845_145083_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Dundee crossed the room stepping over the dead man s stick a swank affair of dark polished wood with a heavy knob of carved onyx which lay about a foot beyond the reach of the curled fingers of the stiff right hand 
1845_145083_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Sprague s hat he asked pointing to a brightly banded straw which lay upon the top of the cabinet 
none	none	Yes Strawn answered And did you notice the window screen He pointed to the window in front of which the body lay 
1845_145083_000025_000001	train-clean-360	The sash of leaded panes was raised as high as it would go and beneath it was a screen of the roller curtain type raised about six inches from the window sill 
1845_145083_000025_000002	train-clean-360	A pair of curved nickel plated catches in the center of the inch wide metal band on the bottom of the coppernet curtain showed how the screen was raised or lowered 
1845_145083_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Dundee nodded frowning and Strawn began eagerly 
none	none	You ll have to admit I was right now boy You ve sneered at my gunman theory and tried to pin Nita s murder on one of Hamilton s finest bunch of people but you ll have to admit now that every detail of this set up bears me out Yes Sure 
1845_145083_000029_000001	train-clean-360	This is the way I figure it out Sprague has good reason to be afraid he s next on the program 
1845_145083_000029_000002	train-clean-360	He s nervous 
none	none	He hops a taxi at his hotel and comes here can t stick to his room any longer Wants a little human companionship 
1845_145083_000029_000005	train-clean-360	This crowd here and I have Miles word for it ain t any too glad to see him and shows it 
1845_145083_000029_000006	train-clean-360	He phones for a taxi to go back to his hotel about nine fifteen that was Miles says but decides to walk down the hill to meet it 
none	none	Don t want to go back out on the porch and lie about having had a good time when he hasn t Well he opens the front door or what would be the front door if this was any ordinary house but before he steps out he sees or hears something probably a rustling in the hedge across the driveway or maybe he even sees a face in the light from the lanterns on each side of the door He feels sure Nita s murderer has trailed him and is lying in wait for him In a panic he darts into this room and don t turn on the light for fear he ll be seen from the windows but he can see well enough to make out how the screens work and he was familiar with the house anyway I ll bet you anything you like Sprague stayed in this room for an hour or two till he thought the coast was clear then eased up this screen intending to climb out of the window and drop to the ground 
1845_145083_000029_000012	train-clean-360	Not much of a drop at that 
none	none	You can see that the tall hedge on this side of the driveway comes pretty near up to these windows Well I figure he laid his hat on this cabinet intending to reach in for it when he was outside but that he had already made some little noise which the gunman was listening for and that when he got the screen up this high the gunman crouching under the window let go with the same gun and silencer that he used to bump off Nita I ve got Miles word for it that neither he nor anybody else heard a shot 
1845_145083_000029_000016	train-clean-360	Of course nobody knew Sprague was in here and since his hat and stick was both missing from the hall closet they took it for granted he d beat it 
1845_145083_000029_000017	train-clean-360	Any objections to that theory boy 
1845_145083_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Just a few one in particular Dundee said 
none	none	But I grant it s a good one provided doctor Price s autopsy bears you out as to the course of the bullet and that Carraway finds Sprague s fingerprints on that contrivance for raising the screen Even then 
1845_145083_000031_000000	train-clean-360	But Dundee was not allowed to finish his sentence for Strawn was summoned to the telephone by Whitson 
none	none	When he returned there was a slightly bewildered look on his heavy old face That s funny 
1845_145083_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Collins the lad I sent to check up on the taxi companies says he s located the driver that answered Sprague s call last night 
1845_145083_000032_000002	train-clean-360	The driver says he was called about nine fifteen told to come immediately and to wait for Sprague at the foot of the hill on the main road 
1845_145083_000032_000003	train-clean-360	He says he waited there until half past ten then went on back to town sore n a boiled owl 
none	none	It doesn t look exactly as if Sprague were afraid of anyone outside of this house last night does it Dundee asked By the way I suppose you ve sent for everyone who was here Sure 
1845_145083_000034_000001	train-clean-360	But again Captain Strawn looked uncomfortable 
none	none	But we haven t been able to locate the Beale girl and Clive Hammond CHAPTER TWENTY THREE I d give a good deal to know which of those two suggested that it would be a good idea to get married the first thing this morning Dundee mused aloud as he put down the second extra which The Hamilton Morning News had had occasion to issue that Thursday It was two o clock and the district attorney s special investigator sat across the desk from Captain Strawn in his former chief s office at Police Headquarters The first extra had screamed in its biggest head type SECOND BRIDGE DUMMY MURDER and had carried in detail Captain Strawn s comforting theory that Dexter Sprague s erstwhile friends had again been made the victims of a New York gunman s fiendish cleverness in committing his murders under circumstances which would inevitably involve Hamilton s most highly respected and socially prominent citizens in the police investigation But the second extra had a more romantic streamer headline HAMMOND WEDDING DELAYS MURDER QUIZ The story beneath a series of smaller headlines began At the very moment nine five o clock this morning when Celia Hunt maid in the Tracey Miles home in the Brentwood district of Hamilton was screaming the news of her discovery of the dead body of Dexter Sprague New York motion picture director in what is known as the trophy room Miss Polly Beale and mister Clive Hammond were applying for a marriage license in the Municipal Building At nine thirty when Miss Beale and mister Hammond were exchanging their vows in the rectory of saint Paul s Episcopal Church of which both bride and groom have been members since childhood Captain John Strawn of the Homicide Squad was listening to Tracey Miles account of the strange disappearance of Dexter Sprague last night from an impromptu bridge game after he had announced his intention of taking advantage of the fact that he was dummy to telephone for a taxi And at ten o clock when the new missus Hammond called her home to break the news of her marriage to her aunt missus Amelia Beale the bride was in turn acquainted with the news of Sprague s murder and the fact that both she and her husband were wanted at the Miles home for questioning by the police since both had been guests of mister and missus Miles last night although mister Hammond did not arrive until about eleven o clock There followed a revision of the murder story as it had appeared in the first extra with additional details supplied by Strawn and with a line drawing of the scene of the crime the trophy room itself and the forked driveway with its tall yew hedges A dotted line illustrated Strawn s theory of Sprague s plan to elude the murderer who had followed him to the Miles home Because of the curved sweep of the driveway toward the main entrance of the house the tall hedge was less than two feet from the window with the partly opened screen Captain Strawn s theory read the text below the large drawing is that Sprague had good cause to fear he was being followed on his way to the Miles home that he telephoned for a taxi to wait for him at the foot of the hill and that he planned to leave the Miles house by way of the trophy room window so that his lurking pursuer might have no knowledge of his departure The drawing shows that his proposed flight would have been protected by hedges until he reached the wooded slope of the hill provided his Nemesis was lurking in the opposite hedge across the driveway where he could observe every departure from the Miles home You ve sure got a single track mind boy Strawn chuckled So you think those two got married in such a hurry this morning because the law says a husband or a wife can t be made to testify against the other Possibly Dundee grinned unruffled But there is another possibility which is why I should like to know who suggested this sudden wedding I mean that we can t overlook the possibility that these two murders made either the bride or the groom feel perfectly safe in going on with the marriage Polly Beale and Clive Hammond had been engaged for more than a year you know with no apparent reason for a long engagement As for my having a single track mind Captain what about you I have six possible suspects all of whose names I know and you have only one whose name you do not know and whose motive you can only guess at while I have a perfectly good motive that might fit any one of my six blackmail Is that so Strawn growled I m not telling the papers everything and if they are satisfied to call these murders crimes passionnels it s all right with me But I m not forgetting that Nita Selim banked ten thousand dollars cash after she got to Hamilton My real theory now that Sprague has been killed is that Nita and Sprague had cooked up some sort of racket between them and that when Nita got the chance to come to Hamilton with missus Dunlap she jumped at it and she and Sprague sprung their racket whatever it was either just before or just after Nita left New York Probably it was Nita s tip off and Sprague did the actual dirty work himself which explains that telegram that Nita sent him April twenty four just three days after she got to Hamilton Let s see again just what it says and Strawn reached for a copy of the night letter which Dundee himself had unearthed the day before See Everything Jake so far but would feel safer you here Yes I remember the wording quite well Dundee interrupted But you did not take it so seriously when I showed it to you yesterday If you had All right Rub it in Strawn snapped flushing darkly If I had assigned a man to tail Sprague as you suggested he wouldn t have been murdered He probably would have been murdered just the same Dundee comforted the older man but we might have been lucky enough to have had an eye witness Oh you and your theory Strawn growled But let me go on Nita meant she would feel safer about Sprague if he was here in Hamilton too But the guy they double crossed in New York or worked the badger game on or something like that got on their trail But it took him weeks to do it and Sprague followed Nita s advice He got here on Sunday April twenty seven and on Monday the twenty eighth Nita banked the first five thousand dollars Don t you see it boy Sprague brought with him the dough they d got for their stunt and thought it was safer for Nita to bank it in her name since it wasn t the name she was known by in New York anyway We ve checked up on Sprague pretty thoroughly He didn t have a bank book either on his body or in his room and every bank in town denies he had an account with them If that theory is correct it makes Nita Selim a pretty low character Dundee mused aloud Not only did she kick him out as a lover but she double crossed him as her partner in crime by willing the whole wad to Lydia Carr Sprague must have received quite a shock when he heard Nita s will read at the inquest Yeah Strawn agreed It looks like missus Dunlap picked a sweet specimen to make a friend out of Well that s my theory and I think it explains everything Their victim in New York simply hired a gunman or come down here himself when he got on their tracks Of course it was a good stunt to make it look like a local crime figured he d fool me just as he fooled you So the murderer simply trailed Nita around and saw that whole bunch of society people shooting at a target at Judge Marshall s place with a gun equipped with a Maxim silencer Too good an opportunity to be missed so he bides his chance to swipe the gun and silencer To make sure it will look like a local crime he pops off Nita when that same bunch is at her house but it takes a few days longer before he has the same opportunity to get Sprague But it come last night and he grabbed it A very plausible theory and one which in general the whole city of Hamilton has been familiar with since the night Nita was murdered Dundee remarked significantly What do you mean Strawn demanded It s waterproof ain t it Doc Price says the bullet and a thirty two caliber one at that entered Sprague s body just below the breastbone and traveled an upward course till it struck the extreme right side of the heart The bullet entered exactly where it would have to if the murderer was crouching under that window while Sprague was raising the screen And we have Carraway s report that it was Sprague s fingerprints on those nickleplated things you have to press together to make the screen roll up or down Furthermore I haven t a doubt in the world that the ballistics expert in Chicago will report that the bullet was fired from the same gun that killed Nita Selim Neither have I Dundee agreed But what I meant was that you had obligingly furnished the murderer who fits my theory with a theory he or she would not have upset for the world Listen and he bent forward very earnestly I m willing to grant that Sprague was shot from the outside through the window when Sprague raised the screen But there our theories part company I believe that the murderer was a guest in the Selim home last night that he or she had made an appointment to meet Sprague there on the promise of paying the hush money he had demanded in spite of my warning to him not to carry on with the blackmail scheme Naturally he or she and I ll say he from now on for the sake of convenience had no intention of being seen entering that room The bridge game was suggested by Judge Marshall at noon There was plenty of time for the rendezvous to be made with Sprague As I see it the murderer told Sprague to excuse himself from the game when he became dummy and to go to the trophy room and wait there until the murderer had a chance to slip away and appear beneath the window Sprague had been promised that when he raised the screen at a tap or a whispered request a roll of bills would be handed to him but he received a bullet instead And which one of your six suspects have you picked on Strawn asked sarcastically That s just the trouble There are still six Dundee acknowledged with a wry grin After Sprague s disappearance every one of the six was absent from the porch at one time or another No by George There are seven suspects now I was about to forget Peter Dunlap who admits he was alone on a fishing trip when Nita was murdered and who left the porch last night to go to the library as soon as Sprague arrived As for the movements of the original six after Sprague disappeared Polly Beale took a walk about the grounds Flora Miles went upstairs to hunt for Karen Marshall and was gone more than ten minutes Drake went to the dining room to get the refreshments and no one can say exactly how long he was gone Judge Marshall went up to get his wife and had time to make a little trip on the side Janet Raymond walked over from her home and passed that very window arriving after Sprague had disappeared and finally Clive Hammond arrived alone in his car which he parked within a few feet of that window This morning he gets married A telegram sir interrupted a plainclothesman who had entered without knocking Strawn snatched at it read it then exulted Read this boy I guess this settles the business The telegram had been filed half an hour before and was from the city editor of The New York Evening Press WORKING ON YOUR THEORY OF NEW YORK GUNMAN RESPONSIBLE MURDERS OF JUANITA LEIGH SELIM AND DEXTER SPRAGUE THIS PAPER HAS DISCOVERED THAT SELIM WOMAN WAS SEEN AT NIGHT CLUBS SEVERAL TIMES DURING JANUARY FEBRUARY WITH QUOTE SWALLOW TAIL SAMMY END QUOTE UNDERWORLD NAME FOR SAM SAVELLI STOP SAVELLI TAKEN FOR RIDE TUESDAY APRIL TWENTY SECOND TWO DAYS AFTER SELIM WOMAN LEFT NEW YORK STOP POLICE HERE WORKING ON THEORY SAVELLI SLAIN BY OWN GANG AFTER THEY WERE TIPPED OFF SAVELLI WAS DOUBLE CROSSING THEM STOP IN EXCHANGE FOR THIS TIP CAN YOU GIVE US ANY SUPPRESSED INFORMATION YOUR POSSESSION STOP SAVELLI HAD BROTHER WHO IS KNOWN TO US TO HAVE PROMISED REVENGE SWALLOW TAIL SAMMYS MURDER STOP BE A SPORT CAPTAIN Well that puts the lid on it don t it Strawn crowed I ll send Sergeant Turner to New York on the five o clock train Pretty decent of that city editor to wire me this tip I ll say And are you going to reciprocate by wiring him about the ten thousand dollars Nita banked here Dundee asked Sure Why not There s no use that I can see to keep it back any longer now that no one can have any excuse to think as you ve been doing that it was blackmail paid by a Hamiltonian Then Dundee began very slowly if you really think your case is solved I ll make one suggestion take charge of Lydia Carr and put her in a very safe place Why Strawn looked puzzled Because when you publish the fact that Nita and Sprague got ten thousand dollars for tipping off Savelli s gang that he was double crossing them and that Nita willed the money to Lydia the avenger s next and last job would be to get Lydia since his natural conclusion would be that Lydia had been in on the scheme from the beginning Dundee explained God boy You re right Strawn exclaimed and his heavy old face was very pale as he reached for the telephone and called the number of the Miles residence I m going to put it up to her that it will be best for her to be locked up as a material witness for her own protection Five minutes later Strawn restored the receiver to the hook with a bang Says she won t budge he explained unnecessarily Says she ain t afraid and the Miles kids need her Well it s her own funeral But I guess you are convinced at last Dundee slowly shook his head Almost but not quite chief Lord but you re stubborn Here s a water tight case A very pretty and a very satisfactory case but not exactly water tight Dundee interrupted There s just one little thing What do you mean Strawn demanded irritably Have you forgotten the secret shelf behind the guest closet in the Selim house Dundee asked I can afford to forget it since it hasn t got a thing to do with the case Strawn retorted angrily There s not a scrap of evidence Of course it does not fit into your theory Dundee agreed for Swallow tail Sammy s avenging brother could not have known of its existence but there is one thing about that secret shelf and its pivot door which I don t believe you can afford to forget Captain Yeah Strawn snarled Yeah I refer of course to the complete absence of fingerprints on the door and on the shelf itself Carraway didn t even find Nita Selim s fingerprints Since Nita would have had no earthly reason for carefully wiping off her fingerprints after she removed the papers she burned on Friday night it s a dead sure fact that someone else who had no legitimate business to do so touched that pivoting panel and the shelf and carefully removed all traces that he had done so And he continued grimly until I find out who that someone is I for one won t consider the case solved Fifteen minutes later Dundee was sitting at Penny Crain s desk in her office of the district attorney s suite replacing the receiver upon the telephone hook after having put in a call for Sanderson who was still in Chicago keeping vigil at the bedside of his dying mother Did you find out anything new when you questioned the crowd this morning Penny asked Besides the fact that Polly and Clive got married this morning I mean I wasn t surprised when I read about the wedding in the extra It was exactly like Polly to make up her mind suddenly after putting Clive off for a year So it was Polly who held back Dundee said to himself Aloud No I didn t learn much new Penny You re a most excellent and accurate reporter But there were one or two things that came out For instance I got Drake to admit to me in private that Nita did give him an explanation as to where she got the ten thousand dollars Yes Penny prompted eagerly Drake says Dundee answered dryly that Nita told him it was back alimony which she had succeeded in collecting from her former husband Unfortunately she did not say who or where the mysterious husband is Pooh scoffed Penny Don t you see She just said that to satisfy Johnny s curiosity After all it was the most plausible explanation of how a divorcee got hold of a lot of money So plausible that Drake may have thought of it himself Dundee reflected silently Aloud he continued his report to the girl who had been of so much help to him Among other minor things that came out this morning and which the papers did not report was the fact that Janet Raymond tried to commit suicide this morning by drinking shoe polish Fortunately her father discovered what she had done almost as soon as she had swallowed the stuff and made her take ipecac and then sent for the doctor Oh poor Janet Penny groaned She must have been terribly in love with Dexter Sprague though what she saw in him Dundee made no comment but continued with his information Another minor development was that Tracey Miles admitted that he and Flora had quarreled over Sprague after all of you left and that Flora took two sleeping tablets to make sure of a night s rest She s been awfully unstrung ever since Nita s murder Penny defended her friend She told us all Monday night at Peter s that the doctor had prescribed sleeping medicine Now you look here Bonnie Dundee she cried out sharply answering an enigmatic smile on the detective s face if you think Flora Miles killed Nita Selim and Dexter Sprague because she was in love with Dexter and learned he was Nita s lover from that silly note Whoa Penny Dundee checked her I m not linking exactly that But I ve just remembered something that had seemed of no importance to me before And what s that mister Smart Aleck Penny demanded furiously Before I answer that question will you let me do a little theorizing Dundee suggested gently Let us suppose that Flora Miles was not in love with Sprague but that she was being blackmailed by Nita for some scandal Nita had heard gossiped about at the Forsyte School No wait Let us suppose further that Nita recognized Flora s picture in the group Lois Dunlap showed her as the portrait of the girl whose story she had heard that she was able somehow to secure incriminating evidence of some sort letters let us say Nita tells Sprague about it and Sprague advises her to blackmail Flora who Lois has told Nita is very rich So Nita comes to Hamilton and bleeds Flora of ten thousand dollars Not satisfied Nita makes another demand the money to be paid to her the day of the bridge luncheon Silly Penny scoffed furiously The only evidence you have against poor Flora is that she stole the note Dexter had written to Nita That s the crux of the matter Penny darling Dundee assured her in a maddeningly soothing voice at which Penny clinched her hands in impotent rage Flora seeing Nita receive a letter written on her husband s business stationery jumps to the conclusion that Nita had carried out her threat to tell Tracey or that Nita has at least given Tracey a hint of the truth and that Tracey s special messenger note is let us say a confirmation of an appointment suggested by Nita Very well Flora goes to Nita s bedroom at the first opportunity knowing that Nita will come there to make up for the men s arrival Let s suppose Flora had brought the gun and silencer with her intending to frighten Nita rather than kill her But having had proof as she believes that Nita means business Flora waits in the closet until Nita comes in and sits down at her dressing table then steps out and shoots her Then she recoils step by step until her foot catches in the slack cord of the bronze lamp causing the very bang or bump which Flora herself describes later for fear someone else has heard it Her first concern of course is to hide the gun and silencer She remembers Judge Marshall s tale of the secret shelf in the guest closet and not only hides the gun there but seeks in vain for the incriminating evidence Nita has against her But she also remembers the note she believes Tracey has written to Nita and which if found after Nita s death may give her away So she goes to the closet in Nita s bedroom finds the note and faints with horror at her perhaps needless crime when she realizes that the note was written by Sprague and not Tracey Of course she is too ill and panic stricken to leave the closet until the murder is discovered But you think she was not too panic stricken to have the presence of mind to retrieve the gun and silencer and walk out with them under the very eyes of the police Penny scoffed No I think she was Dundee amazed her by admitting And that is where my sudden recollection of something I had considered unimportant comes in Let us suppose that Flora half suspected by Tracey confesses to him in their car as they are going to the Country Club for their long delayed dinner as were the rest of you Tracey loyal to her decides to help her He tells her to suggest at dinner that Lydia come to them as nurse so that he can go back to the house and get the gun and silencer from the guest closet hiding place if an opportunity presents itself as it did since I left Tracey Miles alone in the hall while I went into Nita s bedroom to talk with Lydia before I permitted her to go with Tracey You re crazy Penny told him fiercely when he had finished I suppose you are going to ask me to believe that Tracey was a big enough fool to leave the gun and silencer where Flora could get hold of it and kill Sprague last night Why not let us suppose that Tracey himself killed Sprague to protect his wife not only from scandal but from a charge of murder Dundee countered Tell me honestly do you think Tracey Miles loves Flora enough to do that for her Suddenly inexplicably Penny began to laugh not hysterically but with genuine mirth CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR What are you laughing at Dundee demanded indignantly but the sustained ringing of the telephone bell checked Penny Crain s mirthful laughter My Chicago call Hello Yes this is Dundee All right but make it snappy won t you Hello mister Sanderson How is your mother That s fine I certainly hope Yes the inquest is slated for tomorrow morning but there s no use your leaving your mother to come back for it Yes sir one important new development Can you hear me plainly Then hold the line a moment please With the receiver still at his ear Dundee fumbled in his pocket for a folded sheet of paper No operator We re not through Please keep off the line Listen chief he addressed the district attorney at the other end of the long distance wire This is a telegram Captain Strawn received this afternoon from the city editor of The New York Evening Press Can you hear me All right and he read slowly repeating when necessary When he had finished reading the telegram he listened for a long minute but not with so much concentration that he could not grin at Penny s wide eyed amazement and joy That s what I think sir he cried jubilantly I d like to take the five o clock train for New York and work on the case from that end till we actually get our teeth into something Thanks a lot and my best wishes for your mother Why didn t you tell me about this Swallow tail Sammy Penny demanded indignantly Tormenting me with your silly theory about poor Flora and Tracey when all the time you knew the case was practically solved I m afraid I gave the district attorney a slightly false impression Dundee interrupted but there was no remorse in his shining blue eyes But just so I get to New York By the way young woman what were you laughing at so heartily I didn t know I had made an amusing remark when I asked you if you thought Tracey Miles loved his wife well enough to commit murder for her Penny laughed again white teeth and brown eyes gleaming I was laughing at something else It suddenly occurred to me while you were spinning your foolish theory how flattered Tracey would have been if Flora had confessed to him Saturday night that she had killed Nita because she was jealous Which was not my theory if you remember Dundee retorted But why is the idea so amusing Deep in his heart I suppose any man would really be a bit flattered if his wife loved him enough to be that jealous You don t know Tracey Miles as well as I do Penny assured him her eyes still mirthful He s really a dear in spite of being a dreadful bore most of the time but the truth is Tracey hasn t an atom of sex appeal and he must realize it Of course we girls have all pampered his poor little ego by pretending to be crazy about him and terribly envious that it was Flora who got him But Flora Hackett did marry him Dundee interrupted She must have been a beautiful girl and she was certainly rich enough to get any man she wanted You would think so wouldn t you Penny agreed her tongue loosened by relief I was only twelve years old when Flora Hackett made her debut but a twelve year old has big ears and keen eyes It is true that Flora was beautiful and rich but well there was something queer about her She was simply crazy to get married and if a man danced with her as many as three times in an evening she literally seized upon him and tried to drag him to the altar Her eagerness and her intensity repelled every man who was in the least attracted to her and I think she was beginning to be frightened to death that she wouldn t get married at all when she happened to meet Tracey who had just got a job as salesman in her father s business She began to rush him there s no other word for it and none of the other girls minded a bit because without Flora Tracey would have been the perfect male wallflower They became engaged almost right away and were married six months or so later All the girls freely prophesied that even Tracey flattered by her passion for him as he so evidently was would get tired of it but he didn t and there were three marriages in the crowd that June Three Dundee repeated absently for his interest was waning Yes Lois Morrow and Peter Dunlap Johnny Drake and Carolyn Swann and Tracey and Flora Penny answered Although I was thirteen then and really too old for the role I had the fun of being flower girl for Lois and Flora both Do you think Flora was really in love with Tracey Dundee asked curiously Oh yes But she d have been in love with anyone who wanted to marry her and the funny thing is that with the exception of Peter and Lois they are the happiest married couple I have ever known You see Tracey has never got over being flattered that so pretty and passionate a girl as Flora Hackett wanted him And that s why I laughed Tracey with that deep rooted sexual inferiority complex of his would have been so flattered if Flora had told him she killed Nita out of jealousy that he would have forgiven her on the spot On the other hand she went on if Flora had told him that Nita had documentary proofs of some frightful scandal against her can t you see how violently Tracey would have reacted against her Oh no Tracey would not have taken the trouble to murder Sprague when Sprague popped up for more blackmail Perhaps he might have if the scandal dated back to before the marriage Dundee argued Let s suppose Sprague did pop up and Flora turned him over to Tracey When Sprague appeared apparently uninvited last night Flora must have been on pins and needles trying to make Tracey treat him decently and hoping against hope that Tracey would simply pay the scoundrel all the blackmail he was demanding Which is exactly what Tracey would have done instead of taking the awful risk of murdering him in his own home Penny cut in spiritedly Besides Tracey wasn t gone from the porch long enough to go outside signal to Sprague in the trophy room shoot him when Sprague raised the screen and then hide the gun I told you Tracey was gone only about a minute when he went to see if Sprague s hat and stick were gone from the closet Did Tracey and Flora both step outside to see their guests into their cars Dundee asked suddenly Tracey did Penny answered Flora told us all good night in the living room then ran upstairs to see if Betty was still asleep But remember we didn t leave until midnight and doctor Price says Sprague was killed between nine and eleven last night doctor Price would be the first to grant a leeway of an hour one way or another Dundee told her Of course if Tracey did kill him he let Flora believe that he had given Sprague the blackmail money he was demanding For it is inconceivable that a woman of Flora Miles hysterical temperament could have slept even with two sleeping tablets knowing that a corpse was in the house Oh I m sick of your silly theorizing Penny told him with vehement scorn Listen here Bonnie Dundee You probably laugh at woman s intuition but take it from me you re on the wrong track Oh I m not so wedded to that particular theory Dundee laughed I can spin you exactly six more just as convincing And I shan t listen You d better dash home and pack your bag if you want to catch the five o clock train for New York It s already packed and in my office Dundee assured her lazily Got lots of time Hullo Here s the home edition of The Evening Sun he interrupted himself as a small boy making his rounds of the courthouse flung the paper into the office He reached for it and read the streamer headline aloud ITALIAN GANGSTER SOUGHT IN BRIDGE MURDERS I wager a good many heads will lie easier on their pillows tonight Let me see Penny commanded and snatched the paper unceremoniously Oh Did you see this and she pointed to a boxed story in the middle of the front page Bridge Parties Cancelled she read aloud The society editor of The Evening Sun was kept busy at her telephone today receiving notices of cancellations of bridge parties scheduled for the remainder of the week Eight frantic hostesses terrified by Hamilton s second murder at bridge Oh that s simply a crime The newspapers deliberately work up mob hysteria and then I d rather not play bridge for a while myself Dundee laughed as he rose and started for his own office And don t you dare leave the room when you become dummy if you have the nerve to play again Remember that gun and silencer are still missing What do you mean You don t think there ll be more Dundee became instantly contrite before her terror I didn t mean it honey he said gently I think it is more than likely that the gun is at the bottom of Mirror Lake But do take care of yourself and by that I mean don t work yourself to death Any messages for anyone in New York Penny s pale face quivered If you happen to run across my father which of course you won t tell him that Mother would like him to come home At intervals during the sixteen hour run to New York Penny s faltering words returned to haunt the district attorney s special investigator although he would have preferred to devote his entire attention to mapping out the program he intended to follow when he reached the city which he fully believed had been the scene of the first act of the tragic drama he was bent upon bringing to an equally tragic conclusion As soon as he had registered at a hotel near the Pennsylvania Station and had shaved and breakfasted he took from his bag a large envelope containing the photographs Carraway had made of Penny alive and of Nita dead both clad in the royal blue velvet dress In the envelope also was the white satin gold lettered label which the dress had so proudly borne Pierre Model Copied by Simonson s New York City Half an hour later he was showing the photographs and the label to a woman buyer in the French Salon of Simonson s one of New York s most exclusive department stores Can you tell me when the original Pierre model was bought and when this copy was made and sold he asked The white haired smartly dressed buyer accepted the sheaf of photographs Bonnie Dundee was offering I ll do my best of course she began briskly then paled and uttered a sharp exclamation as her eyes took in the topmost picture This is Juanita Leigh isn t it But she shuddered how odd she looks as if Yes Dundee agreed gravely She was dead when that picture was taken Did you know missus Selim No the woman breathed her eyes still bulging with horror But I ve seen so many pictures of her in the papers To think that it was one of our dresses she chose for her shroud But you want to know when the dress was sold to her don t you she asked brisk again I can find out We keep a record of all our French originals and of the number of copies made of each Let me think I ve been going to Paris myself for the firm for the last fifteen years but I can t remember buying this Pierre model Oh of course I didn t go over during nineteen seventeen and nineteen eighteen on account of the war you know but the big Paris designers managed to send us a limited number of very good models and this must have been one of them Otherwise I d remember buying it If you ll excuse me a moment When she returned about ten minutes later Miss Thomas brought him a pencilled memorandum This Pierre model was imported in the summer of nineteen seventeen several months in advance of the winter season of course Only five copies were made in different colors and materials naturally since we make a point of exclusiveness The royal blue velvet copy was sold to Juanita Leigh in January nineteen eighteen I am sorry I cannot give you the exact day of the month but our records show the month only I took the liberty of showing a picture of the dress to the only saleswoman in the department who has been with us that long but she cannot remember the sale Twelve years is a long time you know Indeed it is Dundee agreed regretfully You have been immensely helpful however Miss Thomas and I thank you with all my heart If you could just tell me confidentially of course Miss Thomas whispered what sort of clue this dress is I don t know myself the detective admitted But he added to himself after he had escaped the buyer s natural curiosity I intend to find out Before he could take any further steps along that particular path however Dundee had an appointment to keep Upon arriving at his hotel that morning he had made two telephone calls He smiled now as he recalled the surprise and glee of one of his former Yale classmates now a discouraged young bond salesman with whom he had kept in touch You want to borrow my name and my kid sister Jimmy Randolph had chortled Hop to it old sport But you might tell me what you want with such intimate belongings of mine You may not know it Dundee had retorted but young mister James Wadley Randolph junior scion of the famous old Boston family is going to visit that equally famous school Forsyte on the Hudson to see whether it is the ideal finishing school for his beloved young sister Barbara She s about fifteen now isn t she Jimmy Going on sixteen and one of Satan s prize hellions Jimmy Randolph had answered The family would be eternally grateful if you could get Forsyte to take her but make them promise not to have any more chorus girls who plan to get murdered as directors of their amateur theatricals Bab would be sure to be mixed up in the mess I suppose that s the job you re on you flat footed dick you The second telephone call had secured an appointment at the Forsyte School for mister James Wadley Randolph junior of Boston and Dundee rather relishing his first need for such professional tactics relaxed to enjoy the ten mile drive along the Hudson It was a quarter to twelve when his taxi swept up the drive toward the big grey stone turreted building sedately lonely in the midst of its valuable acres Miss Earle says to come to the office a colored maid told him when he had given his borrowed name and led him from the vast hall to a fairly large room whose windows looked upon a tennis court and whose walls were almost covered with group pictures of graduating classes photographs of amateur theatrical performances and portrait studies of alumnae A very thin sharp faced woman of about forty with red rimmed eyes which peered nearsightedly rose from an old fashioned roll top desk and came forward to greet him I am Miss Earle Miss Pendleton s private secretary she told him as he shook her bony clammy hand I should have told you when you telephoned this morning that both Miss Pendleton and Miss Macon sailed for Europe yesterday We always have our commencement the last Tuesday in May you know But if there is anything I can do for you I should like to know something at first hand of the history of the school its well prestige special advantages curriculum and so on Dundee began deprecatingly I should certainly be able to answer any question you may wish to ask mister Randolph since I have been with the school for fifteen years Miss Earle interrupted tartly Then Forsyte must take younger pupils than I had been led to believe Miss Earle Dundee said with his most winning smile I was never a pupil here the secretary corrected him but she thawed visibly Of course I was a mere child when I finished business school but I have been here fifteen years fifteen years of watching rich society girls dawdle away four or five years just because they ve got to be somewhere before they make their debut But I mustn t talk like that or I ll give you a wrong impression mister Randolph Of its kind it is really a very fine school very exclusive riding masters dancing masters a golf pro and our own golf course native teachers for French Italian German and Spanish Oh the school is all right and will probably not suffer any loss of prestige on account of that dreadful murder out in the Middle West Murder Dundee echoed as if he had no idea what she was talking about Haven t you been reading the papers Miss Earle rallied him with a coquettish smile But I don t suppose Boston bothers with such sordid things she added her thin lipped mouth tightening Miss Pendleton was all cut up about it because missus Selim or Juanita Leigh as she was known on Broadway had directed our Easter play the last two years and the reporters simply hounded us the first two days after she was murdered out in Hamilton where a number of our richest girls have come from By Jove Dundee exclaimed Was the Selim woman connected with this school really I only read the headlines never pay much attention to murders in the papers I wish Miss Earle interrupted tartly fresh tears reddening her eyes that people wouldn t persist in referring to her as that Selim woman When I think how sweet and friendly she was how how kind and to Dundee s surprise she choked on tears before she could go on Of course I know it s dreadful for the school and I ought not to talk about it when you ve come to see about putting your sister into the school but Nita was my friend and it simply makes me wild You admired and liked her very much Dundee asked forgetting his role for the moment Yes I did And Miss Pendleton liked her too And you can imagine how clever and popular she was when a wonderful woman like missus Peter Dunlap who was Lois Morrow when she was in school here admired her so much she took her to Hamilton with her to direct plays for a Little Theater Why I never met anyone I was so congenial with the secretary went on passionately The girls here snub me and make silly jokes about me behind my back and call me nicknames but Nita was just as sweet to me as she was to anyone even Miss Pendleton herself Were you with her much Dundee dared ask With her much I should say I was she asserted proudly I have a room here live here the year round and both years Nita shared my room so she would not have to make the long trip back to New York every night during the last week of rehearsals We used to talk until two or three o clock in the morning Say she broke off in sudden terror You aren t a reporter are you A reporter Good Lord no Dundee denied in all sincerity Then he made up his mind swiftly This woman hated the school and all connected with it had grown more and more sour and envy bitten every year of the fifteen she had served here and she liked Nita Leigh Selim better than anyone she had ever met The opportunity for direct questioning was too miraculous to be ignored So he changed his tone suddenly and said very earnestly No I am not a reporter Miss Earle But I am not James Wadley Randolph junior I am James F Dundee special investigator attached to the office of the district attorney of Hamilton and I want you to help me solve the mystery of missus Selim s murder It took nearly ten precious minutes for Dundee to nurse the terrified but obviously thrilled woman over the shock and to get her into the mood to answer him freely But I shan t and can t tell you anything bad about Nita she protested vehemently wiping her red rimmed eyes The papers are all saying now that she got ten thousand dollars for double crossing some awful racketeer named Swallow tail Sammy but I know she didn t get the money that way She was too good From Nita s confidences to you do you have any idea how she did get the money Dundee asked Miss Earle shook her head I don t know but she got it honorably I know that Maybe she found her husband and made him pay alimony Dundee controlled his excitement with difficulty Did she tell you all about her marriage and divorce Again Miss Earle shook her head The only time she ever spoke of it was last year the first year she directed our play you know I asked her why she didn t get married again and she said she couldn t she wasn t divorced because she didn t know where her husband was and it was too expensive to go to Reno Of course she may have found him or something and got a divorce some time this last year and this money she got was a settlement She must have got a divorce since she was planning to be married again to a young man in Hamilton Dundee assured her soothingly The way everybody puts the very worst interpretation on everything when a person gets murdered Miss Earle stormed If poor Nita had belonged to a rich family like the girls here they would have spent a million if necessary to hush up any scandal on her I ve seen it done she added darkly and venomously CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE Bonnie Dundee s heart leaped but he forced himself to go softly I suppose he said casually a fashionable school like this has plenty of carefully hushed up scandals I ll say it has Miss Earle retorted inelegantly and with ghoulish satisfaction Money can do anything It makes my blood simply boil when I think of how those Forsyte girls in Hamilton so smug and snobbish in their hick town society must be running poor Nita down now that she s dead and can t defend herself If the truth were only known about some of them Dundee could almost have embraced the homely life soured spinster she was making his task so easy for him I ve met them all of course since missus Selim was murdered he said deprecatingly and I must say they seem to be remarkably fine women and girls Oh are they Miss Earle snorted Flora Hackett missus Tracey Miles she is now didn t happen to tell you the nice little fuss she kicked up when she was here did she Oh no I guess not She looks Dundee agreed like a girl who would have made things lively I ll say so Miss Pendleton nearly had nervous prostration Miss Earle plunged on then fear blanched her face for a moment You know you ve promised you ll never tell Miss Pendleton or Miss Macon that you talked to me You can depend on it that I will protect you Dundee assured her When did Flora Hackett kick up her little fuss Let s see Flora graduated in June nineteen twenty Miss Earle obliged willingly So it must have been in nineteen nineteen yes because she had one more year here Of course they let her come back Money She took the lead in our annual Easter play in nineteen nineteen and just because Serena Hart complimented her and told her she was almost as good as a professional Serena Hart Dundee wonderingly repeated the name of one of America s most popular and beloved stage stars Yes Serena Hart Miss Earle repeated proudly She was a Forsyte girl too and of course she did go into the chorus herself after she graduated in let s see nineteen seventeen because it was the second year after I d come to work here and Miss Pendleton nearly died because she was afraid Forsyte s precious prestige would be lowered but when Serena became a star everything was grand of course and Forsyte was proud to claim her Anyway Serena comes to the Easter play every year she can if she isn t in a Broadway play herself of course and so she saw Flora acting in the Easter play in nineteen nineteen and told her she was awfully good She was too but not half the actress that little Penny Crain was when she had the lead in the play four or five years ago Dundee s heart begged him to ask for more details of Penny s triumph but his job demanded that he keep the now too voluble Miss Earle to the business in hand And Flora Hackett he prompted Well the next day after the play the Easter vacation began you know and Flora forged a letter from her father giving her permission to spend the ten days Easter holiday with one of the girls who lived in Atlanta Miss Earle continued with great relish Well sir right in the middle of the holidays here came her father and mother they were both alive then and asked for Flora They wired the girl in Atlanta and Flora wasn t there and the Hacketts were nearly crazy But as luck would have it mister Hackett ran into a friend of theirs on Broadway and this friend began to tease mister Hackett about his daughter s being a chorus girl A chorus girl Dundee echoed taking care not to show his disappointment Of course they nabbed her right out of the show but that wasn t the worst of it Miss Earle went on dramatically and mysteriously They tried to hush it up of course but the word went through the school like wildfire that Flora wasn t only in the chorus but that she was living with an actor she d been writing fan letters to long before the Easter play went on Did you hear his name Dundee asked No Miss Earle acknowledged regretfully But I ll bet anything it was the truth Why Flora Hackett was so man crazy she flirted scandalously with every male teacher in the school The golf pro we had then got so scared of her he quit his job I suppose Dundee prompted craftily she wasn t any worse than some of the other Hamilton girls We ell Miss Earle admitted reluctantly nothing ever came out on any of the others but it looked mighty funny to me when Janet Raymond s mother took her out of school right in the middle of a term and hauled her off to Europe for a whole year I guess she suggested with raised eyebrows you know what it usually means when a girl has to spend a whole year abroad and her mother says she s taking her away for her health and Janet looking as healthy as any other girl in the school except that she was crying half the time and smuggling special delivery letters in and out by one of the maids Did you tell Nita these stories and point out the pictures of the girls Dundee had to risk asking Miss Earle froze instantly Naturally she was interested in the school and once when she said it always made her mad the way chorus girls were run down I told her that in my opinion society girls were worse than actresses and well of course I gave her some examples a lot of them worse than anything I ve told you about Flora Hackett and Janet Raymond I hope she added viciously that Nita dropped a hint or two if Flora or Janet had the nerve to high hat her when she was in Hamilton Perhaps she did Dundee agreed softly By the way how did Nita happen to get the job here of directing the Easter plays That s what the reporters wanted to know Miss Earle smiled But Miss Pendleton wouldn t tell them for fear Serena wouldn t like it and maybe be drawn into the scandal when everybody knows she s as straight as a string Did Serena Hart get her the job Dundee was amazed Yes Wait I ll show you the letter of recommendation she wrote for Nita to Miss Pendleton Miss Earle offered eagerly Remember now you re not to tell on me She went to a tall walnut filing cabinet and quickly returned with a note which she thrust into Dundee s willing hands He read Dear Miss Pendleton The bearer Juanita Leigh is rather badly in need of a job and I have suggested that she apply to you for a chance to direct the Easter play I have known Miss Leigh personally for ten years and have the highest regard both for her character and for her ability Since you usually stage musical comedies I think Miss Leigh who has been a specialty dancer as well as an actress in musical comedy for about twelve years would be admirably suited for the work Knowing my love for Forsyte as you do I do not have to assure you that I would suggest nothing which would be detrimental to the school s best interests Fondly yours Serena Hart She was wrong there but I know it wasn t Nita s fault Miss Earle who had been looking over his shoulder commented upon the last sentence of the letter Is Miss Hart appearing in a play now Dundee asked No but she s rehearsing in one Temptation which will open at the Warburton Theater next Monday night the secretary answered At commencement Tuesday night Serena told Miss Pendleton how awfully sorry she was about Nita and gave me tickets for the opening You go to see her but don t tell her I told you anything I know she s rehearsing at the theater this afternoon because she said she would be all week and couldn t go to the boat to see Miss Pendleton and Miss Macon off for Europe I will Dundee accepted the suggestion gratefully as if it had not occurred to him But first I want you to come out to lunch with me I m sure you know of some nice tearoom or roadhouse in the neighborhood During the luncheon which Miss Earle devoured avidly without its interfering with her flow of reminiscences concerning the girls she hated Dundee was able to learn nothing more to the detriment of Forsyte s Hamilton alumnae but he did add considerably to his knowledge and pity of female human nature It was nearly three o clock when he presented his card with a message pencilled upon its back to the aged doorkeeper who drowsed in the alley which led to the stage entrance of the Warburton Theater just off Broadway near Times Square and fifteen minutes later he was being received in the star s dressing room by Serena Hart herself You re working on poor Nita s murder she began without preamble as she seated herself at her dressing table and indicated a decrepit chair for the detective I was wondering how much longer I could keep out of it Of course you ve been pumping that poor foolish virgin Gladys Earle Why girls who look like that are always called Gladys God I m tired We ve been at it since ten this morning but thank the Lord we re through now for the day Dundee studied her with keen interest and decided that almost plain though she was she was even more magnetic than when seen from the footlights Rather carelessly dressed long brown hair rather tousled her face very pale and haggard without the make up which would give it radiance on Monday night Serena Hart was nevertheless one of the most attractive women Dundee had ever met and one of the kindest he felt suddenly sure When did I first meet Nita Leigh she repeated his question Let me think Oh yes The first year after I went on the stage nineteen seventeen We were in the chorus together in Teasing Tilly a rotten show by the way The other girls of the chorus were awfully snooty to me because I was that anathema a society girl but Nita was a darling She showed me the ropes and we became quite intimate around the theater only however since my parents kept an awfully strict eye on me The show was a great hit ran on into nineteen eighteen till February or March I believe Then do you know Miss Hart whether Nita got married during the winter Dundee asked Why yes she did Serena Hart answered her brow clearing after a frown of concentration I can t remember exactly when but it was before the show closed certainly a few weeks before because the poor child was a deserted bride days before the closing notice was posted Deserted Dundee exclaimed Did you meet her husband Miss Hart No Serena Hart replied As a matter of fact she told me extraordinarily little about him and did not discuss her marriage with the other girls of the chorus at all I got the impression that mister Selim Mat she called him wanted it kept secret for a while but I don t know why This was early in nineteen eighteen as I ve told you though I have no way of fixing even the approximate date and New York was full of soldiers I remember I jumped to the conclusion that Nita had succumbed to a war romance but I don t think she said anything to confirm my suspicion When did she tell you of her marriage that is when in relation to the date of the wedding itself Dundee asked The very day she was married Serena Hart answered She was late for the matinee Our dressing tables were side by side and as she slipped out of her dress This dress Dundee asked and handed her the photograph of dead Nita in the royal blue velvet dress she had kept for twelve years Yes and Serena Hart shuddered And her hair was dressed like that too although she had been wearing it in long curls and had to take it down before she would go on for the opening number She whispered to me that she had been married that day that she was terribly happy very much in love and that her husband had asked her to dress her hair in the French roll a favorite hair dress with him Between numbers she whispered to me again telling me that her husband was so different such a lamb totally unlike any man she had met on Broadway poor child For she was a child still only twenty but she had been in the show business since she was a motherless fatherless little drifter of sixteen No she did not tell me how old he was where he came from his business or what he looked like and I did not inquire As the days passed weeks probably she became more and more silent and reserved though once or twice she protested she was still terribly happy Then came a day when she did not show up for the performance at all The next night she told me in just a few words that her husband had left her after a quarrel and had not returned It seems that she had innocently told him how she had vamped Benny Steinfeld the big revue producer you know into giving her a spot in his summer show and that her Mat had flown into a rage accusing her of having been untrue to him She never mentioned his desertion to me again but Yes Dundee prompted Well Serena Hart went on uncomfortably I m afraid I rather forgot poor Nita after Teasing Tilly closed for my next work was in stock in Des Moines After a year of stock I got my chance in a legitimate show on Broadway and one day I met her on the street Not having much to talk with her about I asked her if she and her husband were reconciled She said no that she had never seen him again Then in a burst of confidence she told me that she had hired a private detective out of her meager earnings to investigate him in his home town or rather the city he had told her he came from The detective had reported that no such person as Mat or Matthew Selim had ever lived there so far as he could find out I asked her if she was going to get a divorce and she said she was not that being already married was a protection against getting married in haste again After that I rather lost sight of Nita and practically forgot her our paths being so very divergent And you never saw her again Dundee asked very much disappointed Oh yes two or three times at openings or on the street but we never held any significant conversation Serena Hart answered reaching for her plain rather dowdy little hat Wait I was about to forget I had quite a shock in connection with Nita One afternoon let s see that was when I opened in Hullabaloo in which I made my first real success you know I bought The New York Evening Star which devotes considerable space to theatrical doings to see what sort of review the show had got and on the first page I saw a picture of Nita beneath a headline which said Famous Model Commits Suicide What Dundee exclaimed astounded Oh it wasn t Nita Leigh Serena Hart reassured him There was a correction the next day You see an artists model named Anita Lee spelled L e e instead of Le i g h had committed suicide and as the Star explained it the next day the similarity of both the first name and the last had caused the error in getting a photograph from the morgue to accompany the story There was a picture of Nita Leigh with Nita s statement that the report of my death has been exaggerated and a picture of the real Anita Lee When did the mistake occur Dundee asked in great excitement Let me think Serena Hart frowned Hullabaloo opened in yes about the first of May nineteen twenty two Just a little more than eight years ago Dundee reached for his own hat in a fever to be gone but to his surprise the actress stopped him a faint color in her pale cheeks Since you re from Hamilton and are investigating the murder you have undoubtedly met little Penelope Crain I know her very well It happens that she is private secretary to the district attorney under whom I work Why I saw her play the lead in the Easter show at Forsyte four or five years ago Miss Hart explained her face turned from the detective as she dusted it with powder and I was impressed with her talent In fact I advised her father who had come from Hamilton to witness the performance as proud parents are likely to do to let her go on the stage So you met Roger Crain Dundee paused to ask Oh yes A charming man with even more personality than his daughter the actress answered carelessly so carelessly that Dundee had a sudden hunch Have you seen mister Crain recently He deserted his family and fled Hamilton under rather unsavory circumstances What do you mean Miss Hart asked sharply Oh there was nothing actually criminal I suppose but he is believed to have withheld some securities which would have helped satisfy his creditors when bankruptcy was imminent Dundee explained Have you seen him since then January it was I believe January Miss Hart appeared to need time for reflection Oh yes He sent in his card on the first night of my show that opened in January It was a flop lasted only five weeks We chatted of the Forsyte girls who are now in Hamilton most of whom I went to school with or have met at the Easter plays Do you know where mister Crain is now Dundee asked I have a message for him from Penny if you should happen to see him again Why should I see him again Miss Hart shrugged And I haven t the least idea where he is living or what he is doing now Of course if he should come to see me backstage after Temptation opens What is the message from Penny That her mother wants him to come home Dundee answered And I am very sure Penny wants him back too The mother is one of the sweetest gentlest most tragic women I have ever met and you have seen Penny for yourself The disgrace has been very hard on them It would be splendid if Roger Crain would come back and redeem himself Half an hour later Bonnie Dundee in the file room of The New York Evening Star was in possession of the bound volume of that newspaper for the month of May nineteen twenty two On the front page of the issue of May three under the caption which Serena Hart had quoted so accurately was a picture of a young laughing Nita Leigh her curls bobbed short a rose between her gleaming teeth And in the issue of May four appeared two pictures side by side exotic straight haired slant eyed Anita Lee who had found life so insupportable that she had ended it and the same photograph of living vital Nita Leigh When he returned the files he asked the girl in charge Does this copyright line beneath this picture and he pointed to the photograph of Nita which had appeared erroneously mean that the picture was syndicated The girl bent her head to see Copyright by Metropolitan Picture Service she read aloud Yes that s what it means When The Evening Star was owned by mister Magnus he formed a separate company called the Metropolitan Picture Service which supplied papers all over the country with a daily picture service in mat form But the picture syndicate was discontinued about five years ago when the paper was sold to its present owners Are their files available Dundee asked If they are I don t know anything about it the girl told him and turned to another seeker after bound volumes of the paper It doesn t matter Dundee assured her and asked for a sheet of blank paper on which he quickly composed the following telegram addressed to Penny Crain PLEASE SEARCH FILES ALL THREE HAMILTON PAPERS WEEK OF MAY FOURTH TO ELEVENTH YEAR OF NINETEEN TWENTY TWO FOR STORY AND PICTURES ON SUICIDE ANITA LEE ARTISTS MODEL STOP SAY NOTHING TO ANYONE NOT EVEN SANDERSON IF HE IS THERE STOP WIRE RESULT In his hotel while impatiently awaiting an answer from Penny Dundee passed the time by scanning all the New York papers of Thursday and Friday on the chance of meeting with significant revelations concerning the private life of Dexter Sprague or Juanita Leigh Selim united by death in the press at least There was much space devoted to the theory involving the two New Yorkers with the murder of the racketeer and gambler Swallow tail Sammy Savelli but only two pieces of information held Dundee s interest The first was a reminder to the public that certain theatrical columns of Sunday February nine had carried the rumor of Dexter Sprague s engagement to Dolly Martin popular baby star of Altamont Pictures and that the same columns of Tuesday February eleven had carried Sprague s own denial of the engagement Dolly having nothing to say So that is why Nita tried to commit suicide on February nine and her attempted suicide with its tragic consequences for Lydia Carr is probably the reason Sprague gave up his movie star Dundee mused Did Nita let him persuade her to go into the blackmail business in order to hold his wandering mercenary affections Lord The men some women love The second bit of information which the papers supplied him was winnowed by Dundee himself from a news summary of Nita Leigh s last year of life as chorus girl specialty dancer double in pictures and director of the Easter play at Forsyte on the Hudson If Nita got a divorce or even a legal separation from her husband after her talk with Gladys Earle a year ago she got it in New York and so secretly that no New York paper has been able to dig it up Dundee concluded And yet she had promised to marry Ralph Hammond A bellboy with a telegram interrupted the startling new train of thought which that conclusion had started CHAPTER TWENTY SIX With a sharp exclamation of excitement and triumph Dundee read Penny s telegram HAMILTON EVENING SUN DATE OF MAY FIFTH NINETEEN TWENTY TWO PUBLISHED STORY OF SUICIDE ANITA LEE ARTISTS MODEL BUT PICTURE ACCOMPANYING WAS UNDOUBTEDLY NITA LEIGH SELIM S STOP NO CORRECTION FOLLOWED STOP WHAT DOES IT MEAN What does it mean Dundee repeated exultantly to himself It means my darling little Penny that anyone in Hamilton who had any interest in the matter believed Nita Leigh Selim was dead and thought the spelling of her name was wrong not the picture itself The question is who read that story and gazed on that picture with exquisite relief Two hours before he had dismissed as impossible or highly impractical his impulse to investigate the eleven year old scandal on Flora Hackett who was now Flora Miles as told him by Gladys Earle of the Forsyte School Even more difficult would it be to find out why Janet Raymond s mother had taken her abroad for a year Of course he had ruefully told himself Nita Leigh might have been lucky or unlucky enough to run across documentary proof of one of the scandals of which Gladys Earle had told her or had dared to blackmail her victim by dark hints as Miss Earle had unconsciously suggested to her But this new development could not be ignored A picture of Nita Leigh as a suicide had appeared eight years ago in a Hamilton paper and the paper had either remained unaware of the error or had thought it not worth the space for a correction Eight years ago Eight years ago in June three weddings had occurred in Hamilton The Dunlap the Miles the Drake wedding And within the last year and a half Judge Marshall after proposing season after season to the most popular debutante had married lovely little Karen Plummer Suddenly a sentence from Ralph Hammond s story of his engagement to Nita Leigh Selim popped up in Dundee s memory And once I got cold sick because I thought she might still be married but she said her husband had married again and I wasn t to ask questions or worry about him If Ralph Hammond had reported Nita accurately she had not said she was divorced She had merely said her husband was married again Why was Ralph to ask no questions Divorced wives were not usually so reticent Had Nita planned to commit the crime of bigamy If not when and where and how had she secured a divorce To Serena Hart years before she had denied any intention of getting a divorce for two reasons because she did not know where her husband was and because being married although husbandless was a protection against matrimonial temptations To Gladys Earle a year ago in April she had confided that she could not marry again because she was not divorced and because she did not know the whereabouts of her husband And so far as New York reporters had been able to find out Nita Leigh had done nothing to alter her status as a married woman during the past year Moreover if Nita had secured either a divorce or a legal separation her faithful and beloved maid Lydia Carr would certainly have known of it And Lydia had vehemently protested more than once to Bonnie Dundee that she knew nothing of Nita s husband although she had worked for the musical comedy dancer for five years Surely if Nita loving and trusting Lydia as she did had entered into negotiations of any kind with or concerning her husband during the last year her maid would have been the first to know of them And yet Suddenly Dundee jumped to his feet and began to pace the floor of his hotel bedroom He was remembering the belated confidence that John C Drake banker had made to him the morning before after the discovery of Dexter Sprague s murder He recalled Drake s reluctant statement almost word for word About that ten thousand dollars which Nita deposited with our bank Dundee When she made the first deposit of five thousand dollars on April twenty eight she explained it with an embarrassed laugh as back alimony an instalment of which she had succeeded in collecting from her former husband And naturally when she made the second deposit on May five I presumed the same explanation covered that sum too though I confess I was puzzled by the fact that both big deposits had been made in cash In cash Had Nita by any chance been telling a near truth Had she been blackmailing her own husband a husband who had dared marry again believing his deserted wife to be dead and justifying herself by calling it back alimony But wasn t it in reality no matter what coercion Nita had used in getting the money exactly that Back alimony And the price of her silence before the world and the wife who was not really a wife In a new light Bonnie Dundee studied the character of the woman who had been murdered possibly to make her silence eternal Lois Dunlap had liked even loved her The other women and girls of the crowd that exclusive self centered clique of Hamilton s most socially prominent women must have liked her fairly well and found her congenial in spite of their jealousy of her popularity with the men of the crowd or they would not have tolerated her regardless of Lois Dunlap s championship of her protegee Gladys Earle had found her the sweetest kindest most generous person I ever met Gladys Earle who envied and hated all girls who were more fortunate than she Serena Hart former member of New York s Junior League and still listed in the Social Register had found her the only congenial member of the chorus she had invaded as the first step toward stardom And Serena Hart had the reputation of being a woman of character and judgment a kind and wise and great woman Finally Ralph Hammond had loved Nita and wanted to marry her Was it possible that Nita Selim s only crime into which she had been led by her infatuation for Dexter Sprague had been to demand secretly financial compensation from a husband who had married and deserted her a husband who believing her dead had married again But who was the man whose picture to spin a new theory Nita had recognized as that of her husband among the male members of the cast of The Beggar s Opera when Lois Dunlap had proudly exhibited the stills of that amateur performance With excitement hammering at his pulses Dundee took the bunch of photographs which Lois Dunlap had willingly given him and studied the picture that contained the entire cast the picture which had first attracted Nita s attention And again despair overwhelmed him for every one of his possible male suspects was in that group But he could not keep his thoughts from racing on Men who stepped out of their class and went on parties with chorus girls frequently did so under assumed names he reflected Serena Hart was authority for the information that Nita s had been a sudden marriage Was it not entirely possible that the man who married Nita in nineteen eighteen had done so half drunk both on liquor and infatuation and that he had not troubled to explain to Nita his motives for having used an assumed name or to write in his real name on the application for a marriage license Had Nita s private detective journeyed out to Hamilton years ago in a fruitless attempt to locate Matthew Selim Bonnie Dundee lay awake for hours Friday night turning these and a hundred other questions over and over in his too active mind and slept at last only to awake Saturday with a plan of procedure which he was sensible enough to realize promised small chance of success And he was right Not in Manhattan or in any of the other boroughs of New York City did he find any record of a marriage license issued to Juanita Leigh and Matthew Selim Not only was it entirely probable that Juanita Leigh was a stage name and that Nita had married conscientiously under her real name but it was equally possible that the license had been secured in New Jersey or Connecticut When he gave up his quest at noon Saturday and returned to his hotel Dundee bought at the newsstand a paper whose headline convinced him that Sergeant Turner was at that moment even more discouraged than himself For the big type told the world JOE SAVELLI GETS BROTHER S SLAYER And smaller headlines informed the sensation loving public SWALLOW TAIL SAMMY SAVELLI S DEATH AVENGED BY BROTHER WHO SURRENDERS TO POLICE SLICK THOMPSON ALLEGED MEMBER OF SAMMY S GANG SHOT TO DEATH ON SIXTH AVENUE Still smaller head type acknowledged that Joe Savelli after giving himself up with a revolver in his hand had disclaimed any knowledge of or connection with the murders of Juanita Leigh Selim and Dexter Sprague Two hours later Dundee received a long telegram from District Attorney Sanderson INFORMED BY EVENING SUN SAVELLI ANGLE COMPLETE WASHOUT STOP HAVE YOU MADE ANY PROGRESS ALONG OTHER LINES STOP HAVE INFORMED REPORTERS YOU WORKING INDEPENDENTLY WITH STRONG CHANCE OF SOLVING BOTH CASES STOP WOULD LIKE YOU HERE FOR ADJOURNED INQUESTS ON BOTH MURDERS MONDAY STOP MOTHER IMPROVED AM ON JOB AGAIN Since Dundee felt that there was little chance of following through either on the scandals which Gladys Earle had hinted at or on Nita s strangely secret marriage of twelve years before he immediately dispatched a wire to Sanderson assuring him that vital progress had been made and that he would leave New York on the four o clock train west arriving in Hamilton Sunday morning at eight fifty The concluding sentence of the wire was SUGGEST YOU PACIFY PRESS WITH ONLY VAGUEST OF HINTS Sanderson s wire with its confession of an interview on Dundee s trip to New York had upset him and left him with a cold sick feeling of fear that stumbling half in darkness the district attorney had unwittingly warned the murderer of Nita Selim and Dexter Sprague that his special investigator was on the right track But he consoled himself with the hope that the final sentence of his answering telegram would prevent any further damage But he was wrong An hour before he reached his destination on Sunday morning he went into the dining car and found a copy of The Hamilton Morning News beside his plate And on the front page was a photograph of dead Nita her black hair in a French roll her slim recumbent body clad in the royal blue velvet dress Beneath the picture was the caption What part does the outmoded royal blue velvet dress which Nita Selim chose as a shroud play in the solution of her murder That is the question which Special Investigator Dundee attached to the district attorney s office who is due home this morning from fruitful detective work in New York is undoubtedly prepared to answer Dundee was still seething with futile rage when he climbed the stairs to his apartment On the floor just inside his living room door he found an envelope unstamped and bearing his name in typing The note inside on paper as plain as the envelope was typed and unsigned If Detective Dundee will consult page four hundred ten of the latest WHO S WHO IN AMERICA he will find a tip which should aid him materially in solving the two murder cases which seem to be proving too difficult for his inexperience A wry grin at his anonymous correspondent s unfriendly gibe was just twisting his lips when a double knock sounded on the living room door which he had not completely closed Come in Belle A morose slack mouthed mulatto girl in ancient felt slippers sidled into the room Howdy Mistah Dundee Belle greeted him listlessly You got back lak de papers said you would didn yuh An I ain t sayin I ain t glad Dat parrot o yoahs sho is Gawd s own nuisance nippin at mah fingahs an screechin his fool head off Cose I ain t sayin it s his fault keepin dat young gemman on de secon flo awake las night But lak I say to Mistah Wilson when he lights into me dis mawnin runnin off at de mouf cause I fo got to put Cap n s covah on his cage las night I ain t de onliest one what fo gits in dis hyar house Comin home Gawd knows when leavin de front do unlocked de res o de night so s bugglers and murderers and Gawd knows who could walk right in hyar Dundee itching to consult his own copy of Who s Who flung a glance at the parrot s cage intending to pacify the mournful mulatto by scolding his Watson roundly But he changed his mind and consoled the chambermaid instead Just tell mister Wilson that for once he s wrong You did not forget to cover Cap n s cage Belle Look The girl s dull eyes bulged as they took in the cage completely swathed in a square of black silk Gawd s sake Mistah Dundee she ejaculated I didn t put dat covah on dat bird s cage An neithah did Mis Bowen cause she been laid up with rheumatiz eveh since you lef an eveh las endurin thing in dis ol house has been lef fo me to do Then I suppose the indignant mister Wilson came up and covered Cap n himself Dundee suggested crossing the room to the bookcase which stood within reaching distance of his big leather covered armchair Him Belle snorted How he gonna get in hyer widout no key Sides he d a tol me if n Belle how many times must I ask you not to misplace my things Dundee cut in irritably for he was tired of the discussion and angry that his copy of Who s Who was missing from its customary place in the bookcase Me I ain t teched none o yoah things cep n to dus em and lay em down whar I foun em Belle retorted mournfulness submerged in anger Dundee looked about the room then his eyes alighted upon the missing book lying upon a shelf that extended across the top of an old fashioned hot air register set high in the wall between the two windows The thick red volume lay close against the wall its gold lettered rib facing the room Belle tell me the truth and I shall not be angry did you put that red book on that shelf Dundee asked his voice steady and kindly in spite of his excitement Nossuh I ain t teched it And you did not put the cover over my parrot s cage although I had tipped you well to feed Cap n and cover him at night Dundee said severely I gotta heap o wuk to do And you say that mister Wilson one of the two young men on the second floor left the front door unlocked when he came in last night Dundee asked Does he admit it Yassuh Belle told him sulkily He say he was tiahed when he got home long bout midnight an he clean fo got to turn de key in de do an shoot de bolt Thanks Belle That will be all now and Dundee did a great deal to dispel the chambermaid s gloom by presenting her with a dollar bill When she had gone the detective read the note again then looked at it and its envelope more closely They had a strangely familiar look Suddenly he jerked open a drawer of his desk on which his new noiseless typewriter stood selected a sheet of plain white bond and rolled it into the machine Quickly he tapped out a copy of the strange taunting message Yes The left hand margin was identical the typing and its degree of blackness were identical and the paper on which he had made the copy was exactly the same as that on which the original had been written The truth flashed into his mind It was no coincidence that he had a copy of the very book to which his unknown correspondent referred him For the note had been written in this very room on stationery conveniently at hand on the noiseless typewriter which had been far more considerate about not betraying the intruder than had the parrot whose slumbers had been disturbed But why did my unknown friend risk arrest as a burglar if he wanted to give me an honest tip Dundee remarked aloud to the parrot who croaked an irrelevant answer Bad Penny Bad Penny I m afraid my dear Watson that those words will not be so helpful in this case as they were when your mistress was murdered Dundee assured his parrot absently for he was studying the peculiar situation from every angle Another question Cap n why did the unknown bother to take my Who s Who out of the bookcase where I should normally have looked for it and put it on that particular shelf Warily for his scalp was prickling with a premonition of danger Dundee crossed the room to the shelf but his hand did not reach out for the red book which might have been expected to solve one problem at least Why the shelf he asked himself again Why not the desk top or the mantelpiece or the smoking table beside the big armchair The shelf with its drapery of rather fine old silk tapestry offered no answer in itself for it held nothing except the red book a Chinese bowl and a humidor of tobacco And beneath the shelf was nothing but the old fashioned register the opening covered with a screwed on metal screen which was a mass of big holes to permit the escape of hot air when the furnace was going in the winter Suddenly Dundee stooped and stared with eyes that were widened with excitement and a certain amount of horror Then he rose and standing far to one side picked up the fat volume which lay on the shelf As he had expected a bullet whizzed noiselessly across the room and buried itself in the plaster of the wall opposite a bullet which would have ploughed through his own heart if he had obeyed his first impulse and gone directly to the shelf to obey the instructions in the note But more had happened than the whizzing flight of a bullet through one of the holes of the hot air register The Who s Who had been jerked almost out of Dundee s hand before he had lifted the heavy volume many inches from the shelf Coincidental with the disappearance of a bit of white string which had been pinned to a thin page of the book was a metallic clatter followed swiftly by the faint sound of a bump far below Dropping Who s Who to the floor Dundee flung open his living room door and raced down three flights of stairs He brought up panting at the door of the basement It was not locked and in another minute he was standing before the big hot air furnace Above the fire box was a big metal compartment the reservoir for the heated air And set into the reservoir to conduct the heat to the regions above were three huge pipes With strength augmented by excitement Dundee tugged and tore at one of the pipes until he had dislodged it Then thrusting his hand into the heat reservoir he groped until he had found what he had known must be there Judge Marshall s automatic with the Maxim silencer screwed upon the end of its short nose At last he held in his hands the weapon with which Nita Leigh Selim and Dexter Sprague had been murdered The ingeniousness of his own attempted murder moved him to such profound admiration that he could scarcely feel resentment If in the excitement of hunting for a promised clue he had gone directly to the shelf standing in front of the hole in the register into which the end of the silencer had been jammed so that it showed scarcely at all even to eyes looking for it he would now have been dead And the gun and silencer after hurtling down the big hot air pipe behind the register could have lain hidden for months even years in the heat reservoir of the furnace With the weapon carefully wrapped in his handkerchief Dundee went up the stairs almost as swiftly as he had gone down them meeting no one on the way to his rooms on the top floor My most heartfelt thanks to you Cap n he greeted his parrot If you had not squawked last night and so frightened the murderer that he made the vital error of covering your cage I should never have annoyed you again with my Sherlock ruminations on cases which do not interest you in the slightest The parrot cackled hoarsely but Dundee paid him scant attention He picked up the now harmless Who s Who and turned to page four hundred ten a corner of which had disappeared with the string that was still fastened to the hair trigger hammer of the Colt s thirty two Very clever and very simple The murderer of two people and the would be murderer of a third had had only to unscrew the metal covering of the register wedge the end of the silencer into one of the many holes replace the screws and paste the end of the string drawn through another hole hidden by the tapestry to a page of the book he had selected as the one most likely to appeal to a detective as a clue source No wait He had had to do more Dundee bent and examined the metal cover of the register The circumference of the hole the murderer had chosen as the one which would be directly in front of Dundee s heart gleamed brightly It had been necessary to enlarge it considerably The murderer had left a trace after all But the book was open in Dundee s hands and his eyes rapidly scanned page four hundred ten And he found what the murderer had not expected him to live to read but which he had counted on as an explanation of the note which the police would have puzzled over if all had gone well with his scheme CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN Dundee laughed the parrot which had saved his life echoing his mirth raucously as his eyes hit upon the following lines of fine print halfway down the third column of page four hundred ten of Who s Who in America BURNS William John detective b Baltimore Oct nineteen eighteen sixty one A taunt and a joke which turned sour my dear Watson he exulted to the parrot A joke I was not intended to live to laugh over He closed the book and replaced it in the bookcase careless of fingerprints for he was sure the murderer had been too clever to leave any behind him in that room or upon the gun and silencer either for that matter Interestedly Dundee surveyed the scene of his attempted murder If he had unsuspectingly gone up to the high shelf to reach for the book he would have stood so close to the register that there would have been powder burns on his shirt front just as there had been on Dexter Sprague s And he would have been shot so near an open window no chance for fingerprints there either since he had not closed the windows on his departure for New York not wishing to return to a stuffy apartment that the police would have been justified in thinking he had been shot from outside It was an old fashioned house in more ways than in the manner of its heating Outside of one of his two unscreened windows there was an iron grating the topmost landing of a fire escape Dundee could imagine Captain Strawn s positiveness in placing the murderer there crouching in wait for his victim Yes damned ingenious this attempted murder Undoubtedly Strawn would have dismissed the note as the work of a crank not hitting upon the fact that it had been written in that very room on Dundee s own typewriter and stationery Strawn might even have got a mournful sort of amusement out of the fact that Dundee had been advised to call upon a greater detective than himself for assistance Yes ingenious indeed And so amazingly simple Suddenly the young detective snatched for his hat If the murderer was so ingenious in this case might he not have been equally clever in planning and executing the murder of Nita Leigh Selim Twenty minutes later he parked his car in the rutty road before the Selim house in Primrose Meadows and honked his horn loudly to attract the attention of the plainclothesmen Captain Strawn had detailed immediately after the murder to guard the premises during the day There was no answer And a violent ringing of the doorbell also brought no response The guard had been withdrawn probably to join the small army of plainclothesmen and patrolmen who had been foolishly and futilely searching for the New York gunman the keystone of Captain Strawn s exploded theory With an oath Dundee used his skeleton key to release the Yale lock with which the front door was equipped Straight down the main hall he went and into the little foyer between the hall and Nita s bedroom He snatched up the telephone and to his relief it was not dead He gave the number of Captain Strawn s home and had the pleasure of learning that he had interrupted his former chief at a late Sunday breakfast When did you withdraw the guard from the Selim house he asked abruptly cutting short Strawn s cordial welcome home Late Thursday afternoon the Chief of the Homicide Squad answered belligerently I needed all my men and the Selim house had been gone over with a fine tooth comb half a dozen times Why Oh nothing Dundee retorted wearily and hung up the receiver after assuring his old friend that he would call on him later in the day No use to explain now to Strawn that the murderer had been given every chance to remove any betraying traces of his crime Besides his first excited hunch after his own attempted murder might very well be a wild groundless one In his Dundee s case the impossibility of the murder s being delayed or arranged so that the detective might be slain when the whole crowd was assembled was obvious The murderer had read in a late Saturday afternoon extra a copy of which was now in Dundee s pocket District Attorney Sanderson s boast to the press that his office had been working on an entirely different theory than that which connected the two murders with Swallow tail Sammy that Special Investigator Dundee expected back in Hamilton early Sunday morning had been investigating Nita Leigh s past life in New York And despite Dundee s telegraphed warning he had hinted sensational revelations connected with the twelve year old royal blue velvet dress which Nita had chosen to be her shroud And in his desire to reassure the public through the press Sanderson had mysteriously promised even more specific revelations than Dundee had actually brought home with him Prodded by reporters Sanderson had admitted that he did not himself know the nature of those revelations The exasperated young detective could picture the murderer reading those sensational hints and promises could imagine his panic the need for immediate action so that Special Investigator Dundee should not live to tell the tale of his New York discoveries to the district attorney or anyone else But whether he was right or wrong Dundee determined to give his hunch a chance He went into the over ornate bedroom in which Nita Leigh Selim had been murdered shot through the back as she sat at her dressing table powdering her face If her murder had been accomplished by mechanical means how had it been done There was no hot air register here From the dressing table Dundee walked to the window upon whose pale green frame there was still the tiny pencil mark which doctor Price had drawn to indicate the end of the path along which the bullet had traveled provided it had traveled so far Nothing here to aid in a mechanical murder But in a flash Dundee changed his mind For just slightly above the pencil mark there was a small dent in the soft painted pine of the window frame And before his mind could frame words and sentences he thought he saw how Nita Leigh had been murdered Nothing here Not now because he himself had taken the lamp to the courthouse for safe keeping He saw it clearly in imagination that bronze floor lamp which Lydia Carr had given to Nita Leigh its big round bowl studded with great jewels of colored glass And in recalling every detail of the lamp he saw what he had dismissed as of no importance at the time in the excitement of finding that the lamp s bulb had been shattered by the bang or bump which Flora Miles had described One of the big glass jewels had been missing leaving an unsightly hole No wonder there had been a bang or bump hard enough to dent the frame of the window For if his hunch was correct the gun wedged into the big bowl with the silencer slightly protruding from the jewel hole had kicked just as it had kicked an hour before when it had dislodged itself from the hole in the hot air register and clattered down the big pipe to the heat reservoir of the furnace That the big lamp when he following Strawn had first examined the scene of Nita s murder had not stood in front of the window frame did not dampen Dundee s excitement in the least After Karen Marshall s scream that room had been filled with excited people who had rushed about looking out of the window for the murderer and doing all the other things which terror stricken people do in such a crisis No the murderer or murderess had found no difficulty in shifting the big lamp one foot nearer the chaise longue to the place it had always occupied before But how had the gun been fired from the lamp Electrically Another picture flashed into Dundee s mind He saw himself stooping on Monday afternoon to see if the plug of the lamp s cord had been pulled from the socket saw it again as it was then nearly out so that no current could pass from the baseboard outlet under the bookcase into the bronze lamp How far from the truth his conclusion that Monday had been But what was the real truth Suddenly Dundee flung back the moss green Wilton rug which almost entirely covered the bedroom floor and revealed the bell which Dexter Sprague had rigged up so that Nita might summon Lydia from her basement room in case of dire need a precaution with which the murderer was probably familiar since Lois Dunlap might innocently have spread the news of its existence There was a half inch hole in the hardwood floor and out of it issued a length of green electric cord connected with two small flat metal plates one upon the other so that when stepped upon a bell would ring in Lydia s basement room But there was something odd about the wire Although it was obviously new a section of it near the two metal plates was wrapped with black adhesive tape Another memory knocked for attention upon Dundee s mind The long cord of the bronze lamp had been mended with exactly the same sort of tape about a foot from where it ended in the contact plug Within another two minutes Dundee with a flashlight he had found in the kitchen was exploring the dark earthy portion of the basement which lay directly to the east of Lydia Carr s basement room And he found what he was looking for adhesive tape wrapped about the wire which had been dropped through the floor of Nita s room before it had been carried by means of another hole into Lydia s room 
1845_145088_000029_000000	train-clean-360	He was too late thanks to Captain Strawn 
none	none	The bell which Sprague had rigged up was in working order again But as he was passing out of the basement he glanced at the ceiling of the large room devoted to furnace hot water heater and laundry tubs And in the ceiling he saw a hole The murderer had left a trace he could not obliterate At three o clock that Sunday afternoon Bonnie Dundee fatigued after a strenuous day and suffering to his own somewhat disgusted amusement from reaction even a detective feels some shock at having narrowly escaped death permitted himself the luxury of a call upon Penny Crain He found the girl and her mother playing anagrams After greeting him missus Crain rose to surrender her place to the visitor You play with this girl of mine mister Dundee She s too clever for me She s beaten me every game so far and when I plead for two handed bridge as a chance to get even she shudders at the very word Why did you drag poor Ralph away from his dinner here today Penny demanded scrambling the little wooden blocks until they made a weird pattern of letters Because I wanted to find out exactly how Nita Selim was killed and I did Dundee answered I wish I knew as well who murdered her Mute before Penny s excited questions the detective idly selected letters from the mass of face up blocks on the table and spelled out in a long row the names of all the guests at Nita s fatal bridge party Suddenly and with a cry that startled Penny Dundee made a new name with the little wooden letters Now he knew the answers to both How and Who CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT I fail to see any necessity for all this secrecy and hocus pocus District Attorney Sanderson protested irritably Why the devil don t you come clean and give us the low down if you have it on this miserable business instead of high handedly summoning Captain Strawn to my office so that you can give orders to us both Before Dundee could answer Captain Strawn came to his assistance I worked with this boy for pretty near a year Bill and never yet did he fail to make good when he said he had a pot on to boil If he says it will boil over this evening provided we help him boil over it will or I don t know Bonnie Dundee Sanderson scowled but capitulated All right What do you want Thanks chief And thanks Captain Dundee cried with heartfelt gratitude First I want to be excused from attending the adjourned inquests into the two murders scheduled for three o clock today O K Sanderson agreed shortly Second after about an hour of routine stuff I wish you d ask for another adjournment until tomorrow on the plea that important developments are expected today O K again Third I d like you personally to request the appearance of every person connected in any way with each of the murders in your office this afternoon at four o clock so the whole bunch will be kept together and have no chance to go to their homes or anywhere else until I am ready for them You can say that owing to the illness of your mother during the investigations you want to question everyone personally Do you want all the servants brought here too Sanderson asked None but Lydia Carr Dundee answered After about an hour s innocuous questioning please invite them to accompany you to the Selim house For that and he grinned is where the pot is scheduled to boil over I d like everybody to be there by five fifteen Where do I come in Captain Strawn demanded almost jealously Now that you are no longer looking for a New York gunman I suppose you have plenty of plainclothesmen at your disposal Dundee asked and was instantly sorry he had reminded his former chief of the collapse of his cherished and satisfying theory Plenty Strawn answered gruffly How many will you need Enough to keep every person on mister Sanderson s invitation list under strictest observation until the pot boils over Dundee replied When do you want them to get on the job As soon as they can do so after you get back to your office Are they to follow the whole gang clear out to the Selim house Most decidedly After the unwilling guests are safely within the house your boys must guard the premises so that no one leaves without permission That s all as good as done Strawn assured him Now about them inquiries you asked me to make yesterday of the secretary of the American Legion He drew a scrap of paper from his breast pocket I find that John Drake Peter Dunlap and Clive Hammond were all in service in the th Division which was held up late in January nineteen eighteen for nearly two weeks in Hoboken before the War Department could get transports to send em to France Miles who enlisted the day war was declared was wounded and shipped home late in nineteen seventeen He was discharged as unfit for further service spinal operation from a New Jersey base hospital on January twelve nineteen eighteen Furthermore Judge Marshall was in New York the whole winter of nineteen seventeen eighteen attached to the Red Cross in some legal capacity He donated his services and All that doesn t matter now Captain but thanks just the same Dundee interrupted Now if you will both excuse me I ve got a lot of work to do before five o clock today Dundee had not exaggerated That Monday was one of the busiest days he had ever spent in all the twenty seven years of his life He began rather strangely by visiting half a dozen of Hamilton s hardware stores exhibiting a peculiar instrument and making annoying inquiries as to when and to whom it had been sold But at his sixth port of call success so completely rewarded his efforts that he was jubilant when he bade the mystified proprietor good day a signed statement reposing in his wallet Two other calls both in office buildings took up only an hour of his time and a taxicab delivered him at Police Headquarters just as the factory whistles were sirening the news that it was twelve o clock He was lucky enough to find the fingerprint expert Carraway in his cubbyhole of an office his desk almost crowded out by immense filing cabinets Five minutes later Dundee sat at that desk photographs of Dexter Sprague s dead body just as it had been discovered on the floor of the trophy room in the Miles home and a labelled set of fingerprints spread out before him You re sure there can have been no mistake he asked No chance that these fingerprint photographs were reversed when the prints were made Not a chance with my system Carraway retorted positively Fine Dundee cried May I take these photographs You have copies I presume It was half past two o clock when Dundee after a much needed lunch parked his car in the driveway of one of the most splendid houses overlooking Mirror Lake a home whose master and mistress were now attending an inquest into two murders Half an hour later he climbed into his roadster again his head spinning Did I say ingenious he marvelled He drove directly to the Selim house for he had much to do before the arrival of Sanderson s compulsory guests at five fifteen His first visit there was to a small room in the basement a dark cubbyhole next to the coal room He had locked it carefully after exploring it the day before for he had taken no chance on leaving unguarded as he had found it treasure worth more to him than its weight in gold And queer treasure it was that he extracted now a coiled length of electric wire which he and Ralph Hammond had measured the day before with triumphant excitement a box of thumb tacks many of them surprisingly bent at the point an augur with a set of bits of varying sizes a step ladder and a hammer If Dexter Sprague had not overestimated the amount of electric wire needed for the job of installing an alarm bell between Nita s bedroom and Lydia s Dundee was about to close the tool chest when his eyes fell upon a piece of hardware he had not expected ever to find although he had known of its existence for more than an hour At five fifteen he was entirely ready for D A Sanderson Captain Strawn and their party of indignant and unwilling guests Oh mister Dundee Carolyn Drake squealed You re not going to make us play that awful death hand again are you They were all crowding about him the men and women who had been Nita Selim s guests at her last bridge and cocktail party Not only are the bridge tables exactly where they were at this time on the evening of May twenty four Dundee answered so significantly that all stopped chattering to listen but everything else in the house is precisely as it was then Fortunately not even the electricity has been cut off But to make sure I have forgotten nothing I wish you would all follow me into missus Selim s bedroom and look for yourselves Like sheep they crowded into the little foyer and on into the bedroom There stood the big bronze lamp set squarely in front of the window frame and in a direct line with the musical powder box on dead Nita s dressing table At five twenty five Penny Crain Karen Marshall Carolyn Drake and Flora Miles who had been requisitioned by Dundee to play the part of the murdered woman were seated at table No two and behind Karen s chair stood Lois Dunlap Clive Hammond and his new wife were again together in the solarium But there Dundee s restaging of the original scene in the tragic drama ended Everyone else including Lydia Carr and Peter Dunlap were huddled together in a far corner of the living room Now mister Miles Dundee called Your cue Never mind the comedy about How s tricks Simply go into the dining room with missus Dunlap to mix cocktails You ll find all the ingredients still on the sideboard exactly as there were when missus Selim sent you to mix drinks on May twenty four And missus Miles will you pretending that you are Nita Selim go to powder your face at missus Selim s dressing table Her face white and drawn Flora Miles stumbled from the room just as her husband dumb for once with rage entered the dining room with Lois Dunlap Dundee was about to follow the latter two when an interruption occurred Followed by a plainclothesman a middle aged man entered the living room Tall broad shouldered determined he strode to the bridge table his handsome head upflung his brown eyes fixed upon the widened brown eyes of Penny Crain Dad the girl breathed then joyously Oh Dad You ve come home But Dundee halted the reconciliation with a stern word of command Please join the group in the corner mister Crain Regardless of the ensuing hubbub Dundee strode into the dining room where Tracey Miles stood at the sideboard pouring whiskey from an almost empty decanter into a small glass May I drink the Scotch Tracey has poured for me mister Dundee missus Dunlap asked shakily leaning against the big round table Yes but Silence please he cried as there came the first faint tinkling notes of Juanita from Nita s musical powder box penetrating the thin wall between the bedroom and dining room As I have said the detective spoke loudly and clearly above the tinkle of music everything is now exactly as it was when Nita Selim was murdered Permit me to show you all how that murder was accomplished A chair at the bridge table was overturned Lois Dunlap almost choked on her drink of Scotch Women screamed In a few seconds every person in the living room including the district attorney and Strawn was huddled in the wide opening into the dining room their eyes fixed in horror upon Bonnie Dundee He spoke again his voice very clear but slow and weighted with a dreadful significance missus Dunlap step on the bell beneath the dining table Lois Dunlap dropped the empty whiskey glass her face suddenly wiped of all expression Step on that bell missus Dunlap just as you did before As if hypnotized Lois Dunlap began to grope with the toe of her right pump for the slight bulge under the rug which indicated the position of the bell used for summoning the maid from the kitchen With a strangled cry Tracey Miles lunged across the few feet which separated the woman and himself seized her arm and whirled her violently away from the table Do you want to kill my wife too he panted his usually florid face the color of putty You you CHAPTER TWENTY NINE That would be impossible Miles Dundee said deliberately For your wife is already dead Then his clear words rang out like the knell of doom Tracey Arthur Miles I arrest you for the murder of your wife known as Juanita Leigh Selim and for the murder of Dexter Sprague And it is my duty to warn you that anything you say may be used against you Tracey Miles lifted his ashen face and stared at the detective blankly as though he had gone deaf and blind All over isn t it May I have a drink he managed to articulate at last Poor devil He needs it the too soft hearted young detective told himself as Miles poured a drink from the almost empty whiskey decanter and raised the little glass to his lips I have nothing to say the murderer gasped thickly then fell heavily to the floor It was three quarters of an hour later District Attorney Sanderson Captain Strawn and Dundee were alone in the house where Nita Selim had been murdered and where her husband had confessed his crimes by committing suicide The morgue ambulance had come and gone I should have known Dundee admitted ruefully as the three men entered Nita s bedroom that so ingenious a criminal as Tracey Miles would not have failed to provide against the possibility of discovery He must have seized an opportunity to spill cyanide of potassium into the decanter when my eyes were off him for a moment and upon Lois Dunlap I m glad he did Sanderson said curtly But it was ghastly that poor Lois had to know that it was she in all innocence who fired the shot that killed her friend It was Dundee sighed But I believed that the only way I could make Miles confess was to frighten him into thinking Flora would be killed in the same manner Well it worked Captain Strawn and I are still in the dark as to exactly how Miles managed his wife s murder Sanderson reminded him This morning you chose to tell us nothing more than that a Hamilton man had married Nita Leigh in New York in January nineteen eighteen and that eight years ago when he saw her picture in The Hamilton Evening Sun along with the story that Anita Lee had committed suicide he felt free to marry again You said then you knew who the man was but you would not even tell us how you knew Because I had very little actual proof then Dundee answered As to who he was the salient clue had been staring me in the face the whole time but it was not until I was fooling with a set of anagrams last night idly spelling out the names of all the men who might have married her and then murdered her that I saw it Saw what Strawn demanded irritably That Selim is simply Miles spelled backwards Dundee explained Possibly because he considered it the sophisticated thing to do Miles used an assumed name at the party at which he met Nita Leigh and married her under that name shortly afterward Even the first name Mat by which she knew him was only his initials reversed Simple but clever Sanderson commented Just as were all of Miles schemes after Nita egged on by Sprague turned up in Hamilton to demand back alimony as the price of her silence But let me show you how he killed his wife He strode to the big bronze lamp It took me less than an hour today to reconstruct the death machine so that it would be almost exactly as it was when Miles finished his work just before two thirty on Saturday May twenty four and as it remained until he had an opportunity to come back here and dismantle it Trust him to find out that the guard was removed from the house Thursday As he spoke he was unscrewing the big jewel studded bowl of the bronze lamp Wedged at a down slanting angle inside the bowl which was twelve inches in diameter was Judge Marshall s snub nosed automatic the attached Maxim silencer projecting slightly from the hole whose jewel was missing Lydia told me last night over the telephone and very much surprised she was too when I swore her to secrecy that the jewel had been lost when the lamp was shipped from New York Dundee explained There s a blank cartridge in the gun now of course but Miles in his panic took my words literally See the electro magnet strapped to the gun butt He got it from the bell Sprague had installed in Lydia s bedroom and he returned it when he was cleaning up so that the bell would ring again The magnet he connected with the electric wire in one of the two lamp sockets as you see it now and the long cord of the lamp was connected with the wire of the bell in the dining room so connected that when anyone stepped on the two little metal plates under the dining room rug the kitchen bell would ring and the gun would be fired simultaneously But if you will examine the jewel hole he suggested you will see that Miles had to enlarge it considerably using a reamer which I found in the tool chest in the basement along with all the apparatus Sprague had bought for installing Nita s alarm bell I could see no reason for Sprague s having needed a reamer for his little job however and this morning I was lucky enough to get proof that Miles himself had purchased it at a hardware store on the Tuesday before Nita s murder How did he connect the lamp cord with the dining room bell Strawn puzzled These modern houses don t have exposed wiring You forget Sprague s wiring for the alarm bell from here to Lydia s room and Dundee threw back the rug showing them the hole in the floor out of which came a short length of electric wire ending in two small metal plates But attached now to the wire was the cord from the bronze lamp The plug of the lamp cord is nearly out of the baseboard outlet behind the bookcase just as Miles left it so that there is no contact with electricity there And the rug which almost entirely covers the floor hides as you have seen the joining of the two wires An inexplicable wrapping of adhesive tape both on the lamp cord and on the wire of Nita s alarm bell here gave me the clue In installing the alarm bell Sprague copied the arrangement under the dining table of course And Miles simply had to drop a bit fastened to the augur Sprague had bought and used for his own job down the four inches which separate the dining room floor from the basement ceiling boring a hole through the ceiling It was that fresh bored hole in the ceiling that I could not understand and which Ralph Hammond assured me was not there Saturday morning before Nita was killed Miles joined a piece of electric wire to the dining room bell wires and pushed it down through the hole he had bored into the basement ceiling Now if you ll come down with me When the three men stood staring upward at the basement ceiling Dundee continued See this long wire running along the ceiling from the hole beneath the dining room bell The tacks Miles used to secure it were also returned to the tool chest but he could not get rid of either the augur hole or the tiny holes showing the course of the wire Let s follow it He led them across the basement to a door leading into a dank unfinished portion of the cellar directly east of Lydia s bedroom and beneath Nita s The wire whose course they were following led under the top frame of the door and with a flashlight in his hand Dundee showed how it continued along a rafter until it reached the place where it was joined by adhesive tape to the wire Sprague had dropped from Nita s bedroom floor above Miles simply cut the wire here where it enters another hole through Lydia s bedroom wall and attached the new wire Dundee explained The connection between the dining room bell and the electro magnet in the lamp upstairs was then complete Sprague had bought yards too much of the wire fortunately for Miles scheme But what a chance Miles took on the bullet s not hitting her in a fatal spot Sanderson commented in an awed voice Not much of a chance Dundee denied He would fire the gun only when he knew Nita was seated before her dressing table Experienced marksman that he was he could calculate the path of the bullet to a nicety Of course the machine had to be used that very day As you know Nita herself gave him his chance Miles standing at the sideboard which was separated from Nita s dressing table only by a thin wall listened until the first faint notes of Juanita told him that Nita was powdering her face He could be almost positive that Nita was sitting down to her task The poor girl saw nothing to alarm her but the gun kicked when the shot was fired by Lois innocent stepping upon the dining room bell and the big lamp was rocked so that it banged against the window frame shattering the one bulb Miles had left in it Of course he moved the lamp a foot or so in the resulting excitement And if Nita had been wounded only living to tell how the shot was fired Miles would have committed suicide then and there What if Nita had not asked him to mix cocktails or had not gone to powder her face Strawn asked The whole party was going to dine and dance at the Country Club Miles would have escorted her home as he had done on Monday night when Nita had probably made her last demand He could have counted on Nita s going into her bedroom to powder her face even if he had had to tell her that her nose was shiny and would himself then have gone to the dining room on the excuse that he needed a drink before discussing business But I must tell you that on Saturday morning according to the telephone operator in Miles office into whom I put the fear of the Lord and the law when I interviewed her this morning Nita rang Miles to say she must see him as soon as possible her unexpressed intention being to tell him that she was not going to make him come across again Miles the telephone operator confessed to having listened in on the Whole conversation told her he would be right out but Nita said she and Lydia were going into Hamilton and would not be back until two thirty the time the bridge game was scheduled to begin That was the opportunity Miles had been praying for and he came on out having previously stolen the gun and silencer and having studied this house How had he got in Sanderson wanted to know Judge Marshall had lent him a key in February when Miles wanted to show the house to an engaged young man in his offices and Miles had neglected to return it Well when he arrived he found Ralph Hammond here and had to leave waiting at a safe distance probably until the coast was clear about one o clock Even so he had more than an hour to do his carefully planned job Nita had to die Miles could not continue to pay her large sums of money since he was really only an employe of Flora s Everything he held dear in the world was threatened He loved Flora he adored his children and he could not give up the luxury and social position which his bigamous marriage with Flora Why didn t he make a clean breast of the whole mess to Flora since he had not married her until he believed Nita Leigh was dead Sanderson interrupted You must remember that Flora was carrying on a violent flirtation with Sprague vamping him to get the lead in the Hamilton movie if Sprague got the job of directing it Dundee reminded him Miles victim of a deep rooted sexual inferiority complex must have felt sure that Flora on discovering she was not legally married would snatch at the chance to marry Sprague which was of course what Sprague had planned in case Nita published the truth But you were wrong about the secret shelf The gun was never there Strawn gloated No But it was the absence of fingerprints on the pivoting panel and shelf which kept me on the right track Miles had searched the shelf for the marriage certificate which he could not know Nita had already burned Probably too he had written her a few letters during their short courtship How was Sprague killed Sanderson interrupted impatiently Dundee led the way across the basement to a cubbyhole next to the coal room entered and came out with a narrow deep drawer of ebony inlaid with mother of pearl First I must tell you that Miles got the gun out of the lamp that Saturday night parking his car at a distance and sneaking into the house while I was talking with Lydia in the basement We can guess that he stowed gun silencer and electro magnet in a pocket of his car At any rate he came back noisily enough a little later to offer Lydia a job as nurse in his home Doubtless he assured himself that she knew nothing or poor Lydia would have gone the way of her mistress and Sprague Was Sprague Strawn began Despite my warning Dundee went on refusing to be hurried Sprague made a demand for blackmail money upon Miles It is possible that Sprague also sneaking into the house that Saturday night to get his bag saw Miles retrieve the gun At any rate Sprague knew that Miles was the only person among all the company who had a real motive for killing Nita Selim and he undoubtedly blackmailed Miles as a murderer as well as a bigamist Perhaps Miles put him off for a day or two but on Wednesday Judge Marshall begged for a bridge game and Miles seized the opportunity of again having the original crowd present a sort of wall of integrity surrounding and including him For I don t think he really wanted to involve his best friends as suspects I believe he merely wanted to hide among them apparently as above suspicion as they were And there is safety in numbers you know At any rate Miles made an appointment Wednesday afternoon with Sprague telling him that if he would come to his home that evening and manage to leave the bridge game while he was dummy he would find the money he was demanding in a drawer of the cabinet that stood between the two windows in the trophy room Dundee exhibited the drawer he had taken from the basement tool room This drawer I took it away from the Miles home this afternoon while everyone but a chambermaid was at the inquest Miles did not have time to go home before going to your office mister Sanderson with the rest of the crowd you had summoned for questioning If he had he would have killed himself as soon as he found the incriminating drawer was missing from the cabinet But how Sanderson began frowning with bewilderment Very simple Dundee answered When Sprague pulled open this drawer which was set in the cabinet at just the height of his stomach he received a bullet in his heart See these four little holes A vise was screwed into the bottom of the drawer so that it gripped the gun with its silencer at an upward angle A piece of string was tied to the trigger and fastened somehow to the underside of the drawer so that when Sprague pulled the drawer open the string was drawn taut and the trigger pulled Practically the same mechanism by which he tried to murder me The kick of the gun jerked the drawer shut All Miles had to do when he was pretending to look for Sprague was to turn off the trophy room light by a button one of a series on the outside wall of the hall closet Probably it had been agreed between them that Sprague would not return to the bridge game hence Sprague s telephoning for a taxi to wait for him at the foot of the hill and his taking his hat and stick into the trophy room with him Then Miles had from midnight till dawn to remove the gun Yes Some time during the night after Flora was asleep with a sedative which she badly needed because of the quarrel a genuine one which she and Tracey had had over Sprague Miles slipped down to the trophy room and removed the gun and vise But he could not remove the holes the screws had made although he did cover the bottom of the usually empty drawer with old pamphlets on the care and feeding of dogs By the way the chambermaid told me that her master spent about half an hour before dinner that Thursday night in the trophy room going over his fishing tackle His next concern was to make the murder jibe completely with Captain Strawn s theory of a gunman who had trailed his quarry to the Miles home and shot him through the window The window was already open but the screen had to be raised too and Sprague s fingerprints had to be on the nickel catches by which the screen curtain is raised or lowered Of course Sprague had not touched the screen Do you mean to say he lugged the corpse to the window and lifted it up so that he could press the stiff fingers upon the nickel catches Sanderson asked with a shudder What a fiend No Dundee assured him That was unnecessary He simply removed the curtain screen which is so designed that it can be taken down and put up as easily as a window shade He carried the screen his own hands protected by gloves I suppose to where Sprague s right hand lay palm upward on the floor and pressed the thumb and forefinger against the catches making fingerprints all right but they were reversed as I discovered when it occurred to me to examine the photographs of Sprague s fingerprints in Carraway s office today Miles could not turn the stiff hand over without bruising the dead flesh consequently the print of the forefinger was on the catch where the thumb would normally have left its mark and vice versa Before I forget it I should also tell you that I found a master key hanging on the keyboard in the butler s pantry Big houses with their many locks are usually provided with a master key and Miles undoubtedly used that one to gain entrance into my room after midnight Saturday morning Where did you find the vise Strawn asked In the tool chest right here where he had also placed the reamer he had bought The vise probably belonged to Miles originally but he was taking no chances on anything s being found in his possession provided we tumbled to how the two crimes were committed The reamer he must have brought out here after he used it to enlarge the hole in my hot air register after midnight Sunday morning It is possible he did his cleaning up job here at the same time It was safe enough to have lights on since the house is so isolated and there had been no guard here since Thursday Well Sanderson drew a deep breath He was a far cleverer man than any of us suspected The mechanical arrangements were absurdly easy to rig up in all three cases but the thinking of them It is a pity Nita did not fear him as she feared Sprague s vengeance You re right Dundee answered Nita did not fear Miles not even when she was making him pay and pay No woman could look at Miles and believe him capable of murder But a conviction of sexual inferiority leads to strange things as psychologists can tell you I believe Miles married the only two women who ever fell in love with him and there can be no doubt that Nita really loved him for she kept her wedding dress for more than twelve years and chose it to be her shroud It is possible she was still fond of him although she was infatuated with Sprague when she came down here and was later sincerely in love with Ralph Hammond Another reason she did not fear Miles when she made her will was that she counted on being able to tell him Saturday night at the latest that she would never ask him for money again if he would trade silence for silence How she hoped to secure Sprague s silence we can only guess at Probably she meant to buy it with the remainder of the ten thousand dollars she had already got from Miles provided Sprague did not kill her for ditching him as a lover We know she foresaw that possibility since she willed the money to Lydia Of course if Sprague had proved tractable Nita as Ralph s wife would have been able to compensate Lydia handsomely for the injury she had done her Poor Nita and poor Flora Sanderson sighed as he led the way up the basement stairs Hello Someone s calling you Bonnie Dundee ran through the kitchen and dining room and into the living room for he had recognized Penny Crain s sweet husky contralto What are you doing back here young woman he demanded You were told to go home and forget all this ugly business Dad wants a private word with you Penny explained her brown eyes luminous with happiness He s on the front porch And you ought to see Mother She looks like a twenty year old bride When Dundee joined him on the porch Roger Crain flushed painfully but there was happiness in his eyes too Serena asked me to thank you for giving her Penny s message to pass on to me Crain began in a low voice I m sure you ve guessed a lot but what you probably don t know is that Serena used the securities I had sent her for safe keeping to play the market with When she knew what I had done here she wouldn t let me touch a penny of the money until she had turned it into enough to clear up all my debts in Hamilton Then and he sighed slightly she sent me home Not that I m sorry I m going to try to make Margaret and Penny happy make them and the town forget that I disgraced them Through Penny called from the doorway and Bonnie Dundee forgot
