which have become so incorporated into the literature and thought of our race that a knowledge of them is an indispensable part of one s education These stories are of several different classes To one class belong the popular fairy tales which have delighted untold generations of children and will continue to delight them to the end of time To another class belong the limited number of fables that have come down to us through many channels from hoar antiquity To a third belong the charming stories of olden times that are derived from the literatures of ancient peoples such as the Greeks and the Hebrews A fourth class includes the half legendary tales of a distinctly later origin which have for their subjects certain romantic episodes in the lives of well known heroes and famous men or in the history of a people It is to this last class that most of the fifty stories contained in the present volume belong As a matter of course some of these stories are better known and therefore more famous than others Some have a slight historical value some are useful as giving point to certain great moral truths others are products solely of the fancy and are intended only to amuse Some are derived from very ancient sources and are current in the literature of many lands some have come to us through the ballads and folk tales of the English people a few are of quite recent origin nearly all are the subjects of frequent allusions in poetry and prose and in the conversation of educated people Care has been taken to exclude everything that is not strictly within the limits of probability hence there is here no trespassing upon the domain of the fairy tale the fable or the myth That children naturally take a deep interest in such stories no person can deny that the reading of them will not only give pleasure but will help to lay the foundation for broader literary studies can scarcely be doubted It is believed therefore that the present collection will be found to possess an educative value which will commend it as a supplementary reader in the middle primary grades at school It is also hoped that the book will prove so attractive that it will be in demand out of school as well as in Acknowledgments are due to missus Charles A Lane by whom eight or ten of the stories were suggested FIFTY FAMOUS STORIES RETOLD KING ALFRED AND THE CAKES Illustration Many years ago there lived in Eng land a wise and good king whose name was Al fred No other man ever did so much for his country as he and people now all over the world speak of him as Alfred the Great In those days a king did not have a very easy life There was war almost all the time and no one else could lead his army into battle so well as he And so between ruling and fighting he had a busy time of it indeed A fierce rude people called the Danes had come from over the sea and were fighting the Eng lish There were so many of them and they were so bold and strong that for a long time they gained every battle If they kept on they would soon be the masters of the whole country At last after a great battle the English army was broken up and scat tered Every man had to save himself in the best way he could King Alfred fled alone in great haste through the woods and swamps Late in the day the king came to the hut of a wood cut ter He was very tired and hungry and he begged the wood cut ter s wife to give him something to eat and a place to sleep in her hut The wom an was baking some cakes upon the hearth and she looked with pity upon the poor ragged fellow who seemed so hungry She had no thought that he was the king Yes she said I will give you some supper if you will watch these cakes I want to go out and milk the cow and you must see that they do not burn while I am gone King Alfred was very willing to watch the cakes but he had far greater things to think about How was he going to get his army to geth er again And how was he going to drive the fierce Danes out of the land He forgot his hunger he forgot the cakes he forgot that he was in the woodcutter s hut His mind was busy making plans for to mor row In a little while the wom an came back The cakes were smoking on the hearth They were burned to a crisp Ah how angry she was You lazy fellow she cried See what you have done You want some thing to eat but you do not want to work I have been told that she even struck the king with a stick but I can hardly be lieve that she was so ill na tured The king must have laughed to himself at the thought of being scolded in this way and he was so hungry that he did not mind the woman s angry words half so much as the loss of the cakes I do not know whether he had any thing to eat that night or whether he had to go to bed without his supper But it was not many days until he had gath ered his men to geth er again and had beaten the Danes in a great battle KING ALFRED AND THE BEGGAR At one time the Danes drove King Alfred from his kingdom and he had to lie hidden for a long time on a little is land in a river One day all who were on the is land except the king and queen and one servant went out to fish It was a very lonely place and no one could get to it except by a boat About noon a ragged beggar came to the king s door and asked for food The king called the servant and asked How much food have we in the house My lord said the servant we have only one loaf and a little wine Then the king gave thanks to God and said Give half of the loaf and half of the wine to this poor man The servant did as he was bidden The beggar thanked the king for his kindness and went on his way In the after noon the men who had gone out to fish came back They had three boats full of fish and they said We have caught more fish to day than in all the other days that we have been on this island The king was glad and he and his people were more hopeful than they had ever been before When night came the king lay awake for a long time and thought about the things that had happened that day At last he fancied that he saw a great light like the sun and in the midst of the light there stood an old man with black hair holding an open book in his hand It may all have been a dream and yet to the king it seemed very real indeed He looked and wondered but was not afraid Who are you he asked of the old man Alfred my son be brave said the man for I am the one to whom you gave this day the half of all the food that you had Be strong and joyful of heart and listen to what I say Rise up early in the morning and blow your horn three times so loudly that the Danes may hear it By nine o clock five hundred men will be around you ready to be led into battle Go forth bravely and within seven days your en e mies shall be beaten and you shall go back to your kingdom to reign in peace Then the light went out and the man was seen no more In the morning the king arose early and crossed over to the mainland Then he blew his horn three times very loudly and when his friends heard it they were glad but the Danes were filled with fear At nine o clock five hundred of his bravest soldiers stood around him ready for battle He spoke and told them what he had seen and heard in his dream and when he had fin ished they all cheered loudly and said that they would follow him and fight for him so long as they had strength So they went out bravely to battle and they beat the Danes and drove them back into their own place And King Alfred ruled wisely and well over all his people for the rest of his days KING CANUTE ON THE SEASHORE A hundred years or more after the time of Alfred the Great there was a king of England named Ca nute King Canute was a Dane but the Danes were not so fierce and cruel then as they had been when they were at war with King Alfred The great men and of fi cers who were around King Canute were always praising him You are the greatest man that ever lived one would say Then an oth er would say O king there can never be an oth er man so mighty as you And another would say Great Canute there is nothing in the world that dares to dis o bey you The king was a man of sense and he grew very tired of hearing such foolish speeches One day he was by the sea shore and his of fi cers were with him They were praising him as they were in the habit of doing He thought that now he would teach them a lesson and so he bade them set his chair on the beach close by the edge of the water Am I the greatest man in the world he asked O king they cried there is no one so mighty as you Do all things obey me he asked There is nothing that dares to dis o bey you O king they said The world bows before you and gives you honor Will the sea obey me he asked and he looked down at the little waves which were lapping the sand at his feet The foolish officers were puzzled but they did not dare to say No Command it O king and it will obey said one Sea cried Canute I command you to come no farther Waves stop your rolling and do not dare to touch my feet But the tide came in just as it always did The water rose higher and higher It came up around the king s chair and wet not only his feet but also his robe His officers stood about him alarmed and won der ing whether he was not mad Then Canute took off his crown and threw it down upon the sand I shall never wear it again he said And do you my men learn a lesson from what you have seen There is only one King who is all powerful and it is he who rules the sea and holds the ocean in the hollow of his hand It is he whom you ought to praise and serve above all others THE SONS OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR There was once a great king of England who was called Wil liam the Con quer or and he had three sons Illustration Sea I command you to come no farther One day King Wil liam seemed to be thinking of something that made him feel very sad and the wise men who were about him asked him what was the matter I am thinking he said of what my sons may do after I am dead For unless they are wise and strong they cannot keep the kingdom which I have won for them Indeed I am at a loss to know which one of the three ought to be the king when I am gone O king said the wise men if we only knew what things your sons admire the most we might then be able to tell what kind of men they will be Perhaps by asking each one of them a few ques tions we can find out which one of them will be best fitted to rule in your place The plan is well worth trying at least said the king Have the boys come before you and then ask them what you please The wise men talked with one another for a little while and then agreed that the young princes should be brought in one at a time and that the same ques tions should be put to each The first who came into the room was Robert He was a tall willful lad and was nick named Short Stocking Fair sir said one of the men answer me this question If instead of being a boy it had pleased God that you should be a bird what kind of a bird would you rather be A hawk answered Robert I would rather be a hawk for no other bird reminds one so much of a bold and gallant knight The next who came was young William his father s name sake and pet His face was jolly and round and because he had red hair he was nicknamed Rufus or the Red Fair sir said the wise man answer me this question If instead of being a boy it had pleased God that you should be a bird what kind of a bird would you rather be An eagle answered William I would rather be an eagle because it is strong and brave It is feared by all other birds and is there fore the king of them all Lastly came the youngest brother Henry with quiet steps and a sober thought ful look He had been taught to read and write and for that reason he was nick named Beau clerc or the Hand some Schol ar Fair sir said the wise man answer me this question If instead of being a boy it had pleased God that you should be a bird what kind of a bird would you rather be A star ling said Henry I would rather be a star ling because it is good mannered and kind and a joy to every one who sees it and it never tries to rob or abuse its neigh bor Then the wise men talked with one another for a little while and when they had agreed among themselves they spoke to the king We find said they that your eldest son Robert will be bold and gallant He will do some great deeds and make a name for himself but in the end he will be over come by his foes and will die in prison The second son William will be as brave and strong as the eagle but he will be feared and hated for his cruel deeds He will lead a wicked life and will die a shameful death The youngest son Henry will be wise and prudent and peaceful He will go to war only when he is forced to do so by his enemies He will be loved at home and re spect ed abroad and he will die in peace after having gained great pos ses sions Years passed by and the three boys had grown up to be men King William lay upon his death bed and again he thought of what would become of his sons when he was gone Then he re mem bered what the wise men had told him and so he de clared that Robert should have the lands which he held in France that William should be the King of England and that Henry should have no land at all but only a chest of gold So it hap pened in the end very much as the wise men had fore told Robert the Short Stocking was bold and reckless like the hawk which he so much admired He lost all the lands that his father had left him and was at last shut up in prison where he was kept until he died William Rufus was so over bear ing and cruel that he was feared and hated by all his people He led a wicked life and was killed by one of his own men while hunting in the forest And Henry the Handsome Scholar had not only the chest of gold for his own but he became by and by the King of England and the ruler of all the lands that his father had had in France THE WHITE SHIP King Henry the Handsome Scholar had one son named William whom he dearly loved The young man was noble and brave and every body hoped that he would some day be the King of England One summer Prince William went with his father across the sea to look after their lands in France They were wel comed with joy by all their people there and the young prince was so gallant and kind that he won the love of all who saw him But at last the time came for them to go back to England The king with his wise men and brave knights set sail early in the day but Prince William with his younger friends waited a little while They had had so joyous a time in France that they were in no great haste to tear them selves away Then they went on board of the ship which was waiting to carry them home It was a beau ti ful ship with white sails and white masts and it had been fitted up on purpose for this voyage The sea was smooth the winds were fair and no one thought of danger On the ship every thing had been ar ranged to make the trip a pleasant one There was music and dancing and everybody was merry and glad The sun had gone down before the white winged vessel was fairly out of the bay But what of that The moon was at its full and it would give light enough and before the dawn of the morrow the narrow sea would be crossed And so the prince and the young people who were with him gave themselves up to mer ri ment and feasting and joy The ear li er hours of the night passed by and then there was a cry of alarm on deck A moment after ward there was a great crash The ship had struck upon a rock The water rushed in She was sinking Ah where now were those who had lately been so heart free and glad Every heart was full of fear No one knew what to do A small boat was quickly launched and the prince with a few of his bravest friends leaped into it They pushed off just as the ship was be gin ning to settle beneath the waves Would they be saved They had rowed hardly ten yards from the ship when there was a cry from among those that were left behind Row back cried the prince It is my little sister She must be saved The men did not dare to disobey The boat was again brought along side of the sinking vessel The prince stood up and held out his arms for his sister At that moment the ship gave a great lurch forward into the waves One shriek of terror was heard and then all was still save the sound of the moaning waters Ship and boat prince and prin cess and all the gay com pa ny that had set sail from France went down to the bottom together One man clung to a floating plank and was saved the next day He was the only person left alive to tell the sad story When King Henry heard of the death of his son his grief was more than he could bear His heart was broken He had no more joy in life and men say that no one ever saw him smile again Here is a poem about him that your teacher may read to you and perhaps after a while you may learn it by heart HE NEVER SMILED AGAIN The bark that held the prince went down The sweeping waves rolled on And what was England s glorious crown To him that wept a son He lived for life may long be borne Ere sorrow breaks its chain Why comes not death to those who mourn He never smiled again There stood proud forms before his throne The stately and the brave But who could fill the place of one That one beneath the wave Before him passed the young and fair In pleasure s reckless train But seas dashed o er his son s bright hair He never smiled again He sat where festal bowls went round He heard the minstrel sing He saw the tour ney s victor crowned Amid the knightly ring A murmur of the restless deep Was blent with every strain A voice of winds that would not sleep He never smiled again Hearts in that time closed o er the trace Of vows once fondly poured And strangers took the kins man s place At many a joyous board Graves which true love had bathed with tears Were left to heaven s bright rain Fresh hopes were born for other years He never smiled again missus HEMANS KING JOHN AND THE ABBOT I THE THREE QUESTIONS There was once a king of England whose name was John He was a bad king for he was harsh and cruel to his people and so long as he could have his own way he did not care what became of other folks He was the worst king that England ever had Now there was in the town of Can ter bur y 
243-162846-0000	train-other-500	a rich old abbot who lived in grand style in a great house called the Abbey Every day a hundred noble men sat down with him to dine and fifty brave knights in fine velvet coats and gold chains
243-162846-0001	train-other-500	waited upon him at his table When King John heard of the way in which the abbot lived he made up his mind to put a stop to it So he sent for the old man to come and see him How now my good abbot
243-162846-0002	train-other-500	he said I hear that you keep a far better house than I How dare you do such a thing Don t you know that no man in the land ought to live better than the king And I tell you that no man shall O king said the abbot
none	none	 I beg to say that I am spending nothing but what is my own I hope that you will not think ill of me for making things pleasant for my friends 
243-162846-0003	train-other-500	and the brave knights who are with me Think ill of you said the king How can I help but think ill of you All that there is in this broad land is mine by right and how do you dare to put me to shame
none	none	 by living in grander style than I One would think that you were trying to be king in my place Oh do not say so said the abbot For I Not another word cried the king Your fault is plain and unless you can answer me three questions 
243-162846-0004	train-other-500	your head shall be cut off and all your riches shall be mine I will try to answer them O king said the abbot Well then said King John as I sit here with my crown of gold on my head you must tell me
243-162846-0005	train-other-500	to within a day just how long I shall live Sec ond ly you must tell me how soon I shall ride round the whole world and lastly you shall tell me what I think
none	none	 O king said the abbot these are deep hard questions and I cannot answer them just now But if you will give me two weeks to think about them I will do the best that I can Two weeks you shall have said the king 
243-162846-0006	train-other-500	but if then you fail to answer me you shall lose your head and all your lands shall be mine The abbot went away very sad and in great fear He first rode to Oxford Here was a great school
none	none	 called a u ni ver si ty and he wanted to see 
243-162846-0007	train-other-500	if any of the wise pro fess ors could help him But they shook their heads and said that there was nothing about King John in any of their books Then the abbot rode down to Cam bridge
none	none	 where there was another u ni ver si ty But not one of the teachers 
243-162846-0008	train-other-500	in that great school could help him At last
none	none	 sad and sor row ful he rode toward home to bid his friends and his brave knights good by 
243-162846-0009	train-other-500	For now he had not a week to live
none	none	 II THE THREE ANSWERS 
243-162846-0010	train-other-500	As the abbot was riding up the lane which led to his grand house he met his shep herd going to the fields Welcome home good master cried the shepherd What news do you bring us from great King John
243-162846-0011	train-other-500	Sad news sad news said the abbot and then he told him all that had happened Cheer up cheer up good master said the shepherd Have you never yet heard
243-162846-0012	train-other-500	that a fool may teach a wise man wit I think I can help you out of your trouble You help me cried the abbot How how Well answered the shepherd you know that everybody says
none	none	 that I look just like you and that I have some times been mis tak en for you 
243-162846-0013	train-other-500	So lend me your servants and your horse and your gown and I will go up to London and see the king If nothing else can be done I can at least die in your place
none	none	 My good shepherd said the abbot 
243-162846-0014	train-other-500	you are very very kind and I have a mind to let you try your plan But if the worst comes to the worst you shall not die for me I will die for myself So the shepherd got ready to go at once He dressed himself with great care
243-162846-0015	train-other-500	Over his shepherd s coat he threw the abbot s long gown and he bor rowed the abbot s cap and golden staff When all was ready no one in the world would have thought that he was not the great man himself Then he mounted his horse
243-162846-0016	train-other-500	and with a great train of servants set out for London Of course the king did not know him Welcome Sir Abbot he said It is a good thing that you have come back But prompt as you are
243-162846-0017	train-other-500	if you fail to answer my three questions you shall lose your head I am ready to answer them O king said the shepherd Indeed indeed said the king and he laughed to himself Well then
243-162846-0018	train-other-500	answer my first question How long shall I live Come you must tell me to the very day You shall live said the shepherd until the day that you die and not one day longer And you shall die when you take your last breath
none	none	 and not one moment before The king laughed You are witty I see he said But we will let that pass and say that your answer is right And now tell me how soon I may ride round the world Illustration You shall live until the day that you die You must rise with the sun said the shepherd and you must ride with the sun until it rises again the next morning As soon as you do that you will find that you have ridden round the world in twenty four hours 
243-162846-0019	train-other-500	The king laughed again Indeed he said
none	none	 I did not think that it could be done so soon 
243-162846-0020	train-other-500	You are not only witty but you are wise and we will let this answer pass And now comes my third and last question What do I think
none	none	 That is an easy question said the shepherd You think that I am the Abbot of Can ter bur y But to tell you the truth I am only his poor shepherd 
243-162846-0021	train-other-500	and I have come to beg your pardon for him and for me And with that he threw off his long gown The king laughed loud and long A merry fellow you are said he
none	none	 and you shall be the Abbot of Canterbury in your master s place 
243-162846-0022	train-other-500	O king that cannot be said the shepherd
none	none	 for I can neither read nor write Very well then said the king I will give you something else to pay you for this merry joke I will give you four pieces of silver every week as long as you live And when you get home you may tell the old abbot that you have brought him a free pardon from King John A STORY OF ROBIN HOOD In the rude days of King Rich ard and King John there were many great woods in England The most famous of these was Sher wood forest where the king often went to hunt deer In this forest there lived a band of daring men called out laws They had done something that was against the laws of the land and had been forced to hide themselves in the woods to save their lives There they spent their time in roaming about among the trees in hunting the king s deer and in robbing rich trav el ers that came that way There were nearly a hundred of these outlaws and their leader was a bold fellow called Robin Hood They were dressed in suits of green and armed with bows and arrows and sometimes they carried long wooden lances and broad swords which they knew how to handle well When ever they had taken anything it was brought and laid at the feet of Robin Hood whom they called their king He then di vid ed it fairly among them giving to each man his just share Robin never allowed his men to harm any body but the rich men who lived in great houses and did no work He was always kind to the poor and he often sent help to them and for that reason the common people looked upon him as their friend Long after he was dead men liked to talk about his deeds Some praised him and some blamed him He was indeed a rude lawless fellow but at that time people did not think of right and wrong as they do now A great many songs were made up about Robin Hood and these songs were sung in the cot ta ges and huts all over the land for hundreds of years after ward Here is a little story that is told in one of those songs Robin Hood was standing one day under a green tree by the road side While he was lis ten ing to the birds among the leaves he saw a young man passing by This young man was dressed in a fine suit of bright red cloth and as he tripped gayly along the road he seemed to be as happy as the day I will not trou ble him said Robin Hood for I think he is on his way to his wedding The next day Robin stood in the same place He had not been there long when he saw the same young man coming down the road But he did not seem to be so happy this time He had left his scarlet coat at home and at every step he sighed and groaned Ah the sad day the sad day he kept saying to himself Then Robin Hood stepped out from under the tree and said I say young man Have you any money to spare for my merry men and me I have nothing at all said the young man but five shil lings and a ring A gold ring asked Robin Yes said the young man it is a gold ring Here it is Ah I see said Robin it is a wedding ring I have kept it these seven years said the young man I have kept it to give to my bride on our wedding day We were going to be married yes ter day But her father has prom ised her to a rich old man whom she never saw And now my heart is broken What is your name asked Robin My name is Allin a Dale said the young man What will you give me in gold or fee said Robin if I will help you win your bride again in spite of the rich old man to whom she has been promised Illustration I have no money said Allin but I will promise to be your servant How many miles is it to the place where the maiden lives asked Robin It is not far said Allin But she is to be married this very day and the church is five miles away Then Robin made haste to dress himself as a harper and in the after noon he stood in the door of the church Who are you said the bishop and what are you doing here I am a bold harper said Robin the best in the north country I am glad you have come said the bishop kindly There is no music that I like so well as that of the harp Come in and play for us I will go in said Robin Hood but I will not give you any music until I see the bride and bridegroom Just then an old man came in He was dressed in rich clothing but was bent with age and was feeble and gray By his side walked a fair young girl Her cheeks were very pale and her eyes were full of tears This is no match said Robin Let the bride choose for herself Then he put his horn to his lips and blew three times The very next minute four and twenty men all dressed in green and car ry ing long bows in their hands came running across the fields And as they marched into the church all in a row the fore most among them was Allin a Dale Now whom do you choose said Robin to the maiden I choose Allin a Dale she said blushing And Allin a Dale you shall have said Robin and he that takes you from Allin a Dale shall find that he has Robin Hood to deal with And so the fair maiden and Allin a Dale were married then and there and the rich old man went home in a great rage And thus having ended this merry wedding The bride looked like a queen And so they re turned to the merry green wood Amongst the leaves so green BRUCE AND THE SPIDER There was once a king of Scot land whose name was Robert Bruce He had need to be both brave and wise for the times in which he lived were wild and rude The King of England was at war with him and had led a great army into Scotland to drive him out of the land Battle after battle had been fought Six times had Bruce led his brave little army against his foes and six times had his men been beaten and driven into flight At last his army was scat tered and he was forced to hide himself in the woods and in lonely places among the moun tains One rainy day Bruce lay on the ground under a rude shed lis ten ing to the patter of the drops on the roof above him He was tired and sick at heart and ready to give up all hope It seemed to him that there was no use for him to try to do anything more As he lay thinking he saw a spider over his head making ready to weave her web He watched her as she toiled slowly and with great care Six times she tried to throw her frail thread from one beam to another and six times it fell short Poor thing said Bruce you too know what it is to fail But the spider did not lose hope with the sixth failure With still more care she made ready to try for the seventh time Bruce almost forgot his own troubles as he watched her swing herself out upon the slender line Would she fail again No The thread was carried safely to the beam and fas tened there I too will try a seventh time cried Bruce He arose and called his men together He told them of his plans and sent them out with mes sa ges of cheer to his dis heart ened people Soon there was an army of brave Scotch men around him Another battle was fought and the King of England was glad to go back into his own country I have heard it said that after that day no one by the name of Bruce would ever hurt a spider The lesson which the little crea ture had taught the king was never for got ten THE BLACK DOUGLAS In Scotland in the time of King Robert Bruce there lived a brave man whose name was Doug las His hair and beard were black and long and his face was tanned and dark and for this reason people nicknamed him the Black Douglas He was a good friend of the king and one of his strongest helpers In the war with the English who were trying to drive Bruce from Scotland the Black Douglas did many brave deeds and the English people became very much afraid of him By and by the fear of him spread all through the land Nothing could frighten an English lad more than to tell him that the Black Douglas was not far away Women would tell their chil dren when they were naughty that the Black Douglas would get them and this would make them very quiet and good There was a large cas tle in Scotland which the English had taken early in the war The Scot tish soldiers wanted very much to take it again and the Black Douglas and his men went one day to see what they could do It happened to be a hol i day and most of the English soldiers in the cas tle were eating and drinking and having a merry time But they had left watch men on the wall to see that the Scottish soldiers did not come upon them un a wares and so they felt quite safe In the e ven ing when it was growing dark the wife of one of the soldiers went up on the wall with her child in her arms As she looked over into the fields below the castle she saw some dark objects moving toward the foot of the wall In the dusk she could not make out what they were and so she pointed them out to one of the watch men Pooh pooh said the watchman Those are nothing to frighten us They are the farmer s cattle trying to find their way home The farmer himself is en joy ing the hol i day and he has forgotten to bring them in If the Douglas should happen this way before morning he will be sorry for his care less ness But the dark objects were not cattle They were the Black Douglas and his men creeping on hands and feet toward the foot of the castle wall Some of them were dragging ladders behind them through the grass They would soon be climbing to the top of the wall None of the English soldiers dreamed that they were within many miles of the place The woman watched them until the last one had passed around a corner out of sight She was not afraid for in the dark en ing twi light they looked indeed like cattle After a little while she began to sing to her child Hush ye hush ye little pet ye Hush ye hush ye do not fret ye The Black Douglas shall not get ye All at once a gruff voice was heard behind her saying Don t be so sure about that She looked around and there stood the Black Douglas himself At the same moment a Scottish soldier climbed off a ladder and leaped upon the wall and then there came another and another and another until the wall was covered with them Soon there was hot fighting in every part of the castle But the English were so taken by surprise that they could not do much Many of them were killed and in a little while the Black Douglas and his men were the masters of the castle which by right be longed to them Illustration Don t be so sure about that As for the woman and her child the Black Douglas would not suffer any one to harm them After a while they went back to England and whether the mother made up any more songs about the Black Douglas I cannot tell THREE MEN OF GOTHAM There is a town in England called Go tham and many merry stories are told of the queer people who used to live there One day two men of Go tham met on a bridge Hodge was coming from the market and Peter was going to the market Where are you going said Hodge I am going to the market to buy sheep said Peter Buy sheep said Hodge And which way will you bring them home I shall bring them over this bridge said Peter No you shall not said Hodge Yes but I will said Peter You shall not said Hodge I will said Peter Then they beat with their sticks on the ground as though there had been a hundred sheep between them Take care cried Peter Look out that my sheep don t jump on the bridge I care not where they jump said Hodge but they shall not go over it But they shall said Peter Have a care said Hodge for if you say too much I will put my fingers in your mouth Will you said Peter Just then another man of Gotham came from the market with a sack of meal on his horse He heard his neigh bors quar rel ing about sheep but he could see no sheep between them and so he stopped and spoke to them Ah you foolish fellows he cried It is strange that you will never learn wisdom Come here Peter and help me lay my sack on my shoul der Peter did so and the man carried his meal to the side of the bridge Now look at me he said and learn a lesson And he opened the mouth of the sack and poured all the meal into the river Now neighbors he said can you tell how much meal is in my sack Illustration How much meal is in my sack There is none at all cried Hodge and Peter together You are right said the man and you that stand here and quarrel about nothing have no more sense in your heads than I have meal in my sack OTHER WISE MEN OF GOTHAM One day news was brought to Gotham that the king was coming that way and that he would pass through the town This did not please the men of Gotham at all They hated the king for they knew that he was a cruel bad man If he came to their town they would have to find food and lodg ing for him and his men and if he saw anything that pleased him he would be sure to take it for his own What should they do They met together to talk the matter over Let us chop down the big trees in the woods so that they will block up all the roads that lead into the town said one of the wise men Good said all the rest So they went out with their axes and soon all the roads and paths to the town were filled with logs and brush The king s horse men would have a hard time of it getting into Gotham They would either have to make a new road or give up the plan al to geth er and go on to some other place When the king came and saw that the road had been blocked up he was very angry Who chopped those trees down in my way he asked of two country lads that were passing by The men of Gotham said the lads Well said the king go and tell the men of Gotham that I shall send my sher iff into their town and have all their noses cut off The two lads ran to the town as fast as they could and made known what the king had said Every body was in great fright The men ran from house to house carrying the news and asking one another what they should do Our wits have kept the king out of the town said one and so now our wits must save our noses True true said the others But what shall we do Then one whose name was Dobbin and who was thought to be the wisest of them all said Let me tell you something Many a man has been punished because he was wise but I have never heard of any one being harmed because he was a fool So when the king s sher iff comes let us all act like fools Good good cried the others We will all act like fools It was no easy thing for the king s men to open the roads and while they were doing it the king grew tired of waiting and went back to London But very early one morning the sheriff with a party of fierce soldiers rode through the woods and between the fields toward Gotham Just before they reached the town they saw a queer sight The old men were rolling big stones up the hill and all the young men were looking on and grunting very loudly The sheriff stopped his horses and asked what they were doing We are rolling stones up hill to make the sun rise said one of the old men You foolish fellow said the sheriff Don t you know that the sun will rise without any help Ah will it said the old man Well I never thought of that How wise you are And what are you doing said the sheriff to the young men Oh we do the grunting while our fathers do the working they answered I see said the sheriff Well that is the way the world goes every where And he rode on toward the town He soon came to a field where a number of men were building a stone wall What are you doing he asked Why master they answered there is a cuck oo in this field and we are building a wall around it so as to keep the bird from straying away You foolish fellows said the sheriff Don t you know that the bird will fly over the top of your wall no matter how high you build it Why no they said We never thought of that How very wise you are The sheriff next met a man who was carrying a door on his back What are you doing he asked I have just started on a long jour ney said the man But why do you carry that door asked the sheriff I left my money at home Then why didn t you leave the door at home too I was afraid of thieves and you see if I have the door with me they can t break it open and get in You foolish fellow said the sheriff It would be safer to leave the door at home and carry the money with you Ah would it though said the man Now I never thought of that You are the wisest man that I ever saw Then the sheriff rode on with his men but every one that they met was doing some silly thing Truly I believe that the people of Gotham are all fools said one of the horsemen That is true said another It would be a shame to harm such simple people Let us ride back to London and tell the king all about them said the sheriff Yes let us do so said the horsemen So they went back and told the king that Gotham was a town of fools and the king laughed and said that if that was the case he would not harm them but would let them keep their noses THE MILLER OF THE DEE Once upon a time there lived on the banks of the River Dee a miller who was the hap pi est man in England He was always busy from morning till night and he was always singing as merrily as any lark He was so cheerful that he made everybody else cheerful and people all over the land liked to talk about his pleasant ways At last the king heard about him I will go down and talk with this won der ful miller he said Perhaps he can tell me how to be happy As soon as he stepped inside of the mill he heard the miller singing I envy no body no not I For I am as happy as I can be And nobody envies me You re wrong my friend said the king You re wrong as wrong can be I envy you and I would gladly change places with you if I could only be as light hearted as you are The miller smiled and bowed to the king I am sure I could not think of changing places with you sir he said Now tell me said the king what makes you so cheerful and glad here in your dusty mill while I who am king am sad and in trouble every day The miller smiled again and said I do not know why you are sad but I can eas i ly tell why I am glad I earn my own bread I love my wife and my children I love my friends and they love me and I owe not a penny to any man Why should I not be happy For here is the River Dee and every day it turns my mill and the mill grinds the corn that feeds my wife my babes and me Illustration Say no more said the king Stay where you are and be happy still But I envy you Your dusty cap is worth more than my golden crown Your mill does more for you than my kingdom can do for me If there were more such men as you what a good place this world would be Good by my friend The king turned about and walked sadly away and the miller went back to his work singing Oh I m as happy as happy can be For I live by the side of the River Dee SIR PHILIP SIDNEY A cruel battle was being fought The ground was covered with dead and dying men The air was hot and stifling The sun shone down without pity on the wounded soldiers lying in the blood and dust One of these soldiers was a no ble man whom everybody loved for his general tle ness and kindness Yet now he was no better off than the poorest man in the field He had been wounded and would die and he was suf fer ing much with pain and thirst When the battle was over his friends hurried to his aid A soldier came running with a cup in his hand Here Sir Philip he said I have brought you some clear cool water from the brook I will raise your head so that you can drink The cup was placed to Sir Philip s lips How thank ful ly he looked at the man who had brought it Then his eyes met those of a dying soldier who was lying on the ground close by The wist ful look in the poor man s face spoke plainer than words Give the water to that man said Sir Philip quickly and then pushing the cup toward him he said Here my comrade take this Thy need is greater than mine What a brave noble man he was The name of Sir Philip Sidney will never be for got ten for it was the name of a Chris tian general tle man who always had the good of others in his mind Was it any wonder that everybody wept when it was heard that he was dead It is said that on the day when he was carried to the grave every eye in the land was filled with tears Rich and poor high and low all felt that they had lost a friend all mourned the death of the kindest gentlest man that they had ever known THE UNGRATEFUL SOLDIER Here is another story of the bat tle field and it is much like the one which I have just told you Not quite a hundred years after the time of Sir Philip Sidney there was a war between the Swedes and the Danes One day a great battle was fought and the Swedes were beaten and driven from the field A soldier of the Danes who had been slightly wounded was sitting on the ground He was about to take a drink from a flask All at once he heard some one say O sir give me a drink for I am dying It was a wounded Swede who spoke He was lying on the ground only a little way off The Dane went to him at once He knelt down by the side of his fallen foe and pressed the flask to his lips Drink said he for thy need is greater than mine Hardly had he spoken these words when the Swede raised himself on his elbow He pulled a pistol from his pocket and shot at the man who would have be friend ed him The bullet grazed the Dane s shoulder but did not do him much harm Ah you rascal he cried I was going to befriend you and you repay me by trying to kill me Now I will punish you I would have given you all the water but now you shall have only half And with that he drank the half of it and then gave the rest to the Swede Illustration When the King of the Danes heard about this he sent for the soldier and had him tell the story just as it was Why did you spare the life of the Swede after he had tried to kill you asked the king Because sir said the soldier I could never kill a wounded enemy Then you deserve to be a no ble man said the king And he re ward ed him by making him a knight and giving him a noble title SIR HUMPHREY GILBERT More than three hundred years ago there lived in England a brave man whose name was Sir Humphrey Gil bert At that time there were no white people in this country of ours The land was covered with forests and where there are now great cities and fine farms there were only trees and swamps among which roamed wild In di ans and wild beasts Sir Hum phrey Gilbert was one of the first men who tried to make a set tle ment in A mer i ca Twice did he bring men and ships over the sea and twice did he fail and sail back for England The second time he was on a little ship called the Squirrel Another ship called the Golden Hind was not far away When they were three days from land the wind failed and the ships lay floating on the waves Then at night the air grew very cold A breeze sprang up from the east Great white ice bergs came drifting around them In the morning the little ships were almost lost among the floating mountains of ice The men on the Hind saw Sir Humphrey sitting on the deck of the Squirrel with an open book in his hand He called to them and said Be brave my friends We are as near heaven on the sea as on the land Night came again It was a stormy night with mist and rain All at once the men on the Hind saw the lights on board of the Squirrel go out The little vessel with brave Sir Humphrey and all his brave men was swal lowed up by the waves SIR WALTER RALEIGH There once lived in England a brave and noble man whose name was Walter Ra leigh He was not only brave and noble but he was also handsome and polite and for that reason the queen made him a knight and called him Sir Walter Ra leigh I will tell you about it When Raleigh was a young man he was one day walking along a street in London At that time the streets were not paved and there were no sidewalks Raleigh was dressed in very fine style and he wore a beau ti ful scar let cloak thrown over his shoulders As he passed along he found it hard work to keep from stepping in the mud and soiling his hand some new shoes Soon he came to a puddle of muddy water which reached from one side of the street to the other He could not step across Perhaps he could jump over it As he was thinking what he should do he happened to look up Who was it coming down the street on the other side of the puddle It was E liz a beth the Queen of England with her train of general tle wom en and waiting maids She saw the dirty puddle in the street She saw the handsome young man with the scar let cloak stand ing by the side of it How was she to get across Young Raleigh when he saw who was coming forgot about himself He thought only of helping the queen There was only one thing that he could do and no other man would have thought of that He took off his scarlet cloak and spread it across the puddle The queen could step on it now as on a beautiful carpet She walked across She was safely over the ugly puddle and her feet had not touched the mud She paused a moment and thanked the young man As she walked onward with her train she asked one of the general tle wom en Who is that brave general tle man who helped us so handsomely His name is Walter Raleigh said the gentle woman He shall have his reward said the queen Not long after that she sent for Raleigh to come to her pal ace The young man went but he had no scarlet cloak to wear Then while all the great men and fine ladies of England stood around the queen made him a knight And from that time he was known as Sir Walter Raleigh the queen s favorite Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Humphrey Gilbert about whom I have already told you were half broth ers When Sir Humphrey made his first voy age to America Sir Walter was with him After that Sir Walter tried sev er al times to send men to this country to make a set tle ment But those whom he sent found only great forests and wild beasts and sav age In di ans Some of them went back to England some of them died for want of food and some of them were lost in the woods At last Sir Walter gave up trying to get people to come to America But he found two things in this country which the people of England knew very little about One was the po ta to the other was to bac company If you should ever go to Ireland you may be shown the place where Sir Walter planted the few po ta toes which he carried over from America He told his friends how the Indians used them for food and he proved that they would grow in the Old World as well as in the New Sir Walter had seen the Indians smoking the leaves of the to bac company plant He thought that he would do the same and he carried some of the leaves to England Englishmen had never used tobacco before that time and all who saw Sir Walter puff ing away at a roll of leaves thought that it was a strange sight One day as he was sitting in his chair and smoking his servant came into the room The man saw the smoke curling over his master s head and he thought that he was on fire He ran out for some water He found a pail that was quite full He hurried back and threw the water into Sir Walter s face Of course the fire was all put out After that a great many men learned to smoke And now tobacco is used in all countries of the world It would have been well if Sir Walter Raleigh had let it alone POCAHONTAS There was once a very brave man whose name was John Smith He came to this country many years ago when there were great woods everywhere and many wild beasts and Indians Many tales are told of his ad ven tures some of them true and some of them untrue The most famous of all these is the fol low ing One day when Smith was in the woods some Indians came upon him and made him their pris on er They led him to their king and in a short time they made ready to put him to death A large stone was brought in and Smith was made to lie down with his head on it Then two tall Indians with big clubs in their hands came forward The king and all his great men stood around to see The Indians raised their clubs In another moment they would fall on Smith s head But just then a little Indian girl rushed in She was the daugh ter of the king and her name was Po ca honorable tas She ran and threw herself between Smith and the up lift ed clubs She clasped Smith s head with her arms She laid her own head upon his O father she cried spare this man s life I am sure he has done you no harm and we ought to be his friends The men with the clubs could not strike for they did not want to hurt the child The king at first did not know what to do Then he spoke to some of his war riors and they lifted Smith from the ground They untied the cords from his wrists and feet and set him free The next day the king sent Smith home and several Indians went with him to protect him from harm After that as long as she lived Po ca honorable tas was the friend of the white men and she did a great many things to help them GEORGE WASHINGTON AND HIS HATCHET When George Wash ing ton was quite a little boy his father gave him a hatchet It was bright and new and George took great delight in going about and chopping things with it He ran into the garden and there he saw a tree which seemed to say to him Come and cut me down George had often seen his father s men chop down the great trees in the forest and he thought that it would be fine sport to see this tree fall with a crash to the ground So he set to work with his little hatchet and as the tree was a very small one it did not take long to lay it low Illustration Soon after that his father came home Who has been cutting my fine young cherry tree he cried It was the only tree of its kind in this country and it cost me a great deal of money He was very angry when he came into the house If I only knew who killed that cherry tree he cried I would yes I would Father cried little George I will tell you the truth about it I chopped the tree down with my hatchet His father forgot his anger George he said and he took the little fellow in his arms George I am glad that you told me about it I would rather lose a dozen cherry trees than that you should tell one false hood GRACE DARLING It was a dark Sep tem ber morning There was a storm at sea A ship had been driven on a low rock off the shores of the Farne Islands It had been broken in two by the waves and half of it had been washed away The other half lay yet on the rock and those of the crew who were still alive were cling ing to it But the waves were dashing over it and in a little while it too would be carried to the bottom Could any one save the poor half drowned men who were there On one of the islands was a light house and there all through that stormy night Grace Darling had listened to the storm Grace was the daughter of the light house keeper and she had lived by the sea as long as she could re mem ber In the darkness of the night above the noise of the winds and waves she heard screams and wild cries When day light came she could see the wreck a mile away with the angry waters all around it She could see the men clinging to the masts We must try to save them she cried Let us go out in the boat at once It is of no use Grace said her father We cannot reach them He was an old man and he knew the force of the mighty waves We cannot stay here and see them die said Grace We must at least try to save them Her father could not say No In a few minutes they were ready They set off in the heavy lighthouse boat Grace pulled one oar and her father the other and they made straight toward the wreck But it was hard rowing against such a sea and it seemed as though they would never reach the place At last they were close to the rock and now they were in greater danger than before The fierce waves broke against the boat and it would have been dashed in pieces had it not been for the strength and skill of the brave girl But after many trials Grace s father climbed upon the wreck while Grace herself held the boat Then one by one the worn out crew were helped on board It was all that the girl could do to keep the frail boat from being drifted away or broken upon the sharp edges of the rock Then her father clam bered back into his place Strong hands grasped the oars and by and by all were safe in the lighthouse There Grace proved to be no less tender as a nurse than she had been brave as a sailor She cared most kindly for the ship wrecked men until the storm had died away and they were strong enough to go to their own homes All this happened a long time ago but the name of Grace Darling will never be forgotten She lies buried now in a little church yard by the sea not far from her old home Every year many people go there to see her grave and there a mon u ment has been placed in honor of the brave girl It is not a large mon u ment but it is one that speaks of the noble deed which made Grace Darling famous It is a figure carved in stone of a woman lying at rest with a boat s oar held fast in her right hand THE STORY OF WILLIAM TELL The people of Swit zer land were not always free and happy as they are to day Many years ago a proud tyrant whose name was Gessler ruled over them and made their lot a bitter one indeed One day this tyrant set up a tall pole in the public square and put his own cap on the top of it and then he gave orders that every man who came into the town should bow down before it But there was one man named William Tell who would not do this He stood up straight with folded arms and laughed at the swinging cap He would not bow down to Gessler himself When Gessler heard of this he was very angry He was afraid that other men would disobey and that soon the whole country would rebel against him So he made up his mind to punish the bold man William Tell s home was among the mountains and he was a famous hunter No one in all the land could shoot with bow and arrow so well as he Gessler knew this and so he thought of a cruel plan to make the hunter s own skill bring him to grief He ordered that Tell s little boy should be made to stand up in the public square with an apple on his head and then he bade Tell shoot the apple with one of his arrows Tell begged the tyrant not to have him make this test of his skill What if the boy should move What if the bow man s hand should tremble What if the arrow should not carry true Illustration Will you make me kill my boy he said Say no more said Gessler You must hit the apple with your one arrow If you fail my sol diers shall kill the boy before your eyes Then without another word Tell fitted the arrow to his bow He took aim and let it fly The boy stood firm and still He was not afraid for he had all faith in his father s skill The arrow whistled through the air It struck the apple fairly in the center and carried it away The people who saw it shouted with joy As Tell was turning away from the place an arrow which he had hidden under his coat dropped to the ground Fellow cried Gessler what mean you with this second arrow Tyrant was Tell s proud answer this arrow was for your heart if I had hurt my child And there is an old story that not long after this Tell did shoot the tyrant with one of his arrows and thus he set his country free ARNOLD WINKELRIED A great army was marching into Swit zer land If it should go much farther there would be no driving it out again The soldiers would burn the towns they would rob the farmers of their grain and sheep they would make slaves of the people The men of Switzerland knew all this They knew that they must fight for their homes and their lives And so they came from the mountains and valleys to try what they could do to save their land Some came with bows and arrows some with scythes and pitch forks and some with only sticks and clubs But their foes kept in line as they marched along the road Every soldier was fully armed As they moved and kept close together nothing could be seen of them but their spears and shields and shining armor What could the poor country people do against such foes as these We must break their lines cried their leader for we cannot harm them while they keep together The bowmen shot their arrows but they glanced off from the soldiers shields Others tried clubs and stones but with no better luck The lines were still un bro ken The soldiers moved stead i ly onward their shields lapped over one another their thousand spears looked like so many long bris tles in the sun light What cared they for sticks and stones and hunts men s arrows If we cannot break their ranks said the Swiss we have no chance for fight and our country will be lost Then a poor man whose name was Ar nold Wink el ried stepped out On the side of yonder moun tain said he I have a happy home There my wife and chil dren wait for my return But they will not see me again for this day I will give my life for my country And do you my friends do your duty and Switzerland shall be free With these words he ran forward Follow me he cried to his friends I will break the lines and then let every man fight as bravely as he can He had nothing in his hands neither club nor stone nor other weapon But he ran straight on ward to the place where the spears were thickest Make way for lib er ty he cried as he dashed right into the lines A hundred spears were turned to catch him upon their points The soldiers forgot to stay in their places The lines were broken Arnold s friends rushed bravely after him They fought with whatever they had in hand They snatched spears and shields from their foes They had no thought of fear They only thought of their homes and their dear native land And they won at last Such a battle no one ever knew before But Switzerland was saved and Arnold Wink el ried did not die in vain THE BELL OF ATRI A tri is the name of a little town in It a ly It is a very old town and is built half way up the side of a steep hill A long time ago the King of Atri bought a fine large bell and had it hung up in a tower in the market place A long rope that reached almost to the ground was fas tened to the bell The smallest child could ring the bell by pulling upon this rope It is the bell of justice said the king When at last everything was ready the people of Atri had a great holiday All the men and women and children came down to the market place to look at the bell of justice It was a very pretty bell and was pol ished until it looked almost as bright and yellow as the sun How we should like to hear it ring they said Then the king came down the street Perhaps he will ring it said the people and everybody stood very still and waited to see what he would do But he did not ring the bell He did not even take the rope in his hands When he came to the foot of the tower he stopped and raised his hand My people he said do you see this beautiful bell It is your bell but it must never be rung except in case of need If any one of you is wronged at any time he may come and ring the bell and then the judges shall come together at once and hear his case and give him justice Rich and poor old and young all alike may come but no one must touch the rope unless he knows that he has been wronged Many years passed by after this Many times did the bell in the market place ring out to call the judges together Many wrongs were righted many ill doers were punished At last the hempen rope was almost worn out The lower part of it was un twist ed some of the strands were broken it became so short that only a tall man could reach it This will never do said the judges one day What if a child should be wronged It could not ring the bell to let us know it They gave orders that a new rope should be put upon the bell at once a rope that should hang down to the ground so that the smallest child could reach it But there was not a rope to be found in all Atri They would have to send across the mountains for one and it would be many days before it could be brought What if some great wrong should be done before it came How could the judges know about it if the in jured one could not reach the old rope Let me fix it for you said a man who stood by He ran into his garden which was not far away and soon came back with a long grape vine in his hands This will do for a rope he said and he climbed up and fastened it to the bell The slender vine with its leaves and ten drils still upon it trailed to the ground Yes said the judges it is a very good rope Let it be as it is Now on the hill side above the village there lived a man who had once been a brave knight In his youth he had ridden through many lands and he had fought in many a battle His best friend through all that time had been his horse a strong noble steed that had borne him safe through many a danger But the knight when he grew older cared no more to ride into battle he cared no more to do brave deeds he thought of nothing but gold he became a miser At last he sold all that he had except his horse and went to live in a little hut on the hill side Day after day he sat among his money bags and planned how he might get more gold and day after day his horse stood in his bare stall half starved and shiv er ing with cold What is the use of keeping that lazy steed said the miser to himself one morning Every week it costs me more to keep him than he is worth I might sell him but there is not a man that wants him I cannot even give him away I will turn him out to shift for himself and pick grass by the roadside If he starves to death so much the better So the brave old horse was turned out to find what he could among the rocks on the barren hill side Lame and sick he strolled along the dusty roads glad to find a blade of grass or a thistle The boys threw stones at him the dogs barked at him and in all the world there was no one to pity him One hot afternoon when no one was upon the street the horse chanced to wander into the market place Not a man nor child was there for the heat of the sun had driven them all indoors The gates were wide open the poor beast could roam where he pleased He saw the grape vine rope that hung from the bell of justice The leaves and tendrils upon it were still fresh and green for it had not been there long What a fine dinner they would be for a starving horse He stretched his thin neck and took one of the tempting morsels in his mouth It was hard to break it from the vine He pulled at it and the great bell above him began to ring All the people in Atri heard it It seemed to say Some one has done me wrong Some one has done me wrong Oh come and judge my case Oh come and judge my case For I ve been wronged The judges heard it They put on their robes and went out through the hot streets to the market place They wondered who it could be who would ring the bell at such a time When they passed through the gate they saw the old horse nibbling at the vine Ha cried one it is the miser s steed He has come to call for justice for his master as everybody knows has treated him most shame ful ly He pleads his cause as well as any dumb brute can said another And he shall have justice said the third Mean while a crowd of men and women and children had come into the market place eager to learn what cause the judges were about to try When they saw the horse all stood still in wonder Then every one was ready to tell how they had seen him wan der ing on the hills unfed un cared for while his master sat at home counting his bags of gold Go bring the miser before us said the judges Illustration Some one has done me wrong And when he came they bade him stand and hear their judg ment This horse has served you well for many a year they said He has saved you from many a peril He has helped you gain your wealth Therefore we order that one half of all your gold shall be set aside to buy him shelter and food a green pasture where he may graze and a warm stall to comfort him in his old age The miser hung his head and grieved to lose his gold but the people shouted with joy and the horse was led away to his new stall and a dinner such as he had not had in many a day HOW NAPOLEON CROSSED THE ALPS About a hundred years ago there lived a great general er al whose name was Na po le on Bo na parte He was the leader of the French army and France was at war with nearly all the countries around He wanted very much to take his soldiers into It a ly but between France and Italy there are high mountains called the Alps the tops of which are covered with snow Is it pos si ble to cross the Alps said Na po le on The men who had been sent to look at the passes over the mountains shook their heads Then one of them said It may be possible but Let me hear no more said Napoleon Forward to Italy People laughed at the thought of an army of sixty thousand men crossing the Alps where there was no road But Napoleon waited only to see that everything was in good order and then he gave the order to march The long line of soldiers and horses and cannon stretched for twenty miles When they came to a steep place where there seemed to be no way to go farther the trum pets sounded Charge Then every man did his best and the whole army moved right onward Soon they were safe over the Alps In four days they were marching on the plains of Italy The man who has made up his mind to win said Napoleon will never say Im pos si ble THE STORY OF CINCINNATUS There was a man named Cin cin na tus who lived on a little farm not far from the city of Rome He had once been rich and had held the highest office in the land but in one way or another he had lost all his wealth He was now so poor that he had to do all the work on his farm with his own hands But in those days it was thought to be a noble thing to till the soil Cin cin na tus was so wise and just that every body trusted him and asked his advice and when any one was in trouble and did not know what to do his neighbors would say Go and tell Cincinnatus He will help you Now there lived among the mountains not far away a tribe of fierce half wild men who were at war with the Roman people They per suad ed another tribe of bold war riors to help them and then marched toward the city plun der ing and robbing as they came They boasted that they would tear down the walls of Rome and burn the houses and kill all the men and make slaves of the women and children At first the Romans who were very proud and brave did not think there was much danger Every man in Rome was a soldier and the army which went out to fight the robbers was the finest in the world No one staid at home with the women and children and boys but the white haired Fathers as they were called who made the laws for the city and a small company of men who guarded the walls Everybody thought that it would be an easy thing to drive the men of the mountains back to the place where they belonged But one morning five horsemen came riding down the road from the mountains They rode with great speed and both men and horses were covered with dust and blood The watchman at the gate knew them and shouted to them as they gal loped in Why did they ride thus and what had happened to the Roman army They did not answer him but rode into the city and along the quiet streets and everybody ran after them eager to find out what was the matter Rome was not a large city at that time and soon they reached the market place where the white haired Fathers were sitting Then they leaped from their horses and told their story Only yes ter day they said our army was marching through a narrow valley between two steep mountains All at once a thou sand sav age men sprang out from among the rocks before us and above us They had blocked up the way and the pass was so narrow that we could not fight We tried to come back but they had blocked up the way on this side of us too The fierce men of the mountains were before us and behind us and they were throwing rocks down upon us from above We had been caught in a trap Then ten of us set spurs to our horses and five of us forced our way through but the other five fell before the spears of the mountain men And now O Roman Fathers send help to our army at once or every man will be slain and our city will be taken What shall we do said the white haired Fathers Whom can we send but the guards and the boys and who is wise enough to lead them and thus save Rome All shook their heads and were very grave for it seemed as if there was no hope Then one said Send for Cincinnatus He will help us Cincinnatus was in the field plowing when the men who had been sent to him came in great haste He stopped and greeted them kindly and waited for them to speak Put on your cloak Cincinnatus they said and hear the words of the Roman people Then Cincinnatus wondered what they could mean Is all well with Rome he asked and he called to his wife to bring him his cloak She brought the cloak and Cincinnatus wiped the dust from his hands and arms and threw it over his shoulders Then the men told their errand They told him how the army with all the noblest men of Rome had been en trapped in the mountain pass They told him about the great danger the city was in Then they said The people of Rome make you their ruler and the ruler of their city to do with everything as you choose and the Fathers bid you come at once and go out against our enemies the fierce men of the mountains Illustration So Cincinnatus left his plow standing where it was and hurried to the city When he passed through the streets and gave orders as to what should be done some of the people were afraid for they knew that he had all power in Rome to do what he pleased But he armed the guards and the boys and went out at their head to fight the fierce mountain men and free the Roman army from the trap into which it had fallen A few days afterward there was great joy in Rome There was good news from Cincinnatus The men of the mountains had been beaten with great loss They had been driven back into their own place And now the Roman army with the boys and the guards was coming home with banners flying and shouts of vic to ry and at their head rode Cincinnatus He had saved Rome Cincinnatus might then have made himself king for his word was law and no man dared lift a finger against him But before the people could thank him enough for what he had done he gave back the power to the white haired Roman Fathers and went again to his little farm and his plow He had been the ruler of Rome for sixteen days THE STORY OF REGULUS On the other side of the sea from Rome there was once a great city named Car thage The Roman people were never very friendly to the people of Car thage and at last a war began between them For a long time it was hard to tell which would prove the stronger First the Romans would gain a battle and then the men of Car thage would gain a battle and so the war went on for many years Among the Romans there was a brave general er al named Reg u lus a man of whom it was said that he never broke his word It so happened after a while that Reg u lus was taken pris on er and carried to Carthage Ill and very lonely he dreamed of his wife and little children so far away beyond the sea and he had but little hope of ever seeing them again He loved his home dearly but he believed that his first duty was to his country and so he had left all to fight in this cruel war He had lost a battle it is true and had been taken prisoner Yet he knew that the Romans were gaining ground and the people of Carthage were afraid of being beaten in the end They had sent into other countries to hire soldiers to help them but even with these they would not be able to fight much longer against Rome One day some of the rulers of Carthage came to the prison to talk with Regulus We should like to make peace with the Roman people they said and we are sure that if your rulers at home knew how the war is going they would be glad to make peace with us We will set you free and let you go home if you will agree to do as we say What is that asked Regulus In the first place they said you must tell the Romans about the battles which you have lost and you must make it plain to them that they have not gained any thing by the war In the second place you must promise us that if they will not make peace you will come back to your prison Very well said Regulus I promise you that if they will not make peace I will come back to prison And so they let him go for they knew that a great Roman would keep his word When he came to Rome all the people greeted him gladly His wife and children were very happy for they thought that now they would not be parted again The white haired Fathers who made the laws for the city came to see him They asked him about the war I was sent from Carthage to ask you to make peace he said But it will not be wise to make peace True we have been beaten in a few battles but our army is gaining ground every day The people of Carthage are afraid and well they may be Keep on with the war a little while longer and Carthage shall be yours As for me I have come to bid my wife and children and Rome fare well To morrow I will start back to Carthage and to prison for I have promised Then the Fathers tried to persuade him to stay Let us send another man in your place they said Shall a Roman not keep his word answered Regulus I am ill and at the best have not long to live I will go back as I promised His wife and little children wept and his sons begged him not to leave them again I have given my word said Regulus The rest will be taken care of Then he bade them good by and went bravely back to the prison and the cruel death which he ex pect ed This was the kind of courage that made Rome the greatest city in the world CORNELIA S JEWELS It was a bright morning in the old city of Rome many hundred years ago In a vine covered summer house in a beautiful garden two boys were standing They were looking at their mother and her friend who were walking among the flowers and trees Did you ever see so handsome a lady as our mother s friend asked the younger boy holding his tall brother s hand She looks like a queen Yet she is not so beautiful as our mother said the elder boy She has a fine dress it is true but her face is not noble and kind It is our mother who is like a queen That is true said the other There is no woman in Rome so much like a queen as our own dear mother Soon Cor ne li a their mother came down the walk to speak with them She was simply dressed in a plain white robe Her arms and feet were bare as was the custom in those days and no rings nor chains glit tered about her hands and neck For her only crown long braids of soft brown hair were coiled about her head and a tender smile lit up her noble face as she looked into her sons proud eyes Boys she said I have something to tell you They bowed before her as Roman lads were taught to do and said What is it mother You are to dine with us to day here in the garden and then our friend is going to show us that wonderful casket of jewels of which you have heard so much The brothers looked shyly at their mother s friend Was it possible that she had still other rings besides those on her fingers Could she have other gems besides those which sparkled in the chains about her neck When the simple out door meal was over a servant brought the casket from the house The lady opened it Ah how those jewels dazzled the eyes of the wondering boys There were ropes of pearls white as milk and smooth as satin heaps of shining rubies red as the glowing coals sap phires as blue as the sky that summer day and di a monds that flashed and sparkled like the sunlight The brothers looked long at the gems Ah whis pered the younger if our mother could only have such beautiful things At last how ever the casket was closed and carried care ful ly away Is it true Cor ne li a that you have no jewels asked her friend Is it true as I have heard it whis pered that you are poor No I am not poor answered Cornelia and as she spoke she drew her two boys to her side for here are my jewels They are worth more than all your gems I am sure that the boys never forgot their mother s pride and love and care and in after years when they had become great men in Rome they often thought of this scene in the garden And the world still likes to hear the story of Cornelia s jewels ANDROCLUS AND THE LION In Rome there was once a poor slave whose name was An dro clus His master was a cruel man and so unkind to him that at last An dro clus ran away He hid himself in a wild wood for many days but there was no food to be found and he grew so weak and sick that he thought he should die So one day he crept into a cave and lay down and soon he was fast asleep After a while a great noise woke him up A lion had come into the cave and was roaring loudly Androclus was very much afraid for he felt sure that the beast would kill him Soon however he saw that the lion was not angry but that he limped as though his foot hurt him Then Androclus grew so bold that he took hold of the lion s lame paw to see what was the matter The lion stood quite still and rubbed his head against the man s shoulder He seemed to say I know that you will help me Androclus lifted the paw from the ground and saw that it was a long sharp thorn which hurt the lion so much He took the end of the thorn in his fingers then he gave a strong quick pull and out it came The lion was full of joy He jumped about like a dog and licked the hands and feet of his new friend Androclus was not at all afraid after this and when night came he and the lion lay down and slept side by side For a long time the lion brought food to Androclus every day and the two became such good friends that Androclus found his new life a very happy one One day some soldiers who were passing through the wood found Androclus in the cave They knew who he was and so took him back to Rome It was the law at that time that every slave who ran away from his master should be made to fight a hungry lion So a fierce lion was shut up for a while without food and a time was set for the fight When the day came thousands of people crowded to see the sport They went to such places at that time very much as people now a days go to see a circus show or a game of base ball The door opened and poor Androclus was brought in He was almost dead with fear for the roars of the lion could al read y be heard He looked up and saw that there was no pity in the thou sands of faces around him Then the hungry lion rushed in With a single bound he reached the poor slave Androclus gave a great cry not of fear but of gladness It was his old friend the lion of the cave The people who had ex pect ed to see the man killed by the lion were filled with wonder They saw Androclus put his arms around the lion s neck they saw the lion lie down at his feet and lick them lov ing ly they saw the great beast rub his head against the slave s face as though he wanted to be petted They could not un der stand what it all meant Illustration Androclus and the Lion After a while they asked Androclus to tell them about it So he stood up before them and with his arm around the lion s neck told how he and the beast had lived together in the cave I am a man he said but no man has ever befriended me This poor lion alone has been kind to me and we love each other as brothers The people were not so bad that they could be cruel to the poor slave now Live and be free they cried Live and be free Others cried Let the lion go free too Give both of them their liberty And so Androclus was set free and the lion was given to him for his own And they lived together in Rome for many years HORATIUS AT THE BRIDGE Once there was a war between the Roman people and the E trus cans who lived in the towns on the other side of the Ti ber River Por se na the King of the E trus cans raised a great army and marched toward Rome The city had never been in so great danger The Romans did not have very many fighting men at that time and they knew that they were not strong enough to meet the Etruscans in open battle So they kept themselves inside of their walls and set guards to watch the roads One morning the army of Por se na was seen coming over the hills from the north There were thousands of horsemen and footmen and they were marching straight toward the wooden bridge which spanned the river at Rome What shall we do said the white haired Fathers who made the laws for the Roman people If they once gain the bridge we cannot hinder them from crossing and then what hope will there be for the town Now among the guards at the bridge there was a brave man named Ho ra ti us He was on the farther side of the river and when he saw that the Etruscans were so near he called out to the Romans who were behind him Hew down the bridge with all the speed that you can he cried I with the two men who stand by me will keep the foe at bay Then with their shields before them and their long spears in their hands the three brave men stood in the road and kept back the horsemen whom Porsena had sent to take the bridge On the bridge the Romans hewed away at the beams and posts Their axes rang the chips flew fast and soon it trembled and was ready to fall Come back come back and save your lives they cried to Ho ra ti us and the two who were with him But just then Porsena s horsemen dashed toward them again Run for your lives said Horatius to his friends I will keep the road They turned and ran back across the bridge They had hardly reached the other side when there was a crashing of beams and timbers The bridge toppled over to one side and then fell with a great splash into the water When Horatius heard the sound he knew that the city was safe With his face still toward Porsena s men he moved slowly back ward till he stood on the river s bank A dart thrown by one of Porsena s soldiers put out his left eye but he did not falter He cast his spear at the fore most horseman and then he turned quickly around He saw the white porch of his own home among the trees on the other side of the stream And he spake to the noble river That rolls by the walls of Rome O Tiber father Tiber To whom the Romans pray A Roman s life a Roman s arms Take thou in charge to day He leaped into the deep swift stream He still had his heavy armor on and when he sank out of sight no one thought that he would ever be seen again But he was a strong man and the best swimmer in Rome The next minute he rose He was half way across the river and safe from the spears and darts which Porsena s soldiers hurled after him Soon he reached the farther side where his friends stood ready to help him Shout after shout greeted him as he climbed upon the bank Then Porsena s men shouted also for they had never seen a man so brave and strong as Horatius He had kept them out of Rome but he had done a deed which they could not help but praise As for the Romans they were very grateful to Horatius for having saved their city They called him Horatius company cles which meant the one eyed Horatius because he had lost an eye in defending the bridge they caused a fine statue of brass to be made in his honor and they gave him as much land as he could plow around in a day And for hundreds of years afterwards With weeping and with laugh ter Still was the story told How well Horatius kept the bridge In the brave days of old JULIUS CAESAR Nearly two thousand years ago there lived in Rome a man whose name was Julius Cae sar He was the greatest of all the Romans Why was he so great He was a brave warrior and had con quered many countries for Rome He was wise in planning and in doing He knew how to make men both love and fear him At last he made himself the ruler of Rome Some said that he wished to become its king But the Romans at that time did not believe in kings Once when Cae sar was passing through a little country village all the men women and children of the place came out to see him There were not more than fifty of them all together and they were led by their may or who told each one what to do These simple people stood by the roadside and watched Caesar pass The may or looked very proud and happy for was he not the ruler of this village He felt that he was almost as great a man as Caesar himself Some of the fine of fi cers who were with Caesar laughed They said See how that fellow struts at the head of his little flock Laugh as you will said Caesar he has reason to be proud I would rather be the head man of a village than the second man in Rome At an oth er time Caesar was crossing a narrow sea in a boat Before he was halfway to the farther shore a storm overtook him The wind blew hard the waves dashed high the lightning flashed the thunder rolled It seemed every minute as though the boat would sink The captain was in great fright He had crossed the sea many times but never in such a storm as this He trembled with fear he could not guide the boat he fell down upon his knees he moaned All is lost all is lost But Caesar was not afraid He bade the man get up and take his oars again Why should you be afraid he said The boat will not be lost for you have Caesar on board THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES There was once a king whose name was Di o nys i us He was so unjust and cruel that he won for himself the name of tyrant He knew that almost everybody hated him and so he was always in dread lest some one should take his life But he was very rich and he lived in a fine palace where there were many beautiful and costly things and he was waited upon by a host of servants who were always ready to do his bidding One day a friend of his whose name was Dam o cles said to him How happy you must be You have here everything that any man could wish Perhaps you would like to change places with me said the tyrant No not that O king said Dam o cles but I think that if I could only have your riches and your pleas ures for one day I should not want any greater hap pi ness Very well said the tyrant You shall have them And so the next day Damocles was led into the palace and all the servants were bidden to treat him as their master He sat down at a table in the banquet hall and rich foods were placed before him Nothing was wanting that could give him pleasure There were costly wines and beautiful flowers and rare perfumes and de light ful music He rested himself among soft cushions and felt that he was the happiest man in all the world Illustration The Sword of Damocles Then he chanced to raise his eyes toward the ceiling What was it that was dangling above him with its point almost touching his head It was a sharp sword and it was hung by only a single horse hair What if the hair should break There was danger every moment that it would do so The smile faded from the lips of Damocles His face became ashy pale His hands trembled He wanted no more food he could drink no more wine he took no more delight in the music He longed to be out of the palace and away he cared not where What is the matter said the tyrant That sword that sword cried Damocles He was so badly frightened that he dared not move Yes said Di o nys i us I know there is a sword above your head and that it may fall at any moment But why should that trouble you I have a sword over my head all the time I am every moment in dread lest something may cause me to lose my life Let me go said Damocles I now see that I was mis tak en and that the rich and pow er ful are not so happy as they seem Let me go back to my old home in the poor little cot tage among the mountains And so long as he lived he never again wanted to be rich or to change places even for a moment with the king DAMON AND PYTHIAS A young man whose name was Pyth i as had done something which the tyrant Dionysius did not like For this offense he was dragged to prison and a day was set when he should be put to death His home was far away and he wanted very much to see his father and mother and friends before he died Only give me leave to go home and say good by to those whom I love he said and then I will come back and give up my life The tyrant laughed at him How can I know that you will keep your promise he said You only want to cheat me and save your self Then a young man whose name was Da mon spoke and said O king put me in prison in place of my friend Pyth i as and let him go to his own country to put his affairs in order and to bid his friends fare well I know that he will come back as he promised for he is a man who has never broken his word But if he is not here on the day which you have set then I will die in his stead The tyrant was sur prised that anybody should make such an offer He at last agreed to let Pythias go and gave orders that the young man Da mon should be shut up in prison Time passed and by and by the day drew near which had been set for Pythias to die and he had not come back The tyrant ordered the jailer to keep close watch upon Damon and not let him escape But Damon did not try to escape He still had faith in the truth and honor of his friend He said If Pythias does not come back in time it will not be his fault It will be because he is hin dered against his will At last the day came and then the very hour Damon was ready to die His trust in his friend was as firm as ever and he said that he did not grieve at having to suffer for one whom he loved so much Then the jailer came to lead him to his death but at the same moment Pythias stood in the door He had been de layed by storms and ship wreck and he had feared that he was too late He greeted Damon kindly and then gave himself into the hands of the jailer He was happy because he thought that he had come in time even though it was at the last moment The tyrant was not so bad but that he could see good in others He felt that men who loved and trusted each other as did Damon and Pythias ought not to suffer un just ly And so he set them both free I would give all my wealth to have one such friend he said A LACONIC ANSWER Many miles beyond Rome there was a famous country which we call Greece The people of Greece were not u nit ed like the Romans but instead there were sev er al states each of which had its own rulers Some of the people in the southern part of the country were called Spar tans and they were noted for their simple habits and their brav er y The name of their land was La company ni a and so they were sometimes called La cons One of the strange rules which the Spartans had was that they should speak briefly and never use more words than were needed And so a short answer is often spoken of as being la con ic that is as being such an answer as a Lacon would be likely to give There was in the northern part of Greece a land called Mac e don and this land was at one time ruled over by a war like king named Philip Philip of Mac e don wanted to become the master of all Greece So he raised a great army and made war upon the other states until nearly all of them were forced to call him their king Then he sent a letter to the Spartans in La company ni a and said If I go down into your country I will level your great city to the ground In a few days an answer was brought back to him When he opened the letter he found only one word written there That word was IF It was as much as to say We are not afraid of you so long as the little word if stands in your way THE UNGRATEFUL GUEST Among the soldiers of King Philip there was a poor man who had done some brave deeds He had pleased the king in more ways than one and so the king put a good deal of trust in him One day this soldier was on board of a ship at sea when a great storm came up The winds drove the ship upon the rocks and it was wrecked The soldier was cast half drowned upon the shore and he would have died there had it not been for the kind care of a farmer who lived close by Illustration When the soldier was well enough to go home he thanked the farmer for what he had done and promised that he would repay him for his kindness But he did not mean to keep his promise He did not tell King Philip about the man who had saved his life He only said that there was a fine farm by the seashore and that he would like very much to have it for his own Would the king give it to him Who owns the farm now asked Philip Only a churlish farmer who has never done anything for his country said the soldier Very well then said Philip You have served me for a long time and you shall have your wish Go and take the farm for yourself And so the soldier made haste to drive the farmer from his house and home He took the farm for his own The poor farmer was stung to the heart by such treat ment He went boldly to the king and told the whole story from beginning to end King Philip was very angry when he learned that the man whom he had trusted had done so base a deed He sent for the soldier in great haste and when he had come he caused these words to be burned in his forehead THE UNGRATEFUL GUEST Thus all the world was made to know of the mean act by which the soldier had tried to enrich himself and from that day until he died all men shunned and hated him ALEXANDER AND BUCEPHALUS One day King Philip bought a fine horse called Bu ceph a lus He was a noble an i mal and the king paid a very high price for him But he was wild and savage and no man could mount him or do anything at all with him They tried to whip him but that only made him worse At last the king bade his servants take him away It is a pity to ruin so fine a horse as that said Al ex an der the king s young son Those men do not know how to treat him Perhaps you can do better than they said his father scorn ful ly I know said Al ex an der that if you would only give me leave to try I could manage this horse better than any one else And if you fail to do so what then asked Philip I will pay you the price of the horse said the lad While everybody was laughing Alexander ran up to Bu ceph a lus and turned his head toward the sun He had noticed that the horse was afraid of his own shadow He then spoke gently to the horse and patted him with his hand When he had qui et ed him a little he made a quick spring and leaped upon the horse s back Everybody expected to see the boy killed outright But he kept his place and let the horse run as fast as he would By and by when Bucephalus had become tired Alexander reined him in and rode back to the place where his father was standing All the men who were there shouted when they saw that the boy had proved himself to be the master of the horse He leaped to the ground and his father ran and kissed him My son said the king Macedon is too small a place for you You must seek a larger kingdom that will be worthy of you After that Alexander and Bucephalus were the best of friends They were said to be always together for when one of them was seen the other was sure to be not far away But the horse would never allow any one to mount him but his master Alexander became the most famous king and warrior that was ever known and for that reason he is always called Alexander the Great Bucephalus carried him through many countries and in many fierce battles and more than once did he save his master s life DIOGENES THE WISE MAN At Cor inth in Greece there lived a very wise man whose name was Di og e nes Men came from all parts of the land to see him and hear him talk But wise as he was he had some very queer ways He did not believe that any man ought to have more things than he re al ly needed and he said that no man needed much And so he did not live in a house but slept in a tub or barrel which he rolled about from place to place He spent his days sitting in the sun and saying wise things to those who were around him At noon one day Di og e nes was seen walking through the streets with a lighted lantern and looking all around as if in search of something Why do you carry a lantern when the sun is shining some one said I am looking for an honest man answered Diogenes When Alexander the Great went to Cor inth all the fore most men in the city came out to see him and to praise him But Diogenes did not come and he was the only man for whose o pin ions Alexander cared Illustration Diogenes and Alexander And so since the wise man would not come to see the king the king went to see the wise man He found Diogenes in an out of the way place lying on the ground by his tub He was en joy ing the heat and the light of the sun When he saw the king and a great many people coming he sat up and looked at Alexander Alexander greeted him and said Diogenes I have heard a great deal about your wisdom Is there anything that I can do for you Yes said Diogenes You can stand a little on one side so as not to keep the sunshine from me This answer was so dif fer ent from what he expected that the king was much sur prised But it did not make him angry it only made him admire the strange man all the more When he turned to ride back he said to his officers Say what you will if I were not Alexander I would like to be Diogenes THE BRAVE THREE HUNDRED All Greece was in danger A mighty army led by the great King of Persia had come from the east It was marching along the seashore and in a few days would be in Greece The great king had sent mes sen gers into every city and state bidding them give him water and earth in token that the land and the sea were his But they said No we will be free And so there was a great stir through out all the land The men armed themselves and made haste to go out and drive back their foe and the women staid at home weeping and waiting and trembling with fear There was only one way by which the Per sian army could go into Greece on that side and that was by a narrow pass between the mountains and the sea This pass was guarded by Le on i das the King of the Spartans with three hundred Spartan soldiers Soon the Persian soldiers were seen coming There were so many of them that no man could count them How could a handful of men hope to stand against so great a host And yet Le on i das and his Spartans held their ground They had made up their minds to die at their post Some one brought them word that there were so many Persians that their arrows dark ened the sun So much the better said the Spartans we shall fight in the shade Bravely they stood in the narrow pass Bravely they faced their foes To Spartans there was no such thing as fear The Persians came forward only to meet death at the points of their spears But one by one the Spartans fell At last their spears were broken yet still they stood side by side fighting to the last Some fought with swords some with daggers and some with only their fists and teeth All day long the army of the Persians was kept at bay But when the sun went down there was not one Spartan left alive Where they had stood there was only a heap of the slain all bristled over with spears and arrows Twenty thousand Persian soldiers had fallen before that handful of men And Greece was saved Thousands of years have passed since then but men still like to tell the story of Leonidas and the brave three hundred who died for their country s sake SOCRATES AND HIS HOUSE There once lived in Greece a very wise man whose name was Soc ra tes Young men from all parts of the land went to him to learn wisdom from him and he said so many pleasant things and said them in so delightful a way that no one ever grew tired of listening to him One summer he built himself a house but it was so small that his neighbors wondered how he could be content with it What is the reason said they that you who are so great a man should build such a little box as this for your dwelling house Indeed there may be little reason said he but small as the place is I shall think myself happy if I can fill even it with true friends THE KING AND HIS HAWK general ghis Khan was a great king and war rior He led his army into China and Persia and he con quered many lands In every country men told about his daring deeds and they said that since Alexander the Great there had been no king like him One morning when he was home from the wars he rode out into the woods to have a day s sport Many of his friends were with him They rode out gayly carrying their bows and arrows Behind them came the servants with the hounds It was a merry hunting party The woods rang with their shouts and laughter They expected to carry much game home in the evening On the king s wrist sat his favorite hawk for in those days hawks were trained to hunt At a word from their masters they would fly high up into the air and look around for prey If they chanced to see a deer or a rabbit they would swoop down upon it swift as any arrow All day long general ghis Khan and his huntsmen rode through the woods But they did not find as much game as they expected Toward evening they started for home The king had often ridden through the woods and he knew all the paths So while the rest of the party took the nearest way he went by a longer road through a valley between two mountains The day had been warm and the king was very thirsty His pet hawk had left his wrist and flown away It would be sure to find its way home The king rode slowly along He had once seen a spring of clear water near this path way If he could only find it now But the hot days of summer had dried up all the moun tain brooks At last to his joy he saw some water tric kling down over the edge of a rock He knew that there was a spring farther up In the wet season a swift stream of water always poured down here but now it came only one drop at a time The king leaped from his horse He took a little silver cup from his hunting bag He held it so as to catch the slowly falling drops It took a long time to fill the cup and the king was so thirsty that he could hardly wait At last it was nearly full He put the cup to his lips and was about to drink All at once there was a whir ring sound in the air and the cup was knocked from his hands The water was all spilled upon the ground The king looked up to see who had done this thing It was his pet hawk The hawk flew back and forth a few times and then alighted among the rocks by the spring The king picked up the cup and again held it to catch the tric kling drops This time he did not wait so long When the cup was half full he lifted it toward his mouth But before it had touched his lips the hawk swooped down again and knocked it from his hands And now the king began to grow angry He tried again and for the third time the hawk kept him from drinking The king was now very angry indeed How do you dare to act so he cried If I had you in my hands I would wring your neck Then he filled the cup again But before he tried to drink he drew his sword Now Sir Hawk he said this is the last time He had hardly spoken before the hawk swooped down and knocked the cup from his hand But the king was looking for this With a quick sweep of the sword he struck the bird as it passed The next moment the poor hawk lay bleeding and dying at its master s feet That is what you get for your pains said Genghis Khan But when he looked for his cup he found that it had fallen between two rocks where he could not reach it At any rate I will have a drink from that spring he said to himself With that he began to climb the steep bank to the place from which the water trickled It was hard work and the higher he climbed the thirst i er he became At last he reached the place There indeed was a pool of water but what was that lying in the pool and almost filling it It was a huge dead snake of the most poi son ous kind The king stopped He forgot his thirst He thought only of the poor dead bird lying on the ground below him Illustration The hawk saved my life he cried and how did I repay him He was my best friend and I have killed him He clam bered down the bank He took the bird up gently and laid it in his hunting bag Then he mounted his horse and rode swiftly home He said to himself I have learned a sad lesson to day and that is never to do any thing in anger DOCTOR GOLDSMITH There was once a kind man whose name was Oliver Gold smith He wrote many de light ful books some of which you will read when you are older He had a gentle heart He was always ready to help others and to share with them anything that he had He gave away so much to the poor that he was always poor himself He was some times called Doctor Goldsmith for he had studied to be a phy si cian One day a poor woman asked Doctor Goldsmith to go and see her husband who was sick and could not eat Goldsmith did so He found that the family was in great need The man had not had work for a long time He was not sick but in distress and as for eating there was no food in the house Call at my room this evening said Goldsmith to the woman and I will give you some med i cine for your husband In the evening the woman called Goldsmith gave her a little paper box that was very heavy Here is the med i cine he said Use it faith ful ly and I think it will do your husband a great deal of good But don t open the box until you reach home What are the di rec tions for taking it asked the woman You will find them inside of the box he answered When the woman reached her home she sat down by her husband s side and they opened the box What do you think they found in it It was full of pieces of money And on the top were the di rec tions TO BE TAKEN AS OFTEN AS NE CES SI TY REQUIRES Goldsmith had given them all the ready money that he had THE KINGDOMS There was once a king of Prussia whose name was Frederick William On a fine morning in June he went out alone to walk in the green woods He was tired of the noise of the city and he was glad to get away from it So as he walked among the trees he often stopped to listen to the singing birds or to look at the wild flowers that grew on every side Now and then he stooped to pluck a violet or a primrose or a yellow but ter cup Soon his hands were full of pretty blossoms After a while he came to a little meadow in the midst of the wood Some children were playing there They were running here and there and gathering the cow slips that were blooming among the grass It made the king glad to see the happy children and hear their merry voices He stood still for some time and watched them as they played Then he called them around him and all sat down to geth er in the pleasant shade The children did not know who the strange gentleman was but they liked his kind face and gentle manners Now my little folks said the king I want to ask you some ques tions and the child who gives the best answer shall have a prize Then he held up an orange so that all the children could see You know that we all live in the king dom of Prussia he said but tell me to what king dom does this orange belong Illustration The children were puz zled They looked at one another and sat very still for a little while Then a brave bright boy spoke up and said It belongs to the veg e ta ble kingdom sir Why so my lad asked the king It is the fruit of a plant and all plants belong to that kingdom said the boy The king was pleased You are quite right he said and you shall have the orange for your prize He tossed it gayly to the boy Catch it if you can he said Then he took a yellow gold piece from his pocket and held it up so that it glit tered in the sunlight Now to what kingdom does this belong he asked Another bright boy answered quick ly To the min er al kingdom sir All metals belong to that kingdom That is a good answer said the king The gold piece is your prize The children were de light ed With eager faces they waited to hear what the stranger would say next I will ask you only one more question said the king and it is an easy one Then he stood up and said Tell me my little folks to what kingdom do I belong The bright boys were puz zled now Some thought of saying To the kingdom of Prussia Some wanted to say To the animal kingdom But they were a little afraid and all kept still At last a tiny blue eyed child looked up into the king s smiling face and said in her simple way I think to the kingdom of heaven King Frederick William stooped down and lifted the little maiden in his arms Tears were in his eyes as he kissed her and said So be it my child So be it THE BARMECIDE FEAST There was once a rich old man who was called the Bar me cide He lived in a beautiful palace in the midst of flowery gardens He had every thing that heart could wish In the same land there was a poor man whose name was Schac a bac His clothing was rags and his food was the scraps which other people had thrown away But he had a light heart and was as happy as a king Once when Schac a bac had not had anything to eat for a long time he thought that he would go and ask the Bar me cide to help him The servant at the door said Come in and talk with our master He will not send you away hungry Schacabac went in and passed through many beautiful rooms looking for the Barmecide At last he came to a grand hall where there were soft carpets on the floor and fine pictures on the walls and pleasant couches to lie down upon At the upper end of the room he saw a noble man with a long white beard It was the Barmecide and poor Schacabac bowed low before him as was the custom in that country The Barmecide spoke very kindly and asked what was wanted Schacabac told him about all his troubles and said that it was now two days since he had tasted bread Is it possible said the Barmecide You must be almost dead with hunger and here I have plenty and to spare Then he turned and called Ho boy Bring in the water to wash our hands and then order the cook to hurry the supper Schacabac had not expected to be treated so kindly He began to thank the rich man Say not a word said the Barmecide but let us get ready for the feast Then the rich man began to rub his hands as though some one was pouring water on them Come and wash with me he said Schacabac saw no boy nor basin nor water But he thought that he ought to do as he was bidden and so like the Barmecide he made a pretense of washing Come now said the Barmecide let us have supper He sat down as if to a table and pre tend ed to be carving a roast Then he said Help yourself my good friend You said you were hungry so now don t be afraid of the food Schacabac thought that he un der stood the joke and he made pretense of taking food and passing it to his mouth Then he began to chew and said You see sir I lose no time Boy said the old man bring on the roast goose Now my good friend try this choice piece from the breast And here are sweet sauce honey raisins green peas and dry figs Help yourself and remember that other good things are coming Schacabac was almost dead with hunger but he was too polite not to do as he was bidden Come said the Barmecide have another piece of the roast lamb Did you ever eat anything so de li cious Never in my life said Schacabac Your table is full of good things Then eat heartily said the Barmecide You cannot please me better After this came the des sert The Barmecide spoke of sweet meats and fruits and Schacabac made believe that he was eating them Now is there anything else that you would like asked the host Ah no said poor Schacabac I have indeed had great plenty Let us drink then said the Barmecide Boy bring on the wine Excuse me my lord said Schacabac I will drink no wine for it is for bid den The Barmecide seized him by the hand I have long wished to find a man like you he said But come now we will sup in earnest He clapped his hands Servants came and he ordered supper Soon they sat down to a table loaded with the very dishes of which they had pre tend ed to eat Poor Schacabac had never had so good a meal in all his life When they had fin ished and the table had been cleared away the Barmecide said I have found you to be a man of good un der stand ing Your wits are quick and you are ready always to make the best of everything Come and live with me and manage my house And so Schacabac lived with the Barmecide many years and never again knew what it was to be hungry THE ENDLESS TALE In the Far East there was a great king who had no work to do Every day and all day long he sat on soft cush ions and lis tened to stories And no matter what the story was about he never grew tired of hearing it even though it was very long There is only one fault that I find with your story he often said it is too short All the story tellers in the world were in vit ed to his palace and some of them told tales that were very long indeed But the king was always sad when a story was ended At last he sent word into every city and town and country place offering a prize to any one who should tell him an endless tale He said To the man that will tell me a story which shall last forever I will give my fairest daugh ter for his wife and I will make him my heir and he shall be king after me But this was not all He added a very hard con di tion If any man shall try to tell such a story and then fail he shall have his head cut off The king s daughter was very pretty and there were many young men in that country who were willing to do anything to win her But none of them wanted to lose their heads and so only a few tried for the prize One young man invented a story that lasted three months but at the end of that time he could think of nothing more His fate was a warning to others and it was a long time before another story teller was so rash as to try the king s patience But one day a stran ger from the South came into the palace Great king he said is it true that you offer a prize to the man who can tell a story that has no end It is true said the king And shall this man have your fairest daughter for his wife and shall he be your heir Yes if he suc ceeds said the king But if he fails he shall lose his head Very well then said the stran ger I have a pleasant story about locusts which I would like to relate Tell it said the king I will listen to you The story teller began his tale Once upon a time a certain king seized upon all the corn in his country and stored it away in a strong gran a ry But a swarm of locusts came over the land and saw where the grain had been put After search ing for many days they found on the east side of the gran a ry a crev ice that was just large enough for one locust to pass through at a time So one locust went in and carried away a grain of corn then another locust went in and carried away a grain of corn then another locust went in and carried away a grain of corn Day after day week after week the man kept on saying Then another locust went in and carried away a grain of corn A month passed a year passed At the end of two years the king said How much longer will the locusts be going in and carrying away corn O king said the story teller they have as yet cleared only one cubit and there are many thousand cubits in the granary Man man cried the king you will drive me mad I can listen to it no longer Take my daughter be my heir rule my kingdom But do not let me hear another word about those horrible locusts And so the strange story teller married the king s daughter And he lived happily in the land for many years But his father in law the king did not care to listen to any more stories THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT There were once six blind men who stood by the road side every day and begged from the people who passed They had often heard of el e phants but they had never seen one for being blind how could they It so happened one morning that an el e phant was driven down the road where they stood When they were told that the great beast was before them they asked the driver to let him stop so that they might see him Of course they could not see him with their eyes but they thought that by touching him they could learn just what kind of animal he was The first one happened to put his hand on the elephant s side Well well he said now I know all about this beast He is ex act ly like a wall The second felt only of the elephant s tusk My brother he said you are mistaken He is not at all like a wall He is round and smooth and sharp He is more like a spear than anything else The third happened to take hold of the elephant s trunk Both of you are wrong he said Anybody who knows anything can see that this elephant is like a snake The fourth reached out his arms and grasped one of the elephant s legs Oh how blind you are he said It is very plain to me that he is round and tall like a tree The fifth was a very tall man and he chanced to take hold of the elephant s ear The blind est man ought to know that this beast is not like any of the things that you name he said He is ex act ly like a huge fan The sixth was very blind indeed and it was some time before he could find the elephant at all At last he seized the animal s tail O foolish fellows he cried You surely have lost your senses This elephant is not like a wall or a spear or a snake or a tree neither is he like a fan But any man with a par ti cle of sense can see that he is exactly like a rope Then the elephant moved on and the six blind men sat by the roadside all day and quar reled about him Each believed that he knew just how the animal looked and each called the others hard names because they did not agree with him People who have eyes sometimes act as foolishly MAXIMILIAN AND THE GOOSE BOY One summer day King Max i mil ian of Ba va ri a was walking in the country The sun shone hot and he stopped under a tree to rest It was very pleasant in the cool shade The king lay down on the soft grass and looked up at the white clouds sailing across the sky Then he took a little book from his pocket and tried to read But the king could not keep his mind on his book Soon his eyes closed and he was fast asleep It was past noon when he awoke He got up from his grassy bed and looked around Then he took his cane in his hand and started for home When he had walked a mile or more he happened to think of his book He felt for it in his pocket It was not there He had left it under the tree The king was already quite tired and he did not like to walk back so far But he did not wish to lose the book What should he do If there was only some one to send for it While he was thinking he happened to see a little bare foot ed boy in the open field near the road He was tending a large flock of geese that were picking the short grass and wading in a shallow brook The king went toward the boy He held a gold piece in his hand My boy he said how would you like to have this piece of money I would like it said the boy but I never hope to have so much You shall have it if you will run back to the oak tree at the second turning of the road and fetch me the book that I left there The king thought that the boy would be pleased But not so He turned away and said I am not so silly as you think What do you mean said the king Who says that you are silly Well said the boy you think that I am silly enough to believe that you will give me that gold piece for running a mile and fetch ing you a book You can t catch me But if I give it to you now perhaps you will believe me said the king and he put the gold piece into the little fellow s hand The boy s eyes spar kled but he did not move What is the matter now said the king Won t you go The boy said I would like to go but I can t leave the geese They will stray away and then I shall be blamed for it Illustration Crack the whip Oh I will tend them while you are away said the king The boy laughed I should like to see you tending them he said Why they would run away from you in a minute Only let me try said the king At last the boy gave the king his whip and started off He had gone but a little way when he turned and came back What is the matter now said Max i mil ian Crack the whip The king tried to do as he was bidden but he could not make a sound I thought as much said the boy You don t know how to do anything Then he took the whip and gave the king lessons in whip cracking Now you see how it is done he said as he handed it back If the geese try to run away crack it loud The king laughed He did his best to learn his lesson and soon the boy again started off on his errand Maximilian sat down on a stone and laughed at the thought of being a goose herd But the geese missed their master at once With a great cac kling and hissing they went half flying half running across the meadow The king ran after them but he could not run fast He tried to crack the whip but it was of no use The geese were soon far away What was worse they had gotten into a garden and were feeding on the tender veg e ta bles A few minutes after ward the goose boy came back with the book Just as I thought he said I have found the book and you have lost the geese Never mind said the king I will help you get them again Well then run around that way and stand by the brook while I drive them out of the garden The king did as he was told The boy ran forward with his whip and after a great deal of shouting and scolding the geese were driven back into the meadow I hope you will pardon me for not being a better goose herd said Maximilian but as I am a king I am not used to such work A king indeed said the boy I was very silly to leave the geese with you But I am not so silly as to believe that you are a king Very well said Maximilian with a smile here is another gold piece and now let us be friends The boy took the gold and thanked the giver He looked up into the king s face and said You are a very kind man and I think you might be a good king but if you were to try all your life you would never be a good gooseherd THE INCHCAPE ROCK In the North Sea there is a great rock called the Inch cape Rock It is twelve miles from any land and is covered most of the time with water Many boats and ships have been wrecked on that rock for it is so near the top of the water that no vessel can sail over it without striking it More than a hundred years ago there lived not far away a kind heart ed man who was called the Abbot of Ab er broth ock It is a pity he said that so many brave sailors should lose their lives on that hidden rock So the abbot caused a buoy to be fastened to the rock The buoy floated back and forth in the shallow water A strong chain kept it from floating away On the top of the buoy the abbot placed a bell and when the waves dashed against it the bell would ring out loud and clear Sailors now were no longer afraid to cross the sea at that place When they heard the bell ringing they knew just where the rock was and they steered their vessels around it God bless the good Abbot of Ab er broth ock they all said One calm summer day a ship with a black flag happened to sail not far from the Inch cape Rock The ship belonged to a sea robber called Ralph the Rover and she was a terror to all honest people both on sea and shore There was but little wind that day and the sea was as smooth as glass The ship stood almost still there was hardly a breath of air to fill her sails Ralph the Rover was walking on the deck He looked out upon the glassy sea He saw the buoy floating above the Inchcape Rock It looked like a big black speck upon the water But the bell was not ringing that day There were no waves to set it in motion Boys cried Ralph the Rover put out the boat and row me to the Inchcape Rock We will play a trick on the old abbot The boat was low ered Strong arms soon rowed it to the Inchcape Rock Then the robber with a heavy ax broke the chain that held the buoy He cut the fas ten ings of the bell It fell into the water There was a gur gling sound as it sank out of sight The next one that comes this way will not bless the abbot said Ralph the Rover Soon a breeze sprang up and the black ship sailed away The sea robber laughed as he looked back and saw that there was nothing to mark the place of the hidden rock For many days Ralph the Rover scoured the seas and many were the ships that he plun dered At last he chanced to sail back toward the place from which he had started The wind had blown hard all day The waves rolled high The ship was moving swiftly But in the evening the wind died away and a thick fog came on Ralph the Rover walked the deck He could not see where the ship was going If the fog would only clear away he said I thought I heard the roar of breakers said the pilot We must be near the shore I cannot tell said Ralph the Rover but I think we are not far from the Inchcape Rock I wish we could hear the good abbot s bell The next moment there was a great crash It is the Inchcape Rock the sailors cried as the ship gave a lurch to one side and began to sink Oh what a wretch am I cried Ralph the Rover This is what comes of the joke that I played on the good abbot What was it that he heard as the waves rushed over him Was it the abbot s bell ringing for him far down at the bottom of the sea WHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT I THE CITY There was once a little boy whose name was Richard Whit ting ton but everybody called him Dick His father and mother had died when he was only a babe and the people who had the care of him were very poor Dick was not old enough to work and so he had a hard time of it indeed Sometimes he had no break fast and sometimes he had no dinner and he was glad at any time to get a crust of bread or a drop of milk Now in the town where Dick lived the people liked to talk about London None of them had ever been to the great city but they seemed to know all about the wonderful things which were to be seen there They said that all the folks who lived in London were fine general tle men and ladies that there was singing and music there all day long that nobody was ever hungry there and nobody had to work and that the streets were all paved with gold Dick listened to these stories and wished that he could go to London One day a big wagon drawn by eight horses all with bells on their heads drove into the little town Dick saw the wagon standing by the inn and he thought that it must be going to the fine city of London When the driver came out and was ready to start the lad ran up and asked him if he might walk by the side of the wagon The driver asked him some questions and when he learned how poor Dick was and that he had neither father nor mother he told him that he might do as he liked It was a long walk for the little lad but by and by he came to the city of London He was in such a hurry to see the wonderful sights that he forgot to thank the driver of the wagon He ran as fast as he could from one street to another trying to find those that were paved with gold He had once seen a piece of money that was gold and he knew that it would buy a great great many things and now he thought that if he could get only a little bit of the pave ment he would have everything that he wanted Poor Dick ran till he was so tired that he could run no farther It was growing dark and in every street there was only dirt instead of gold He sat down in a dark corner and cried himself to sleep When he woke up the next morning he was very hungry but there was not even a crust of bread for him to eat He forgot all about the golden pavements and thought only of food He walked about from one street to another and at last grew so hungry that he began to ask those whom he met to give him a penny to buy something to eat Go to work you idle fellow said some of them and the rest passed him by without even looking at him I wish I could go to work said Dick II THE KITCHEN By and by Dick grew so faint and tired that he could go no farther He sat down by the door of a fine house and wished that he was back again in the little town where he was born The cook maid who was just getting dinner saw him and called out What are you doing there you little beggar If you don t get away quick I ll throw a panful of hot dish water over you Then I guess you will jump Just at that time the master of the house whose name was mister Fitz war ren came home to dinner When he saw the ragged little fellow at his door he said My lad what are you doing here I am afraid you are a lazy fellow and that you want to live without work No indeed said Dick I would like to work if I could find anything to do But I do not know anybody in this town and I have not had anything to eat for a long time Poor little fellow said mister Fitz war ren Come in and I will see what I can do for you And he ordered the cook to give the lad a good dinner and then to find some light work for him to do Little Dick would have been very happy in the new home which he had thus found if it had not been for the cross cook She would often say You are my boy now and so you must do as I tell you Look sharp there Make the fires carry out the ashes wash these dishes sweep the floor bring in the wood Oh what a lazy fellow you are And then she would box his ears or beat him with the broom stick At last little Alice his master s daughter saw how he was treated and she told the cook she would be turned off if she was not kinder to the lad After that Dick had an eas i er time of it but his troubles were not over yet by any means His bed was in a garret at the top of the house far away from the rooms where the other people slept There were many holes in the floor and walls and every night a great number of rats and mice came in They tor ment ed Dick so much that he did not know what to do One day a gentleman gave him a penny for cleaning his shoes and he made up his mind that he would buy a cat with it The very next morning he met a girl who was car ry ing a cat in her arms I will give you a penny for that cat he said All right the girl said You may have her and you will find that she is a good mouser too Dick hid his cat in the garret and every day he carried a part of his dinner to her It was not long before she had driven all the rats and mice away and then Dick could sleep soundly every night III THE VENTURE Some time after that a ship that belonged to mister Fitzwarren was about to start on a voyage across the sea It was loaded with goods which were to be sold in lands far away mister Fitzwarren wanted to give his servants a chance for good fortune too and so he called all of them into the parlor and asked if they had anything they would like to send out in the ship for trade Every one had something to send every one but Dick and as he had neither money nor goods he staid in the kitchen and did not come in with the rest Little Alice guessed why he did not come and so she said to her papa Poor Dick ought to have a chance too Here is some money out of my own purse that you may put in for him No no my child said mister Fitzwarren He must risk something of his own And then he called very loud Here Dick What are you going to send out on the ship Dick heard him and came into the room I have nothing in the world he said but a cat which I bought some time ago for a penny Fetch your cat then my lad said mister Fitzwarren and let her go out Who knows but that she will bring you some profit Dick with tears in his eyes carried poor puss down to the ship and gave her to the captain Everybody laughed at his queer venture but little Alice felt sorry for him and gave him money to buy another cat Illustration After that the cook was worse than before She made fun of him for sending his cat to sea Do you think she would say that puss will sell for enough money to buy a stick to beat you At last Dick could not stand her abuse any longer and he made up his mind to go back to his old home in the little country town So very early in the morning on All hal lows Day he started He walked as far as the place called Hol lo way and there he sat down on a stone which to this day is called Whit ting ton s Stone As he sat there very sad and wondering which way he should go he heard the bells on Bow Church far away ringing out a merry chime He listened They seemed to say to him Turn again Whittington Thrice Lord Mayor of London Well well he said to himself I would put up with almost anything to be Lord Mayor of London when I am a man and to ride in a fine coach I think I will go back and let the old cook cuff and scold as much as she pleases Dick did go back and he was lucky enough to get into the kitchen and set about his work before the cook came down stairs to get break fast IV THE CAT mister Fitzwarren s ship made a long voyage and at last reached a strange land on the other side of the sea The people had never seen any white men before and they came in great crowds to buy the fine things with which the ship was loaded The captain wanted very much to trade with the king of the country and it was not long before the king sent word for him to come to the palace and see him The captain did so He was shown into a beautiful room and given a seat on a rich carpet all flow ered with silver and gold The king and queen were seated not far away and soon a number of dishes were brought in for dinner They had hardly begun to eat when an army of rats and mice rushed in and de voured all the meat before any one could hinder them The captain wondered at this and asked if it was not very un pleas ant to have so many rats and mice about Oh yes was the answer It is indeed un pleas ant and the king would give half his treas ure if he could get rid of them The captain jumped for joy He remembered the cat which little Whittington had sent out and he told the king that he had a little creature on board his ship which would make short work of the pests Then it was the king s turn to jump for joy and he jumped so high that his yellow cap or turban dropped off his head Bring the creature to me he said If she will do what you say I will load your ship with gold The captain made believe that he would be very sorry to part with the cat but at last he went down to the ship to get her while the king and queen made haste to have another dinner made ready The captain with puss under his arm reached the palace just in time to see the table crowded with rats The cat leaped out upon them and oh what havoc she did make among the trou ble some creatures Most of them were soon stretched dead upon the floor while the rest scam pered away to their holes and did not dare to come out again The king had never been so glad in his life and the queen asked that the creature which had done such wonders should be brought to her The captain called Pussy pussy pussy and the cat came up and rubbed against his legs He picked her up and offered her to the queen but at first the queen was afraid to touch her However the captain stroked the cat and called Pussy pussy pussy and then the queen ventured to touch her She could only say Putty putty putty for she had not learned to talk English The captain then put the cat down on the queen s lap where she purred and purred until she went to sleep The king would not have missed getting the cat now for the world He at once made a bargain with the captain for all the goods on board the ship and then he gave him ten times as much for the cat as all the rest came to The captain was very glad He bade the king and queen good by and the very next day set sail for England V THE FORTUNE One morning mister Fitzwarren was sitting at his desk in his office He heard some one tap softly at his door and he said Who s there A friend was the answer I have come to bring you news of your ship U ni corn mister Fitzwarren jumped up quickly and opened the door Whom should he see waiting there but the captain with a bill of lading in one hand and a box of jewels in the other He was so full of joy that he lifted up his eyes and thanked Heaven for sending him such good fortune The captain soon told the story of the cat and then he showed the rich present which the king and queen had sent to poor Dick in payment for her As soon as the good gentleman heard this he called out to his servants Go send him in and tell him of his fame Pray call him mister Whittington by name Some of the men who stood by said that so great a present ought not to be given to a mere boy but mister Fitzwarren frowned upon them It is his own he said and I will not hold back one penny from him Dick was scouring the pots when word was brought to him that he should go to the office Oh I am so dirty he said and my shoes are full of hob nails But he was told to make haste mister Fitzwarren ordered a chair to be set for him and then the lad began to think that they were making fun of him I beg that you won t play tricks with a poor boy like me he said Please let me go back to my work mister Whittington said mister Fitzwarren this is no joke at all The captain has sold your cat and has brought you in return for her more riches than I have in the whole world Then he opened the box of jewels and showed Dick his treasures The poor boy did not know what to do He begged his master to take a part of it but mister Fitzwarren said No it is all your own and I feel sure that you will make good use of it Dick then offered some of his jewels to his mistress and little Alice They thanked him and told him that they felt great joy at his good luck but wished him to keep his riches for himself Illustration But he was too kind heart ed to keep everything for himself He gave nice presents to the cap tain and the sailors and to the servants in mister Fitz warren s house He even remembered the cross old cook After that Whittington s face was washed and his hair curled and he was dressed in a nice suit of clothes and then he was as handsome a young man as ever walked the streets of London Some time after that there was a fine wedding at the finest church in London and Miss Alice became the wife of mister Richard Whittington And the lord mayor was there and the great judges and the sher iffs and many rich mer chants and everybody was very happy And Richard Whittington became a great merchant and was one of the foremost men in London He was sheriff of the city and thrice lord mayor and King Henry V made him a knight He built the famous prison of New gate in London On the arch way in front of the prison was a figure cut in stone of Sir Richard Whittington and his cat and for three hundred years this figure was shown to all who visited London CASABIANCA There was a great battle at sea One could hear nothing but the roar of the big guns The air was filled with black smoke The water was strewn with broken masts and pieces of timber which the cannon balls had knocked from the ships Many men had been killed and many more had been wounded The flag ship had taken fire The flames were breaking out from below The deck was all ablaze The men who were left alive made haste to launch a small boat They leaped into it and rowed swiftly away Any other place was safer now than on board of that burning ship There was powder in the hold But the captain s son young Ca sa bi an ca still stood upon the deck The flames were almost all around him now but he would not stir from his post His father had bidden him stand there and he had been taught always to obey He trusted in his father s word and be lieved that when the right time came he would tell him to go He saw the men leap into the boat He heard them call to him to come He shook his head When father bids me I will go he said And now the flames were leaping up the masts The sails were all ablaze The fire blew hot upon his cheek It scorched his hair It was before him behind him all around him O father he cried may I not go now The men have all left the ship Is it not time that we too should leave it He did not know that his father was lying in the burning cabin below that a cannon ball had struck him dead at the very be gin ning of the fight He listened to hear his answer Speak louder father he cried I cannot hear what you say Above the roaring of the flames above the crashing of the falling spars above the booming of the guns he fancied that his father s voice came faintly to him through the scorching air I am here father Speak once again he gasped But what is that A great flash of light fills the air clouds of smoke shoot quickly upward to the sky and Boom Oh what a ter rif ic sound Louder than thunder louder than the roar of all the guns The air quivers the sea itself trembles the sky is black The blazing ship is seen no more There was powder in the hold A long time ago a lady whose name was missus Hemans wrote a poem about this brave boy Ca sa bi an ca It is not a very well written poem and yet everybody has read it and thousands of people have learned it by heart I doubt not but that some day you too will read it It begins in this way The boy stood on the burning deck Whence all but him had fled The flame that lit the battle s wreck Shone round him o er the dead Yet beautiful and bright he stood As born to rule the storm A creature of heroic blood A proud though childlike form ANTONIO CANOVA A good many years ago there lived in Italy a little boy whose name was An to ni o Ca no va He lived with his grand fa ther for his own father was dead His grand fa ther was a stone cut ter and he was very poor An to ni o was a puny lad and not strong enough to work He did not care to play with the other boys of the town But he liked to go with his grandfather to the stone yard While the old man was busy cutting and trimming the great blocks of stone the lad would play among the chips Sometimes he would make a little statue of soft clay sometimes he would take hammer and chisel and try to cut a statue from a piece of rock He showed so much skill that his grandfather was de light ed The boy will be a sculp tor some day he said Then when they went home in the evening the grand moth er would say What have you been doing to day my little sculp tor And she would take him upon her lap and sing to him or tell him stories that filled his mind with pictures of wonderful and beautiful things And the next day when he went back to the stone yard he would try to make some of those pictures in stone or clay There lived in the same town a rich man who was called the Count Sometimes the Count would have a grand dinner and his rich friends from other towns would come to visit him Then Antonio s grandfather would go up to the Count s house to help with the work in the kitchen for he was a fine cook as well as a good stone cut ter It happened one day that Antonio went with his grandfather to the Count s great house Some people from the city were coming and there was to be a grand feast The boy could not cook and he was not old enough to wait on the table but he could wash the pans and kettles and as he was smart and quick he could help in many other ways All went well until it was time to spread the table for dinner Then there was a crash in the dining room and a man rushed into the kitchen with some pieces of marble in his hands He was pale and trembling with fright What shall I do What shall I do he cried I have broken the statue that was to stand at the center of the table I cannot make the table look pretty without the statue What will the Count say And now all the other servants were in trouble Was the dinner to be a failure after all For everything de pend ed on having the table nicely arranged The Count would be very angry Ah what shall we do they all asked Then little Antonio Ca no va left his pans and kettles and went up to the man who had caused the trouble If you had another statue could you arrange the table he asked Cer tain ly said the man that is if the statue were of the right length and height Will you let me try to make one asked Anto nio Perhaps I can make something that will do The man laughed Non sense he cried Who are you that you talk of making statues on an hour s notice I am Antonio Canova said the lad Let the boy try what he can do said the servants who knew him And so since nothing else could be done the man allowed him to try On the kitchen table there was a large square lump of yellow butter Two hundred pounds the lump weighed and it had just come in fresh and clean from the dairy on the mountain With a kitchen knife in his hand Antonio began to cut and carve this butter In a few minutes he had molded it into the shape of a crouching lion and all the servants crowded around to see it How beautiful they cried It is a great deal pret ti er than the statue that was broken When it was finished the man carried it to its place The table will be hand som er by half than I ever hoped to make it he said When the Count and his friends came in to dinner the first thing they saw was the yellow lion What a beautiful work of art they cried None but a very great artist could ever carve such a figure and how odd that he should choose to make it of butter And then they asked the Count to tell them the name of the artist Illustration The servants crowded around to see it Truly my friends he said this is as much of a surprise to me as to you And then he called to his head servant and asked him where he had found so wonderful a statue It was carved only an hour ago by a little boy in the kitchen said the servant This made the Count s friends wonder still more and the Count bade the servant call the boy into the room My lad he said you have done a piece of work of which the greatest artists would be proud What is your name and who is your teacher My name is Antonio Canova said the boy and I have had no teacher but my grandfather the stonecutter By this time all the guests had crowded around Antonio There were famous artists among them and they knew that the lad was a genius They could not say enough in praise of his work and when at last they sat down at the table nothing would please them but that Antonio should have a seat with them and the dinner was made a feast in his honor The very next day the Count sent for Antonio to come and live with him The best artists in the land were em ployed to teach him the art in which he had shown so much skill but now instead of carving butter he chis eled marble In a few years Antonio Canova became known as one of the greatest sculptors in the world PICCIOLA Many years ago there was a poor gentleman shut up in one of the great prisons of France His name was Char ney and he was very sad and un hap py He had been put into prison wrong ful ly and it seemed to him as though there was no one in the world who cared for him He could not read for there were no books in the prison He was not allowed to have pens or paper and so he could not write The time dragged slowly by There was nothing that he could do to make the days seem shorter His only pastime was walking back and forth in the paved prison yard There was no work to be done no one to talk with One fine morning in spring Char ney was taking his walk in the yard He was counting the paving stones as he had done a thousand times before All at once he stopped What had made that little mound of earth between two of the stones He stooped down to see A seed of some kind had fallen between the stones It had sprouted and now a tiny green leaf was pushing its way up out of the ground Charney was about to crush it with his foot when he saw that there was a kind of soft coating over the leaf Ah said he This coating is to keep it safe I must not harm it And he went on with his walk The next day he almost stepped upon the plant before he thought of it He stooped to look at it There were two leaves now and the plant was much stronger and greener than it was the day before He staid by it a long time looking at all its parts Every morning after that Charney went at once to his little plant He wanted to see if it had been chilled by the cold or scorched by the sun He wanted to see how much it had grown One day as he was looking from his window he saw the jailer go across the yard The man brushed so close to the little plant that it seemed as though he would crush it Charney trembled from head to foot O my Pic cio la he cried When the jailer came to bring his food he begged the grim fellow to spare his little plant He expected that the man would laugh at him but al though a jailer he had a kind heart Do you think that I would hurt your little plant he said No indeed It would have been dead long ago if I had not seen that you thought so much of it That is very good of you indeed said Char ney He felt half ashamed at having thought the jailer unkind Every day he watched Pic cio la as he had named the plant Every day it grew larger and more beautiful But once it was almost broken by the huge feet of the jailer s dog Charney s heart sank within him Picciola must have a house he said I will see if I can make one So though the nights were chilly he took day by day some part of the firewood that was allowed him and with this he built a little house around the plant The plant had a thousand pretty ways which he noticed He saw how it always bent a little toward the sun he saw how the flowers folded their petals before a storm He had never thought of such things before and yet he had often seen whole gardens of flowers in bloom One day with soot and water he made some ink he spread out his hand ker chief for paper he used a sharp ened stick for a pen and all for what He felt that he must write down the doings of his little pet He spent all his time with the plant See my lord and my lady the jailer would say when he saw them As the summer passed by Picciola grew more lovely every day There were no fewer than thirty blossoms on its stem But one sad morning it began to droop Charney did not know what to do He gave it water but still it drooped The leaves were with er ing The stones of the prison yard would not let the plant live Charney knew that there was but one way to save his treasure Alas how could he hope that it might be done The stones must be taken up at once But this was a thing which the jailer dared not do The rules of the prison were strict and no stone must be moved Only the highest officers in the land could have such a thing done Poor Charney could not sleep Picciola must die Already the flowers had with ered the leaves would soon fall from the stem Then a new thought came to Charney He would ask the great Napoleon the em per or himself to save his plant It was a hard thing for Charney to do to ask a favor of the man whom he hated the man who had shut him up in this very prison But for the sake of Picciola he would do it He wrote his little story on his hand ker chief Then he gave it into the care of a young girl who promised to carry it to Napoleon Ah if the poor plant would only live a few days longer What a long journey that was for the young girl What a long dreary waiting it was for Charney and Picciola But at last news came to the prison The stones were to be taken up Picciola was saved The em per or s kind wife had heard the story of Charney s care for the plant She saw the handkerchief on which he had written of its pretty ways Surely she said it can do us no good to keep such a man in prison And so at last Charney was set free Of course he was no longer sad and un lov ing He saw how God had cared for him and the little plant and how kind and true are the hearts of even rough men And he cher ished Picciola as a dear loved friend whom he could never forget MIGNON Here is the story of Mignon as I remember having read it in a famous old book A young man named Wil helm was staying at an inn in the city One day as he was going up stairs he met a little girl coming down He would have taken her for a boy if it had not been for the long curls of black hair wound about her head As she ran by he caught her in his arms and asked her to whom she belonged He felt sure that she must be one of the rope dan cers who had just come to the inn She gave him a sharp dark look slipped out of his arms and ran away without speaking The next time he saw her Wil helm spoke to her again Do not be afraid of me little one he said kindly What is your name They call me Mignon said the child How old are you he asked No one has counted the child an swered Wilhelm went on but he could not help wondering about the child and thinking of her dark eyes and strange ways One day not long after that there was a great outcry among the crowd that was watching the rope dan cers Wilhelm went down to find out what was the matter He saw that the master of the dancers was beating little Mignon with a stick He ran and held the man by the collar Let the child alone he cried If you touch her again one of us shall never leave this spot The man tried to get loose but Wilhelm held him fast The child crept away and hid herself in the crowd Pay me what her clothes cost cried the ropedancer at last and you may take her As soon as all was quiet Wilhelm went to look for Mignon for she now belonged to him But he could not find her and it was not until the ropedancers had left the town that she came to him Where have you been asked Wilhelm in his kindest tones but the child did not speak You are to live with me now and you must be a good child he said I will try said Mignon gently From that time she tried to do all that she could for Wilhelm and his friends She would let no one wait on him but herself She was often seen going to a basin of water to wash from her face the paint with which the ropedancers had red dened her cheeks indeed she nearly rubbed off the skin in trying to wash away its fine brown tint which she thought was some deep dye Mignon grew more lovely every day She never walked up and down the stairs but jumped She would spring along by the railing and before you knew it would be sitting quietly above on the landing To each one she would speak in a different way To Wilhelm it was with her arms crossed upon her breast Often for a whole day she would not say one word and yet in waiting upon Wilhelm she never tired One night he came home very weary and sad Mignon was waiting for him She carried the light before him up stairs She set the light down upon the table and in a little while she asked him if she might dance It might ease your heart a little she said Wilhelm to please her told her that she might Then she brought a little carpet and spread it upon the floor At each corner she placed a candle and on the carpet she put a number of eggs She arranged the eggs in the form of certain figures When this was done she called to a man who was waiting with a violin She tied a band about her eyes and then the dancing began Illustration And then the dancing began How lightly quickly nimbly wonderfully she moved She skipped so fast among the eggs she trod so closely beside them that you would have thought she must crush them all But not one of them did she touch With all kinds of steps she passed among them Not one of them was moved from its place Wilhelm forgot all his cares He watched every motion of the child He almost forgot who and where he was When the dance was ended Mignon rolled the eggs together with her foot into a little heap Not one was left behind not one was harmed Then she took the band from her eyes and made a little bow Wilhelm thanked her for showing him a dance that was so wonderful and pretty He praised her petted her and hoped that she had not tired herself too much When she had gone from the room the man with the violin told Wilhelm of the care she had taken to teach him the music of the dance He told how she had sung it to him over and over again He told how she had even wished to pay him with her own money for learning to play it for her There was yet another way in which Mignon tried to please Wilhelm and make him forget his cares She sang to him The song which he liked best was one whose words he had never heard before Its music too was strange to him and yet it pleased him very much He asked her to speak the words over and over again He wrote them down but the sweetness of the tune was more delightful than the words The song began in this way Do you know the land where citrons lemons grow And oranges under the green leaves glow Once when she had ended the song she said again Do you know the land It must be Italy said Wilhelm Have you ever
