THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL Jane Abbott tall graceful and languidly beautiful passed through the bevy of girls on the wharf below Highacres Seminary with scarcely a nod for any of them Closely following her came three other girls each carrying a satchel and wearing a tailored gown of the latest cut Although Esther Ballard and Barbara Morris called gaily to many of their friends it was around Marion Starr that all of the girls crowded until her passage way to the small boat even then getting up steam was completely blocked Jane when she had crossed the gang plank turned to find only Esther and Barbara at her side A slight sneer curled her lips as she watched the adulation which Merry was receiving Then with a shrug of her slender shoulders that was more eloquent than words the proud girl seated herself in one of the reclining deck chairs and imperiously motioned her friends to do likewise It s so silly of Merry to make such a fuss over all those girls She ll miss the boat if she doesn t hurry Marion had evidently thought of the same thing for she laughingly ran up the gang plank her arms filled with candy boxes boquets and magazines gifts of her admiring friends Depositing these on a chair she leaned over the rail to call Good bye girls Of course I ll write to you Sally reams and reams a sort of a round robin letter to be sent to the whole crowd Sure thing Betty Ann I ll tell my handsome brother Bob that you don t want him to ever forget you Then as there was a protest from the wharf the girl laughingly added But you wished to be remembered to him Isn t that the same thing Noticing a small girl who had put her handkerchief to her eyes Merry remonstrated Tessie don t cry child This isn t a funeral or a wedding Of course you ll see us again We four intend to come back to Highacres to watch you graduate just as you watched us today Work hard Little One and carry off the honors I ve been your big sister coach all this year and I want you to make the goal I know you will Goodbye Marion Starr could say no more for the small river steamer gave a warning whistle the rope was drawn in and as the boat churned the water noisily in starting the chorus of goodbyes from the throng of girls on the wharf could be heard but faintly Marion remained standing at the rail waving her handkerchief smiling and nodding until the small steamer rounded a jutting out point of land then she turned about and faced the three other girls who had made themselves comfortable in the reclining steamer chairs What a fuss you make over all those undergrads Merry Jane Abbott remarked languidly A casual observer might suppose that each one of them was a very best friend while we three who are here present have that honor For myself I much prefer to conserve my enthusiasm Marion sat down in a vacant steamer chair and merely smiled her reply but the youngest among them Esther Ballard flashed a defense for her ideal among girls That s the very reason why Merry was unanimously voted the most popular girl in Highacres during the entire four years that we have been at the seminary Nothing was ever too much trouble and no girl was too unimportant for Merry s loving consideration Listen Listen laughed good natured Barbara Morris All salute Saint Marion Starr But Esther flushed and eager did not stop While you Jane Abbott she could not keep the scorn out of her voice while you were only voted the most beautiful Only there was a rising inflection in Barbara s voice and she also lifted her eyebrows questioningly I think our queen is quite satisfied with her laurels Jane merely shrugged her shoulders then turning her dark shapely head on the small cherry colored pillow with which she always traveled she asked in her usual languid manner Marion let s forget the past and plan for the future You said you had a wonderful vacation trip to suggest and that you would reveal it when we were on the boat Well this is the time and the place And the girls chimed in Barbara Do hurry and tell us Merry Your plans are always jolly And so with a smile of pleasurable anticipation Merry began to unfold her scheme Aunt Belle is going to one of those adorable cottage hotels at Newport She is just past perfect as a chaperone and she said that she thought a party of four girls would be ideal It will only cost each of us about one hundred dollars a month A mere mite Jane Abbott commented and the plan as far as I m concerned is simply inspirational I ve always had a wild desire to live at one of those fashionable cottage hotels but not having a mother to take me I have never been I know my father will be glad to have me go since your Aunt Belle is to be there and I shall ask for one hundred fifty dollars a month so that we may have plenty of ice cream and not feel stinted The usually indolent Jane was so interested in Merry s plan that she was actually sitting erect the small cherry colored pillow in her lap I m not so sure that I can go Esther Ballard said ruefully My father is not a Wall Street magnate as is your father Jane and one hundred dollars a month may seem a good deal to him following so closely the vast sum that he has had to spend on my four years tuition at Highacres Nonsense Jane flashed at their youngest You are the idol of your artist father s existence He d give you anything you needed to make you happy Then before Esther could voice her retort the older girl had continued As for me I shall need an additional five hundred dollars for clothes Since we are going to so fashionable a place we ought to have the smartest and latest summer styles from Paris Let s all make note of the wardrobe we d like to take Out came four small leather notebooks and with tiny pencils suspended above them the girls thought for a moment Then Merry scribbled something as she remarked My first is a bathing suit Green the color mermaids wear Mine shall be cherry colored It best suits my style of beauty Jane said complacently You surely do look peachy in it Barbara remarked admirably It doesn t matter what I put on my squint and my freckled pug nose spoil it all Oh you re not so bad Esther said generously I heard one of the cadets at our closing dance say that he thought your squint was adorable Lead me to him Barbara jumped up as though about to start in search of her unknown admirer but sank back again when she recalled that she was on a steamer which was chugging down the Hudson at its best speed Do be serious girls See I ve made out a long list of things that I shall need Jane held up her notebook for inspection But Esther closed hers and replaced it in her natty alligator traveling bag I ll select my wardrobe after I have had my father s consent she said You might as well stop planning now Jane as we are nearly to the Battery Esther was right and in another five moments all was confusion on the small steamer When they had safely crossed the gang plank Merry detained them long enough to say Girls before we part let s plan to meet at my home next Friday Since you will all have to travel so far suppose you come early and stay to lunch Then we can make our final plans How I do hope that we can all go I know that I can Jane replied confidently I always do as I wish and nothing could induce me to spend another summer with my young brother and sister They re so boisterous and bothersome As for Dan he s so eager to make high grades at college that he always is deep in a book Why Jane Abbott rebuked Esther I think your little sister is adorable I d give anything if I were not an only child Jane merely shrugged Au revoir she called over her shoulder I ve got to catch the ferry CHAPTER II THE MOST SELFISH GIRL The girls who had been inseparable friends during the four years at the fashionable Highacres Seminary parted at the Battery to go in as many different directions Marion Starr s home was far up on Riverside Drive while Barbara Morris millionaire father had an extensive estate on Long Island Esther Ballard the only daughter of devoted parents resided in the house of her grandfather Colonel Ballard on Washington Square while Jane Abbott s family of four lived in the same rambling picturesque wooden house that mister Abbott s father had built for his bride long before his name had become so well known on Wall Street Edgemere a pretty little town among the Jersey hills mister Abbott deemed a good place to bring up his younger girl and boy and so although Jane often pleaded that they move to a more fashionable suburb in Edgemere they had remained Nor would her father tear down the old home to replace it with one finer for his beloved wife who had died at the birth of little Julie had planned it and had chosen all of the furnishings Some day you will have a home of your own Jane he had told his proud older daughter and then you may have it as fine as you wish But in all other things mister Abbott humored her for she was so like her mother in appearance It was with sorrow that the father had to confess in his heart that there the resemblance ceased for the mother who had been equally beautiful had been neither proud nor selfish Little Julie though not so beautiful was far more like the mother in nature and so too was Daniel the nineteen year old lad upon whom the father placed so much reliance Regrettable as it may seem Jane Abbott as she stood on the deck of the ferry that was to convey her to the Jersey shore was actually dreading the two weeks that she would have to spend in her own home Marion had suggested that they plan going to Newport by the middle of July and it was now the first It was late afternoon and there were many working girls on the huge ferry who were returning to their Jersey homes after a long hot day in the New York offices As they crowded against her Jane drew herself away from them haughtily thankful indeed that her father was so wealthy that she would never have to earn her own way in the world nor wear such unattractive ready made dresses Unconsciously her lips curled scornfully until she chanced to catch a glimpse of her own trim tailored figure in one of the panel mirrors then she smiled complacently and seated herself somewhat apart from the working girls who from time to time glanced at her as she supposed with admiration But she was disabused of this satisfying thought when one of them spoke loud enough for her to hear See that stiff necked snob She thinks she s made of different clay from the rest of us I wish her pa d lose his money so she d have to scrub for a living This remark merely caused Jane to sneer slightly but what she heard next filled her heart with terrified foreboding for another girl had turned to look at her and replied Well if she s who I think she is her father s already gone bankrupt and she s poor enough all right The working girls then moved to another part of the ferry and Jane was left alone It was ridiculous of course Her father could not lose his vast fortune Jane determined to think no more about it The ferry had reached its destination and the proud girl hurried away Never before had she so longed to reach her home Of course it is not true her panicky thought kept repeating But what could it mean What could it mean Jane vowed to herself that she would not again think of what the spiteful working girl had said for how could she a mere nobody have information concerning the affairs of a man of her father s standing which Jane his own daughter did not have But a disquieting thought reminded her that the working girl s face had been familiar and then memory recalled that she had seen her in the very building on Wall Street where mister Abbott s offices were located Jane s troubled reverie was interrupted by a joyous exclamation and her brother who was three years her senior and a head taller leaped from the crowd and held out both hands His greeting was so enthusiastic his expression so radiant that the girl was convinced that all was well with their father and so she said nothing of what she had heard It was not until they were seated on the train and had started for Edgemere that Jane noticed how pale and thin was her brother s face and when his eager flow of conversation was interrupted by a severe coughing spell the girl exclaimed with real concern Why Brother Dan what a terrible cold you have You ought to be in bed The boy s smile was reassuring Don t worry about that cough sis he said lightly Now the grind is over it will let up I m thinking But it surely has stuck closer than a postage stamp Caught it weeks ago but I ve been so busy well doing things that I haven t had time to coddle myself Suddenly the lad s expression became very serious and turning he placed a thin hand that was far too white lovingly on his sister s as he said Jane dear some changes have taken place in our home since you went back to Highacres last Christmas For Dad s sake try to bear them bravely Then it was true true all that this dreadful working girl had said For a moment the girl s whole being surged with self pity then she felt cold and hard What right had their father to lose his fortune and bring disgrace and privation upon his family In a voice that sounded most unfeeling she asked And just what may those changes be It was hard so hard for Dan to tell the whole truth to a girl whom he knew with sorrow thought only of herself He had believed that trouble might awaken the true Jane whom he had always felt must be somewhere deep under all the adamant of selfishness but as yet there was no evidence of it He removed his hand as from something that hurt him and folding his arms he began Our father is in great trouble Jane and he needs our aid but at present all we can do is to bear cheerfully the inconveniences that are not nearly as severe as many others have to endure But the girl was impatient For goodness sakes Dan don t preach Now is no time to moralize If our father has done some idiotic speculating and has lost his money tell me so squarely A red spot burned in each pale cheek of the lad and a light of momentary indignation flashed in his eyes but he replied calmly enough Remember Jane that you are speaking of our father one of the noblest men who ever trod on this earth You know as well as I do that Dad never did any wildcat speculating Well then stop beating around the bush and tell me just what has happened CHAPTER III FACING HARD TRUTHS It is because our father is honest that today we are poor Dan Abbott began and I glory in that fact His sister sitting beside him in the train that was nearing Edgemere curled her lips but did not reply The firm to which Dad belonged made illegal contracts in western oil fields The other men will be many times richer than they were before but because our father scorned to be a party to such dishonesty he has failed Not a one of the men in whom he trusted made the slightest effort to help avert the catastrophe When did this all happen Jane s voice was still hard almost bitter as though she felt hatred and scorn for her father rather than loyalty and admiration Last February was the brief reply Then why was I not informed Am I a mere infant to be kept in ignorance of facts like these Father has treated me unfairly letting me boast to my most intimate friends that I could have an elaborate Paris wardrobe for the summer My position is certainly a most unpleasant one At this the slow temper of the lad at her side flamed and though he spoke in a low voice that the other passengers might not hear he said just what he thought Jane Abbott you are the most selfish heartless girl I have ever known It is very hard to believe that you are an own daughter to that most wonderful woman whom we are permitted to claim as our mother In an hour of trouble and there were many of them in those long ago days she was always brave and cheerful comforting Dad and urging him above all to be true to an ideal But I actually believe that you Jane Abbott would rather our Dad had entered into dishonest negotiations as did the other members of his firm The lad glanced hopefully at his sister Surely she would indignantly refute this accusation but she did nothing of the sort With a shrug of her slender shoulders she sank back against the cherry colored cushion as she replied I have often heard that an honest man can not be a success in business and I do feel that our father should have considered his family above all else Dan pressed his lips firmly together He feared that if his torrent of angry thoughts were expressed it might form a barrier between himself and his sister that the future could not tear down and so after taking a deep breath that seemed almost a half sob he again placed his hand tenderly on the cold white one that lay listlessly near him Sis dear he implored try to be brave won t you I ll do all I can to make things easier for you and so will Dad He s pretty much stunned just now but oh little girl you can t guess how he is dreading your homecoming That s why I offered to meet you at the ferry station I wanted to tell you and save Dad that agony of spirit If you would only go in brightly and say what our dear mother would have said it will do more to help our father than anything else in this world Selfish as Jane was she dearly loved the brother who had idolized her and who in moments of great tenderness had always called her his little girl remembering only that she was three years younger and in need of his protection Tears sprang to her eyes but as the train was drawing in at the Edgemere station she only had time to say I ll try But oh it is so hard so hard Dan engaged a hack and after assisting his sister in he sat beside her Then as they drove along the pleasant streets of the village that were shaded by wide spreading elms the lad told her what changes had occurred in their home missus Beach our housekeeper and Nora her assistant have left and our dear old grandmother has closed up her farm in Vermont and is staying with father It has been his greatest comfort to have his mother with him You always thought her ways so old fashioned and farmerish Jane but for all that she is the sweetest kind of a little old lady and as brisk and capable as she was two years ago when we visited the farm There was a slight curl to Jane s lips but she merely said I suppose I shall be expected to wash dishes now We must be terribly poor if we couldn t even keep Nora But we have one big blessing Dan said brightly the home which was mother s can not be taken from us for it belongs to us children Jane was not listening She was trying to figure out something in her own mind Dan She turned toward him suddenly I can t see why Dad lost his money just because he did not want to be a partner in what he considered a dishonest oil deal Explain it to me a little more clearly I didn t at first her brother confessed fearing that it would not have your sympathy Many poor people invested their entire savings in the oil deal supposing that father s firm could be relied upon to be absolutely honest It is their money much of it which is making the rich men richer Our father knowing that many had invested their all because they trusted his personal integrity has turned over his entire fortune to make up their losses as far as it will go Dan was sorry he had to make this explanation for he saw at once the hard expression returning to the eyes of his sister If our father has greater consideration for the poor of New York than he has for his own children you can not expect me to express much sympathy for him Dear girl wouldn t you rather have our father honest than rich The lad s clear grey eyes looked at her searchingly Jane put her hand to her forehead as though it ached Oh Dan she said wearily you and father have different ideals from what I have I guess I never really gave any thought to these things I like comfort and nice clothes and I hate hate hate drudgery and work of every kind I suppose now I shall have to scrub for a living Jane was recalling what the working girl on the ferry had said Dan s amused laughter rang out Oh Jane what nonsense Do you suppose that while I have a strong right arm I would let my little pal work in any of those drudgery ways No indeed so forget that fear if it s haunting you But the boy could say no more for another violent coughing spell racked his frail body Instantly Jane was self reproachful Oh Dan Dan she said I know you would give your very life to help me I m so selfish so very selfish I m going to think of only one thing and that is how I can help you to get well for I can see now that you must have been ill The boy took advantage of this momentary tender spell to turn and take the girl s hands in his and say imploringly Dear we re almost home If you really want to help me to get well be loving and brave to Dad Your unhappiness grieves me more than our loss little girl and I can t get strong while I am so worried There were again tears in the beautiful dark eyes of the girl and impulsively she kissed the one person on earth whom she truly loved Brother for your sake I ll try to be brave she said with a half sob as the hack stopped in front of their home CHAPTER IV A SAD HOMECOMING As Jane walked up the circling graveled path which led to the picturesque rambling low built brown house that she called home her heart was filled with conflicting emotions She bit her trembling lips and brushed away the tears that quivered on her eyelashes She knew oh how well she knew that they were prompted only by self pity She struggled to awaken the nobler self that her brother was so confident still slumbered in her soul but she could not She felt cold hard indignant every time she recalled that her father had sacrificed his children s comfort for a Quixotic ideal It is no use trying she assured herself noticing vaguely that they were passing the rose garden which was a riot of fragrant colorful bloom How tenderly her father cared for that garden for every bush in it had been planted by the loved one who was gone The tall lad carrying her satchels walked silently at Jane s side He well knew the conflict that was raging in the heart of the girl he had always loved in spite of her ever increasing selfishness with a tenderness akin to that which he had given his mother but he said no word to try to help This was a moment when Jane must stand alone They were ascending the wide front steps when the door of the house was flung open and a little girl of ten leaped out with a glad cry Oh Janey my wonderful big sister Janey Two arms were held out and in another moment as the older girl well knew she would be in one of those crushing embraces that the younger children called bear hugs She frowned slightly Don t Julie she implored My suit has just been pressed Won t you ever grow up and greet people in a more dignified way The glad expression on the freckled face of the little girl who could not be called really pretty changed instantly Her lips quivered and her eyes filled with tears Don t be a silly Jane said rebukingly as she stooped and kissed the child indifferently on the forehead A dear old lady wearing a pretty lavender gingham and a white afternoon apron appeared in the doorway all a flutter of happy excitement She had not seen Jane for two years and she took the girl s hands in her own that trembled Dear dear Jenny How the graduate of fashionable Highacres had always hated the name her grandmother had given her What a blessing tis that you have come home at last It ll mean more to your father to have you here than you can think The old lady evidently did not notice the scornful curling of the girl s lips or if she did she purposely pretended that she did not and kept on with her speech You know dearie you re the perfect image of that other Jane my Daniel loved so dearly and she was just your age Jenny when they met It ll be like meeting her all over again to have you coming home now when he s in such trouble you being so like her and she was most tender and brave and unselfish Even the grandmother noticed that her well meant speech was not acceptable for the girl s impatience was ill concealed Where is my father she said in a voice which gave Dan little hope that the nobler self in the girl had been awakened He s working in the garden dearie out beyond the apple orchard the old lady said tremulously He told me when you came to send you out He wants to be alone with you just at first And your little brother Gerald I s pose you re wondering where he is Well he s got a place down in the village as errand boy for Peterson s grocery They give him his pay every night and he fetches it right home to his Dad Of course my Daniel puts the money in bank for Gerald s schooling but the boy don t know that He thinks he s helping and bless him nobody knows how much he is helping There s ways to bring comfort that no money could buy Dan knew that Jane believed their gentle old grandmother was preaching at her He was almost sorry He feared that it was antagonizing Jane nor was he wrong Well I think the back orchard was a strange place for father to have me meet him she said almost angrily as she flung herself out of the house Dan sighed Then stooping he kissed the little old lady Don t feel badly grandmother he said adding hopefully The real Jane must waken soon The proud selfish girl again rebellious walked along the narrow path that led under the great old gnarled apple trees which the children had used for playhouses ever since they could climb She felt like one stunned or as though she were reading a tragic story and expected at every moment to be awakened to the joyful realization that it was not true Her father saw her coming and dropped the hoe that he had been plying between the long rows of beans How terribly he has changed Jane thought He had indeed aged and there was on his sensitive face which was more that of an idealist than a business man the impress of sorrow but also there was something else Jane noticed it at once an expression of firm unwavering determination She knew that appealing to his love for his daughter would be useless great as that love was A quotation she had learned in school flashed into her mind I could not love thee dear so much loved I not honor more There was indeed infinite tenderness in the clear gray eyes that looked at her and then without a word he held out his arms and suddenly Jane felt as she had when she was a little child and things had gone wrong Father Father she sobbed and then she clung to him while he held her in a yearning strong embrace saying It s hard my daughter terribly hard for all of us but it was the thing that I had to do Dan I am sure has told you all that happened But it won t be for long Janey What I have done once I can do again He led her to a rustic bench under one of the trees and removing her hat he stroked her dark glossy hair Jane dear he implored when her sobs grew less try to be brave just for a time Promise me Then as the girl did not speak the man went on We have tried so hard all of us together to make it possible for you to finish at Highacres Poor Dan made the biggest sacrifice I feared that I would have to send for you to come home perhaps only for this term but Dan wrote Father use my college money for Jane s tuition I ll work my way through for the rest of this year And that is what he did Notwithstanding the fact that he had to study until long after midnight he worked during the day nor did he stop when he caught a severe cold He did not let us know how ill he was but struggled on and finished the year with high honors but oh my daughter you can see how worn he is doctor Sanders tells me that Dan must go to the Colorado mountains for the summer and I have been waiting dear to talk it over with you You will want to go with Dan to take care of him won t you Jane Almost before the girl knew that she was going to say it she heard her self pitying voice expostulating Oh Dad how cruel fate is Marion Starr wanted me to go with her to Newport They re going to one of those adorable cottage hotels she and her Aunt Belle and we three girls who have been Merry s best friends were to go with her It would only cost me one hundred dollars a month That isn t so very much is it Dad mister Abbott sighed Jane and there was infinite reproach in his tone am I to believe that you are willing that Dan should go alone to the mountains to try to find there the health he lost in his endeavor to help you Again the girl sobbed Oh Dad how selfish I am How terribly selfish I love Dan but the thing I want to do is to go to Newport Of course I know I can t go but oh how I do want to The girl feared that her father would rebuke her angrily for the frank revelation of her lack of gratitude but instead he rose saying kindly as he assisted her to arise Jane dear you think that is what you want to do but I don t believe it Dan is to go West next Friday My good friend mister Bethel being president of a railroad has sent me the passes As you know I still own a little cabin on Mystery Mountain which I purchased for almost nothing when I graduated from college and went West to seek my fortune There is no mystery and there was no wealth but I have paid the taxes until last year and those Dan shall pay as I do not want to lose the place It was to that cabin as you have often heard us tell that your mother and I went for our honeymoon You need not decide today daughter If you prefer to go with your friends I will find a way to send you CHAPTER V JANE S SMALL BROTHER There were many conflicting emotions in the heart of the tall beautiful girl as she walked slowly back to the house her father at her side with one arm lovingly about her Jane he said tenderly I wish there were words in our English language that could adequately express the joy it is to me because you are so like your mother and strangely perhaps Dan is as much like me as I was at his age as you are like that other Jane She was tall and willowy with the same bright uplifting of her dark eyes when she was pleased Then the man sighed and he said almost pleadingly You do realize do you not daughter that I would do anything that was right to give you pleasure Vaguely the girl replied Why I suppose so Dad I don t quite understand ideals and ethics I ve never given much thought to them Jane could say no more for vaulting over the low fence beyond the orchard a vigorous boy of twelve appeared and if ten year old Julie had made a terrifying onrush this boy s attack resembled that of a little wild Indian Whoopla he fairly shouted If here isn t old Jane Bully but that s great Did you bring me anything There was no fending off the boy s well meant embraces and Jane emerged from them with decidedly ruffled feelings I certainly don t like to have you call me old Jane she scolded I think it is very lacking in respect Father I wish you would tell Gerald to call me Sister Jane mister Abbott reprimanded the crestfallen lad then he told the girl that the boy had not meant to be disrespectful You know Jane that children use certain phrases until they are worn ragged and just now old is applied to everything of which Gerald is especially fond It is with him a term of endearment Then with a smile of loving encouragement for the boy their father added Why that youngster even calls me old Dad and I confess I rather like it The boy did not again address his sister but going to the other side of his father he clung affectionately to his arm and hopped along on one foot and then on the other as though he had quite forgotten the rebuff but he had not They entered a side door and Jane went upstairs to her own pleasant room with its wide bow windows that opened out over the tops of the apple trees and toward the sloping green hills for which New Jersey is famous Grandmother was in the kitchen preparing a supper such as Jane had liked two years before when she had visited the Vermont farm and Julie was setting the table when Gerald appeared Straddling a chair he blurted out Say isn t Jane a spoil joy I m awful sorry her school s let out and tisn t only for vacation that she ll be home Dan says it s forever n ever n ever She ll be trying to tell us where to head in We ll have about as much fun as as the boy was trying hard to think of a suitable simile as a Then as he was still floundering Julie holding a handful of silver knives and forks whirled and said brightly as a rat in a dog kennel You know last week how awful unhappy that rat was that puppy had in his kennel till you held his collar and let the poor thing get away Then as the small girl continued on her way around the long table placing the silver by each plate she said hopefully Don t let s mope about it yet Jane always goes a visitin her school friends every summer and like s not she will this Humph She must be heaps nicer other places than she is here or folks wouldn t want her Their mutual commiserating came to an abrupt end for Grandma appeared from the kitchen with a covered dish out of which a delicious aroma was escaping Then in from the other door came Dad one arm about Jane and the other about Dan Grandma glanced anxiously at her big son His expression was hard to read but he seemed happier How she hoped Jane had proved herself a worthy daughter of her mother It is well perhaps that we cannot read the thoughts of those nearest us for all that evening Jane was wondering how she could make over her last summer s wardrobe that it might appear new even in a fashionable cottage hotel On Thursday directly after breakfast Jane went up to her room without having offered to help with the morning work She had never even made her own bed in all the eighteen years of her life and the thought did not suggest itself to her that she might be useful Or if it did she assured herself that Julie was far more willing and much more capable as a helper for their grandmother than she Jane could possibly be The truth was that bright eyed eager light footed little Julie was far more welcome than the older girl bored sulky and selfish would have been Dan left early for the city where he wished to purchase a few things he would need while roughing it in the Colorado mountains Gerald went with him as far as the cross roads then the older boy tramped on to the depot while the younger one whistling gaily and even turning a handspring now and then proceeded to his place of business and was soon nearly hidden in an apron much too big for him while he swept out the store mister Abbott had watched his older daughter closely during that morning meal He had said little to her but had conversed cheerily with Dan telling him just what khaki garments he would need and at Gerald s urging he had retold exciting adventures that he had had in that old log cabin in the long ago days when he had first purchased it How the boy wished that he also could go to that wonderful Mystery Mountain but not for one moment would he let Dad know of this yearning He was needed at home to earn what he could by working at the Peterson grocery His big brother was not well so he Gerald must take his place as father s helper He was a little boy only twelve and it took courage to whistle and turn handsprings when he would far rather have crept away into some hidden fence corner and sobbed out his longing for travel and adventure All that sunny July morning mister Abbott worked in his garden back of the apple orchard Often as he hoed between the long rows of thrifty vegetables the sorrowing man glanced up at the windows of the room in which he knew his beloved daughter sat How he wished she would come out and talk with him even if it were to tell him that she had decided that she wanted to go with her friends to Newport He had promised to find a way to obtain the three hundred dollars she would need if she wished to go for three months He sighed deeply and being hidden from the house by a gnarled old apple tree he stopped his work and took from his pocket an often read letter from an old friend who had offered to loan him any sum large or small at any time that it might be needed If Jane wants to go I ll wire for the money he decided Never before had a morning dragged so slowly for the man who was used to the whirl confusion and excitement of Wall Street And yet though he hardly realized it the warm gentle breeze rustling among the leaves of the trees the smell of the freshly turned earth in which he was working the cheerful singing of the birds far and near brought into his soul a sense of peace At the end of one row he stood up very straight as he had stood before it had all happened and looking up into the radiant blue sky he seemed to know deep in the heart of him that all would be well It was with a brisker step than he had walked in many a day that he returned to the house when little Julie appeared at the back door to ring the luncheon bell Surely Jane has decided by now he told himself And equally surely she will want to go West with the brother who has sacrificed himself his ease and his health that she might finish her course at Highacres So confident was he of his daughter s real nobility of nature that he found himself planning what he would suggest that she take with her She would ask him about that at lunch There was not much time to prepare but she would need little in that wild mountain country At last he heard her slowly descending the stairs His anxiety increased What would Jane s decision be CHAPTER VI JANE S CHOICE The father with his hands clasped behind him was pacing up and down the long dining room when his daughter entered 
8321-284207-0000	train-other-500	He saw at once that she had been crying
none	none	 although she had endeavored to erase the traces of the tears which had been shed almost continuously through the morning 
8321-284207-0001	train-other-500	In a listless voice she said at once Father
none	none	 I have decided to go with Dan since you feel that it is my duty 
8321-284207-0002	train-other-500	but oh how I want to go to Newport with Merry and the rest but of course it would cost three hundred dollars and there is no money The father had started eagerly toward his daughter when she had entered
8321-284207-0003	train-other-500	but upon hearing the concluding part of her speech he drew back a hurt expression in his clear gray eyes He folded his arms and a more alert observer than Jane would have noticed an almost hard tone in his voice
8321-284207-0004	train-other-500	Never before had it been used for the daughter who was so like the mother in looks only The matter is decided Jane he informed her The three hundred dollars that you require will be forthcoming However I wish you would plan to leave tomorrow
none	none	 the same day that your brother goes West 
8321-284207-0005	train-other-500	I want to be alone without worries that I may decide how best to go about earning what I shall need to finish paying the debt that I still owe to the poor people who trusted me Oh father father Jane flung herself into her chair at the table and put her head down on her folded arms
none	none	 I didn t know that you felt that you owe them more than your entire fortune 
8321-284207-0006	train-other-500	It was not enough to cover their investments the man said still coldly for he believed the girl was crying because she would have to give up even more than she had supposed and be kept in poverty for a longer period of time She sat up however when her father said Jane dry your tears
none	none	 Since you are to go to Newport I see nothing for you to cry about and I do not wish mother and Julie to know how I feel about this whole matter Hastily Jane left the table to again remove the traces of tears 
8321-284207-0007	train-other-500	and when she returned her grandmother and Julie were in their places Her father had remained standing until she also was seated Then bowing his head he said the simple grace of gratitude which had never been omitted at that table
8321-284207-0008	train-other-500	Jane marveled at the courage of her father for he was actually smiling at the little old lady who sat at his side
none	none	 Mother mine he said if this isn t the same kind of a meat pudding that you used to make for me as a special treat long ago when I had been good 
8321-284207-0009	train-other-500	Have I been good today There were sudden tears in the fading blue eyes and a quiver in the corners of the sweet old mouth as the grandmother replied Yes Dan you have been very good
none	none	 And all the while I was making it I was thinking how proud and pleased your father would be if he only knew 
8321-284207-0010	train-other-500	and maybe he does know how good you ve been
none	none	 When you weren t more than knee high to your Dad he began to teach you that it was better to have folks know that your word could be depended on 
8321-284207-0011	train-other-500	than to be praised for smartness and that s how tis Danny and I m happy and proud The dear little old lady wiped her eyes with a corner of her apron then she smiled up brightly and pretended to eat the meat pie which was in danger of being neglected
8321-284207-0012	train-other-500	by all except Julie who prattled We ve set away two big pieces one for brother Dan when he comes home from the city and one for Gerry
none	none	 Umm 
8321-284207-0013	train-other-500	won t they be glad when they see them They ll be hungry as anything I like to be awful hungry when there s something extra special to eat don t you Janey Almost timorously this query was ventured Julie did not like to have the big sister look so sad The answer was not encouraging
none	none	 Oh Julie I don t want to talk the other girl said fretfully 
8321-284207-0014	train-other-500	Nor eat neither it looks like the old lady had just said when the front door bell pealed Julie leaped up looking eagerly at her father Oh Dad may I go But being nearest the door he had risen I ll answer it Julie he replied
none	none	 It is probably some one to see me 
8321-284207-0015	train-other-500	But mister Abbott was mistaken A messenger boy stood on the porch
none	none	 After the yellow envelope had been signed for it was taken to Jane to whom it was addressed 
8321-284207-0016	train-other-500	Eagerly the girl tore it open the others watching her with varied emotions although Julie s was just eager curiosity Ohee she squealed
none	none	 telegrams are such fun and so exciting 
8321-284207-0017	train-other-500	What s in it Janey do tell us mister Abbott noted that a red spot was burning in each cheek of the daughter who had been so pale She glanced up at him her eyes shining Dad she cried you won t have to give me three hundred dollars Listen to this
8321-284207-0018	train-other-500	Oh Merry is certainly wonderful Then she read Dearest Jane Aunt Belle has changed her plans She has rented a cottage just beyond the hotel grounds and is going to take her own cook and I want you to come as our guest
none	none	 because darling girl 
8321-284207-0019	train-other-500	I owe you a visit since you gave me such a wonderful time in the country with you last year
none	none	 and what is more we are going Friday so pack up your trunk today and be at the Central Station tomorrow at four zero Lovingly your intimate friend Marion Starr P S Who 
8321-284207-0020	train-other-500	more than ever is living up to her nickname Merry M S During the reading of the night letter mister Abbott had quickly made up his mind just what his attitude would be That s splendid Jane isn t it
8321-284207-0021	train-other-500	he said and not even his watchful mother noted a trace of disappointment in his voice If I were you I would pack at once You would better go over to the city in the morning and that will give you time to buy a new summer dress for I am sure that you must need one
none	none	 Jane started to reply but something in her throat seemed to make it hard for her to speak 
8321-284207-0022	train-other-500	and so she left the room hurriedly without having more than touched her plate Julie followed as she adored packing When they were gone the man sighed deeply Mother he said I have decided to send Julie with Dan She can cook the simple things he will need and some one must go with the boy
none	none	 I would go myself but I would be of little use In a few days as soon as I can pull myself together I am going back to the city to start in some occupation far from Wall Street 
8321-284207-0023	train-other-500	The old lady reached out a comforting hand and placed it on that of her son nearest her Dan she said in a low voice Jane doesn t know a thing about your long illness does she Nobody s told her has there The man shook his head
none	none	 Jane has been so interested in her own problems and in finding a way to do as she wished that she has not even wondered why I am working about in the garden instead of going to the city daily as I always have done 
8321-284207-0024	train-other-500	But don t tell her mother She does not seem to care and moreover I am now much stronger My only real worry is Dan and I do feel confident that if he can be well cared for the mountain air will restore his health
8321-284207-0025	train-other-500	Rising he stooped to kiss his mother s forehead then left the room going through the kitchen to the garden
none	none	 As he worked he glanced often at the open windows of the room above the tree tops 
8321-284207-0026	train-other-500	He saw the two girls hurrying about
none	none	 for Jane had gladly accepted Julie s offer of service and the trunk packing was evidently progressing merrily 
8321-284207-0027	train-other-500	This assurance was brought to him when he heard Jane singing a snatch of a school song It sounded like a requiem to the man in the garden below He leaned on his hoe as he thought self rebukingly
none	none	 It is all my fault I have spoiled Jane My love has been misdirected It is I who have made her selfish I wanted to give her everything for she had lost so much when she lost her mother 
8321-284207-0028	train-other-500	I have done as much for the other three children but somehow they didn t spoil The comfort of that realization was so great that the father soon returned to his self imposed task and an hour later when Dan appeared he told the boy Jane s decision saying
8321-284207-0029	train-other-500	Son of mine it would be no comfort to you to have her companionship if her heart were elsewhere The shadow of keen disappointment in the lad s eyes was quickly dispelled Placing a hand on his father s shoulder he said cheerfully It s all right Dad Julie is a great little pal
8321-284207-0030	train-other-500	But even yet the matter was not decided That Thursday night after the younger members of the household were asleep mister Abbott and his mother talked together in his den
none	none	 Julie was the happiest child in this world when I told her she was to go with Dan 
8321-284207-0031	train-other-500	The old lady smiled as she recalled the hoppings and squealings with which the small girl had expressed her joy Luckily I d washed and ironed her summer clothes on Monday and Tuesday and this being only Thursday she hadn t soiled any of them
8321-284207-0032	train-other-500	Then her tone changed to one of tenderness Dan she said Julie and Jane aren t much alike are they That little girl didn t hop and squeal long before she thought of something that sobered her Then she told me I don t like to go Grandma
8321-284207-0033	train-other-500	and leave Gerald at home He s been wishing and wishing and wishing he could go but he wouldn t tell Dad cause he wants to stay home and earn money to help To the little old lady s surprise her companion sprang up as he exclaimed Mother I won t be gone long Wait up for me
8321-284207-0034	train-other-500	Seizing his hat from the hall tree he left the house Well now that s certainly a curious caper the old lady thought
none	none	 He couldn t have been listening to a word I was saying 
8321-284207-0035	train-other-500	He must have thought of something he d forgotten probably it s something for Jane Well there s nothing for me to do but wait She glanced at the clock on the mantle Even then it was late She was usually asleep at ten There had been time for many a little cat nap before she heard her son returning
8321-284207-0036	train-other-500	His expression assured the old lady that he was satisfied with the result of his errand Why Dan Abbott she exclaimed whatever started you off in that way Twasn t anything I said was it The man sank down in his chair again and took from his pocket a telegram
none	none	 That s what I went after mother he told her I wired Bethel for one more pass as I had a small son who also wished to go West 
8321-284207-0037	train-other-500	and this is his answer Glad indeed to accommodate you Dan and I m sending one more just for good measure Happened to recall that you have four children Let me do something else for you old man if I can The grandmother looked up with shining eyes as she commented
8321-284207-0038	train-other-500	Bert Bethel s a true friend if there ever was one Won t Gerry be wild with joy But goodness me Danny that means more packing to do There s room enough in Julie s trunk for the things Gerald will need and I do believe I ll go right up and put them in while the boy s asleep
8321-284207-0039	train-other-500	Then she paused and looked at her son inquiringly Will it be quite fair to mister Peterson to have Gerry leave his store without giving notice I ve attended to that mother the man replied
none	none	 While I was waiting for an answer from Bert I walked over to the grocery and told Jock Peterson all that had happened and he was as pleased as he could be 
8321-284207-0040	train-other-500	He wants Gerald to come over there first thing in the morning to get a present to take with him He didn t say what it would be
none	none	 I don t even suppose that he had decided when he spoke 
8321-284207-0041	train-other-500	I was indeed happy to have him praise Gerald as he did
none	none	 He said that he would trust our boy with any amount of money 
8321-284207-0042	train-other-500	He has watched Gerald as he always does every lad who works in the store He said that nearly all of them had helped themselves to a piece of candy from the showcase when they had wished
none	none	 but that Gerald had never once touched a thing that did not belong to him 
8321-284207-0043	train-other-500	mister Peterson was so pleased that he asked Gerald about it one day saying Don t you like candy lad And our boy replied Indeed I do mister Peterson I don t buy it because I want to save all my money to help Dad
8321-284207-0044	train-other-500	Gerald hadn t even thought of helping himself as he worked around the store Of course Gerry wouldn t the old lady replied emphatically for isn t he your son Daniel And your grandson mother the man smilingly returned But we must get some sleep he added
8321-284207-0045	train-other-500	as the chimes on the mantle clock told them that it was eleven Tomorrow is to be a busy day
none	none	 It was also to be a day of surprises although this these two did not guess CHAPTER VII GERRY S SURPRISE Grandmother Abbott had indeed been right when she prophecied that Gerald s joy upon hearing that he could accompany Dan and his sister Julie would be unbounded She told him before breakfast while they were waiting for the others to come down They had planned telling him later but when his father saw how hard the small boy was trying to be brave how the tune he was endeavoring to whistle wavered and broke he could stand it no longer and putting a hand on each of the boy s shoulders he looked down at him as he asked Son if you could have your dearest wish fulfilled what would it be The lad hesitated then he said earnestly There s two things to wish for Dad and they re both awful big I want everything to be all right for you but oh how I do want brother Dan to get well Tears sprang to the eyes of the little old lady and placing a hand affectionately on the boy s head she asked Isn t there something else dearie something you d be wishing just for yourself It was quite evident to the two who were watching that a struggle was going on in the boy s heart He had assured himself time and again that his dad must not know how he wished that he could go with Dan He even felt guilty because he wanted to go believing that his dad needed his help at home and so he said nothing His father surmising that this might be the case asked with one of his rare smiles If you knew son that I thought it best for you to go with Julie to help her take care of Dan would you be pleased Such a light as there was in the freckled face but even then the boy did not let himself rejoice Dad he said don t you need me here No son your grandmother has decided to stay all summer She has found a nice family to take care of her farm Indeed I shall feel better knowing that you are with Julie if Dan should be really ill For a moment the good news seemed to stun the little fellow But when the full realization of what it meant surged over him he leaped into his father s arms and hugged him hard then turning he bolted for the stairway and went up two steps at a time Hurray he fairly shouted Dan Jane Julie I m going to Mystery Mountain This unexpected news was received joyfully by Julie and Dan but Jane who was putting the last touches to her traveling costume merely gave a shrug which was reflected back to her in the long mirror Well thanks be I m not going she confided to that reflection I d be worn to rags by the end of the summer if I had to listen to such shrieking I m thankful Merry s Aunt Belle has no children They may be all very well for people who like them but I think they are superlative nuisances The entire family had gathered in the dining room when Jane descended and after the grace had been said the two youngest members began to chatter their excitement like little magpies Dan who sat next to Jane smiled at her lovingly I suppose you are going to have a wonderful time little girl he said I have heard that Newport is a merry whirl for society people in the summer time with dances tallyho rides and picnic suppers Jane s eyes glowed and she voiced her agreement I ve heard so too and I ve always been just wild to have a wee taste of that gay life and now I can hardly believe that I am to be right in the midst of it for three glorious months Then as she saw a sudden wearied expression in her brother s face she added You re very tired Dan aren t you If only you were rested I should try to plan some way to have you go with me I m wild to have you meet Merry I do believe she is just the kind of a girl whom you would like You never have cared for any girl yet have you I mean not particularly well There was a tender light in the gray eyes that were so like their father s Resting a hand on Jane s arm he said in a low voice I care right now very particularly for a girl and she is my dear sister pal Somehow the expression in her brother s eyes made Jane unhappy She did wish he would not look at her was it wistfully yearningly or what Rising their father said The taxi is outside children Are you all ready There was much confusion for the next few moments The expressman had come for the trunks and there were many last things that the father wished to say to the three who were going to his cabin on Mystery Mountain Dan my boy mister Abbott held the hand of his eldest in a firm clasp and looked deep into his eyes let your first thought be how best you can regain your strength If you need me wire and I will come at once Then putting his hand in his pocket he drew out an envelope The passes are in here Put them away carefully Then he turned to Jane Goodbye daughter You will be nearer Come home when you want to May heaven protect you all The two younger children gave bear hugs over and over again to their dad and grandmother and when at last all were seated in the taxi they waved to the two who stood on the porch until they had turned a corner Dan smiled at Jane as he said This is indeed an exodus That little old home of ours never lost so many of us all at once Gee I bet ye the apple orchard ll wonder where me and Julie are the boy began but Jane interrupted fretfully Oh I do wish you would be more careful of the way you speak Gerald You know as well as any of us that you should say where Julie and I are The boy s exuberance for a moment was dampened but not for long He soon burst out with Say Dan you know that story Dad tells about a brown bear that came right up to the cabin door once Do you suppose there s bears in those mountains now I m sure of it Gerry Dozens of them but they won t hurt us unless we get them cornered Well you can bet I m not going to corner any of them Gerry confided But I d like to have a little cub wouldn t you Julie to fetch up for a pet The little girl was doubtful Maybe when it grew up it would forget it was a pet bear and maybe you d get it cornered and then what would you do Dan laughed The bear would do the doing he said He glanced at Jane who sat looking out of the small window at her side He did not believe that she really saw the objects without How he wished he knew what the girl who had been his pal all through their childhood was thinking As he watched her there was again in his eyes that yearning wistful expression but Jane did not know it as she did not turn The little station at Edgemere was soon reached the trunks checked for the big city beyond the river and after a short ride on the train and ferry they found themselves in the whirling seething mass of humanity with which the Grand Central Station seemed always to be filled The train for the West was to leave at ten and after it was gone Jane planned going uptown to buy a summer dress Dad had told her to charge it to him His credit was still good As they stood waiting for the gates to open Dan took from his pocket the envelope containing the passes For the first time he glanced them over then exclaimed Why how curious There are four passes I thought there were but three Oh well they are only slips of paper and do not represent money He replaced them and smiled at Jane The children raced to a stand to buy a bag of popcorn and Dan seized that opportunity to take his sister s hand and say most seriously Dear girl if I never come back try to be to our Dad all that I have so wanted to be There was a startled expression in the girl s dark eyes Dan what do you mean Her voice sounded frightened terrorized If you never come back Brother why shouldn t you come back She clung to his arm Tell me what do you mean But he could not reply for a time because of a sudden attack of coughing Then he said I don t know little girl I m afraid I m worse off than Dad knows I All aboard The gates were swung open Frantically Jane cried Dan quick have my trunk checked on that other pass I m going with you mister Abbott smiled through tears as he handed his mother the telegram he received that afternoon I felt sure our Jane had a soul he said Her mother s daughter couldn t be entirely without one And now that it s awakened maybe it ll start to blossoming the old lady replied CHAPTER VIII ALL ABOARD There had been such a whirl at the last moment that it was not until they were on the train and had located their seats on the Pullman that the children realized what had happened Luckily Jane was too much occupied readjusting her own attitude of mind and trying to think hastily what she should do before the train was really on its way to notice the disappointment which was plainly depicted on the faces of Julie and Gerald They gazed at each other almost in dismay when they heard that their big sister was to accompany them but the joy in their brother s face and manner was all that was needed to reconcile the younger boy In the confusion caused by passengers entering the car with porters carrying their luggage Gerald managed to draw Julie aside and whisper to her Don t let on we didn t want Jane not on your life Dan wanted her and this journey s got just one object Dad says and that s to help Dan get well But Julie was too terribly disappointed to pretend that she was not I know all that she half sobbed and turned toward the window across the aisle but I was so happy when I s posed I was to cook for Dan and when you and I were to be the ones to take care of him But now Jane will get all the honor and everything and we ll have to be bossed around worse than if we were at home for Dad s there to take our part Gerald s clear hazel eyes gazed at his sister rebukingly Julie he said with an earnestness far beyond his years the train hasn t started yet and if you n I are going to think of ourselves we d better go back home Shall we Julie The little girl shook her head vigorously No no I don t want to go home She clung to the back of a seat as though she feared she were going to be taken forcibly from the train Gerald leaned over to whisper to her but he first gave her a little kiss on the ear then he said Julie you n I will have oodles of fun up there in the mountains If Jane isn t too snappish I ll be glad she s along because of course she ll be able to take care of Dan better than we could Then suddenly he laughed gleefully I ve got it he confided to the girl who had looked around curiously She could not imagine how Gerald could laugh when such a tragic thing had happened You re dippy about pretending Julie You once said you could pretend anything you wanted to and make it seem real Well here s your chance Every time Jane is snappy pretend she has said something pleasant That ll be a hard one but for Dan s sake I m willing to give it a try Julie s mania had always been pretending and she had often wished that Gerald would play it with her but he was a matter of fact sort of a lad and his reply had been that real things were fun enough for him The little girl s face brightened At last her brother was willing to play her favorite game That will be a hard one she agreed Then as she was lunged against the boy she also laughed Oh goodie she whispered Now the train is really started nobody can send us back home Honest I was skeered Jane might want to She thinks we re so terribly in the way Happy as Dan was because the sister he so loved was to accompany him to the West he did not forget the two who had been willing to go with him and care for him in the beginning and as soon as the train was well under way he called to the children Come here Julie I ve saved the window side of my seat for you and I m sure Jane will let Gerald sit by the window on her seat Now isn t this jolly The children wedged into the places toward which he was beckoning them Julie glanced almost fearfully up at the older girl she had accidentally jostled in passing but Jane was gazing out of the window deep in dreams Dan noticed his sister pal s expression How he hoped she was not regretting her hasty decision His fears were soon dispelled for Jane turned toward him with a tender light in her beautiful dark eyes Brother she said I have just been wondering how I can communicate with Marion Starr She expects to meet me at the Central Station at four It is now nearly noon I should have left some message for her We must send a telegram to her home when we reach Albany or sooner if we make a stop I ll ask the conductor Suppose you write out what you wish to say And so Jane took from her valise the very same little leather covered notebook in which less than a week before she had written a list of the things she would need for a wardrobe to be worn at the fashionable summer resort at Newport Of this Jane did not even think as she wrote after a thoughtful moment the ten words that were needed to tell her best friend that she was on her way West with her brother Dan who was ill and who needed her The conductor took the message and said that he expected to have an opportunity to send a telegram in a very short time The train soon stopped at a village where it was evidently flagged and the young people saw the station master running from the depot waving a yellow envelope The conductor received it at the same time giving him the paper on which Jane s message was written Please send this at once The sound of his voice came to them through Gerald s window Then the train started again and had acquired its former speed when the kindly conductor entered their car He was reading the telegram he had just received Stopping at their seats he asked Are you Daniel Abbott accompanied by Jane Julie and Gerald We are the tall lad replied in his friendly manner Have you a message from our father The conductor shook his head No not that This telegram is from the president of the railroad telling us that four young people named Abbott are his guests and he wishes them to receive every courtesy and now as it is noon if you will come with me I will escort you to the diner Oh but I m glad Julie who treated everyone with frank friendliness smiled brightly up into the face of the man whom she just knew must be a father he had such kind understanding eyes I m awful hungry aren t you Gerry she whispered a moment later as they filed down the aisle in procession the conductor first Jane next with Dan at the end as rear guard Julie tittered and Jane turned to frown at her Gerry poked his young sister with the reminder Pretend she smiled But frowns could not squelch Julie s exuberance when they were seated about a table in the dining car which was rapidly filling with their fellow travelers Ohee isn t this the jolliest I m going to pretend I m a princess and But the small girl paused and listened The head waiter was addressing Jane As guests of mister Bethel s he told them you may select whatever you wish from the menu Kindly write out your orders He handed them each an order slip and a pencil and then went on to another table Julie gave a little bounce of joy The real was so wonderful she would not have to pretend She and Gerald bowed their heads over a typed menu and then they began to scribble Dan glancing across at them smiled good naturedly What are you doing kiddies copying the entire menu he asked But Jane remarked rebukingly Julie Abbott do you wish people to think that you have been starved at home Tear those up at once Here are two others If you can t make them out properly I ll do it for you Dan saw a rebellious expression in Julie s eyes so he suggested Let them try once more Jane They can t learn any younger Just order a few things at first Gerry and then if you are still hungry you can have more Such a jolly time as the children had When the train turned sharply at a curve and the dishes slid about Julie laughed outright She purposely did not look at Jane She could pretend her big sister was smiling easier if she didn t see the frown But their fun was just beginning CHAPTER IX TELEGRAMS Although the children were greatly interested in all they saw nothing of an unusual nature had occurred when early one morning they reached Chicago The kindly conductor directed them to the other train that would bear them to their destination assuring them that on it also they would be guests of mister Bethel The four young people were standing on the outer edge of the hurrying throng gazing about them with interest as several hours would elapse before the departure of the west bound train when Jane was sure that she heard their name being called through a megaphone It s that man in uniform over by the gates He s calling Telegram for Jane Abbott Gerald told her May I go get it Dan May I The older boy nodded and the younger pushed through the crowd the others following more slowly Very quickly Gerald returned waving two yellow envelopes One was a night letter from Marion Starr Tearing it open Jane read Dearest friend As soon as I received your message I telephoned your father knowing that he could explain much more than you could in ten words What you are doing makes me love you more than I did before if that is possible My one wish is that I too might go West I like mountains far better than I do fashionable summer resorts Will write Your Merry The other telegram contained a short message but Jane looked up with tears in her eyes as she said It is from father and just for me Dan smiled down at her and asked no questions The few words were Thank you daughter for your self sacrifice Now I know that Dan will get well But their father did not know how serious Dan believed his condition to be And he shall not the girl decided not until I have good news to send As soon as they were seated in the train that was to take them the rest of the journey Jane said anxiously Dan dear aren t you trying too hard to keep up You look so very weak and weary Let s have the porter make up the lower berth even though it is still daytime You need a long rest Dan shook his head though he pressed her arm tenderly but a coughing spell racked his body when he tried to speak The conductor on the Rock Island was more practical than their former friend but not more kindly He motioned Jane to one side Miss Abbott he said there is a drawing room vacant Bride and groom were to have had it but the order has been canceled Since you are friends of mister Bethel I m going to put you all in there It will be more comfortable and you can turn in any time you wish Jane s gratitude was sincerely expressed It would give Dan just the opportunity he needed to rest and the lad nothing loath permitted Jane to have her way How elated the children were when they found that they were to travel in a room quite by themselves That evening they went to the diner alone but Gerald was not as pleased as was his sister I should think you d be tickled pink Julie said inelegantly to be able to order anything you choose and not have Jane peering at what you write The boy replied dismally I can t be much pleased about anything Don t you know Jane s staying with Dan cause she thinks he s too weak to come out here I heard her ask the porter to have their dinners brought in there Julie you and I ll have to keep quieter if we want to help Dan get well He s sicker than he was when we started I can see that easy The small girl was at once remorseful I m so glad you told me she said with tears in her dark violet eyes I ve just been thinking what a lot of fun we re having I ve been worse selfish than Jane was Seeing that her lips were quivering Gerald said consolingly No you haven t either Anyhow I think Dan s just tired out He ll be lots better in the morning You see if he isn t But when Dan awakened in the morning he was no better During the afternoon that their brother might try to sleep the conductor suggested that Julie and Gerald go out on the observation platform Is it quite safe for them out there alone Dan inquired They will not be alone was the reply I ll put them in the care of mister Packard with whom I am acquainted as he frequently travels over this line Julie had been very eager to ride on the observation platform but Jane had not wished to go outside because of the dust and cinders which she was sure she would encounter but now that the small girl was actually going she could hardly keep from skipping down the aisle as she followed the conductor with Gerald as rear guard There was only one occupant of the observation platform and to Gerald s delight he wore the wide brimmed Stetson hat which the boy had often seen on the screen I ll bet yo he s a cattle man I bet yo he is Gerry gleefully confided to his small sister while their guide said a few words to the Westerner Then turning the conductor beckoned to them The stranger arose and held out a strong brown hand to assist the little girl to a chair at his side How do you do Julie and Gerald he said including them both in his friendly smile Julie bobbed a little curtsy but Gerald s attempt at manners was rudely interrupted by the necessity of seizing his cap We have to watch out for our hats the stranger cautioned for now and then we are visited by a miniature whirlwind Gerald was almost bursting with eagerness Oh I say mister Packard he blurted out aren t you a reg lar er I mean a reg lar The boy grew red and embarrassed and so Julie went to his aid with mister Packard Gerry thinks maybe you re a cow man rancher like we ve seen in the moving pictures The bronzed face of the middle aged man wrinkled in a good natured smile I am the owner of a cattle ranch fifteen miles from Redfords he told them This information so delighted the boy that Julie was afraid he would bounce right over the rail Gee golly That s where we re going Redfords is Our daddy owns a cabin way up high on Mystery Mountain The man looked puzzled Mystery Mountain he repeated thoughtfully I don t seem to recall having heard of it Then practical little Julie put in Oh mister Packard that isn t its really truly name Our daddy called it that cause there s a lost mine on it and Dad said it was a mystery where it went to The man s face brightened O ho Then you must mean Redfords Peak That mine was found and lost again before I bought the Green Hills Ranch Quite a long while ago that was Gerry nodded agreement Yep Dan our big brother is most twenty one and he hadn t been born yet Then the boy s face saddened as he confided Dan s sick He s got a dreadful cough That s why we re going to Dad s cabin in the Rockies Our doctor said the al te tood would make him well Julie explained stopping after each syllable of the long word and saying it very thoughtfully Gerald looked up eagerly Do you think it will mister Packard Do you think Dan will get well The older man s reply was reassuring Of course he will Our Rocky Mountain air is a tonic that gives new life to everyone Are you three traveling alone Julie and Gerald solemnly shook their heads and the small girl in childish fashion put a finger on her lips as though to keep from saying something which she knew she ought not It was Gerald who replied Our big sister Jane is with us The boy said no more but mister Packard was convinced that devoted as the youngsters were to Dan Jane for some reason was not very popular with them Then as he did not wish to pry into their family affairs the genial rancher pointed out and described to fascinated listeners the many things of interest which they were passing The afternoon sped quickly and even when the dinner hour approached the children were loath to leave their new friend Me and Julie have to eat alone the small boy began but feeling a nudge he looked around to see his sister s shocked little mouth forming a rebuking O and so with a shake of his head he began again I mean Julie and I eat alone and gee golly don t I wish we could sit at your table mister Packard Don t I though The pleasure would be mine the man who was much amused with the children replied Then after naming an hour to meet in the diner the youngsters darted away and mister Packard laughed merrily It was quite evident that some one of their elders had often rebuked them for putting me at the beginning of a sentence he decided as he also arose and went within Meanwhile Julie and Gerald had quietly opened the door of the drawing room and finding Dan alone they told him with great gusto about their new friend mister Packard says he s a really truly neighbor of ours Gerry said How can he be a neighbor if he lives fifteen miles away I don t know Gerald but I suppose that he does Dan replied I would like to meet your new friend I ll try to be up tomorrow CHAPTER X A CATTLE MAN FRIEND The next day Dan seemed to be much better as the crisp morning air that swept into their drawing room was very invigorating By noon he declared that he was quite strong enough to go to the diner for lunch and while there the excited children pointed out to him their friend mister Packard That kindly man bowed and smiled noting as he did so that the older girl in their party drew herself up haughtily The observer who was an interested student of character did not find it hard having seen Jane to understand the lack of enthusiasm which the children had shown when speaking of her Not wishing to thrust his acquaintance upon the girl who so evidently did not desire it the man passed their table on his way from the diner without pausing It is true that Julie had made a slight move as though to call to him but this mister Packard had not seen as a cold rebuking glance from Jane s dark eyes had caused the small girl to sit back in her chair inwardly rebellious Dan noting this said I like your friend s appearance I think I shall go with you for a while to the observation platform I cannot breathe too much of this wonderful air Jane reluctantly consented to accompany them there Gee golly how I hope mister Packard is there Gerald whispered as he led the way The Westerner rose when the young people appeared and Jane quickly realized that he was not as uncouth as she had supposed all ranchers were Dan was made as comfortable as possible and he at once said mister Packard Gerald tells me that you are our neighbor That is indeed good news You have only one nearer neighbor the man replied and that is the family of a trapper named Heger They have a cabin high on your mountain Then turning toward Jane he said Their daughter whom they call Meg is just about your age I judge She is considered the most beautiful girl in the Redfords district Indeed for that matter she is the most beautiful girl whom I have ever seen and I have traveled a good deal How pleased Meg will be to have you all for near neighbors Jane s thoughts were indignant and her lips curled scornfully but as mister Packard s attention had been drawn to Gerald he did not know that his remarks had been received almost wrathfully Ranchers must have strange ideas of beauty she was assuring herself How this crude man could say that a trapper s daughter is the most beautiful girl he has ever met when he was looking directly at me is simply incomprehensible mister Packard is evidently a man without taste or knowledge of social distinctions Jane soon excused herself and going to their drawing room she attempted to read but her hurt vanity kept recurring to her and she most heartily wished she was back East where her type of beauty was properly appreciated It was not strange perhaps that Jane thought herself without a peer for had she not been voted the most beautiful girl at Highacres Seminary and many of the others had been the attractive daughters of New York s most exclusive families Dan returned to their drawing room an hour later apparently much stronger and filled with a new enthusiasm It s going to be great these three months in the West I m so glad that we have made the acquaintance of this most interesting neighbor He is a well educated man Jane Then glancing at his sister anxiously You didn t like him did you I wish you had for my sake and the children s Jane shrugged her slender shoulders Oh don t mind about me I can endure him I suppose Dan sighed and stretched out to rest until the dinner hour arrived Julie and Gerald joined them jubilantly declaring that they were to reach their destination the next morning before sun up Then we must all retire early Dan said This plan was carried out but for hours Jane sobbed softly into her pillow It was almost more than she could bear She had started this journey just on an impulse and she did want to help Dan who had broken down trying to work his way through college that there might be money enough to keep her at Highacres It was their father who had been inconsiderate of them If he had let the poor people lose the money they had invested rather than give up all he had himself she Jane could have remained at the fashionable seminary and Dan would have been well and strong Indeed everything would have been far better But the small voice in the girl s soul which now and then succeeded in making itself heard caused Jane to acknowledge Of course Dad is so conscientious he would never have been happy if he believed that his money really belonged to the poor people who had trusted him It was midnight before Jane fell asleep and it seemed almost no time at all before she heard a tapping on her door She sat up and looked out of the window Although the sky was lightening the stars were still shining with a wonderful brilliancy in the bit of sky that she could see Then a voice which she recognized as that of mister Packard spoke Time to get up young friends We ll be at Redfords in half an hour Gerald leaped to his feet when he heard the summons Then when he grasped the fact that they were nearly at their destination he gave a whoop of joy Hurry up Julie he shook his still sleeping young sister We are most to Mystery Mountain and Oh boy what jolly fun we re going to have Half an hour later mister Packard and the young Abbotts stood on a platform watching the departing train Then they turned to gaze about them It surely was a desolate scene The low log depot was the only building in sight and closing in about them on every side were silent dark fir clad mountains that looked bold and stern in the chill gray light of early dawn Jane shuddered How tragically far away from civilization from the gay life she so enjoyed all this seemed The station master a native grown too old for more active duty shuffled toward them chewing tobacco in a manner that made his long gray beard move sideways His near sighted eyes peered through his brass rimmed spectacles but when he recognized one of the new arrivals he grinned broadly In a high cracked voice he exclaimed Wall if tain t Silas Packard home again from the East Glad to git back to God s country ain t you now Si Brought a parcel of young folks along this trip Wall I don t wonder at it Your big place is sort o lonesome wi no wimmin folks into it What You don mean to tell me these here are Dan Abbott s kids Wall wall How de do Did I know yer pa Did I know Danny Abbott I reckon I was the furst man in these here parts that did know him He come to my camp nigh to the top of Redfords Peak the week he landed here from college The old man took off his bearskin cap and scratched his head Nigh onto twenty five year I make it Yep that s jest what twas That s the year we struck the payin streak over t other side of the mountain and folks flocked in here thicker n buzzards arter a dead sheep Yep that s the year the Crazy Creek Camp sprung up and that s how yer pa come to buy where he did Then encouraged by the interest exhibited by at least three of the young people the old man continued The payin streak where the camp was built headed straight that way and I sez to him sez I Dan Abbott sez I If I was you I d use the money I d fetched to get aholt of that one hundred sixty acres afore it s nabbed by these rich folks that s tryin to grab all the mines sez I That s what I d do And so Dan tuk it but as luck would have it that vein petered out to nothin an I allays felt mighty mean havin Dan stuck that way wi so much land an no gold on it but he sez to me Gabby that s my name Gabby sez he don go to feelin bad about it not one mite That place is jest what I ve allays wanted When a fellow s tired out there s nothin so soothin sez he as a retreat that s what he called it a retreat in the mountains But he didn t need one hundred sixty acres to retreat on so he let go all but ten He d built a log cabin on it that had some style not jest a shack like the rest of us miners run up then Dan went away for a spell but by and by he come back The old man s leathery face wrinkled into a broad smile An he didn t come back alone I reckon you young Abbotts know who twas he fetched back with him It was the purtiest gal ceptin one that I ever laid eyes on You re the splittin image of the bride Danny brought The small blue eyes that were almost hidden under shaggy gray brows turned toward Jane Yep you look powerful like your ma But Jane had heard only one thing which was that even this garrulous old man knew one other person whom he considered more beautiful How she wanted to ask the question but there was no time for Gabby never hesitated except to change the location of his tobacco quid or to do some long distance expectorating Turning to mister Packard he began again Meg Heger s took to comin down to Redfords school ag in She s packin a gun now That ol sneakin Ute is still trailin her I can t figger out what he wants wi her The slinkin coyote She ain t got nothin but beauty and Indians ain t so powerful set on that Thar sure sartin is a mystery somewhere The old man stopped talking to peer through near sighted eyes at the canon road I reckon here s the stage coach he told them late like it allays is If tain t the ho ses as falls asleep on the way then it s Sourface his self Si do yo mind the time when the stage was a goin down the Toboggan Grade It was quite evident that Gabby was launched on another long yarn but mister Packard laughingly interrupted placing a kindly hand on the old man s shoulder Tell us about that at another time Gab he said We re eager to get to the town and have some breakfast He picked up Jane s satchel and Dan s also and led the way to the edge of the platform where an old fashioned stage was waiting Four white horses stood with drooping heads and on the high seat another old man was huddled in a heap as though he felt the need of seizing a few moments rest before making the return trip to Redfords They have just come up the steep Toboggan Grade mister Packard said by way of explanation That s why the horses look tired Then in his cheerful way he shouted Hello there Wallace How goes it The man on the seat sat up and looked down at the passengers with an expression so surly on his leathery countenance that it was not hard for the young people to know why he had been given his nickname but he said nothing nor was there in his eyes a light of recognition With a grunt which might have been intended as a greeting he motioned them to get into the lower part of the stage which they did Then he jerked at the reins and the horses came to life and started back the way they had so recently come Gabby had followed them to the edge of the platform and as far as the Abbotts could make out he was still telling them the story which mister Packard had interrupted How cold it is Julie shivered as she spoke and cuddled close to Dan He smiled down at her and then said mister Packard this is wonderful air so crisp and invigorating I feel better already Honestly I ll confess now the last two days on the train I feared you would have to carry me off when we got here but now the lad paused and took a long breath of the mountain air I feel as though I had been given a new lease on life The older man laid a bronzed hand on the boy s sleeve Dan he said you have When you leave here in three months you ll be as well as I am and that s saying a good deal Then the lad surprised Jane by exclaiming Perhaps I won t want to leave There s a fascination to me about all this He waved his free arm out toward the mountains And your native characters mister Packard interest me exceedingly You see Dan smilingly confessed my ambition is to become a writer I would like to put Gabby into a story mister Packard s eyes brightened Do it Dan Do it he said with real enthusiasm Personally I can t write a line not easily but I have real admiration for men who can and I am a great reader Come over soon and see my library Then he cautioned I told you to write but don t begin yet Not until you are stronger Stay outdoors for a time boy Climb to the rim rock take notes and then later when you are strong you will find them of value While they had been talking the stage had started down a steep narrow canon The mountain walls on both sides were almost perpendicular and for a time nothing else was to be seen It was more than a mile in length and they could soon see the valley opening below them Redfords proper mister Packard smilingly told them as he nodded in that direction It is not much of a metropolis The young Abbotts looked curiously ahead wondering what the town would be like CHAPTER XI REDFORDS Is that all there is to the town of Redfords Jane gasped when the stage leaving Toboggan Grade reached a small circular valley which was apparently surrounded on all sides by towering timber covered mountains A stream of clear sparkling water rushed and swirled on its way through the narrow barren rock strewn lowland The rocks the very dust of the road were of a reddish cast That road yonder climbs your mountain in a zig zag fashion and then circles around it to the old abandoned mining camp Then to Gerald he said Youngster if you re pining for mystery that s where you ought to find one That deserted mining camp always looks to me as though it must have a secret perhaps more than one that it could tell and will not Ohee squealed Julie How interesting Gerry and I are wild to find a mystery to unravel Why do you think that old mining camp has secrets mister Packard Smiling at the little girl s eagerness the rancher replied Because it looks so deserted and haunted Then to Dan You heard what Gabby said at the depot Well he did not exaggerate A rich vein of gold was found on the other side of your mountain and a throng of men came swarming in from everywhere and just overnight or so it seemed buildings of every description were erected They did not take time to make them of permanent logs though there are a few of that description For several months they worked untiringly digging blasting searching everywhere but the vein which had promised so much ended abruptly Of course when the horde of men found that there was no gold they departed as they had come For a time after that a wandering tribe of Ute Indians lived there but the hunting was poor and as they too moved on farther into the Rockies where there are many fertile valleys Only one old Indian of whom Gabby spoke has remained They call him Slinking Coyote Why he stayed behind when his tribe went in search of better hunting grounds surely is a mystery Julie gave another little bounce of joy Oh goodie she cried Gerry there s two mysteries and maybe we ll find the answers to both of them I would rather find something to eat Jane said rather peevishly I never was obliged to wait so long for my breakfast in all my life It s one whole hour since we left the train She glanced at her wrist watch as she spoke mister Packard looked at her meditatively The other three Abbotts were as amiable as any young people he had ever met but Jane was surely the most fretful and discontented Although he knew nothing of all that had happened he could easily see that she at least was in the West quite against her will Well my dear young lady he said as he reached for her bag you won t have long to wait for even now we are in the town approaching the inn What Jane s eyes were wide and unbelieving Is this wretched log cabin place the only hotel She peered out of the stage window and saw two cowboys lounging on the porch and each was chewing a toothpick They were picturesquely dressed in fringed buckskin trousers soft shirts carelessly knotted bandannas and wide Stetson hats Their ponies were tied in front as were several other lean restless horses mister Packard nodded Yes this is the inn and the general store and the postoffice Across the road is another building just like it and that has a room in front which is used as a church on Sunday and a school on weekdays while in back there is a billiard room There are no saloons now this was addressed to Dan which is certainly a good thing for Redfords Billiard room church and a school house all in one building Jane repeated in scornful amazement But where are the houses Where do the townspeople live mister Packard smiled at her There aren t any he said The ranchers cowboys mountaineers and summer tourists are the patrons of the inn and billiard rooms But here we are The stage had stopped in front of the rambling log building and reluctantly Jane followed the others mister Packard held the screen door open for the young people to pass then taking Jane s arm he piloted her through the front part of the building which was occupied by the postoffice and store to the room in the rear where were half a dozen bare tables Each had in the center a vinegar cruet a sugar bowl salt and pepper shakers At least they were clean but the dishes were so coarse that had not Jane been ravenously hungry she told herself she simply could not have eaten mister Packard led the way to the largest table at which there were six places and as soon as they were seated a comely woman entered through a swinging green baize door Howdy mister Packard she said in response to the rancher s cordial greeting Jean Sawyer your foreman was in last night an left your hoss for yo He said as how he was expectin yo in some time today You ve fetched along some visitors I take it The woman looked at the older girl with unconcealed admiration The blood rushed to Jane s face Was this innkeeper s wife going to tell her that she had never seen but one other girl who was more beautiful But missus Bently made no personal comment When mister Packard explained that his companions were the young Abbotts and that they were to spend the summer in a cabin on Redford Mountain her only remark was Is it the cabin that s been standin empty so long the one that s a short piece down from where Meg Heger lives Yes that s it missus Bently Then the man implored Please bring us some of your good ham and eggs and coffee and There s plenty of waffle dough left if the young people likes em The woman smiled at Julie who beamed back at her Oh boy Gerald chimed in Me for the waffles The cooking was excellent and even the fastidious Jane thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast When they emerged from the inn Dan said regretfully The sun is high up We ve missed our first sunrise We were on the Toboggan Grade when the sun rose mister Packard told them He then shook hands with Jane and Dan as he said heartily Here is where we part company That is my horse over yonder A beauty isn t he Silver I call him By the way Dan I want you to meet Jean Sawyer He is just about your age and a fine fellow if I am a judge of character I would trust him with anything I have In fact I do I send him all the way to the city often to get money from the bank to pay off the men I know he isn t dishonest and yet for some reason he ran away from his home You know we have a code out here by which each man is permitted to keep his own counsel We ask no one from whence he came or why We take people for what they seem to be with no knowledge of their past Then breaking off abruptly the older man repeated I would indeed like you to meet Jean and tell me what you think of him Come over to our place soon or better still since that is a rough trip until you get hardened to the saddle I ll send him over to call on you next Sunday Dan s face brightened Great mister Packard do that A chap whom you so much admire must be worth knowing Have him take dinner with us Goodbye and thank you for being our much needed guide When their neighbor and friend had swung into his saddle and had ridden away Jane said fretfully I don t see why you asked that Jean Sawyer who may be an outlaw for all we know to come over to our place for dinner Then when she saw the expression of troubled disappointment in her brother s face again the small voice within rebuked her and she implored Oh Dan don t mind me I know I am horridly selfish but I am so tired and these people are all so queer What are we to do next The older lad knew what an effort Jane was making and he held her arm affectionately close as he replied mister Packard said that the stage would call for us at eight thirty We will have half an hour to purchase our supplies Grandmother made out a list of things we would need Julie has that Jane here is my wallet I wish you would take charge of our funds You won t be climbing around as I will It will be safer with you Together the girls went into the store and purchased the supplies they would need Then they rejoined the boys who had waited outside Gerry wanted to look in the school house The Abbotts found the door of the rambling log cabin across from the inn standing open and they peered in curiously The room was long and well lighted by large windows but it was quite like any other country school There were eight rows of benches one back of the other with a shelf like desk in front of each These had many an initial carved in them The teacher s table and chair faced the others with a blackboard hanging on the wall at the back Near the door was a pail and a dipper Dan smiled It doesn t look as though genius could be awakened here does it he was saying when a pleasant voice back of them caused them to turn You re wrong there my friend The young people saw before them a withered up little old man with the whitest of hair reaching to his shoulders Noting their unconcealed astonishment he continued by way of introduction I am Preacher Bellows on Sunday and Teacher Bellows on weekdays Now as I was saying having overheard your remark this little schoolroom and the teacher who presides over it are proud to tell you that your statement is not correct It may not look as though genius could be awakened here he smiled most kindly I ll agree that it does not but that is just what has happened Meg Heger one of my mountain girls has written some beautiful things Her last composition Sunrise From the Rim Rock is truly poetical Jane turned away impatiently Was she never to be through with hearing about Meg Heger Brother the manner in which she interrupted the conversation was almost rude isn t that the stage returning I am so tired I do want to get up to our cabin She started to cross the street Dan quickly joined her He did not rebuke her for not having said goodbye to the teacher He s a nice man isn t he Dan Gerald skipped along by his brother s side as he spoke He loves mountain people doesn t he Dan smiled down at the eager questioner Why of course he must if he practices what I suppose he preaches the brotherhood of man Well I certainly don t want to claim people like the ones we have met in Redfords as any kin of mine Jane snapped as they all crossed to the stage that awaited them Again the four white horses drooped their heads and the driver slouched on his high seat as though at every opportunity they took short naps But the horses came to life when the driver snapped his long whip and with much jolting they forded the stream Oh my I m cited as anything Julie squealed Wish something Gerald cause this is the first time we ve ever been up our very own mountain road There s just one thing to wish for the small boy said with the seriousness which now and then made him seem older than his years and that s that Dan will get well What do you wish Jane Why the same thing of course the girl replied languidly Gerald continued his questioning What do you wish Dan The boy thought for a moment and then he exclaimed I have a wonderful thing to wish Wouldn t it be great if we could find the lost gold vein on our very own ten acres Then Dad could pay the rest that he owes and be free from all worry Me too Julie cried jubilantly Now we ve all wished and here we go up the mountain The road was narrow In some places it was barely wide enough for the stage to pass and as Jane looked back and down she shuddered many times At last when nothing happened and the old stage did stick to the road Jane consented to look around at the majestic scenery about which the others were exclaiming Beyond the gorge like valley in which was Redfords one mountain range towered above another while many peaks were crowned with snow dazzling in the light of the sun that was now high above them The air was becoming warmer but it was so wonderfully clear that even things in the far distance stood out with remarkable detail At a curve Gerald pointed to the road where it circled above them Gee whiliker Look it he cried excitedly How that boy can ride The others turning saw a pony which seemed to be running at breakneck speed but as the stage appeared around the bend the small horse was halted so suddenly that it reared When it settled back on all fours the watchers saw that instead of a boy the rider was a girl slender of build wiry alert She drew to one side close to the mountain to permit the stage to pass She wore a divided skirt of the coarsest material a scarlet blouse but no hat Her glossy black wind blown hair fluttered loosely about her slim shoulders Her dusky eyes looked curiously out at them from between long curling lashes Dan thought he had never before seen such wonderful eyes but it only took a moment for the stage to pass They all turned to look down the road The pony was again leaping ahead as sure footed evidently as a mountain goat the girl leaning low in the saddle Jane s lips were curled scornfully Well if that is their mountain beauty I think they have queer taste She looked to me very much like an Indian didn t she to you Dan The boy replied frankly I should say she might be Spanish or French but I do indeed think she is wonderfully beautiful I never saw such eyes They seem to have slumbering soul fires just waiting to be kindled I should like to hear her talk Jane shrugged her shoulders Well I certainly should not I have heard enough of this mountain dialect if that s what you call it to last me the rest of my life I simply will not make the acquaintance of that Oh it doesn t matter what she is she hurried on to add when she saw that Dan was about to speak I don t want to know her and do please remember that all of you Gee sis Gerald blurted out you don t like the West much do you I s pose you wish you had stayed at home or gone to that hifalutin watering place Jane bit her lips to keep from retorting angrily Julie was still watching the small horse that now and then reappeared as the zigzagging mountain road far below them came in sight That girl s going to school I guess Though I should think it would be vacation time now it s summer she remarked I rather believe that winter is vacation time for mountain schools It s mighty cold here for a good many months and the roads are probably so deep in snow that they are not passable Dan had just said this when Gerald who had been kneeling on the seat watching intently ahead whirled toward them with a cry of joy There s our log cabin on that ledge up there I bet you tis Gee whiliker we re stopping Hurray It s ours CHAPTER XII THE ABBOTT CABIN It was quite evident that the picturesque log cabin which nestled against the side of the mountain on a wide overhanging ledge was indeed their own The road curved about twenty feet below it and crude steps had been hewn out of the rocks The small boy tumbled out of the stage almost before it came to a standstill Oh Julie look it will you We ve got a real stairway leading right up to our front door I ll beat you to the cabin Julie equally excited scurried up after her brother and reached the top almost as soon as he did Then they turned and shouted joyfully to the two below them Jane Dan Look at us We re top of the world Oh boy Gerald capered about unable to stand still I m glad I came I bet you Julie we ll have a million adventures maybe more But Dan was calling and so they scampered back down the rocky flight of stairs The older lad laughed at their enthusiasm I know just how you feel he told them If I weren t afraid of shocking your sedate sister here I believe I would well I don t know just what I would do Stand on your head Gerald prompted Do it Dan I ll dare you But the older boy was needed just then to tell the surly driver where the trunks were to be put Let me help you mister Wallace Dan made an attempt to take one end of a trunk but the husky man with the unchangeable countenance merely grunted his dissent and swinging a trunk up on his broad shoulders he began the ascent of the steep stone stairs quite as though it were not a herculean task Dan followed Just leave them on the porch until we get our bearings he directed We can move them in after we have unpacked Then from the loose change that he had in his pocket he paid the man A few moments later the stage rumbled on its way up the road which circled the mountain and then descended to a hamlet in the valley on the other side As soon as the four young Abbotts were alone Dan slipping an arm about Jane exclaimed Think of it sister Isn t it almost beyond comprehension that we have such magnificence right in our front door yard He took a long breath The pine trees though not large were spicily fragrant Then whirling toward her he caught both of her hands and there were actually tears in his eyes as he said Jane I m going to live I know that I am Selfish as the girl was she could not but respond to her brother s enthusiasm The younger children had raced away on a tour of discovery Their excited voices were heard exclaiming about something they had discovered beyond the cabin Clear and high Gerry s voice rang out Dan Jane come quick We ve found Roaring Creek and it isn t making a terrible lot of noise at all But the older boy had noted the extreme weariness on his sister s face He well knew that she had sacrificed herself to come to a country which did not appeal to her where she had to meet people whom she considered far beneath her and she had done it all to help him get well Instantly the boy decided that he would make Jane s comfort his first care that her stay with him might be as pleasant as possible and so he called back After a time Gerald Come on I m going to unlock the door Don t you want to see what s on the inside of our cabin Oh boy don t I though Gerry closely followed by Julie raced back to the wide front porch which was made of logs Dan took from his satchel a very large key and holding it up he called merrily The key to health and happiness You left out something Gerry prompted It s health wealth and happiness Maybe we ll find that lost mine who knows Dan merely laughed at that Now he said as he put the key in the lock what do you suppose we ll find on the other side of this door What they saw delighted the hearts of three of the young people A large log cabin room with a long window on either side of the door At the back was a crude fireplace made of rocks There was no window on that side of the room as a wall of the mountain came so close to the cabin that there would have been no view The rafters were logs with the bark still on and the furniture had been made of saplings There were leather cushions in the chairs but the thing that made Gerald caper about mad with joy was a bearskin on one of the walls Oh look it will you Dan What kind of a bear is it Do you think it is a grizzly and do you s pose it s that one Dad said came right down here to our ledge Do you Dan The older boy looked at the rather small bearskin and shook his head No it isn t a grizzly he said I think it is the skin of a black bear But here is another on the floor in front of the fireplace That s Dad s bear I remember now This old fellow was the grizzly who was unfortunate enough to come down here to try to help himself to Dad s supplies Jane had dropped wearily into a big chair that really was comfortable with its leather covered cushions and Dan noting how tired she was exclaimed Jane I ll unlock the packing trunk and get out some of the bedding and if you wish you may lie down for a while Dad said there were two good beds here and several cots Gerald and Julie had darted through a door at one side and reappearing they beckoned to their big brother We ve found one of em the younger lad announced It s in a dandee room I bet you Jane will choose it for hers Then Julie chimed in with Jane please come and see it The older girl who was feeling terribly sorry for herself rose languidly and went with the small sister The boys followed Why what a nice room this is Dan truly pleased remarked Then anxiously and in his voice there was a note that was almost imploring he asked Jane dear don t you think you can be comfortable in here The girl s heart was touched by the tone more than the words and she turned away that she might not show how near how very near she had been to crying out her unhappiness It was hardship to her to be in a log cabin where there were none of the luxuries and conveniences to which she had been used She smiled at her brother but he saw her lips tremble He was tempted to tell her to go back to civilization since it was all going to be so hard for her but something prompted him to wait one week Inwardly he resolved If Jane is not happy here by one week from today I am going to insist that she return to Newport and to the friend Merry for whom she cares so much But Jane too had been making a resolve and so when she spoke her voice sounded more cheerful It is a nice room she said That wide window has a wonderful view of the mountains and the valley It was hard to keep from adding If anyone cares for such a view which I do not But instead she looked up at the rafters What are those great bundles that are hanging up there she inquired Dan laughed Why those bundles Dad said contain the mattress and bedding which he and mother stored away They are wrapped in canvas and so he expected that we would find them in good condition But how are we to get them Julie wanted to know Gerald s quick eyes found the answer to that Look it he cried pointing There s a ladder nailed right against the back wall I ll skin up that in two jiffs Give me your knife Dan I ll cut the ropes The boy was soon sliding along a rafter Out of the way down below there he shouted the warning Here they come There was a soft thud followed by another as the two great bundles fell to the floor An excellent mattress was in one of them and clean warm blankets in the other Now I ll get the sheets from the packing trunk and a pillow case and in less than no time at all we ll have a fine bed in our lady s chamber Dan led Jane to another large comfortable though rustic chair as he said The rest of us are going to pretend that you are a princess today and we are going to wait upon you By tomorrow when you have had a long sleep perhaps you will want to be a mountain girl Again there was the yearning note in his voice How he hoped that Jane would want to stay but a week would tell Jane was quite willing to pretend that she was a princess and be waited upon and so half an hour later when the bed in her room was made she consented to lie down and try to make up the many hours of sleep that she had lost on the train Hardly had her head touched the pillow before she was sound asleep Two of her windows that swung inward were wide open and a soft mountain breeze wafted to her the scent of the pines Even though she was not conscious of it the peace of the mountains was quieting her restless soul She had supposed that as soon as she were alone she would sob out her unhappiness but her weariness had been too great and not a tear had been shed Julie reported that Jane had gone right to sleep and Dan s face brightened Surely his sister pal would feel better when she awakened and how could she help loving it all so high up on their wonderful mountain The younger children had gone on another trip of exploration and soon burst back into the big living room with the information that on the other side of the cabin there were two smaller bedrooms and a real kitchen Dan held up a warning hand and framed the word quiet with his lips and so the excited children took his hands and dragged him from the deep easy chair where he had sought to rest for a moment and showed him what lay behind the two doors on the other side of the cabin Aren t these little bedrooms the cunningest Julie whispered See the front one has a bed in it like Jane s and the other has the cot But there are three of us so what shall we do Julie s brown eyes were suddenly serious and inquiring That s easy Dan told her Dad said there were several cots See there they are hanging up on the rafters I shall take one of those and put it out on the wide front porch That s where I want to sleep I don t want to be shut in by walls And Julie may have this pretty front room with the bed and Gerald the other Now let s get them made up just as quietly as we can Then we will unpack the supplies that you got from the store Julie and prepare a noon meal The cots were untied from the rafters and one was placed on the porch in the position chosen by Dan then the bedding was put on all of them and it was eleven o clock and the sun was riding hot and high above the mountain when Julie suddenly becoming demure announced that she wanted Dan to go to sleep also and that she and Gerald would get the lunch The older boy did not require much urging and when he saw the eager light in the eyes of the little girl who had in the beginning supposed that she alone was to be the one to take care of him he decided to do as she wished Julie had had six months training with her grandmother who believed that a girl could not begin too young to learn how to cook and she had often boasted that she had a very apt pupil He soon heard the children whispering and laughing happily at the back of the cabin then a door was closed softly and the lad heard only the soughing in the pine trees close to the porch and the humming of the winged insects far and near Then he too fell into a much needed slumber CHAPTER XIII TWO LITTLE COOKS The kitchen of the log cabin had one window and a door which opened out into what Gerry called the back yard part of their ledge It was only about fifty feet to the very edge and Gerry crept on hands and knees to look over that he might see where their back yard went He lifted a face filled with awe and beckoned his sister to advance with caution Lying flat the two children gazed over the rim of the ledge straight down a wall of rock far below which the road could be seen curving Ohee Julie drew back with a shudder What if our cabin should slide right off this shelf that it s built on It can t if it wants to the boy told her confidently We re safe here as anything That s two ways a bear can t come he continued but on the other side where the creek is and in front where the stone steps are I suppose the bear came in one of those two ways The small girl looked frightened Oh Gerry she said what if a bear should come again What would we do Why Dan would shoot it just the way Dad did the boy replied with great assurance His big brother was his hero and that he could not perform any feat required was not to be thought of for one moment But Dan hasn t a gun has he Julie was not yet convinced Indeed he has silly Do you s pose Dad would let us come into this wild country without guns Dan has two in his trunk One s a big fellow Dad let me hold it once and Oh boy I m telling you it s a heavy one I most had to drop it and I ve got bully muscle Look at what muscle I ve got Gerry crooked his bare arm but his sister turned away impatiently saying Oh I don t want to You make me feel what muscle you ve got most every day Julie returned to the kitchen but Gerry followed and if he were offended by her lack of interest in his brawniness he did not show it He was far too interested in the subject under discussion That big gun I was telling you about is the very one Dad used when he shot the grizzly and if it shot one bear then of course it can shoot another bear The little girl was convinced That seemed clear reasoning but she interrupted when the boy began again by saying Gerald Abbott do stop telling bear stories and help me clean up this kitchen Jane won t be any more use than nothing and we might as well do things and pretend she isn t here the way I wish she wasn t I sort of wish she hadn t come myself Gerry confessed Now let s see Here s a cupboard all nailed up I guess I can pull out the nails but first I d better make a fire in this old stove I ll have to fetch in some wood No you won t Not just at first There s a box full behind the stove Big knotty pieces pine I suppose but maybe we do need some kindling Then bring me some water from the creek and I ll wash up everything Dad said we d find some dishes in the cupboard if they hadn t been stolen Gee I hope they haven t The boy who was as handy about a home as was his small sister soon had a fire in the stove and then having found a pail he went to the creek stealing around past the front porch and under his sister s window as quietly as he possibly could Although dry twigs creaked and snapped the two sleepers did not waken Such fun as those youngsters had putting the kitchen in order In the cupboard they found all of the dishes which their father had mentioned Although the china was coarse the green fern pattern was attractive Gerald standing on a chair handed it out piece by piece to the small girl who put them in hot sudsy water and then dried them till they shone Gerald meantime was washing the shelves Then they replaced the dishes and stood back to admire their handiwork Oh aren t we having fun Julie chuckled Now we re all ready to get the lunch It was one o clock when Julie went to waken Jane and Gerald at the same time went out on the porch where Dan had been sleeping but the older boy was sitting up on the edge of his cot drinking in the beauty of the scene which to him was an ever changing marvel He sprang up wonderfully refreshed and going to the packing trunk he procured a towel Hello Jane he called brightly to the tall girl who appeared in the open door Then he gave a long whistle Sister he exclaimed love and admiration ringing in his voice I hope that Jean Sawyer who is coming to dine with us day after tomorrow has a heart of adamant I pity him if he hasn t I honestly never saw anyone so beautiful as you are with the flush of slumber on your cheeks and your eyes so bright Jane came out smiling This was the sort of adulation she desired and required but her brother felt a twinge of guilt for even as he had been talking he had seen in memory a slender alert little creature with eyes star like in their dusky radiance gazing out at him from under dark curling lashes But they were so unlike these two he told himself The one proud imperious ultra civilized the other a wild thing untamed or so she had appeared to him in that one moment s glance a native of the mountains Where are you going with that towel Jane asked him The lad laughingly dived again into the packing trunk and brought out another Let s go to the creek to wash he suggested I haven t even seen it yet and I m ever so eager to feel that cold mountain water dash into my face Then in a low tone he whispered close to his sister s ear The children have a surprise for us Jane and so let s be very much surprised and not disappoint them Jane shrugged To her children and their ways had to be endured but she took no interest in what they did or did not do However she accompanied her brother around the house She glanced at him with a sense of satisfaction which was as usual prompted by selfishness If Dan seemed so much better in one day he might be so well by the end of a fortnight that she would not need to remain with him If she were sure that all was to be well with him she would return to Merry The lad not dreaming what her thoughts were caught her hand boyishly Oh Jane he cried as he pointed ahead can you believe it Sister pal that is our very own mountain stream Isn t it a beauty The sunlight falling between the pines lighted the narrow rushing whirling little mountain brook which sparkled and seemed to sing for the very joy of being Standing on its edge Dan looked up the mountain along the course the brook had come See he cried jubilantly wherever the sunlight filters through it gleams as though it were laughing Dad said that it springs out just below the rim rock Oh I do hope by next week I will be able to climb up that high Jane s glance followed her brother s up the rough rocky mountain side and she shook her head I ll never attempt it she decided but Dan whirled laughing defiance I m going to prophesy that you ll climb the rim rock before a fortnight is over Then kneeling he splashed the clear cold water in his face and reached for the towel that Jane held Then he implored her to do the same With great reluctance she complied and so cool and restful did she find it that she actually smiled almost with pleasure But Dan had the misfortune to say the wrong thing just then I suppose this brook or one like it is all the mirror that the mountain girl Meg Heger has ever had he began when he sensed a chill in his sister s reply I certainly do not know nor do I care Then she added as an afterthought And I shall never find out CHAPTER XIV FRETFUL JANE Luckily Dan had succeeded in changing his sister s thought before they returned to the cabin and he vowed inwardly that he would never again mention Meg Heger since Jane had taken such a strange dislike to her How one could dislike a girl one had barely seen was beyond his comprehension but girls were hard to understand all except Julie She was just a wholesome helpful little maid with a pug nose that was always freckled Now for the surprise Dan said as they neared the cabin Well I certainly hope it is something to eat Jane began with little interest but when the two children threw open the front door and she saw the table in the living room close to the wide window with four places set she delighted the little workers by announcing that it was the best sight she had beheld that day Then when Jane and Dan were seated Julie and Gerry skipped to the kitchen and returned with as tempting a lunch as even Jane could have wished for There was creamed tuna on toast and jam and a heaping plate of lettuce sandwiches and two of the Rockyford melons for which Colorado is famous Then there was for each a glass of creamy milk Great Dan exclaimed I didn t know we were going to be able to get milk Julie nodded eagerly It comes from the Packard ranch fresh to the inn every day and missus Bently said she would send us two quarts every time the stage comes up our road which usually is three times a week We can keep it cool as anything in the creek missus Bently told us how After lunch can we get out the guns Dan Gerald asked when he had hungrily gulped down a sandwich Why I guess so the older boy laughed good naturedly You aren t expecting a bear to find out this soon are you that we have some supplies that he might wish to devour Julie looked anxiously toward the open door of the cabin Don t you think maybe we d better keep that door closed when we re eating she asked anxiously You know Dad said he and mother were sitting right here where we are maybe one morning at breakfast when mother looked up and there was an old grizzly standing in the open door He had been around to the kitchen and had eaten up all the supplies he could find and he was hunting for more Gerald chimed in with It was lucky Dad kept his big gun always standing in the corner I suppose it was right there near you Dan so he could just grab it and shoot The children were watching the door as though they expected at any minute that another grizzly might appear Dan laughed at them We might as well have stayed at home if we are going to stay in the cabin and keep the door closed he told them I m going to suggest that we put the table on that nice porch just outside of the kitchen That will make an ideal outdoor dining room with a big pine tree back of it to shelter us from the sun It will be handy to the kitchen and what is more a bear simply could not scale up that wall beyond the ledge Then very seriously the older brother addressed the younger two Julie I don t want you or Gerald to go close to that cliff It s too dangerous Honest Gerald blurted in with We did go once Dan We squirmed out on our tummies till we could look way down and I tell you it made us dizzy We won t ever want to do it again After lunch the children announced that they would do up the dishes if Dan would give them a lesson in shooting the big gun when they were through Well the older boy smilingly conceded I ll try to teach you to handle the smaller gun yes both of you he assured Julie who was making an effort to attract his attention by motions behind Jane s back You really ought to both know how to use it You might need to know how some time to protect yourselves What shall you do Jane while we are learning to shoot Julie inquired when the kitchen had again been tidied and the children were ready for their very first lesson with the small gun Maybe Jane ll want to learn too Gerald suggested but the older girl declared that she simply could not and would not touch one of the dreadful things Won t you come with us and watch the fun Dan lingered when the two active youngsters had bounded out of the cabin But the girl shook her head It wouldn t be fun to me she said fretfully I d much rather be left all alone I want to write a long letter to Merry She will be eager to hear from me just as I am from her There was a self pitying tone in the girl s voice and a slight quiver to her lips She turned hastily into her room and closed the door She did not want Dan to see the tears The lad went out on the wide front porch and stood for a moment with folded arms his gray eyes gazing across the sun shimmered valley but he was not conscious of the grandeur of the scene He was regretting deeply regretting that he had permitted his sister to come to a country so distasteful to her He well knew that she had shut herself in her room to sob out her grief and disappointment and then perhaps to write it all to this friend of whom she so often spoke and whom she seemed to love so dearly Once Dan turned toward the door as though to return to the cabin His impulse was to go to Jane and tell her not to unpack The stage would be passing there again on the following day and if she wished she could go back to the East In fact the lad almost believed that if Jane went it might hasten his recovery Her evident unhappiness was causing him to worry and that was most detrimental With a deep sigh of resignation he did turn toward the open door bent on carrying out his resolve but a cry of alarm from Julie sent him running around the cabin and up toward the brook He met the children white faced big eyed hurrying toward him Gerald carrying the small gun What is it Gerry What have you seen to frighten you He looked about as he spoke but saw nothing but the jagged mountain side the rushing whirling brook and the peaceful old pines But it was quite evident by the expressions of the two children that they at least thought they had seen something of a dangerous nature Gerald pointed toward a clump of low growing pines on the other side of the brook as he said in a tense half whispered voice Whatever twas Dan it s hiding in there Then he explained Julie and I were crossing the water on those big stones when snap something went I whirled to look Honest I expected to see a grizzly but there wasn t anything at all in sight Julie and I stood just as still as we could we didn t even make a sound Then we saw those bushy trees moving though there wasn t a bit of wind so we know whatever tis it s in there While the small boy had been talking Dan had been loading the gun You d better let me go alone he said to the children but their disappointed expressions caused him to add At least let me go ahead and if I think best for you to come I ll beckon Dan crossed the brook on the big stones and went toward the clump of small stubby pines Then he stood still watching the dense low trees intently His heart beat rapidly not from fear for he almost hoped that it might be a grizzly and yet would it not be unwise to shoot at it with a small gun It might infuriate a huge beast and so endanger all of their lives But although he waited watching and listening for many minutes no sound was heard He began to believe that the children had imagined the stealthy noise they thought they had heard for after all they had not really seen anything and so he beckoned them to join him They leaped across the brook and were quickly at his side Wasn t it a bear or a wildcat or anything Gerald asked eagerly Dan shook his head as he replied with a laugh Don t be too disappointed youngsters even if you don t see everything on the first day This time it was just a false alarm But Dan was mistaken for from a safe hiding place the old Indian Slinking Coyote was watching their every move Why don t we shoot into that pine brush anyway Julie suggested We might scare out whatever is hiding there But Dan didn t wish to do this He felt that it would be safer to have the larger gun with him before he started beating up hidden wild creatures of any kind Come along youngsters let s get back on the home side of our brook and set up a target the older boy suggested as he crossed the brook followed by the children In their door yard Dan paused and looked about meditatively I want to set up a target near enough to be within call and yet far enough away to keep from disturbing Jane too much with our racket Oh I know Gerald cried Over there just above where the road bends That ll be a dandee place Won t it Dan The older boy smiled his agreement I do believe it will do as well as any place They went toward the spot indicated and Dan continued Suppose we choose a cone on that lowest pine branch If a bullet hits it the cone will surely fall Now Gerald just to be polite shall we let Julie try first The boy nodded his eyes shining with eagerness Sure How many tries do we each get Three Any number you wish is all right with me Then Dan placed the small gun in the position that Julie was to hold it showed her how to look along the barrel and how to take aim Hold it steady One two three go But no report was heard What s the matter chick a biddie Dan was surprised to see how white the small girl s face had become and to note that her arm was shaking so that she could hardly hold the gun I m scared she confessed I don t know why but I am Dan She dropped the gun and ran to his arms Then she smiled up through her tears I guess I m afraid to hear the noise Pooh pooh That s just like a girl said Gerry almost scornfully Anyhow you don t need to learn to shoot Dan or I ll always be around to protect you n Jane Can I have a try now Dan Can I The older lad turned to the small girl Suppose we let Gerald practice today and later when you feel that you would like to try again you may do so This plan seemed quite satisfactory to Julie who seated herself upon a rock which overhung the curving mountain road and was about twenty feet above it Gerald instead of dreading the noise that the small gun would make was eager to hear it and after repeated trials he managed to dislodge the brown cone Hurray I did it Bully for me I m a marksman now Isn t that what I am Dan Now I ll pick out another one and I bet you I ll hit it first shot Julie having wearied of the constant report of the small gun had wandered away in search of wild flowers The boys saw her running toward them beckoning excitedly Dan she said in a low voice Come on over here and look down at the road The queerest man seems to be hiding I was so far up above him he didn t see me He s hiding back of some rocks watching the road Who do you suppose he is Dan looked troubled He thought at once that it might be the old Ute Indian who had not gone with his tribe when they went in search of better hunting grounds nor was he wrong Very quietly the three went to the rim of their ledge About twenty feet below they beheld a most uncouth creature crouching behind a big boulder Evidently he was intently watching the road as it wound up from Redfords His cap was of black fur with a bushy tail hanging down at the back They could not see his face as they were above him Julie clung fearfully to her brother Oh Dan she whispered What do you suppose he s watching for Before Dan could decide what he ought to do a pounding of horse s feet was heard just below the bend and a wiry brown pony leaped into view The old Indian sprang from his hiding place so suddenly that the small horse reared but the rider her dark face flushed her wonderful eyes flashing angrily cried What did I tell you last time you stopped me Didn t I say I d shoot You know I pack a gun and I never miss I can t give you any more money I m saving all I can to go away to school I ve told you that before and if you are my father as you re always telling me that you are you d ought to be glad if I m going to have a chance The old Indian whined something which Dan could not hear Impatiently the girl took from her pocket a coin and tossed it to him I don t believe you re hungry You don t need to be with squirrels as thick as they are You ll spend all I give you on fire water if you can get it Already the old Indian evidently satisfied with what he had received had started shambling down the road in the direction of the town but the girl turned in the saddle to call after him Mind you that s the last time I ll give you money I don t believe that you are my father and neither does Mammy Heger She might have been talking to the wind for all the attention the old Indian paid His pace had increased as the descent became steeper Dan felt guilty because he had overheard a conversation not meant for his ears and he drew the children away toward the cabin and so heard rather than saw the girl s rapid flight up the road The chivalry of the ages stirred in his heart It s a wicked shame that she hasn t a brother to protect her he thought A young girl ought not to be tormented by such a coward Slinking Coyote that s what he is Blackmailing it would be called in civilized countries Dan s indignation increased as he recalled how wonderfully beautiful the girl had looked when her dark eyes had flashed in anger I d be far more inclined to think her a daughter of noble birth His thoughts were interrupted by Julie who believing that they were a safe distance from the road asked anxiously Who was the awful looking man Dan Will he hurt us The same question had presented itself to Dan but he made himself say lightly Oh no That old Indian isn t at all interested in us He evidently is just a beggar He was asking the mountain girl for money and she gave it to him Then as an afterthought he cautioned Don t mention having seen him to Jane will you children Willingly they agreed They were indeed pleased to share a secret with their big brother Julie chattered on Dan I d like to go up and see that nice girl Do you think she d let me ride on her pony May Gerald and I go up there tomorrow Dan forced himself to smile He did not want either of his companions to know that he was troubled Yes we ll go up there tomorrow I would like to meet the trapper who is I believe the father of that little horsewoman But even as he spoke Dan recalled that the slinking Indian had insisted that he was her father and that the girl did not believe it When he reached the cabin Jane was still shut in her room The children declared that they were hungry as wolves and that they would get the evening meal and so the older lad seated himself on the edge of the front porch to think over all that he had seen and heard and decide what it would be best for him to do Perhaps after all he had been unwise to bring either of the girls to a place so wild Perhaps he ought to send them both home He and Gerald could protect themselves if there were to be trouble of any kind He decided that the very next day as soon as the mountain girl had gone to the Redfords school he would climb up the road to the cabin which he believed was just about a mile above them Then he could discover from the trapper if any real danger might lurk on the mountain for the two Eastern girls CHAPTER XV MEG HEGER To the surprise of the young people almost as soon as the sun had set night descended upon them Dan had helped the children clean the lamps and lanterns Their grandmother at their father s prompting had remembered to put kerosene on their list and also candles Jane chose one of the latter to light her to bed She simply detested kerosene lamps she declared when Dan had asked if she didn t want to sit up with them a little while and read some of the books their father and mother had left in the cabin No thank you had been the emphatic refusal The nights here are bitterly cold In bed at least I can keep warm Gee whiliker Gerald said when the girl to whom everything seemed distasteful had retired Ain t she a wet blanket Before Dan could rebuke him for criticizing his elders Julie burst in with Why Gerry Abbott didn t you promise Dad you wouldn t ever say ain t and there you said it The boy squirmed uncomfortably It s an awful long time since I said it before he tried to excuse himself I bet you I won t do it again You see if I do Dan was looking at the empty hearth We should have cut some wood and had a roaring fire tonight Let s do it tomorrow and make it more cheerful for Jane if He paused as though he had said more than he had intended but his alert companions would not let a sentence go unfinished If what Dan Julie asked curiously The boy was not yet ready to tell even these two that he might think it best to start Jane and Julie on their homeward way the next day He knew that the older girl would be overjoyed but the younger would be so disappointed that it seemed almost a cruel thing to contemplate I ll tell you tomorrow noon he compromised when he saw both pairs of eyes watching him as though awaiting his answer In a very short time the children were nodding sleepily and Dan was glad when Julie took a candle and Gerry a lantern and bade him good night We re going to get up to see the sunrise Julie said If you wake up Dan laughingly told them Then putting out the remaining lights he too retired to his cot on the porch He placed his loaded gun in the corner back of him where it could not be reached by anyone else without awakening him For long hours he lay with wide eyes watching the sky which seemed to be a canopy close above him brilliant with stars A slight wind kept the mosquitos away and as it rustled through the pine boughs that were so near a sense of peace stole into his heart his fears were banished and he seemed to know that all was well It was long after sunrise when he wakened and no one else was astir in the cabin Very quietly he arose and dressed Then he went to the kitchen and a fragrance of coffee was what finally awakened the two children They bounded from bed ashamed of their laziness and when they joined their big brother he had a good breakfast spread on the table in their out of door dining room Julie will you see if Jane is awake the older lad asked and the small girl cautiously opened the door into her sister s room Then she entered and went to the bedside You ve got one of your dreadful headaches haven t you Janey The younger girl was all compassion She knew well how Jane suffered when these infrequent headaches came What she did not know was that they always followed a spell of anger or of worry I ll draw the curtains over this window so the sun can t come in and I ll fetch you your breakfast Julie liked nothing better than to be mothering someone but Jane showed no sign of appreciation Her only comment was Have the coffee hot Dan was sorry to hear that Jane had neuralgia and from past experience he knew that she would be unable to travel that afternoon and so she would be obliged to wait until the following Tuesday when the stage would again pass that way He felt elated at the thought but first he must find out if it were safe for the girls to remain Directly after breakfast he drew Gerald aside and asked him if he would stay at the cabin while he Dan went up the mountain road to interview the trapper Although the small boy would much rather have accompanied Dan he always wanted to do his share and so he consented to remain Dan waited until he was sure that Meg Heger had passed on her way to the Redfords school before he began the ascent of the mountain road He could not have explained to himself why he did not want to meet the girl It might have been a feeling that he had lacked in chivalry on the day before when he had listened to the conversation in which she had probably revealed a secret which she would not wish strangers to share He sauntered along by the brook his gun over his shoulder stopping every few feet to examine some rock or growth or just to gaze out over the valley seeing new pictures at each changed position It was a glorious morning but with the invigorating chill yet in the air He breathed deeply and walked with shoulders thrown back Birds sang to him squirrels in the pine boughs over his head or scurrying among the dry soft carpet of needles chattered at him some were curious many were scolding but he laughingly told them that he was a comrade He stopped on a level with one protesting bushy tailed fellow to say mister Bright Eyes I wouldn t harm you not for anything This gun is merely to be used on something that would harm me if it got the chance first I don t believe in taking life from a little wild creature that enjoys living just as much as I do Then as he continued his walk he thought I must tell Gerry not to kill any harmless creature unless we need it for food Coming to a sudden sharp descent of about fifteen feet he saw that the brook became a waterfall and just below it was a large pool which would make an excellent swimming hole The water was as clear as crystal and was held in a smooth red rock basin After standing for some time watching the joyous waterfall on which broken sunlight flashed the lad glanced at his watch It was after nine and so he could safely take to the road without fear of encountering the mountain girl She was surely by now reciting to that kindly old man Teacher Bellows After another downward scramble the road was reached The ascent was gradual and Dan s thoughts wandered on without his conscious direction He wondered how that mountain girl had happened to have a thirst for knowledge That in itself proved to him that the old Ute was not her father but if he were not why did he pretend that he was What could be his reason To obtain what money he could by making her think it her duty to help care for him Dan had just decided this to be the most plausible explanation of the whole thing when he was greatly startled by hearing the sudden report of a gun from the high rocks at his right He looked up and beheld the girl about whom he had been thinking every muscle tense a smoking gun still against her shoulder It was pointed at the bushes directly at his left Don t you move she shouted the warning Maybe I didn t kill it Dan whirled toward the rocks and low growing bushes at his left and what he saw reassured him A mountain lion lay there evidently dead its position showing that it had been just about to spring upon him He turned to thank the girl but she had disappeared She too had evidently been convinced that the animal was dead On examining it closer the boy saw that the bullet had entered the creature s head at a most vulnerable spot and being thus assured that it was not playing possum he went on his way Already Meg Heger had won a right to his chivalry She had saved his life How he wished that in turn he might do something to save her from her tormentor CHAPTER XVI THE TRAPPER S CABIN Dan felt a glow of pleasure as he neared the log cabin which nestled against the mountain sheltered by rock walls on the side from which the worst storms always came Eagerly he looked ahead hoping that he would see the girl He wanted to thank her for having saved his life but no one was in sight It was a pleasant home like place with chickens clucking cheerfully in a large wired in yard Goats climbed among the rocks at the back and a washing fluttered on a line at one side while to the boy s delight masses of wild flowers showing evidence of loving care carpeted the earth filled stretches between boulders and some of them that trailed along the ground hung over the cliff in vivid bloom It was Meg s garden he knew without being told He rapped on the closed front door but a voice from outside called to him Whoever tis come around here I m washin Dan did as he was told and saw a thin angular woman who stood up very straight and looked at him out of keen blue eyes as she wiped her sudsy hands on her gingham apron Then she brushed back her graying locks Her smile was a friendly one You re Dan Abbott s son ain t you she began at once Hank Wallace him as drives the stage stopped in for dinner to our place yesterday and he told us all about having fetched you up Pa and I knew your pa and your ma too years back afore any of you children was living and long afore I had Meg The woman nodded toward the wooded mountain beyond Meg s out studyin some fandangled thing she calls bot ny Then she waved a bony hand toward the glowing gardens Them s what she calls her specimens Queer things they get to larnin in schools nowadays I didn t have much iddication None at all is more like the real of it But pa he went summers for a spell and learned readin writin and rithmetic All a person needs to know in these mountains but Meg now she s been goin ever since she could talk seems like Notion Pa Heger took He got talked into doin it by Preacher Bellows Then before saying more the woman cautiously scanned the woods and the road Feeling sure that there was no one near enough to hear her she confided You see we ain t dead sure who Meg is She was about three when one of the Ute squaw women fetched her all done up in one of them bright colored blankets they make It was a terrible stormy night There d been a cloudburst and the thunder made this old mountain shake for true Pa Heger said he heard someone at the door and I said twas the wind He said he knew better and he went to see There stood a Ute squaw and she grunted something and held out the blanket bundle Pa took it bein as he heard a cry inside of it That squaw didn t stop She shuffled away and Pa shut the door quick to keep the storm out Well Ma he says turning to me what d s pose we ve got here Some Indian papoose I reckoned twas Well if tis said he I can t throw it out into this awful storm We ll have to keep it till it clears an then I ll pack it back to the Utes They was over at the Crazy Creek camp then but when that storm let up and Pa did go over there wa n t a hide or hair left of that Ute tribe They d gone to better huntin grounds the way they allays do and we ve never seen em since None of em cept ol Slinkin Coyote It s queer the way he sticks to it that he s Meg s pa but my man won t listen to it Gets mad as anythin if I as much as say maybe it s true He ll rave Pa will an say Look at our Meg Does she look like a young un of that skulkin old wildcat Pa says an I have to agree she don t But he pesters her askin for money That is he used to afore Pa Heger set the law on him Pa has a paper from the sheriff givin him the right to arrest that ol Ute if he ever sets eyes on him But I declare to it Here comes Pa Heger himself He ll be glad to meet you bein as he knew your pa so well The lad turned eagerly He was always glad to meet someone who had known his father in the long ago years when he had come West just after leaving college hoping to win a fortune Then as the boy waited for the man to come up he wondered why Meg did not return Didn t she care to make his acquaintance Pa Heger as he liked to be called was a pleasant faced man whose deeply wrinkled leathery countenance showed at once that he had weathered wind and storm through many a long year in the mountains As Ma Heger had done he seemed to know intuitively who the visitor was But before he could speak his talkative spouse began Pa ain t this boy the splittin image of Danny Abbott him as used to come over to set by our fire and hear you spin them trappin yarns o yourn That was afore he went away an got married Arter that he wa n t alone when he come climbin up the mountain but along of him was the sweetest purtiest little creature I d ever sot my eyes on The two of em were a fine lookin pair Dan shook hands with the silent man who showed his pleasure more with his smiling eyes than with words He was quite willing to let his wife do most of the talking The lad was pleased with the praise given his father and mother when they were young and he at once told missus Heger that his sister Jane who was with him very closely resembled that bride of long ago Wall now the good woman exclaimed how I d like to see the gal She n my Meg ought to get on fine if she s anyhow as friendly as her ma was Mis Abbott used to come right out to my kitchen She d been goin to some fandangly cookin school the while she was gettin ready to be married and she larned me a lot of things to make kitchen work easier I m doin some of em yet and thinkin of her often Dan did not comment on the possibility of his proud sister becoming an intimate friend of the mountain girl but for himself he found that he very much wanted to know more about their adopted daughter mister Heger he turned to the man who stood shyly twirling his fur cap your daughter has just saved my life His listeners both looked very much surprised Why how come that missus Heger inquired You didn t say as how you d seen Meg all the time I was talkin about her Dan might have replied that he had not had an opportunity to say much of anything But to an interested audience he related the recent occurrence Pshaw that s queer now Pa Heger scratched his gray head back of one ear which Dan was to learn was a habit with him when he was puzzled You say the mountain lion was crouched to spring at you Then it must o been that she had some young near They re cowards when it comes to humans them lions are They kill sheep an calves an deer an all the little wild critters but they don t often attack a man They ll trail em for hours curious sort of I reckon keepin out of sight Makes you feel mighty uncomfortable to know one of them big critters is prowlin arter you whatever his intentions may be But that un now you was mentionin I ll walk back wi you when you go an take a look at it Thar s a bounty paid for em by the ranchers An if young air near by there ll be no time better for puttin an end to em Ma Heger glanced often toward the wooded mountain beyond Meg s Bot ny Gardens Then to her husband she said I reckon Meg knows thar s company an that s why she s stayin so long She said to me Ma I ain t agoin to school today says she I reckon I ll get some more specimens At that the man looked up quickly evident alarm in his clear blue eyes Did she say anything about havin seen that skulkin Ute Has he been pesterin her The day arter she s given him money she don dare go to school fearin he ll be rarin drunk wi fire water an waylay her If ever I come up wi that coyote I ll I ll The wife tried to quiet the increasing anger of her spouse Pa Heger she said you re alarmin yerself needless That Ute knows the sheriff gave you power to jail him an he s mos likely gone to whar his tribe is Dan stood silently wondering what he ought to say He knew that Meg had given the old Indian money and he realized that was why she had been at home to save his life I shall be glad to have you walk back with me mister Heger he said Dan wanted to be alone with the mountaineer When they had started down the mountain road the man at Dan s side was silent a frown gathering on his leathery forehead Suddenly he blurted out This here business has got to stop That slinkin ol Ute s got to prove that my Meg is his gal In the courts he s got to prove it or I ll have him strung up Jail s too good for him Pesterin a little gal to get her to give up her savin s that she s been puttin by this five year past meanin to go to school in the big city and larn to be a teacher That s what Meg s figgerin on and that skulkin Ute drainin it away from her little by little I made her pack a gun an tol her to shoot him on sight but I reckon she ain t got the heart to take a life though I d sooner trap him than I would a well a coyote that he s named arter Dan could be quiet no longer mister Heger he said it was about that very Indian that I came up here to talk to you this morning I saw him in hiding near our cabin Yesterday afternoon he frightened the children although he did not come out into the open then about two hours later we saw him hiding behind boulders on the road below us He waylaid your daughter just as you fear Also she gave him money While the boy had been talking the man s great knotted hands had closed and unclosed and cords swelled out on his reddening face I knew it he cried Dan Abbott I want you to help me catch that Ute Meg won t She ain t sure but what he is her pa an it s agin nature to ask her to harm him I won t let on that you tol me but Dan we ve got to trap him You needn t be afraid of him He won t harm you or your family He s too cowardly for that What s more he s paralyzed in one arm it s all shriveled up so he can t hold a gun Dan felt greatly relieved upon hearing this and wishing to change the conversation to something pleasanter he inquired how soon Meg expected to be able to go away to school But the subject evidently was not pleasant to the old man Next fall s the time an me and ma can t bring ourselves to think on it Snowed in all winter without Meg s bout as pleasin as bein shet in a tomb The anger had all died out of the leathery wrinkled face and in the blue eyes there shone that wonderful love light that is the most beautiful thing the world holds Queer now ain t it how a slip of a baby girl could fill up two lives the way Meg did our n from the start An she cares for us jest as much as we for her I reckon Pears like she does The old man s voice had become tender as he spoke I m sure of it Dan said heartily Then after a pause Pa Heger continued slowly That gal of our n has the queerest notions One s the way she takes to flowers Then looking up inquiringly Did Ma tell you how she earned the money she s savin for her iddication Dan shook his head and so the old man continued Teacher Bellows twas got her started on it He s what folks call a naturalist an when he used to stay up to our cabin for weeks at a time an he d take Meg wi him specimen huntin Seems like thar s museum places all over this here country that wants specimens of flowers growin high up in the Rockies So Teacher Bellows and Meg would hunt for days startin early every mornin and late back in the arternoon till they had a set of specimens They d press em till they was dry as paper then mount em as they call it an send em off to a museum and along come a check Arter Teacher Bellows went back to his school Meg kept right on doin it by herself him helpin now an then an she s saved nigh enough for the two years schoolin she ll need to be a low grade schoolmarm She s got another queer notion Meg has I wonder if Ma tol you about that The old man looked up inquiringly and Dan finding himself very much interested in the notions of this girl whom he did not know said that he would very much like to hear about it The old man removed his fur cap and scratched his gray head again His voice grew even more tender You know what it says in that good book Preacher Bellows is allays readin out of how a little child shall lead Wall that s sartin what Meg s done for me and Ma Heger When she was about six year old or maybe now she was seven it was curious how friendly even the skeeriest little wild critters was toward her She could feed em out of her hand arter a little coaxin an how she loved em You see they was all the playmates she s ever had Then twas she started her horspital for hurt critters an she s kept it goin ever sence Got one now but plague it I can t remember what kind of patients she s got into it She won t keep nothin captive arter they re well enough to fight for themselves out in the forest Wall as I was sayin back a piece Meg was about seven as I recollect when she sort of sudden like seemed to realize how twas I made my livin trappin wild animals and sellin their skins at the tradin post But even then she didn t fully sense what it meant seemed like till the day we couldn t find her nowhar She d never gone far into the mountains afore that but when she didn t come home at noonday Ma asked me to go an hunt for her It was late arternoon afore I come upon her an I ll never forget that sight as long as I m livin My habit was to set them powerful steel traps to catch mountain lions and the fur animals I wanted for pelts Then every few days I d go the round and shoot the critters that had been caught in em Wall as I was goin toward whar one of them big traps was I heard sech a pitiful cryin Good God but I was wild wi fear an I ran like wolves was arter me I d a notion our baby gal was catched in it An thar she was sure enough but not hurt Instead she was down on the ground wi her arms around a little black bear cub that had been catched hours before and was all torn and bleedin The fight was gone out o him but he wa n t dead yet It was our little Meg who was doin the cryin Clingin to the little fellow not heedin the blood her sobbin was pitiful to hear I picked her up an I ain t shamed to be tellin you that I was cryin myself along about that time Take him out Pa my little gal was beggin Maybe he ll get well Pa So I opened the great steel jaws of that trap and took out the little cub bear He was too small to be worth anything for a pelt an we fetched him home but he died soon arter and Meg she had me bury him But she couldn t get over what she had seen She had a ragin fever for days I sot up every night holdin her little quiverin body close in my arms an prayin God if he d let my little gal live I d never set another of them cruel steel traps to catch any of His critters as long as I d breath in my body Wall boy sort of a miracle took place That little gal of mine had fallen asleep while I sat holdin her but jest as I made that promise silent to God she lifted up her little hand and put it soft like on my face an says still asleep seemed like I love you Pa Heger An when she woke up next mornin the fever was gone and she was well as ever I kept my promise he went on grimly I went all over the mountain an I took them steel traps one by one unsprung em and dropped em down into that crack some earthquake had split into Bald Peak It s bottomless seems like an what goes into that crack never does no more harm Now when I kill a critter that needs killin I shoot an they never know what hits em Meg is a sure shot too though she d never pack a gun if twant that I make her They had reached the spot where the mountain lion still lay and the old man stooped to examine it I reckon that was a sure shot all right Then he shouldered the limp creature Thar s fifty dollars bounty so I might as well have it I ll hunt for the cubs tomorrer So long Hit the trail up our way often As Dan walked slowly down the mountain road toward his home cabin he found that he was more interested in this unknown Meg than he had ever before been in any girl Jane s headache was better when Dan returned but her disposition was worse and poor Julie was about ready to cry She had been spoken to so sharply when she had really tried to help Gerald was angry and indignant He had at first urged his small sister and comrade to pretend that Jane was being pleasant but after a time even he had decided that such a feat was too much for anyone to accomplish Then he had intentionally slammed a door and had declared that he hoped it would make ol Jane s head worse It was well that Dan returned just when he did He entered the cabin living room calling cheerily Good Jane I m glad to see you are up Then he looked from one to the other Julie tearful rebellious stood near the kitchen door and Gerald with clenched fists had evidently been saying something of a defiant nature Why what s the matter What has gone wrong Dan was indeed dismayed at the picture before him Jane who had seated herself in the one comfortable chair in the room said peevishly Everything is the matter Dan you can see for yourself what a mistake I made in coming to this terrible place and trying to live with these two children who have had no training whatever They are defiant and rebellious Even as Jane spoke a memoried picture presented itself of Julie s sweet solicitude for her earlier that morning but she would not heed so she hurried on I have been lying in there with this frightful headache thinking it all out and I have decided that either the children must go back or I will A hard look unusual in Dan s face appeared there and his voice sounded cold Very well Jane I will help you pack The stage passes soon If we hurry we may be ready The children could hardly keep from shouting for joy Something which Julie was cooking boiled over and so she darted to the kitchen followed by Gerald who stood upon his head in the middle of the floor But they had rejoiced too soon for Gerry who a moment later went to the brook for water returned with the disheartening news that the stage was passing down their part of the road Julie plumped down on the floor and her mouth quivered but before she could cry Gerald caught her hands pulled her up and said comfortingly Never mind Jule The stage will be going past again on Monday Me and you ll stay on the watch and tell Mister Sourface to stop for Jane when he goes back to Redfords on Tuesday That is not so awful long Oh boy then won t we have the time of our lives Julie agreed that they would indeed and decided to be very patient during the remaining two days So she went back to her cooking and with Gerald s help soon had the lunch spread Jane ate but little and again shut herself up in her room for all that afternoon Dan was almost as glad as were the children that she was to go back to the East but Jane strangely enough was deeply hurt because her brother who had been her playmate when they were little and her pal in later years had actually chosen the younger children in preference to herself That proved how much he really cared for her and as for his health he seemed to be recovering remarkably He had coughed a while the evening before and for a shorter time that morning Then he had evidently been on a long hike Of all that had happened Dan had said nothing knowing that Jane would not wish to hear about the mountain girl toward whom she felt so unkindly That afternoon Dan gave the children another lesson at shooting cones from an old pine far enough from the cabin to keep from disturbing Jane Julie grew braver as she watched Gerald s success and at last she too tried and when after many failures she sent a brown cone spinning she leaped about wild with joy Now we are both sharpshooters Gerald cried generously Then glancing over at the cabin he added There s Jane sitting out on the porch She does look sort of sick doesn t she Dan s heart was touched when he saw the forlorn attitude of the sister he so loved You youngsters amuse yourselves for a while he suggested I want to have a quiet talk with Jane Dan neglected to tell the children not to wander away CHAPTER XVII QUEER KITTENS Left alone Julie and Gerald scrambled to the road and looked both up and down Which way will we go Julie inquired We ve been down or I mean we ve been up the down road Then the boy laughed Aw gee You know what I mean We came up the road yesterday in the stage so now let s go on further up Julie hopped about clapping her hands gleefully Ohee I know what Let s see if we can find that cabin the innkeeper lady said was about a mile up the mountain road from our place Wouldn t that be fun And maybe that nice girl will be at home from school and if she is I just know she ll let me ride her pony Gerald nothing loath fell into step by his sister s side the gun over his shoulder After the fashion of small brothers he could not resist teasing I bet you couldn t stay on that pony however hard you tried It s a wild Western broncho sort like those we saw at Madison Square Garden that time Dad took us to Buffalo Bill s big circus Then in a manner which seemed to imply that he did not wish to boast he added I sort of think I could ride it easy Boys get the knack seems like without half trying They had rounded the bend and were nearing the very spot where the mountain girl had shot the lion when Julie clutched her brother s arm and drew him back whispering excitedly Gerry Hark What s that noise I hear The boy listened and then crept cautiously toward the bushes He also heard queer little crying sounds that were almost plaintive Huh he said boldly Tisn t anything that would hurt us Sounds to me like kittens crying for their mother A joyful shout from the girl closely following him turned into Gerry That s just what they are Great big kittens See how comically they sprawl They haven t learned to walk yet Their little legs aren t strong enough to stand on See I can pick one right up He doesn t seem to mind a bit The small girl suited the action to the word and it was well for her that the mother lion had been killed or Julie would soon have been badly torn despite the fact that her brother still carried his small gun The boy had lifted the other weak creature which had not been alive many days and with much curious questioning as to what kind of pussy cats they might be they continued their walk and soon reached the cabin Meg Heger who had remained long in the forest that day having sought a rare lichen high on the mountain was just descending from the trail that led into her botany gardens when she saw the two children entering the front yard of her home cabin Unbuckling the basket which she carried much as an Indian squaw carries a pappoose the girl leaped down the rocks and exclaimed Oh children where did you find those darling little mountain lion babies Luckily she took the one Julie was holding in her own arms as she spoke for if she had not that particular baby would have had a hard fall for when the small girl from the East heard that she was actually holding a mountain lion she uttered a little frightened scream and let go her hold But Gerald being a boy realized that even a future fierce wild animal was harmless when its legs were too weak for it to stand on and so he continued to hold his pet even venturing to admire it It s a little beauty ain t I mean isn t it He glanced quickly at Julie but the slip had evidently not been observed for she was intently watching the mountain girl who was caressing the little creature she held as though she loved it as she did everything that lived in all the wilderness But as Meg Heger held that helpless hungry baby her heart was sad for well she knew that it was unprotected and perhaps starving because she had shot and killed its mother Of course she had to kill the lion to save the life of the lad who had gone too close to the place where the mother had her young but nevertheless she felt that in a way her act had made her responsible for these helpless little wild creatures since they had been brought to her Brightly she turned to the children Don t you want to come with me to the hospital she invited We ll give them some supper She did not ask who the children were nor from whence they had come Perhaps she remembered having seen them the day before on the stage or Sourface Wallace may have told her Julie and Gerald followed wondering what the hospital might be Back of the cabin on a rocky ledge the children saw a queer assortment of wooden boxes small cages and little runways This is the hospital Meg flashed a merry smile at them over her shoulder There aren t many patients just now Most of them have been cured Here s one little darling and I m afraid he never will be well Some prowling creature caught him and had succeeded in breaking a wing when it heard me coming Why it dropped its prey when it ran I don t know but I brought the little fellow home and Pap helped me set its wing It s ever so much better but even yet can t fly but it can scuttle along the ground just ever so fast Gerald was much interested What kind of a bird is it Miss Heger he began very politely when the girl s musical laughter rippled out Don t call me that she pleaded It makes me feel as old as the thousand year pine Teacher Bellows told our class about It s a little quail bird dearie You ll see ever so many of them in flocks There are sixty different kinds of cousins in their family The Bob Whites with their reddish brown plumage have a black and white speckled jacket They live in the grass rather than in trees and are good friends of the farmer because they devour so many of the insects that destroy grain and fruits This one is a mountain quail it is one of the largest cousins The one that lives in the South is called a partridge Gerald listened politely to the life history of the pretty bird but his attention had been seized and held by what Meg had said about the very ancient pine Was there ever a tree that lived a thousand years he asked with eager interest The girl nodded Indeed there are many that have lived much longer but this pine was blown over and Teacher Bellows was allowed to cut it up to read its life history He found that it had been in two forest fires and about five hundred years ago an Indian battle had been fought near it for there were arrow heads imbedded in the rings that indicated that year of its life Then Meg concluded with her bright smile Some day when Teacher Bellows is up here I ll have him tell you the names and probable ages of all our neighbor trees It s a fascinating study Julie was not much interested in the length of a tree s life and so she began eagerly Miss I mean do you want us to call you Meg she interrupted herself to inquire The older girl nodded Every move she made seemed to express bubbling over enthusiasm and interest Haven t you any more patients Gerry was peering into empty boxes in which there were soft leaf like beds Only just Mickey Mouse He s a little cripple His left foot was cut off in a trap but he gets around nicely on one stump That s his hole over there I put grain and bits of cheese in front of it Keep ever so still and I ll put a kernel of corn right by his door Then perhaps you ll see his bright eyes And that is just what happened As soon as the corn kernel rolled in front of the hole out darted a sharp brown nose with twitching whiskers and two beady black eyes appeared just long enough for their owner to drag his supper into the safe darkness of his particular box Meg laughed happily He s the cunningest Mickey is I sometimes take him with me in my pocket He likes to ride there or so it seems At any rate he is just as good as he can be Often he goes to sleep but at other times he stands right up and looks out of the pocket just as though he were enjoying the scenery At that moment a sharp almost impatient cry from the small creature she held recalled to the head doctor of the hospital the fact that she had started out to feed the baby lions She brought milk from a cave like room only the front wall of which was wood the rest being in the mountain That s our cooler she told Gerald whom she could easily observe was interested in all the strange things he saw Dipping one corner of her handkerchief into the milk she put it in the mouth of her tiny lion and the children were delighted to see how readily and joyfully the creature seemed to feast upon it Having gathered courage Julie wished to feed the other baby lion and then Meg suggested that they be put in a soft lined box on the rocks near since they were used to being high up The baby lions being no longer hungry cuddled down and went to sleep Gerald s conscience was troubling him We ll have to be going he said Nobody knows where we are Then he hesitated He knew that it would be polite to ask the mountain girl to call upon them but he was afraid that Jane would not treat her kindly so in his embarrassment he caught Julie by the hand and fairly dragged her away as he called Goodbye Meg I m coming up often When they were on the down road the boy cautioned Julie to say nothing whatever of their adventure to their sister but just to Dan CHAPTER XVIII A YOUNG OVERSEER Sunday dawned gloriously and Dan declared that he felt better than he had supposed that he ever would again Jane too though she did not voice it was conscious of feeling more invigorated than she had been in the East and yet of course she was very glad that she was going back again on the following Tuesday She would go directly to Newport to visit Merry Starr as had been their original plan Her conscience would not trouble her since it was Dan s wish that she be the one to leave The two children on the evening before had failed to confide that they had visited the cabin up the mountain road They were wild to tell Dan but they wished to get him off by himself before they did so They dragged him out into the kitchen after the Sunday morning work was done and asked him if he would go with them for a hike up along the brook to a natural bridge that they could see from their door yard The older lad hesitated I ll ask Jane if she would like to go he began but the immediate disappointment expressed by the two freckled faces made him turn back to add Or rather I ll ask Jane if she minds our going just for a little while This suggestion was far more pleasing to the children They all entered the living room where Jane sat reading My goodness don t go far she said petulantly Don t you remember that the terrible overseer from the Packard ranch is coming to take dinner with you today I intend to shut myself in my room and stay there until he is gone Hm Dan snapped his fingers as he ejaculated Queer I d forget that visit since I have been looking forward to it so eagerly Then he queried Why do you say that he is terrible Jane A foreman on a vast cattle ranch is not necessarily an uncouth specimen of humanity The girl flung herself impatiently in the chair as she emphatically replied Of course he ll be terrible A big rawboned creature who will speak with a dreadful dialect or whatever you call it and he will be so embarrassed at meeting people from the city that he will stutter more than likely Dan laughed at the description Maybe you are right sister of mine but we ll be home to prepare the meal for our guest long before the hour he is to arrive Goodbye Fire off the gun if you are frightened at anything The girl merely shrugged her shoulders and when they were gone she decided since it really was very lovely out of doors to take her book to the porch and so she dragged thither the comfortable chair with the leather pillows She was soon reading the story which interested her so greatly that she did not notice the passing of time until she heard a step near by Jane supposed that her family was returning and did not glance up until she heard a pleasant well modulated voice saying Pardon me if I intrude but is this the cabin occupied by the Abbott family Looking up in astonishment Jane saw before her a handsome youth whose wide Stetson hat was held in one hand He wore a tan colored shirt of soft flannel and his corduroys of the same shade were tucked into high laced boots Even before she spoke Jane was conscious that the youth with the clean shaven face strong square chin pleasant mouth blue eyes with clear direct gaze was not in the least embarrassed by her presence He was indeed the kind of a lad she had always met in the homes of her best friends the kind that Dan was But that of which she was most conscious was the fact that he was very good looking and that in his eyes there was an expression of sincere admiration for her Graciously Jane rose and held out a slim white hand We are the Abbotts she began then laughingly confessed that unfortunately she was the only one at home as the others had gone on a hike she really had not inquired where The lad did not seem to consider it unfortunate Please be seated again Miss Abbott and I ll occupy the door step if you don t mind I d heaps rather meet strangers one by one It s easier to get acquainted Then as he thought of something he exclaimed I hope I have not come over much earlier than I was expected I hiked all the way I thought it might be easier to come cross lots so to speak than to ride horseback to Redfords and then up your mountain road Was it Jane asked wishing to appear interested It was great I adore mountain climbing don t you Miss Abbott Then not waiting for her reply he continued with boyish enthusiasm I tell you it means a lot to me to have you Abbotts here I love the West but I ve missed my friends We ll have great times How long are you going to stay Jane hesitated She should have replied that she was leaving on Tuesday but now she was not sure that she wished to go For a merry half hour these two chattered The lad seemed to be quite willing to talk of everything but his home and Jane was too well bred to ask questions Jean told of his college life and when she asked if he regretted that his days of study were over he laughingly declared that they never would be mister Packard is a great student he looked up brightly to say and our long winter evenings that some chaps might call dull are the most interesting I have ever spent We take one subject after another and go into it thoroughly We re most interested in experimental inventions and we have rigged up all sorts of labor saving contrivances over on the ranch Recalling something which for the moment had been forgotten Jean exclaimed mister Packard wished me to invite you all to visit us as soon as you are quite settled here Then with that unconscious admiration in his eyes he concluded For myself I most eagerly second the invitation Jane s vanity was indeed gratified She laughed a happy musical laugh which sounded natural although it had really been cultivated I am greatly flattered that you should be so anxious to entertain the Abbotts she told him since I am the only one of us whom you have met True he confessed merrily but you know we scientists can visualize an entire family from one specimen How could the other three be undesirable when one is so lovely Maybe it s because I am a blonde that I admire the olive type of beauty Just why she said it Jane could not have told unless the memory of what that awful Gabby at the station had said still rankled Be that as it may almost without her conscious direction she heard herself saying I suppose then that you must be a great admirer of Meg Heger There was a note in the girl s voice which made the lad look up a bit puzzled What he said in reply was both pleasing and displeasing to his companion With a ring of sincerity he assured his listener that there were few girls finer than Meg Heger I do not know her personally very well he told Jane She seems to shun the acquaintance of all young people I sometimes think that she may believe her friendship would not be desired since she is supposed to be the daughter of that old Ute Indian but this is not true We in the West ask not the parentage but the sincerity of our friends It s through her foster father that I know the girl really I often go with him to the timber line and above it when I am not needed on the ranch It s a beautiful thing to hear him tell how Meg has enriched their lives Then as his direct gaze was again lifted to the olive tinted face of the girl near him he said frankly Many of the cowboys and others of our neighbors rave about Meg s beauty But I do not admire the Spanish or French type as much as I do our very own American girl Jean did not say in words which American girl he thought wonderfully lovely to look upon but his eyes were eloquent Jane could have sat there basking in the lad s evident admiration for hours but the position of the sun high above them suggested to her that something must be amiss I wonder why Dan and the children do not return she said rising to look up the brook trail Jean leaped to his feet and together they went around the cabin and scanned the mountain side and the lad yodeled but there was no response Of course nothing could have happened to them all Jane assured him They have gone farther than they planned I suppose Then turning with a helpless little laugh she said in her most winning way and Jane could be quite irresistible when she wished I have a terrible confession to make You will have to starve if they do not return for I have never learned to cook Great I m glad you haven t because that will give me an opportunity of shining in an art at which I excel The lad seemed brimming over with enthusiasm Jane smiled up at him He stood a head taller than she with wide square shoulders that looked so strong and capable of carrying whatever burden might be placed upon them How did you happen to learn how to cook the girl inquired and then wondered at the sudden change of expression in his handsome face The joyful enthusiasm of the moment before was gone and in its place was an expression both tender and sad The last year of my little mother s life we two went alone to our cabin on the Maine coast Mums wanted to take our Chinaman but I begged her to let me have her all alone by myself and so under her direction I learned to cook Miss Abbott the boy turned toward her seeming to feel sure of her understanding sympathy that was the happiest summer of my life but it had the saddest ending for try as I might to keep her my little mother faded away and left us Then abruptly he exclaimed as though he dared not trust himself to keep on Won t you lead me to the kitchen and when the wanderers return we will have a feast ready for them CHAPTER XIX A NEW COOK Such a pleasant half hour was spent by these two who seemed content just to be together Jane with a twinge of regret realized that the youth was idealizing her He constantly attributed to her qualities that she well knew that she did not possess He told her that he could understand why she had not learned to cook simply because for years she had been away at a fashionable seminary But now is your golden opportunity and I am indeed lucky to be your first teacher That he was pleased was quite evident I am sure you agree with me Miss Abbott that cooking is as essential in a young woman s education as painting or singing Then he laughed boyishly I m afraid when I am hungry that I would far rather have a beautiful girl cook for me than sing to me Now what is the menu to be Jane looked about the kitchen helplessly She did not wish to confess to Jean Sawyer that she had not before been in there except to pass through it to their outdoor dining room Julie and Dan were planning the meal I really don t know The situation was relieved by Jean s asking May I prepare anything I can find Oh yes do please It really doesn t matter which of our supplies are used first The girl was glad to have the problem thus easily solved After a few moments of ransacking the lad looked up from a box as he asked Miss Jane will you pare the potatoes She shrank away before she realized what she was doing Oh wouldn t they stain my hands terribly Then with her most winning smile she held them both out to him You see they haven t a stain on them yet and I did hope they never would have The boy made a move as though to take the hands in his But he stooped quickly over the box of potatoes and said earnestly Right you are Miss Abbott They are far too lovely to mar Perhaps because of associated ideas it was that he recalled a poem that went somewhat in this way Beautiful hands are those that do work that is useful kind and true What he said was Suppose you set the table I ll make the fire and have a pot of goulash in no time That is my favorite camp menu perhaps because it is the simplest Everything was in readiness when merry voices were heard without and Julie evidently believing they were unheard said in a stage whisper Don t tell Jane that we ve been up to see Meg Heger s hospital will you Dan She d be mad as anything The older lad was opening the kitchen door at that moment and the two who had been keeping so still in the kitchen that the surprise might be complete could not but hear Vaguely Jean Sawyer wondered why Jane would be mad because the rest of her family had been to call upon a neighbor Glancing at her proud beautiful face he saw a scornful curl to the mouth which he had thought so lovely and it was not pleasant to behold But a moment later he had forgotten it in the excitement that followed his discovery Dan advanced with glowing eyes and outstretched hand Jean Sawyer How glad we are to have you with us These are the youngsters Julie and Gerald The little girl made a pretty curtsy and Gerry thrust out a chubby freckled hand smiling his widest as he looked admiringly at the cowboy s costume Gee he confided I d like awful well to have one of those rigs Dan don t you s pose they make em small enough for boys But it was Jean who answered They do indeed and what is more there is one over at the Packard ranch more typical than mine which I am pretty sure will fit you A grandson of mister Packard s was with us last summer but he isn t coming this year and he d be glad to have you wear it Then smiling at the older girl he said to Dan Your sister Miss Jane has agreed to bring you all over to our place to spend next Sunday That is a week from today Julie upon hearing this was about to blurt out her disappointment by saying How can she if she s going back East on Tuesday But a cold glance from her sister s eyes made the small girl turn away with quivering lips After all Jane was going to stay and their summer would be spoiled Jean Sawyer had also witnessed this by play and he felt a sense of great disappointment It was quite evident that Jane Abbott s beauty was only skin deep When Jean Sawyer took his departure that afternoon Dan accompanied him part way cross lots as the former lad had called it They crossed the brook and after climbing many a jagged boulder began the descent on the side of the mountain nearest the wide valley in which was located the fertile Packard ranch These two lads so near of an age found that they were most congenial When Dan confessed that his dearest desire was to become a writer of purpose fiction Jean heartily applauded Great I d give anything if I had the ability to do something fine for this old world of ours but just at present I believe I will continue being mister Packard s foreman Really Dan reading and studying with that man is as good as having a post graduate course at college Then apropos of nothing or so it seemed Jean said What a beautiful girl your sister is What a pity that she has not had the love and direction of a mother I had such a wonderful mother myself Dan I well know what girls and boys have missed when they lost their mothers while they were very young Dan grew serious at once Then he confessed Jean I feel as though I had known you for a long time and so I am going to tell you my greatest problem My sister Jane is beautiful and before she went away to that fashionable Highacres Seminary she was as sweet and lovable a girl as any you could find but for some reason she learned there much that was not in the curriculum Pride of family snobbishness and because of our father s position many of her companions were so differential to her that she has come to expect it from everyone How I wish I knew how to save Jane from herself It was just as Jean had feared He surprised himself by saying If she would chum with Meg Heger a while I believe it would help her to overcome those artificially acquired qualities for Meg is sincerely natural But your sister would have to make the advances Meg never will She keeps apart by herself and will probably continue doing so until it is proven that she is not that Ute Indian s daughter I know that you have met Meg for I overheard your little sister saying that you had been there this morning Yes we were The children pleaded so hard that I go and see their baby lions Then he told the story of the death of the mother lion to an interested listener I wondered why Meg Heger disappeared directly after having saved my life Nor would she come to her home while she know that I was there It is too bad that she shuts herself away from people who would gladly be her friends Jean nodded That is just what she does Last year as I was telling Gerald mister Packard s daughter missus Delbert and her young son were with us When missus Delbert heard the story of Meg s devotion to her foster parents and how she is trying to become a teacher that she might make life easier and pleasanter for them she at once wished to make Meg s acquaintance We hiked up to the Heger cabin one Saturday morning and although Meg willingly showed missus Delbert her botany gardens and her hurt animal hospital she was so reserved and shut away from us that we realized at once that she did not wish our friendship missus Delbert invited Meg to spend a day with her at the ranch but the girl never came nor have I seen her since The other lad understood With me she is also distant and reserved he said but when she talks to Julie and Gerald she is very different Then returning to a remark made earlier he concluded My sister Jane would be greatly helped if she could see how much more naturalness is admired than cultivated poses but she will never learn from Meg Heger whom she considers greatly beneath her Then stopping he held out his hand Jean he said seriously I hope I have not given you a wrong opinion of my beautiful sister I honestly believe that the girl she used to be still lives beneath all this artificial veneer that she has acquired at the fashionable seminary and my most earnest wish is to find a way by which that other girl who was my dearly loved sister pal can be returned to me I would not have spoken of this were it not that I am as greatly troubled for Jane s sake as my own I am glad you told me Dan I too have faith in her Goodbye till next Sunday Dan walked slowly back to the cabin pleased indeed with his new friend Dan found his sister Jane alone with her book on the front porch of their cabin She looked up with a smile of welcome I was agreeably surprised in our guest she began at once and so before you tease me for having described him as raw boned and illiterate I will make the confession that I never met a better looking or nicer mannered youth Tut Tut her brother sinking to the doorstep where earlier in the day Jean had sat merrily shook a finger at his sister That is extreme praise and I may take offense since I consider myself good looking and nice mannered The girl laughed happily Her brother reflected that not in many a day had he seen her brow unclouded with frown or fretfulness Suddenly he said Jane have you changed your mind about going East next Tuesday He looked up inquiringly eagerly The girl flushed then said with an effort at indifference I thought perhaps it is hardly fair to decide that I do not like the mountain life after having been here for such a few days Shall you mind if I postpone my departure until a week from Tuesday The lad caught the hand that hung near him and pressed it with sudden warmth to his cheek Jane he said I m desperately lonesome for the comrade that my sister used to be Won t you give up all thought of going away and try once again to be that other girl Jane looked puzzled then she drew her hand away saying coldly You are evidently not satisfied with me I suppose that you also admire a girl who prefers to pare potatoes and stain her hands than you do one who keeps herself attractive Dan was astonished at the outburst but wisely made no comment though his thoughts were busy Evidently Jean Sawyer had told his sister that he admired a girl who could be useful as well as ornamental What would the result be he wondered But on the following day Jane permitted the other three to do all of the work of the cabin while she idled hours away at letter writing to her many girl friends in the East finished her book and started a bit of lace making which had been the popular pastime at the seminary At nine o clock on Monday the stage drew up in front of their stone stairway and the discordant sound from a horn seemed to be calling them and so Gerald hopped down to receive from mister Sourface Wallace a packet of newspapers and letters Oh thanks a lot mister Wallace the boy shouted knowing that the stage driver was deaf and then up the stairway he scrambled to distribute the mail There was a letter for each of the Abbotts from their father and a tiny note inclosed from grandmother with good advice for each not excluding Jane whose lips took their favorite scornful curve when it was read But a glance at her other two letters sent her to her own room where she could read them undisturbed One was from Merry Starr and instead of containing enthusiastic descriptions of the gay life at Newport which it was her good fortune to be living the epistle was crammed full of longing to see the wonderful West Tastes are surely different Jane thought as she opened the second epistle which was from Esther Ballard In it she read a news item which pleased her exceedingly Jane old dear was the very informal beginning Put on your remembering cap and you will recall that you told me if ever I could find another string of those semi precious cardinal gems that you so greatly admired to buy them at once notify you and you would send me the money Well the deed is done I have found the necklace and honestly Jane it holds all of the glory of the sunset and sunrise melted into one They will set off your dark beauty to perfection But I ll have to confess that I haven t a penny Always broke as you know and so if you want them you ll have to mail me twenty five perfectly good dollars by return post Yours in great haste E B Jane sat looking thoughtfully out of the window In about two weeks she would have a birthday and on that occasion her aunt after whom she was named always sent her the amount needed for the gems but in a postscript Esther had said that she had asked to have the chain held one week feeling sure that by that time Jane would have sent the money Taking from her purse two bills she put them in an envelope addressed to Esther added a hurried little letter stamped it and was just wondering how she would get it to the post when she saw Meg Heger coming down the road on her pony Although she herself would not ask a favor of the mountain girl she called Julie and requested that she hail Meg and ask her to mail the letter Not until it was done did Jane face her conscience Had she any right to use the tax money for a necklace She shrugged her shoulders What would two weeks more or less matter CHAPTER XX MEG AS SCHOOL MISTRESS Upon arriving in Redfords Meg Heger had at once given the letter which had been marked Important Rush to the innkeeper who was about to start for the station to meet the eastbound train He promised the girl to attend to putting the letter on the train himself and thus assured that she had served her neighbors to the best of her ability Meg went across the road to the school only to find that her good friend Teacher Bellows was not to be there that day as he had been sent for by a dying mountaineer in his capacity as preacher and had left word that he wished Meg to hear the younger children recite and dismiss them at two which was an hour earlier than usual Nothing pleased the girl more than to have an opportunity to practice the art of instruction since that was to be her chosen life work and a very happy morning she had with the dozen and one pupils queer little specimens of childhood although indeed several of them were beyond that being long lanky boys and girls in their teens They one and all loved Meg devotedly and considered it a rare treat to have her in charge of the class This happened quite often as in his double capacity as preacher as well as teacher the kindly old man had various calls upon his time some of them taking him so far into the mountains that he was obliged to be gone for days at a time Meg had a charming way quite her own of teaching with story and word pictures Even the master had to concede that she was more fitted by nature than he was to instruct the child mind At two o clock when the young teacher dismissed her class they flocked about her as she crossed the road to the inn The tallest among her pupils a rancher s daughter who was indeed as old as Meg put an arm lovingly about her as she said When yer through with yer schoolin don t I hope yo ll come back to Redfords an be our teacher The mountain girl laughed Why Ann Skittle she teased You will be married with a home of your own by the time that I am ready to teach You are seventeen now aren t you Ann s sunburned face flushed suddenly and her unexpected embarrassment caused Meg to believe that she had guessed more accurately than she had supposed Yeah I m seventeen But I ll be eighteen before snowfall an then Hank Griggs an me s goin to be married He s pa s hired man A new one from Arizony Then why should you care whether or not I teach the Redford school Meg turned at the lowest step of the inn porch to inquire Her dark eyes seemed always to hold a kindly interest in whatever they looked upon were it a hurt little animal or as at that moment a girl who had not been endowed with much natural intelligence Ann Skittle again visibly embarrassed stood looking down twisting one corner of her apron as she said in a low voice Me an Hank is like to have kiddies an I d be wishin you could teach em Suddenly Meg leaned over and impulsively kissed the flushed face of her surprised companion Of course you ll have little ones dear she said and in her voice there was a note of tenderness No greater happiness can come to any girl than just that to be a mother and to have a mother She turned away to hide the tears that mist like always rose to her own eyes when she thought of the mother whom she never knew Ann calling goodbye walked away toward the corral back of the school where her pony had been for hours awaiting her When Meg entered the front room of the inn her smile was as bright as ever missus Bently often said that it didn t matter how gloomy the day might be when Meg appeared with that lighten up smile of hers somehow it seemed as though the sun had burst through and even if things had been going wrong they began to go right then and there missus Bently the girl said Pa Heger told me not to come home today without the County Weekly News It s days overdue The comely woman s face brightened Wall I ve found that newspaper at last she announced That man of mine didn t have on his specks when he was sortin the mail I reckon Anyhow he stuck that paper o yer pa s way over into mister Peters box Twas fetched clear out to his ranch and fetched back agin Thanks Meg said brightly as she took the paper It won t matter any I don t suppose there s any startling news in it Half way up the mountain road Meg drew rein and listened There was not a breath of wind stirring The sun beat down relentlessly and heat shimmered from the red gold dust of the road ahead The only sounds were the humming buzzing and wing whirring of the multitudinous insects all about her Then again she heard the sound which had first attracted her attention A pitiful little gasping cry Leaping from her pony she commanded Pal stand still for a moment One of our little brothers is calling for help Although the faint cry had instantly ceased Meg remembered the direction from which it had come and climbed agilely down the rocks to find that one having been dislodged had caught a Douglas squirrel s tail and had held it captive so long that the creature was nearly starved You poor little mite Meg said with tender sympathy as she stooped and after removing the heavy stone lifted the small creature in her hands She held it unresisting for a moment against her cheek then put it into one of her saddle bags Peering in she said assuringly Don t be frightened I m going to take you to the hospital but as soon as you are stronger you shall have your freedom The bead like eyes that looked up out of the dark depths of the bag seemed to be more appreciative than fearful There was a quality in Meg s voice when she spoke to the sad and wounded that soothed and comforted even though the words were not understood I ll take the newspaper out she thought then his bed will be more comfortable And as she did so she chanced to see a name which attracted her attention It was a name which had come within the last three days to mean much of possible comradeship to her It was Daniel Abbott Opening the paper the girl expected merely to read an article telling of the arrival of the Abbott family at their cabin on Redfords Peak but to her dismay the story that newspaper contained was of an entirely different nature It was a list of the properties in the county that were tax delinquents Meg learned from the short paragraph that the ten acres and cabin thereon belonging to one Daniel Abbott having been for three weeks advertised as delinquent was to be sold for taxes on August the tenth at five o clock unless the aforesaid taxes amounting to the sum of twenty five dollars should be paid before that hour The girl stared at the printed page unable at first to comprehend its meaning Then she glanced at the sun It was at least two thirty But what could it mean Surely the young man with whom she was talking but yesterday when the children had brought him to see the baby lions surely he had known of this and had paid the taxes Refolding the paper Meg started leisurely up the mountain road but something seemed to be urging her to at least tell Dan Abbott what she had seen Perhaps he had not paid the back taxes and if not she might be instrumental in saving his cabin home for him and yet even as she thought of it she was assailed with doubt It would be impossible to reach Scarsburg the county seat before five unless one rode at top speed and the Abbotts had neither car nor horse Meg had reached the stairway hewn in the rocks leading to the cabin which for so many minutes had been uppermost in her thoughts and she drew rein yodeling to a tall graceful girl whom she saw standing by a pine gazing out over the valley Jane Abbott turned and looked down amazed that the mountain girl should have the effrontery to yodel to her Just because she mailed a letter for me does not entitle her to my friendship as an equal Abruptly Jane turned her back and walked away toward the cabin Meg s face flushed and her inclination was to ride on to her own home but she recalled the clinging of little Julie s arms and the sweet yearning expression in the small girl s face when she had said Meg I like you I wish you were my sister instead of Jane You d love me wouldn t you Leaping from her pony she bade him wait for her and taking the paper the girl sprang nimble as a mountain goat up the rocky steps Jane had seated herself in the comfortable chair on the porch and was reading when she heard hurrying footsteps She looked up an angry color suffusing her cheeks This halfbreed was evidently going to force her acquaintance upon her Well she would soon regret it But the proud scornful words were never spoken CHAPTER XXI MEG AS BENEFACTRESS Dan and the children had gone on a hike and Jane being quite alone rose and confronted the mountain girl with a cold stare that would have caused Meg at another time to have whirled about and departed 
8321-284222-0001	train-other-500	but for the sake of the other three she was willing to be treated unkindly Miss Abbott she said holding out the newspaper and pretending not to notice the unfriendly expression there is news in here which may be of great importance to you
none	none	 May I show it to your brother 
8321-284222-0002	train-other-500	Suddenly Jane found herself trembling from some unnamed fear Instantly she had thought of the taxes Perhaps without really being conscious of it she had read the word somewhere on that outheld paper
8321-284222-0003	train-other-500	She sank back into her chair saying almost breathlessly Dan isn t here
none	none	 What is it Miss Heger Is something wrong The mountain girl pointed to the paragraph and was amazed at the effect the reading of it had upon the proud girl 
8321-284222-0004	train-other-500	There was an expression of terror in the dark eyes that were lifted Oh what shall I do What shall I do she implored helplessly
none	none	 Our father gave us the money 
8321-284222-0005	train-other-500	He told us the taxes must be paid but I thought another two weeks would do as well as now Dan did not know the need of haste Meg seeing that the girl
none	none	 unused to deciding matters of importance was more helpless than even Julie would have been 
8321-284222-0006	train-other-500	felt a sudden compassion for her and so she said If you can get the money to the county seat before five o clock you will not lose your property A dull flush suffused the dark face I I haven t the money I I borrowed it for something I wanted
8321-284222-0007	train-other-500	It was in that letter that Julie gave you this morning to mail Then looking up eagerly hopefully
none	none	 Miss Heger perhaps you forgot to post it 
8321-284222-0008	train-other-500	Oh how I hope that you did But the mountain girl shook her head
none	none	 I sent it by mister Bently to the eastbound train which was due about noon He said that he himself would put it in the mail car Then there is nothing that I can do 
8321-284222-0009	train-other-500	The proud girl burst into sudden tears Father has lost everything but our home in the East and now
none	none	 now I have been the cause of his losing the cabin he so loved 
8321-284222-0010	train-other-500	Lifting a tear stained face to the girl who was watching her troubled and thoughtful she implored Oh isn t there something I can do If I tell them I will pay it in two weeks when my birthday money comes won t that do as well as now Meg shook her head
8321-284222-0011	train-other-500	No she said This is final They notified your father some time ago Jane nodded hopelessly Oh if only brother were here But the worry would start him to coughing Again the girl who scorned tears in others began to sob helplessly
8321-284222-0012	train-other-500	How vain and foolish she had been to want that necklace
none	none	 hoping that it would make her appear more beautiful in the eyes of Jean Sawyer Meg stood for one moment deep in thought 
8321-284222-0013	train-other-500	Then she said Miss Abbott find your papers Have them ready for me when I return I ll try to save your place
none	none	 With that she turned and ran back to her pony leaped upon it and galloped out of sight up around the bend 
8321-284222-0014	train-other-500	What does she mean Jane sat almost as one stunned
none	none	 for a moment then as the command of the mountain girl recalled itself to her 
8321-284222-0015	train-other-500	she arose and went indoors to locate the papers their father had given Dan These being fastened with a rubber band into a neat packet she held closely while she ran out to the brook calling Dan s name frantically but there was no response
none	none	 Soon she heard the musical yodeling which had so filled her heart with wrath a short half hour before Now it was to her a sound sweeter than any she had ever heard 
8321-284222-0016	train-other-500	It brought a faint hope that her father s cabin might yet be saved Down the stone steps she went holding out the papers
none	none	 Then and for the first time she thought of something But the money I haven t any to give you Meg s answer was I am loaning you twenty five dollars from my savings 
8321-284222-0017	train-other-500	but don t hope too much It will be very hard for me to make Scarsburg by five o clock but for Julie s sake I ll do my best For Julie s sake
8321-284222-0018	train-other-500	The words drifted back to Jane as she stood watching the pony hurtling itself down the mountain road until the cloud of dust hid it from view She Jane had never done anything for Julie s sake
none	none	 and why pray should this mountain girl loan her own money to strangers who might never repay her and risk her life and that of her pony as it was evident she was doing Jane looked out into the heat shimmering valley Many times the mountain road reappeared to her as it zigzagged down to Redfords Again and again a rushing cloud of dust assured her that Meg was still racing with time Returning to the porch Jane sank down in the deep chair keenly conscious of her own uselessness Oh what a vain worthless creature I am I don t see why Dan cares for me so much 
8321-284222-0019	train-other-500	why he risked his health that I might finish my course in that seminary where everyone everything conspired to make me more proud and helpless Then before her arose a mental picture Meg clear eyed eager to be of service in an hour of need
8321-284222-0020	train-other-500	and more than that capable of being and she
none	none	 Jane had snubbed her but for Julie s sake the mountain girl had persevered in her desire to be neighborly 
8321-284222-0021	train-other-500	Unable to sit still
none	none	 Jane went again to the brook to call but the children with Dan had climbed higher than usual and had found so much to interest them that they had failed to note the passage of time As there was no answer to her calling 
8321-284222-0022	train-other-500	Jane went back to the house and because she had to do something she had entirely lost interest in her book she wandered out into the kitchen She saw on the table a pan of potatoes with the paring knife near Hardly knowing what she was about
none	none	 Jane took the pan to the porch and seating herself on the step she began most awkwardly to pare She had heard her grandmother say that the peeling should be as thin as possible as the goodness was next to the skin It took a very long time for Jane to pare the half dozen potatoes and she had almost resolved not to tell Dan about the taxes until she knew the worst or the best 
8321-284222-0023	train-other-500	when she heard him hallooing from the brook Placing the pan on the step she ran to meet him
none	none	 One glance at her white startled face assured him 
8321-284222-0024	train-other-500	more than words could have done that something of an unusual nature had occurred during their absence Catching her in his arms he felt her body tremble He led her back to the porch before he asked Jane tell me What has happened Has that Slinking Coyote frightened you
8321-284222-0025	train-other-500	Julie and Gerald wide eyed and wondering crowded near Dan
none	none	 Jane clung to him as she had not since the long ago childhood 
8321-284222-0026	train-other-500	when she had so often been frightened and had turned to him for protection please send the children away I want to tell you alone Gerald needed no second bidding Come on Julie he called Let s go and practice on our pine tree rifle range He was carrying the small gun and so away they raced
none	none	 Although they were almost overcome with natural curiosity they neither of them desired to stay where they were not wanted When they were gone Jane leaned against her brother and told the story between sobs that were almost hysterical 
8321-284222-0027	train-other-500	Oh brother brother If only this cabin is saved for Dad I will never never again be so vain and selfish Oh Dan tell me say that you think Meg will reach the county seat before five The lad found that his heart was filled with conflicting emotions
none	none	 The scorn his sister s pride and selfishness would have aroused in him at another time was crowded out by pity for her She had suffered enough without his rebuke Then there was the dread that the cabin might not be saved for well he knew the sorrow its loss would bring to his father 
8321-284222-0028	train-other-500	but above all there was something in his heart he had never felt before a warm glow of admiration for a girl who was not his sister What he said was Jane dear quiet yourself We can do nothing but wait
8321-284222-0029	train-other-500	And a long long wait they were destined to have The hands of the clock moved slowly to four then five and then six
none	none	 Jane s poor efforts at paring the potatoes received much comment from the children alone in the kitchen 
8321-284222-0030	train-other-500	Gee Gerald confided to his small sister
none	none	 something must have happened if it upset Jane so she didn t know what she was doing She surely didn t or she wouldn t have tried to pare potatoes and stain those lily hands of hers 
8321-284222-0031	train-other-500	Try as the small boy might he could not keep the scorn out of his voice But Julie was more forgiving Gerry don t be too hard on Jane
none	none	 She acts awfully worried about something 
8321-284222-0032	train-other-500	I don t believe she saw a bear or anything that scared her I think it s something in her heart that s troubling her I think she s sorry about something she s done
none	none	 Well she sure ought to be The boy was less sympathetic She s been dirt mean to us ever since she s been home from that hifalutin seminary and what s more she s none too good to Dan I d hate her 
8321-284222-0033	train-other-500	that s what if she wasn t my sister and if she didn t look just like our mother But even for all of that I m going to let myself hate her hard if she isn t better to you Jule
none	none	 The way she lets you do the work and she setting around reading novels to keep her hands white so s folks will admire them Aren t you the same family as she is and shouldn t your hands be kept just as white Tell me that now The boy who was holding the bread knife whirled with such an indignant expression on his freckled face 
8321-284222-0034	train-other-500	that Julie laughed merrily which broke the spell Oh Gerry you do look so funny
none	none	 If I had time I d find some riggins to make you into a pirate It could be done easy cause your face looks just like their pictures and that knife would do for a dagger 
8321-284222-0035	train-other-500	Meanwhile on the front porch the two who had long watched and waited were getting momentarily more anxious and often
none	none	 Dan walked to the top of the steep stairway 
8321-284222-0036	train-other-500	down which he gazed at the zig zagging mountain road At last he saw a pony climbing oh so slowly as though it could hardly take another step and at its side there walked a girl Dan leaped back to the porch and snatched up his hat
8321-284222-0037	train-other-500	Jane he said you and the children have your supper I m going up to the Heger cabin and get one of their horses
none	none	 Meg s pony is worn out and I m not going to have that brave girl walk all the way up the mountain just to serve us 
8321-284222-0038	train-other-500	Jane did not try to detain him and the lad fairly leaped up the road to the Heger cabin
none	none	 He found the trapper who had just returned from a ride over the other side of the mountain Take this hoss he said when he had heard the story which fairly tumbled from Dan s mouth Ol Bag o Bones ain t a bit tired and he s the best hoss I have on the place 
8321-284222-0039	train-other-500	Then the man held out a strong hand as he said Dan boy I hope my gal made it She would if anyone could Dan silently returned the clasp then he mounted the horse
none	none	 that was not at all what its name might suggest but lean and wiry as were all of the mustangs of the West with hard muscles and a loping step that carried it down the road 
8321-284222-0040	train-other-500	sure footed and with great rapidity Jane heard the halloo when he passed but she did not stir
none	none	 She felt that she never could move again until she had learned the news that Meg would have for them And Meg far down the mountain looked up and saw Bag o Bones her foster father s favorite horse descending with speed and believing it to be ridden by mister Heger she wondered why at that hour he was in such haste But at a lower turn of the road she saw that the figure on the horse was that of the lad from the East who as yet did not know how to ride as they did in the West Then she knew why he was coming and for the first time in her lonely isolated life there was a sudden warmth in her heart She had a real friend she knew that instinctively and his name was Dan Abbott CHAPTER XXII MEG S CONFIDENCE As soon as Dan was near enough to see Meg s face he knew that all was well Leaping from the back of the dusty gray horse he went forward with both hands outheld Miss Heger he cried and his voice was tense with emotion how can I how are we ever going to thank you for what you have done for us today The girl s radiant smile flashed up at him Be my friend she said simply and as the lad stood there looking deep into those wonderful dark eyes he seemed to feel that no greater privilege could be accorded him than to be permitted to be the friend of this courageous rarely beautiful mountain girl But she did not give him the opportunity to voice his feeling for at once she said in a matter of fact tone Wasn t I lucky to reach the county court house at five minutes to five Pal and I have been congratulating each other all the way home Poor Pal Dan stroked the drooping head of the faithful little animal which had raced down the rough mountain road as he had never raced before Then quite irrelevantly the youth asked Would you mind if I call you Margaret It fits you better than Meg Instantly Dan was sorry he had made the request for he saw the sudden clouding of the girl s brow The joyousness of the moment before was gone and when she spoke there was a note of sorrow in her voice mister Abbott she began with sweet seriousness I forgot when I said that your friendship would be the reward I would ask yours and Julie s and Gerald s I forgot who I am or rather that I do not know who my parents were My real name is not Meg Mammy Heger called me that after a little sister of hers who had died when a baby Mammy loved that other Meg and so it meant a great deal to her to call me by that name Then sighing wistfully I wish I knew my real name she concluded Dan took her hand in a firm friendly clasp as he said earnestly Meg Heger I don t care what your name is I don t care who your parents were I care only to be your friend your very best Of course I would not wish to call you Margaret since it would be displeasing to you The girl withdrew her hand replying Call me Meg I m used to that and hearing it won t make me think Oh I ve thought about it all so long and so much Then as they started walking side by side leading their horses the girl confided Next month when I am eighteen Teacher Bellows Pa Heger and I are going to start on a long hard trip We re going to find if we can the tribe that was living in the deserted mining town on Crazy Creek the year that I was brought to the Heger cabin How her dark face brightened and Dan realized that he had never dreamed that anyone could be so beautiful If we find them then I shall know she concluded For a few moments they walked on in silence If they tell me I am the daughter of The girl hesitated as though dreading to utter the name of Slinking Coyote then began again If I am a member of their tribe I shall live near them and help them I shall be a teacher to their children It will be my duty But if as Pa Heger and Teacher Bellows think my parents were of a foreign race my future will be different Dan knowing how deeply humiliating the conversation must be for the girl and wishing to change the subject exclaimed How stupid of me I brought Bag o Bones down for you to ride You must be very tired after your wild race to Scarsburg The girl smiled gratefully I believe I am very very tired she confessed which happens but seldom I had thought that I was tireless They soon reached the road in front of the Abbotts cabin and Meg bade Dan take from the pony s saddle bags the papers and receipts Although he pleaded to be permitted to accompany her to her home she shook her head You haven t had your supper and it is very late Then impulsively she reached down her brown hand as she said with an almost tremulous smile Good night my friend It was early dusk when Jane still sitting on the porch of their cabin intently listening heard voices and the clattering of slow moving horses along the mountain road below the bend She leaped to her feet her breath came with nervous quickness she pressed her hand to her heart Oh what if Meg had been too late Before she could decide what she ought to do she heard Dan s voice calling to the mountain girl who was evidently not stopping Jane ran to the top of the stone stairway How ungrateful it must have seemed for her not to have been there to thank Meg for the effort she had made whether or not it was successful But Dan was leaping up the steps two at a time his face radiant Jane thought that all of his joyousness was caused by the message he was shouting to her Sister that wonderful girl reached there on time Our cabin is saved for us How can we ever thank her Jane who had never been so upset by anything before in her protected life clung to her brother almost hysterically Oh Dan Dan I am so thankful Do you think Meg Heger will ever forgive me I was so rude to her when she first came The lad was serious at once I do not know that she will he replied as he recalled that the mountain girl had said the reward she requested was the friendship of all the Abbotts except Jane It was hard not to rebuke his sister for her foolish pride but she was trembling as she clung to him and so he encircled her with his arm as he said hopefully Meg is too fine a girl to hold a grudge when she finds out that your heart has changed Jane said nothing but she suddenly wondered if in reality her heart had changed Now that the taxes were paid and the hours of anxiety were over she was not sure that she cared to begin an intimate friendship with a halfbreed merely to show her gratitude but even as she was conscious of this shrinking the voice of her soul told her that she was despicable The children who had been on the kitchen porch hearing Dan s voice rushed out but Jane delayed him long enough to whisper They know nothing of what has happened Please do not tell them Gerald was the first to reach them and he cried rebukingly Dan why did you go horseback riding without taking me I saw you go by an hour ago I m just wild to learn to ride that Bag o Bones Do you think mister Heger will let me Dan realized that the younger members of their family thought he had merely been for a horseback ride and so he made no further explanation replying gayly Indeed I do But I think you would better take your first lesson on the level Wait until we go down to the Packard ranch You remember that good friend of ours told us that he had forty horses and many of them were broken to the saddle Julie clapped her hands as she hopped up and down gleefully Me too she cried ungrammatically mister Packard said he had a little spotted horse just the right size for me When are we going down there Dan The older lad glanced at his sister Did you say that we are to go next Sunday The girl nodded but the boy looked perplexed But how he queried If we went to Redfords by the stage how are we to get to the Packard ranch And we couldn t possibly return on the same day Jane thought for a moment then she looked up brightly I recall now Jean Sawyer said that we would hear from mister Packard during the week Then she smilingly confessed I was so pleased to find the foreman different I mean one of our own class that Gerald noting the blushes pointed a chubby finger at his sister as he sing songed Jane likes Jean Sawyer extra special It was Julie knowing that her sister did not like to be teased who came to the rescue by saying emphatically So do I like Jean Sawyer extra special and I know what girl you like best Gerald Abbott It s Meg Heger so now The small boy grinned his agreement Bet you I do he confessed Dan said nothing but by the warm glow in his heart at the mention of the mountain girl s name he knew that he also liked Meg Heger extra special CHAPTER XXIII JANE HUMILIATED The next morning Jane arose early with the determination to walk up the mountain road and meet Meg Heger on her way to the Redfords school And so directly after breakfast she started away alone She asked Dan to detain the children in the kitchen that they might not see her go and perhaps wish to accompany her The older lad recalling the incident of the mountain lion wondered if he ought to permit her to go alone but the trapper had assured him that the occurrence had been a most unusual one that the lions and other wild creatures usually remained far from the haunts of man and that in the ten years that Meg had ridden up and down that mountain road to the Redfords school she had never encountered a dangerous animal of any kind The sun even at that early hour was so warm Jane was glad that most of the mile she was to climb was in the shadow She found herself scanning the roadside with great interest stopping to watch a scaly lizard that was lying on a rock gazing at her intently with small back eyes believing himself to be unseen because his coat was the color of his surroundings He had not stirred even when she started away It was a still morning and out of many a cool green covert a bird song pealed Again and again Jane paused to listen to some clear rising cadence She wondered why she had never before heard the singing of birds Of course she must have heard them many many times They had often awakened her in her home and at Highacres but she had felt disturbed rather than pleased She never before had listened to a single song like the one which some hidden bird was singing It would be interesting to know what kind of a bird it was She would ask Meg Heger Surely the mountain girl would know Jane Abbott had not been in so susceptible a mood at least not since her long ago childhood and it was with a sense of eager anticipation that she at last drew to one side of the road to await the coming of the small horse and rider that she could hear approaching Meg Heger was indeed surprised to see the sister of Dan Abbott in the road so evidently awaiting her but she experienced no pleasure from the meeting She well knew that the city girl who had snubbed her on the day before would again do so if it were not that she considered it her duty to express gratitude for what Meg had done She drew rein merely because Jane Abbott had stepped forward and had held up her hand The expression in the dusky eyes of the mountain girl was at that moment as proud and cold as had been the expression in the eyes of Jane on the day previous Before the girl in the road could speak Meg said Miss Abbott I know that you have come to thank me for having ridden to Scarsburg but let me assure you at once that I did not do it for your sake I did it for Julie and Gerald chiefly because they are my friends You owe me nothing Good morning The pony feeling the urging of his mistress heel started away so suddenly that Jane found herself standing in a whirl of dust Her face grew crimson as her anger rose She Jane Abbott had actually been snubbed by a halfbreed It had been only natural that she a city girl of family and culture should have snubbed Meg Heger But she had supposed that the mountain girl would be pleased indeed when she condescended to be friendly As she walked slowly back toward their cabin she did not hear the song of the birds nor see the beauty that lay all about her She was wrathfully deciding that she would pack at once and leave a place where it was possible for her to be snubbed by a halfbreed Indian Then that persistent voice deep within her asked Didn t you deserve it Jane Would you admire a girl who would fall upon your neck after you had been rude to her And Jane had to acknowledge that the soul voice was right But though Jane had seemed to have a change of heart toward Meg Heger she still felt most irritable toward Julie Nothing that small girl could do pleased her She had at once retired to her room wishing to be alone True she had decided to try to win the friendship of the mountain girl but after the first few hours she found herself questioning if she really wanted it Of course she did not She wanted only friends of her own kind She flung herself down on her bed and in her heart was a growing anger at herself and at everyone Dan had gone for the daily climb which he believed would aid the recovery of his strength as indeed everything seemed to be doing in a most miraculous manner Julie and Gerald were cleaning house and were dragging the heavy pieces of furniture about in the living room with shouts and laughter Jane sprang up and threw open her door I do wish you children would try to keep quiet she blazed at them Gerald faced her defiantly Come and do the cleaning yourself if you want it done different There s no reason why we should do it at all only Julie said being as it hadn t been done right since we came we d ought to get at it You re just hateful both of you I wish you would clear out of my sight and never come back With this angry remark Jane closed her door with a bang With a dark glance in that direction Gerald caught Julie by the hand Come on sis he said You n I ll clear out and we ll stay away till that Jane Abbott goes back East that s what we ll do The boy snatched up his small gun and put the cartridges in his pocket He took his cap and handed Julie her hat and then led her out of the door Why Gerald Abbott where are we going the small girl held back feeling sure that they ought not to leave their cabin home in this manner First off we re going to find Dan and tell him just what happened Then second off I don t zactly know what we will do but I just won t stay here and have that horrid old Jane saying mean things to you all the time and us waiting on her and doing the work she ought to be doing That s what The boy led his small sister along so rapidly that she tripped and would have fallen had he not turned and caught her Gee I guess we ll have to go slower he confessed as they started to climb the steep rocks that formed the outer edge of the mountain brook which tumbled in a series of little waterfalls now and then tossing a mist of spray over them Julie began to glow with the pleasurable sense of adventure supposing of course that Gerald knew where Dan had gone At last she inquired I sort o think we ll find him up at the rim rock Gerald said stoutly I m pretty sure we will He told me that s where he goes for his constitootional That means a hike to make him get strong constitootional does The girl s freckled face was aglow Oh goodie she cried I d love to climb way up there Then she asked a little anxiously Aren t you skeered we might meet a wildcat or a lion or a bear Her small brother s courage was reassuring I hope we will That s what I m a sharpshooter I am and the wildcat that meets us will wish he hadn t Julie clung to his hand with a secure feeling that she was well protected Oh look it will you Gerry pointed ahead and above There s a tree that has fallen right across our brook That s a nice bridge and if we can get up there we can go across on it Is the rim rock on the other side of our brook Julie inquired Now Gerald had never climbed that high on their mountain before and so he had no real knowledge of the exact location of the rock about which Dan had told them but since it was on the very top the small boy knew that if they kept on climbing in time they would surely reach it The fallen tree was lying across the brook at a very steep ascent and it was with great difficulty that Gerald boosted his sister to the narrow ledge on which it rested Don t be scared he said I ll get you across all right and then we ll begin calling for Dan CHAPTER XXIV JULIE AND GERALD LOST It was nearly noon when Dan returned to the cabin He gave a long whistle of astonishment when he saw the disordered living room and heard no one about Jane at once appeared in her doorway Her face still showed evidence of her anger Dan she said coldly my trunks are all packed Please put out a flag or whatever you should do to stop the stage It passes about one does it not on the way to Redfords The lad went to the girl with outstretched hands Jane dear what has happened Have you and the children had more trouble Is it so hard for you to love them and be patient with their playfulness You know it is nothing more The girl s lips curled scornfully Love them she repeated coldly I feel far more as if I hated them I don t believe love is possible to me I even hate myself Dan there s something all wrong with me and I m going back East to Merry who is about the only person living who can understand me There was an expression of tender rebuke in the gray eyes that were gazing at her You are wrong the lad said seriously Father and I love you dearly not only because we know that you are different from what you seem to be but for Mother s sake Then turning and glancing again at the confusion the lad said Tell me just what happened Jane did so adding petulantly My head was beginning to ache I had had an unpleasant encounter with your Meg Heger Dan felt a sudden leaping of his heart How strange he thought that for the first time in his life the name of a girl should so affect him He had heard of love at first sight but he had never believed in it With an effort he again listened to Jane s indignant outpouring of words Don t say I deserved just such treatment she protested No one knows it better than I do I acknowledge that I am despicable and I hate myself Honestly Dan I do but I don t know how to change I don t seem to really want to be different That s just it Jane The boy had grown very serious Just as soon as you desire to be different you will at once begin to change We are the sculptors of our own characters We can set before ourselves a model of what we would like to be and carve accordingly Then as the clock was striking twelve the lad suddenly inquired Jane when did all this trouble with the children occur I left at nine You think it was about an hour after that The girl nodded then glancing out of the wide front door she exclaimed I wonder why they don t come back I supposed of course that they had gone to find you Gerald knew where you were going didn t he Dan shook his head He could not have known for I did not myself Yesterday and the day before I climbed up to the rim rock and planned doing it every morning as a strength restorative measure but today after we had been wondering how we were to get to the Packard ranch I thought I would cross the mountain to the other side and look down into the valley and see if I could how much nearer was the trail which Jean Sawyer took on Sunday But I found that it would be much too rough and hard for you and so we will wait until we receive directions from mister Packard If you will prepare the lunch I will go out and put up a white flag Surely mister Wallace will know that I wish to speak to him Then I will call the children to come home They may be close but since you told them that you wished you would never see them again they are probably hiding hoping that you are to go on the afternoon stage Jane was indeed miserable Her flaring anger had often caused her to say things that afterwards she deeply repented Perhaps if I would go with you and call they would know that I did not mean all that I said she ventured But Dan was insistent that she at least prepare a lunch for herself You must not start for the East without having a good hearty noon meal he told her As he spoke he was fastening an old pillow case to a pole Leaving the house he placed it at the top of the stairway Then going to the brook he began a series of halloos but a hollow distant echo was all that responded Dan after a fruitless effort to call to the children returned to the cabin his face an ashen white Jane he said and his voice was almost harsh you will have to attend to stopping the stage if it comes soon mister Wallace can carry your baggage down without my assistance I am going to hunt for those poor little youngsters who felt that they were turned out of their home Goodbye Jane with a low cry of agony leaped forward with arms outstretched but Dan had not given her another look and by the time she reached the brook he was out of sight The girl sank down on a boulder and sobbed bitterly If they re lost I shall never forgive myself Oh how selfish how unkind I have been thinking only of Jane Abbott and her comfort I can t go away now and not know what has become of Julie and Gerald Then another thought caused her to rise and go slowly to the cabin They want me to go all of them even Dan Perhaps it would be the best thing for me to do and when they come back they will be glad to find that I have gone Almost unconsciously Jane began to put the living room in order She smoothed rugs and dragged the heavy furniture into the places it had formerly occupied Then she went to the kitchen to prepare lunch If Julie and Gerald had been climbing the mountains all the morning they would be starved as she well knew Again Jane Abbott pared potatoes and after studying upon the subject for some moments she made a fire in the stove and put on a kettle of water In the midst of these preparations she was startled by the shrill blast of the horn carried by the stage driver Oh she could not go just then She was nowhere near ready Jane snatched up a letter that she had that morning written to Merry and hurried down the stone steps The surly driver took it with a grunt which seemed to express displeasure although as Jane knew taking the mail to town was one of his duties When the big creaking stage had rocked around the corner Jane suddenly felt as though a great load had been lifted from her heart She had not really wanted to go at all She wanted to be sure that all was well with the children and more than that she did so want to see Jean Sawyer again But her pleasure was short lived for with a sense of oppression she again recalled that they would all be disappointed to find her there even Dan As the water in the tea kettle had not yet started to boil Jane went to her room to change her dress to one more suitable for the work she had undertaken Upon opening her trunk she saw lying on top a miniature picture delicately colored in a dainty frame of silver filigree The girl lifted it and looked long into the truly beautiful face Then with a half sob she said aloud My mother Instantly she recalled what Dan had said We are each of us sculptors of our own characters We can choose a model and carve ourselves like it The girl sank on her knees the picture held close to her cheek Oh mother mother she sobbed I choose you for my model Help me I am sure you can help me to be more like you A strange sense of strength came to her as she arose She had been struggling without a definite goal She had known the small voice within had often told her that she was despicable but she had not found a way to change but surely Dan s suggestion would help her She clearly remembered her mother gentle courageous and always loving With infinite tenderness Jane again addressed the miniature Oh mother if you had only lived you would have helped me carve a character more lovely but alone I have made of it an ugly thing but now dearest one I ll begin all over But even as the girl spoke she feared that it might be too late to ask Julie and Gerald to forgive her and try to love her CHAPTER XXV JANE S RESOLVE The lunch was prepared the potatoes had cooked quite to pieces but still the children did not return Jane was becoming terrorized She was startled when there came a sharp rapping at the front door Running into the living room her hand pressed to her heart she saw standing there a tall uncouth looking mountaineer She believed and rightly that it was the trapper who lived near them He began at once Dan Abbott came to our place nigh an hour ago sayin the young uns was lost Meg and me wasn t to home but my woman said she d tell whichever of us come fust and we d help hunt Ben t they back yet Jane shook her head Oh mister Heger she cried what do you suppose has happened to them Do you suppose they have been harmed It was unusual for the kind face of the man to look hard but at that moment it did so His voice was stern Dan Abbott said twas you as let them young uns go to hunt for him not knowin whar he was Wall Miss I ll tell ye this If tis they ever come back alive yo d better keep them young uns a little closer to home Thar s no harm if they stay on the road Nothin s likely to happen thar but way off in the wilderness places wall thar s no tellin what may have happened I ll bid you good day Here was still another of her fellow men who scorned her Of course Dan had not told him the whole truth that she had said she hoped she never again would see the children Oh why had she said it She knew even in her anger that she had not meant it She sank down on the porch and buried her face in her hands Would this torture never end The odor of something burning reached her and leaping to her feet she ran to the kitchen and pushed back the kettle of potatoes that had started to scorch There was no one to eat the lunch she had spread on the table and at two o clock she began to mechanically put things back in their places when she heard a step on the porch Running into the living room hardly able to breath in her great anxiety she saw her brother stagger in and fall as one spent from a long race on the cot bed they were using as a day lounge For a moment he lay white and still his eyes closed Jane knelt at his side and held his limp hand Brother Brother Dan she sobbed you are worn out Oh won t you stay here and let me be the one to hunt I would give my life to save the children Dan brother open your eyes and tell me that you forgive me and believe me A tightening of the clasp of the limp hand was the only answer she received Jane rising brought water cold from the brook and when she returned the lad was sitting up his elbows on his knees his face bent on the palms of his hands He looked at her as she handed him the goblet of water and when he saw the lines of suffering in her face his heart that had been like adamant softened Sister he took her hand as he spoke I well know we none of us mean what we say in anger and yet the results are often just as disastrous I have sent word to the Packard ranch for them to be on the lookout for our little ones Luckily high on the mountain I came upon the cabin of a forest ranger where there was a telephone to Redfords and missus Bently said she would relay the message to mister Packard Then he rose coughing in the same racking way that he had on the train Now I am rested I must start out again Jane clung to him trying to detain him Oh brother please eat something I had lunch all ready Even yet it is warm The lad smiled at her wanly but shook his head I couldn t swallow food and there are springs wherever I go Then turning back in the doorway and noting that Jane had flung herself despairingly on the lounge he said kindly Jane dear we often are taught much needed lessons through great suffering You and I will each have learned one of these if our little ones are found Then holding to a staff for support he again started away For another two long hours Jane sat in the porch chair as one stunned She had lost hope She was sure Julie and Gerald of their own free will would not stay away so long They must have been attacked by wild animals or kidnapped by that Ute Indian When the clock struck four Jane leaped to her feet She could no longer stand the inactivity She simply must do something Going to her room she again unpacked her trunk and took from it a riding habit of dark blue tweed She donned the neat fitting trousers that laced to the ankles her high riding boots the long skirted coat and a small visored cap None of her costumes was more becoming but not once did Jane glance in the mirror She had but one desire and that was to help find the children She was about to write a note to tell Dan that she also had gone in search of Julie and Gerald when she again heard a step on the porch a light quick footfall which she had not heard before In the open doorway stood Meg Heger Without a word of greeting she said The children have they been found No no Jane cried Dan was here two hours ago and oh Miss Heger he is all worn out I am as troubled about him or nearly as I am about Julie and Gerald He told me to stay here for the children might return but it is so long now They left at nine this morning I am sure they will not come back alone and I also must go in search of them The mountain girl s dusky eyes had been closely watching the speaker and she seemed to sense that the proud girl was in no way considering herself Jane Abbott she said seriously it would be foolhardy for you an Easterner unused to our wilderness ways to start out alone You would better heed your brother s wishes and remain here But the girl to whom she spoke was beyond the power to reason No No she cried Oh Meg Heger if you are going I beg of you let me go with you The mountain girl thought for a moment then she said I will leave word for whoever may return Taking from her pocket the notebook and pencil she always carried she tore out a page and wrote upon it Jane Abbott and Meg Heger are going to the Crazy Creek Camp in search of the children The hour is now four thirty If we think best we will remain there all night The Eastern girl shuddered when she read the note but made no comment Let us tack it on the door after we have closed it she suggested This was done and taking the stout staff Dan had cut for her Jane followed her companion whom she was glad to see carried a gun Silently they climbed the natural stairway of rocks that ascended by the brook until they reached the pine which having fallen across the stream formed a bridge Meg uttered an exclamation and turning back she said We are on the right trail Jane Abbott There is a torn bit of your sister s red gingham dress on the tree She evidently feared to walk across and so she jumped over Jane s eyes glowed with hope How happy I would be if we were the ones to find them although of course the important thing is that they shall be found Meg often broke through dense undergrowth holding open a place for Jane to pass then again she took the lead beating ahead with her staff to startle serpent or wild creature that might be in hiding Jane though greatly frightened followed quietly but now and then when back of Meg she pressed her hand to her heart to still its too rapid beating They came to a wall of almost perpendicular rocks which the mountain girl said would save them many minutes if they could scale How Meg climbed them alone and unaided was indeed a mystery to the watcher below The toe of her boot fitted into a crevice so small that it did not seem possible that it could be used as a stair but with little apparent effort the ascent was made and then kneeling on the top Meg leaned far down and pulled Jane to a place at her side At last they came to what appeared to be a grove of poles so straight and tall were the pines They were on a wide slowly ascending mountainside The ground was soft with the drying needles and it was easier to walk Jane commented on the grove like aspect of the place and Meg at once told her that they were called lodge pole trees because Indians had used them as the main poles in their wigwams It is the Tamarack Pine the mountain girl said and then as the ground was level for a considerable distance she walked more rapidly and neither spoke for some time Jane was wretchedly unhappy and she well knew that she never again would be happy unless the children were found Redfords Peak is one of the lowest in the range Meg turned to say when they had left the pole pine grove and were climbing over rugged bare rocks which in the distance had looked to Jane unscaleable but Meg in each instance found a way At last they stood on a large flat rock which formed a small plateau This is the left shoulder of the peak Meg paused to say and it is here that we begin the descent to Crazy Creek mine See far down there beyond the foothills is the Packard ranch The buildings are large but they do not appear so from here Jane sitting on a rock to rest at Meg s suggestion looked about her eager to find some trace of the lost children From time to time they had both shouted but there had been no answer save the startled cry of birds or the scolding of squirrels who greatly objected to intruders Suddenly the Eastern girl uttered an exclamation of surprise Why there is the stage road not very far below us Wouldn t it have been easier for us to follow that Meg nodded Much easier but I had been told that the children started away along the brook so if they were to be found we would have to hunt in the way they had gone Of course and we did find that torn bit of Julie s dress Meg looked at her companion eagerly Are you rested enough now to start down It is an easy descent to the road and we will follow it directly into the camp As she spoke she glanced anxiously at the sun It is dropping rapidly to the horizon Jane having followed the glance of the other commented Silently they began the descent Jane found it much easier than she had supposed and before long they were on the stage road which zigzagged downward They had not gone far when Jane said What a queer color the sunlight is becoming She turned to look toward the west and uttered an exclamation Meg she cried unconsciously using the mountain girl s Christian name the sun looks like a ball of orange fire and the mountain range is being hidden by a yellow haze What can it mean It means that a summer storm is brewing Let us make haste We will soon be under the shelter of the pines and just below them is the Crazy Creek camp We will keep dry in one of the old cabins These sudden storms though often cloudbursts are of short duration There was a weird light under the great old pines but in the spaces between they saw that clouds were rapidly gathering close above them Then a vivid flash of lightning almost blinded them Instantly it was followed by a crash of thunder which seemed to make the very mountain rock Big drops of rain could be heard pelting among the trees though few of them could be felt because of the densely interwoven branches Meg drew her companion close to one of the great old trunks It isn t safe under trees is it Jane s face was white with fear Her companion s matter of fact voice calmed her As safe as it is anywhere she commented It won t last five minutes and we won t be much wet The flashes of lightning and crashes of thunder were incessant and the road out of which they had scrambled became for a moment a raging torrent I ve been struck Jane cried out I know I have I feel the electricity pulling at my hair Again the calm voice You are all right That is because we are so near the cloud The air is charged with electricity The storm was gone as quickly as it had come but there was a roaring rushing noise near That s the Crazy Creek It floods for a few moments after every cloudburst Quick now let s make for the shelter of a cabin The camp is just below here Meg fairly dragged Jane out from under the pines The light was brighter and the Eastern girl saw beneath her a scene of desolation but before she could clearly define it Meg had dragged her into an old log cabin There was a joyous cry from within It was Gerald shouting Meg you ve come I knew you would CHAPTER XXVI A RECONCILIATION The small boy ignoring Jane sprang toward the mountain girl and dragged her into the cabin On the floor lay Julie her cheeks wet with tears her eyes dulled with suffering With a glad cry Jane leaped into the darkened room and was about to take the small girl in her arms but Julie turned away and held her hands out toward Meg when to their surprise Jane sank down in a worn out heap on the floor and began to sob bitterly Oh mother mother she cried as though addressing someone she knew must be present help me to take your place with Julie and Gerald Tell them to forgive me Meg feared that Jane s long day of anguish had temporarily unbalanced her mind but Julie hearing that cry reached out a comforting hand Jane she said weakly don t feel so badly I guess we were awfully trying me and Gerald Passionately Jane caught the child in her arms and held her close She kissed her forehead and her tumbled hair Then she reached out a hand to the boy who had drawn near amazed to see his usually cold hard sister so affected Give me another chance Gerald she cried tears streaming unheeded down her cheeks Don t hate me yet I m going to begin all over I m going to try to be like mother A cry of pain from the small girl then caught her attention Julie what is it dear Are you hurt What has happened Gerald spoke up That s why we came in here We were headin down the mountain for the Packard ranch when Julie fell I guess her ankle is hurt Meg at once was on her knees unbuttoning the high shoe The ankle was swollen but there were no bones broken It is a bad sprain she said Then swinging the knapsack which she always carried when on a mountain hike from her back she took out her emergency kit She washed the angry looking place with soothing liniment and then wound tightly about it strips of clean white cloth Now she said we will have some refreshments This amazed her listeners and greatly pleased at least one of them Gee golly Gerald cried I hadn t thought of it before but I guess I m starving to death more n likely Meg smiled as she produced a box of raisins This may not seem much of a menu but it is all one needs for several days to sustain life The small boy took a generous handful and gobbled it with speed Then the mountain girl brought out a canteen Bring us some water from the creek she told him Jane held out a detaining hand Oh Meg she implored don t send Gerry to that raging torrent Don t you remember how we heard it roaring But you don t hear it now was the reply The water from the cloudburst has long since gone to the valley to be absorbed much of it in the coarse gravel You ll find Crazy Creek just as it always is That s where Julie sprained her ankle Gerald said We were trying to reach it to get a drink He soon returned with the canteen full of ice cold water His eyes were wide Say girls he began we can t make it home tonight can we The sun s going down west of our peak right this minute We didn t expect to Meg replied Gerald you come with me and we will bring in pine branches or kinnikinick if we can find any for our beds From her knapsack Meg took a folding knife as she talked Kinnikinick the boy gayly repeated Everything that had happened now appeared to him in the light of a jolly adventure except of course Julie s ankle and she no longer seemed to be in pain What sort of a thing is that Meg had led the way out of the cabin Here s some she shouted and the boy raced over to find the girl whom he so admired bending over a dense evergreen vine It s prettier in winter she told him for then it has red berries among the bright green leaves It makes a wonderful bed It is so soft and springy After half an hour of effort branches of pine and some of the kinnikinick were laid on the floor Julie was made comfortable but Jane would not lie down She sat with her back against the wall holding the small girl s head on her lap Dan had been right One could carve oneself after a model Never never again would she lose sight she assured herself of her chosen goal which was to do in all things as her dear mother would have done As soon as the sun sank it began to grow dark Meg had at once barred the door and also she had examined the floor and walls to be sure that there was no yawning knothole large enough to admit a snake The children slept from sheer exhaustion but Jane and Meg stayed awake through the seemingly endless hours while night prowlers howled many times close to their cabin At the first gray streak of dawn Julie stirred uneasily and began to cry softly Meg begged Jane to change positions with her and completely worn out Jane did lie down on the pine boughs which had been so placed that they were springy and comfortable Almost at once she fell asleep Meg removed the bandages that were hot from the little girl s hurt ankle and again applied the cooling liniment Other fresh strips of cloth were used and then with the small head pillowed on Meg s lap Julie again fell asleep Gerald had not wakened through the night not even when a curious wolf had sniffed at their doorsill and had then lifted his head to wail out his displeasure The sun was high above the peak when Jane leaped up startled from her restless slumber What was that I thought I heard a gun shot You did Nothing seemed to stir Meg from her undisturbed calm Someone is coming Julie will you sit up against the wall dear and I will open the door Gerald half awake but sensing some excitement leaped out of the cabin his small gun held in readiness Do you spect it s the Utes he asked almost hoping that the answer would be in the affirmative But Meg laughed No she said It is probably someone searching for you Then she fired in answer From not far above them came two gun shots in rapid succession Oh boy Gerald leaped to a position where he could see the road as it wound under the pines There are two horsemen Gee One of em is Dan And the other is Jean Sawyer his companion told him Julie had wanted to see what was going on so hopping on one foot she appeared in the doorway supported by Jane The two lads uttered whoops of joy when they saw the group awaiting them Dan at once caught Gerald in his arms and then glanced tenderly toward the two in the doorway Little did Jane guess that in that moment white and worn as she was she had never looked so beautiful to her brother And as for Jean Sawyer he saw in the face which had charmed him a softer expression and he knew that some great transformation had taken place in the soul of the girl Leaping forward he said with deep solicitude Oh Miss Jane how you have suffered Dan lifted Julie most carefully to the back of his horse as he said Meg can you ride in front of this little miss and I will walk at your side Then he smiled and Jane glancing at him anxiously rejoiced to note he was not ill as she had feared he would be though he did look very tired The lad continued You see Jean and I expected to find you all here Intuitive knowledge if you wish to call it that and so we planned what we would do Jane is to ride on Silver which mister Packard loaned us and Jean will lead the way But where are we going his older sister inquired Down to the ranch Jean replied I had strict orders to bring you back with me all of you for that visit that you were to have paid at the weekend Meg was about to demur but the lad hastened to say I told your father that I would telephone the forest ranger as soon as you all were located He is waiting there for a message and I cannot until I get you to the ranch Still Meg thought she ought to climb back to her own home but Jane implored Oh don t leave me I do so want you to go with us That settled it and though the girl from the East little dreamed it there was a warm glow of joy in the heart of the mountain girl who had so wanted a friend of her own age Jane shuddered as they rode down the old trail of the deserted mining camp Shacks in all degrees of ruin stood about machinery was rusting where it had been left The beauty of the mountain had been marred by dark tunnels outside of which stood heaps of orange and blue gray refuse Even in the more substantial log huts made of aspen poles windows were broken and doors hung on one hinge The desolation of the place will haunt my dreams forever the girl from the East said And all this Jean made a wide sweep with his arm because the paying vein they had been so frantically following was lost It might have been found mister Packard told me but another rich strike was made on Eagle Head Mountain and the inhabitants of this camp to a man deserted it and flocked to that new mine and from there they probably followed other lures ending I suppose as poor or poorer than when they began Dan was interested Then the lost vein may still be here who knows he commented with a backward glance at the deserted camp they had left And yet was it deserted As soon as the young people were gone a stealthy figure appeared slinking out of one of the huts It was the old Ute Indian and since he carried a pick and shovel it was quite evident that he had started out to dig Was it the lost vein or some other treasure that he sought CHAPTER XXVII THE GREEN HILLS RANCH Shielded from the fury of the storms by gently sloping foothills the rambling Packard ranch house presented a very inviting appearance to the young people as the two big horses carefully picked their way down the last steep trail O how beautiful was Jane s involuntary exclamation when the level road having been reached she felt freer to look about and admire the scene I had no idea that a mere ranch could be so attractive A great change was evident in the Eastern girl and Jean Sawyer had been quick to notice it Not once that morning had she seemed to be posing that she might appear more charming to him She was just sweetly sincerely natural The reason perhaps was that Jane had suffered so much since his last visit that she had changed her estimate of real values She was so happy so at peace deep in her heart She had learned that her mother s little ones were dearer to her than all else and so the impression she might make had dwindled in importance If Jean had thought her beautiful on the day of their first meeting he thought her more lovely now although her face showed evidence of a great weariness and the hours of anxiety through which she had passed He smiled up at her as he walked at her side one hand resting on the horse s bridle mister Packard and I have tried out many schemes to make our home more beautiful he told her That little artificial lake surrounded by cottonwood trees and willows we made quite by ourselves A mountain stream flows into it Indeed there are many springs in these foothills and that is why they have such a soft velvety green appearance when the desert and mountains are so dry They were passing through a vegetable garden where a beaming Chinaman hoe in hand nodded to them Then came the flower gardens and Meg s enthusiasm though expressed in her usual quiet way was very evident How you do love flowers Dan said smiling up at her Indeed I do Meg replied They seem like live things to me and so I was not surprised to read recently that a scientist with some very delicate instrument has learned that many plants are sentient though not acutely so Since then I have never torn a plant ruthlessly That scientist advised cutting flowers rather than breaking them It was indeed Meg s much loved subject and her eyes glowed as she gazed at the banks of scarlet salvia at the masses of golden glow and many hued asters Someone else must love flowers she commented turning to look back at Jean He nodded It is my best friend mister Packard You two ought to be great cronies I sometimes tell him that I think it is the color effect rather than the individual flower that he so greatly admires but here he comes now They were riding up to the circling drive which passed under a vine covered portico mister Packard leaped down the steps with an agility which seemed to dispute the years his graying hair attributed to him Welcome he cried with a wide sweep of his sombrero This is indeed a pleasant surprise although I can hardly call it that as I have been watching for just such a cavalcade to come riding down my foothills ever since the dawn broke He held out his strong arms to lift little Julie whose face still tear stained and white with pain appealed to him He held her close as he listened sympathetically while Gerald told what had happened to the poor little foot Then after giving a word of greeting to each of the guests he bade them follow him indoors to the breakfast that had long been awaiting them The girls found that a wing containing two rooms and a bath and overlooking the little lake had been prepared for their comfort Gerald with the two older boys sought quarters elsewhere in the rambling ranch house which had room for the accommodation of many guests When you girls have prinked enough mister Packard said merrily follow the scent of the coffee and you will find the rest of us When the door had closed and the three girls were alone Jane held out a hand to Meg saying Will you forgive me for everything and let me try to be a real friend An expression of gladness in the mountain girl s dusky eyes was her most eloquent reply Directly after breakfast in the dining room which seemed to be all windows and where they were served by a silently moving Chinaman the girls were told that they were to go to their wing and rest until noon This was in no way a displeasing suggestion and in a very short while Julie and Jane in one room and Meg in the other were deep in slumber Gerald was also advised to rest but he declared that he would rather stay awake and see what was going to happen Dan laughed as he said that Gerald seemed always to believe that an adventure might begin at any moment What boy does not mister Packard smiled understandingly down at the stocky little fellow whose clear blue eyes and freckled face beamed good nature Then quite as though he could read the small boy s thought the man exclaimed Gerald you ought to wear my grandson s cowboy outfit He d be glad to loan it to you That this suggestion met with the youngster s entire approval was quite evident by the wild dance which he executed then and there Jean led the little fellow away and before long Gerald reappeared clothed in a costume of the most approved style a fringed buckskin suit a red bandana handkerchief loosely knotted about his neck while in one hand he held a wide felt hat on which to his great joy a dried rattlesnake skin served as band His own small gun was never out of his possession Great Dan said with brotherly pride I wish our dad and dear old grandmother might see you now Gerry You do indeed look ready to start on an adventure Where ll we go to look for it The small boy gazed eagerly hopefully up at their genial host Well sonny what kind of an adventure would you prefer the amused man asked as though he were willing at least to attempt to provide whatever adventure his small guest might desire I d like an Indian raid best or a hold up The boy was thinking of the most exciting things he could recall in his set of Wild West books but mister Packard shook his head Sorry to disappoint you sonny but the Utes are a friendly tribe peaceable anyway and they are no longer our near neighbors They have moved their camp deeper into the mountains And as for hold ups since we are neither on a stage or a train we cannot provide that but if you boys are not too weary I am going to suggest that you ride with me to the old stage road I ve been losing some calves lately and Jean believes that they might have been driven into an abandoned corral over in the foothills at night and later were spirited away He hesitated It s a hard ride though Perhaps you boys would rather not undertake it until tomorrow But they were glad to go and Gerald would not agree to being left behind He was given a small horse that was gentle and used to boys as the grandson had claimed it as his own and so they rode away having left word for the girls that they would return as soon as possible In the mid morning they reached the old abandoned stage road No one uses it now that is for legitimate purposes as it is very dangerous There are washouts and cutways that make it almost impassable for stage or for auto travel Then pointing to the place where the road circled a high hill mister Packard concluded Jean can you see where yesterday s cloudburst washed out the road It has started a new canon that will have to be bridged for now and then a tenderfoot autoist does get started on that old road thinking that it leads to Redfords Time and again we have put up signs on the main highway but they are hurled down in the storms I suppose Dan had been intently tracing the old road until it was lost from sight Suddenly he urged his horse forward to mister Packard s side May I take the field glasses I feel sure that I see a dark object moving along that old road and coming this way You look first though Your eyes are better trained to these distances than mine mister Packard gazed long then he turned to Jean Boy he said it looks like an auto moving slowly this way If it ever starts on that down grade toward the washout there is going to be a tragedy Jean was eagerly alert What shall we do mister Packard How can it be averted The automobile had disappeared as the road circled behind a hill but the watchers well knew that if it did not meet with disaster it would soon reappear above the washout and then be unable to stop because of the steep descent Follow me mister Packard gave the brief order and urging his horse to its utmost speed he led the way at what seemed to Gerald a breakneck pace The small boy clung to his wiry little pony which kept close behind the racing mustangs It was evident to the boys that mister Packard was hoping to round the foot of the hill in time to shout a warning to the autoists before they began the descent which would prove fatal It seemed a very long distance to Dan and he could not see how they possibly could make it He kept his eyes constantly on the crest of the hill road dreading the moment when the car would appear there to plunge down to certain destruction mister Packard rounded the foot of the hill first whirled in his saddle beckoned the boys to make haste then disappeared leaving his horse standing riderless What can that mean Dan asked but Jean merely shook his head In another moment they would know When they also had rounded the hill they saw that ill fortune as autoists usually consider a blow out had befriended the travelers The car had been stopped just as it had begun the ascent of the hill on the other side of which sure death had awaited them mister Packard was seen breaking a trail through the underbrush From time to time he hallooed and the boys saw that at last he had been heard It will be needless for us to make the climb Jean said since mister Packard will warn them and so the three boys awaited the man s return Who were they Jean inquired mister Packard removing his Stetson to wipe his brow shook his head I do not know Some family from the East trying to cross the Rockies They could have done it easily enough if they had not taken the wrong road The woman in the party is so utterly exhausted that I invited them to come to our place to rest I showed them the road from the foot of the hill back of them It certainly isn t in good condition but being on the level it at least will not be dangerous The woman fainted when she heard how near death lurked ahead of them but they ll be all right now We ll inspect that old foothill corral some other day Jean These strangers have need of our friendly services mister Packard turned his horse s head toward the ranch as he spoke and they all galloped back at a moderate speed That was sort of an adventure wasn t it Gerald inquired hopefully mister Packard laughed heartily I certainly think it could be so classified he agreed I shudder to think what it would have been however if that tire had not halted them We could not have reached them in time Although it was not quite noon the girls were up and dressed when the equestrians returned and were greatly interested in all that had happened Gerald waxed eloquent as he told Julie the details and that little girl who hungered for adventure quite as much as her brother hoped that if anything exciting happened again she might be in the thick of it mister Packard retired to the kitchen to advise Sing Long the cook that four other guests were to arrive for lunch Although that Chinaman s reply was merely Ally lite the American interpretation of his pleased smile would be the more the merrier Guests were his joy that he might display the art at which he excelled An hour later a big luxurious closed car limped into the ranch door yard mister Packard went out to greet the strangers in the same hospitable manner that he had greeted his friends The girls on the wide porch saw a fine looking man with a Van Dyke beard assisting a simply though richly gowned woman from the car then the front door was flung open There was a joyful cry from a girl who leaped out and fairly raced up the front steps with arms out held O Jane Jane How wonderful to find you here We were looking for your cabin and that s how we came to lose our way Marion Starr of all things I thought that you were in Newport CHAPTER XXVIII OLD FRIENDS Jean Dan and Gerald had gone at once to the corral with the four horses they had ridden and were still there for Jean had much to show his guests when the car arrived and so the excitement was quite over when they at last sauntered around one corner of the porch There were four in the party of autoists mister and missus Robert Starr Marion and Bob her young brother Jane at once took Merry to her room while Julie accepted Meg s invitation to wander about the gardens and make the acquaintance of the flowers mister Packard had just returned from showing mister and missus Starr to the guest room when the boys appeared Bob Starr had lingered to look over the car which was the pride of his heart and so it was that he first met Jean Dan and Gerald Jean proved himself an expert mechanic as was also mister Packard and they promised the lad that directly after lunch they would assist him in putting his car in the best of shape Meanwhile Jane and Merry were telling each other all that had happened since last they had met I simply can t understand it in the least Jane declared for the tenth time To think that you deliberately gave up the opportunity to spend a whole summer in Newport to undergo the hardships of a cross country motor trip Merry dropped down in a deep easy chair and laughed happily Oh I ve loved it Every hour of the trip has been fascinating Of course I m mighty glad mister Packard saved our lives but even that was exciting But wasn t your Aunt Belle terribly disappointed Why no not at all There are steens of us in the Starr family She just invited some other girl cousins Aunt Belle is never so happy as when she is surrounded with gay young girls Then moreover Esther Ballard couldn t go Her artist father had planned a tramping trip through Switzerland as a surprise for her and Barbara Morris decided to accompany them so you and I would have been quite alone at Newport But do tell me who is the girl to whom you introduced me when I first arrived She is beautiful isn t she Jane surely had changed in the past week for her reply was sincere and even enthusiastic Merry that girl is more than beautiful She is wonderful I want you to know her better She has saved me from myself Then she laughingly arose holding out both hands to assist her friend to her feet If you are rested dear come out on the porch I want you to meet the nicest well almost the nicest boy I have ever known Merry glanced up roguishly Are congratulations in order Jane flushed prettily though she protested You know they are not Marion Starr Romance is as far from my thoughts today as it ever was but next to Dan I do like Jean best Well I certainly am curious to meet this paragon of a youth Merry gave her friend s waist a little affectionate hug then said I have a pretty nice brother of my own He ought to be ready by now to be presented to my best friend Together they went toward the front door I know Bob must be nice Jane agreed since he is your twin The girls appeared on the porch just as the boys had completed an inspection of the machine and so Jane s paragon with a smudge of grease on one cheek and smeared hands laughingly begged Merry to pardon his inability to remove his hat Before Marion could reply her brother led her aside and talked rapidly and in a low voice then returning he said in his pleasing manner Miss Abbott you will pardon any seeming lack of courtesy on my part when I tell you there was something very important which I wished to say to my sister and there is no time like the present you know Merry laughingly interrupted And now that you have made that long speech to Jane it would be sort of an anti climax would it not for me to formally introduce you However Jane this is my wayward young brother Bob whom I am endeavoring to bring up the way that he should go Jane held out a slim white hand but although she said just the right thing her thoughts were busy Something had happened that she did not understand missus Starr rested that afternoon in one of the comfortable reclining chairs on the wide front porch mister Starr was most interested in all that mister Packard had to show him while the young people went for a horseback ride in merry cavalcade Bob Starr was eager to see the washout and decide for himself what chance of escape they might have had Julie was overjoyed that this time she also might accompany the riders A small spotted pony was chosen for her as it was a most reliable little creature sure footed and gentle For a while Jane and Merry rode side by side then Bob and Jean Sawyer who for some time had ridden far back of the others galloped up and rode alongside of the two girls Bob next to Jane and Jean close to Merry There was a pang in the dark girl s heart She had noticed several times at lunch that Jean had glanced across at Marion Starr and had smiled at her when their eyes met But the trail soon became too rough to permit four to ride abreast and so Jean called Miss Starr suppose you and I ride ahead and set the pace Marion smiled at her friend That will give you and Bob a chance to become better acquainted she said then urged her horse to a gallop and away they went Jean and Merry laughing happily and yet when they had quite outdistanced the rest Jane noted that they rode more slowly and close together as though in serious converse They surely are becoming acquainted very rapidly the girl thought miserably She had not realized until now how very much Jean Sawyer s admiration had meant to her Suddenly she felt so alone and looked back to find the brother who had always cared so much for her but he also was completely engrossed in another girl for Meg had dismounted to examine some growth by the trail and Dan standing at her side was listening as he gazed into her dusky eyes with great evident interest Jane sighed I deserve it all she thought I have not been lovable and so why should I expect to be loved Jean Sawyer seems to be a mighty fine chap her companion was saying Is he overseer of this cattle ranch Yes I understand that is the position he fills Jane said feeling suddenly very weary and wishing that she could ride back to the ranch house A fortnight before she would have done so but now a thought for the happiness of others came to prevent such a selfish decision for of course if Jane turned back some of the others would also for the lads were too chivalrous to permit her to ride alone Bob glancing at her decided that she was not interested in his companionship but for Merry s sake he made one more effort at friendly conversation I do not suppose though that so fine a chap and one so capable will remain forever in the position of an employee he ventured Do you know where he hails from No I do not Jane replied Then wishing to change the subject she pointed toward a hill over which one lone vulture was swinging in wide circles There is the washout Merry and Jean were galloping back toward them The girl rode up to Jane as she said with a shudder Oh I don t want to go any closer When I saw that wicked looking vulture and heard why he is circling there I could picture all too plainly what would have happened if we had been killed and It was seldom that Merry was so overcome Jane do you mind riding back with me she pleaded I want to go to my mother And so the two girls turned back toward the ranch house They assured the others that they did not mind going alone Jane noticed that Merry said nothing of the conversation that she had had with Jean Sawyer in fact she did not mention his name and neither did Jane When they reached the ranch house Merry ran up the steps and kneeling she held her mother close That sweet faced woman smoothed the sunny hair of the girl she so loved marveling at the unusual emotion but when her daughter told her how much more vividly she could picture their escape after she had seen the washout and the vulture the older woman understood Jane watching her friend felt that something more than a view of the road where there might have been a tragedy was affecting her dearest friend nor was she wrong mister Packard prevailed upon missus and mister Starr to remain as his guests for at least another day that the mother of Merry and Bob might become thoroughly rested before the return journey to the East which was to be made by train the automobile to be shipped back O missus Starr how I do wish you would permit Merry and Bob to visit us in our cabin on Redfords Peak Jane said when this decision had been reached Couldn t they stay until we return East next month missus Starr looked inquiringly at her husband but it was Merry who replied Not quite that long dear she said slipping an arm about her friend I very much want to be in New York on September the first Just why she glanced quickly up at Jean Sawyer a pretty flush tinting her cheeks Jane could not understand There was an actual pain in her heart and she caught her breath quickly before she could reply in a voice that sounded natural Well then at least you and Bob can remain with us for two weeks and that will be better than not at all The selfish side of Jane s nature was saying to her Why urge Merry to remain when if she were to go you could have Jean Sawyer s companionship all to yourself But Jane had indeed changed for she put the thought away from her as unworthy and gave her friend a little affectionate hug when missus Starr said that the plan was quite agreeable to her Good That s great Dan declared warmly Then he excused himself for he saw Meg Heger returning with Julie from a botany expedition in the foothills The mountain girl smiled up at him in her frank way when he ran down the garden path toward them Have you news to tell us she inquired You re looking wonderfully well these days Daniel Abbott I do not believe that your lungs were affected after all Indeed they were not The boy whirled to walk at Meg s side and as she smiled up at him in her good comradeship way he was almost impelled to add But my heart is Instead he laughed boyishly and took the basket of specimens that the girl carried Peeping under the cover he exclaimed Why if you haven t taken them up root and all Meg nodded joyfully Wasn t it nice of mister Packard to tell me that I might transplant them to my own botany gardens Aren t they the most exquisite star like flowers and the most delicate pinks and blues Then when the cover had been replaced Meg lifted long lashed dusky eyes that were more serious Dan do you suppose Jane would mind if I went home this afternoon Think of it in another fortnight I will be going to Scarsburg to take the entrance examinations for the normal and kind old Teacher Bellows is giving me some special review work which I cannot afford to miss If you return I will also the lad said then when he saw that his companion was about to protest he hurriedly added Not because you need my protection but because I wish to be with you Meg gave no outward sign of having understood the deep underlying meaning of the words that she had heard but the warmth in her heart assured her that she was glad glad that Dan wanted to accompany her Gerald came bounding toward them dressed still in his fringed cowboy suit Say kids he shouted inelegantly then looked rather sheepishly at Julie as though he expected one of her grandmotherly rebukes but hearing none he blurted on We re going to have a corn and potato roast for supper tonight Won t that be high jinks though mister Packard has a barbecue pit on the other side of the little lake Oh boy he continued rubbing the spot where the feast would eventually be You bet you I ll be there with bells Then catching Julie by the hand he raced with her to the corral where they liked to look over the log fence at the horses and colts in the enclosure Dan smiled down at his companion Let us wait until morning and start at sunrise shall we he suggested If we go this afternoon our host might think that we do not appreciate his plans for our entertainment Meg agreed willingly little dreaming that so slight an incident was to make a vital change in her hitherto uneventful life CHAPTER XXIX THE BARBEQUE Julie and Gerald were hilariously excited as the hour of the roast approached mister Packard had selected them as his aides had made them a committee on arrangement They took wood to the pit and then went with the ever beaming Chinese gardener to the field where the corn grew and they carried back between them a heavily laden basket Then the long table near the lake that was sheltered by cottonwood trees was set with the plate and dishes found on every cattle ranch in reserve for round ups and similar occasions when many are to be fed In the center Julie placed a huge bouquet of scarlet salvia and golden glow to make the table extra pretty and she put Meg s name nearest the flowers but with the innocence of childhood she put Dan s name at the place directly opposite When the guests were finally summoned Julie s big brother protested that he didn t want to sit directly behind that huge bouquet because he couldn t see anything Julie looked perplexed Why yes you can so You can see the foothills and just lots of things Then Gerald blurted out Silly he can t see Meg Heger can he when you ve put her right across from the bouquet How they all laughed even Meg and missus Starr glancing at the mountain girl marveled at her beauty and thought it quite natural that any lad would rather look at her than at a scarlet and gold bouquet mister Packard settled the matter by removing the huge centerpiece to a side table There that s heaps better Jean said as he smiled across at Marion Now I also have a better view of the foothills he added mischievously It was hard cruelly hard for Jane even though Bob Starr who was seated next to her tried his utmost to be entertaining Bob was indeed puzzled He was not at all conceited but up to the present he had found even very attractive girls seeking rather than spurning his companionship Icebergs aren t in my line he decided and turned toward little Julie who was on his other side and whose fresh enthusiasm was interesting even to a lad several years her senior Merry noticed that her best friend did not eat with the same zest that was very apparent in the appetites of all the others and after a time she suggested to Bob that he change seats with her The table had just been cleared and Gerald had darted away with the Chinaman to bring on the generous slices of watermelon and so the change was made very easily Merry slipped a hand under the table and held Jane s in a close loving clasp Dear she said very softly you aren t feeling well are you Shall we go back to the ranch house I do not mind missing the watermelon No thank you Marion Jane s voice try as she might to make it sound natural had in it a note of reserve that was almost cold For the first time in the years that they had been so intimate Jane had used the formal Marion The friends who loved her always called her Merry Something was wrong radically wrong Merry ate her slice of melon wondering what it could possibly be and finally decided that if Jane s manner remained unchanged throughout the evening she would accompany her mother to the East on the following day There is going to be a wonderful moon tonight mister Packard said Why don t you young people climb the foothill trail and watch it rise That s a good suggestion Jean Sawyer at once offered to lead the expedition Then as everyone had arisen he went to the two girls who were seated together and said with a smile which included them both Shall we three go ahead But Jane replied You and Merry may go I have one of my sick headaches I shall go to bed at once Jean Sawyer looked at the girl almost sadly Then he said quietly I am sorry Jane May I walk back to the house with you I thank you no The girl s haughty manner was in evidence Then going to mister Packard she asked to be excused and walked quickly around the little lake Merry watched her thoughtfully then turning to her companion she said Jean I think I understand May I tell her our secret now tonight The boy assented eagerly I shall be glad to have Jane know he said Then Merry also excused herself and followed her friend CHAPTER XXX JEAN SAWYER S SECRET Jane going to the deserted ranch house threw herself down on her bed and sobbed heart brokenly She did not hear the tap on the door nor was she conscious that Merry had entered until she heard her voice Jane dear have I done anything to hurt you to make you unhappy The tenderness in the tone of her best friend was unmistakable All at once Jane felt ashamed of herself Holding out a fevered hand she said Indeed not dear girl It isn t your fault at all Any boy would like you better than me You are so sweet and unselfish and lovable Merry s eyes widened for she was indeed perplexed Jane I don t understand she said What boy likes me better than he does you Then slowly a light dawned Taking both hot hands in her own she cried her blue eyes glowing Oh Jane dearest Jane did you think that Jean Sawyer cared for me Did you think for one moment that I knowing how much you liked him would even want him to care for me Indeed not Janey But now that I think about it I realize that you might misunderstand Dear it s a long story Let s go out on the veranda in the moonlight There is no one around They all went up the foothill trail and will be gone for an hour Jane permitted herself to be led to a vine sheltered corner of the veranda where they sat close together in a hammock swing Merry piled the soft cushions behind her friend whose flushed face assured her that the head was really aching Jane sighed as she sank back among them but it was a sigh of relief How wrong it had been to doubt for one moment the loyalty of this her very best friend But Merry was beginning the story Dear she said placing a cool hand on the hot one near her when you first introduced me to Jean Sawyer did you notice that my brother Bob drew me away to whisper something to me before I could acknowledge the introduction Jane nodded both curious and interested Why did Bob do that I wondered at the time Merry continued I was just about to exclaim Why Jean Sawyer Willoughby so this is where you disappeared to when you left home last February but I did not for Bob gave me no time What he whispered was Don t let on you know Jean He wants his identity kept in the dark He is using his mother s maiden name Get the cue Of course I got it but as soon as I could I asked Jean to go for a canter with me that I might tell him how heart broken his family was because he had disappeared as he did Jane was no longer reclining among the cushions She sat up listening intently You and Bob know Jean s family Yes indeed both his father and older brother Ken We met them every summer on the coast of Maine where our parents had cottages next to each other Jean told me of that cottage where he went that summer alone with his mother Jane said I mean the summer she died Poor boy He never was happy in his home life after that Merry replied Ken his brother is a commissioned officer on one of the war boats He had little shore leave and that left Jean and his father quite alone in their big house in New York They never had been congenial in their interests but the final break came when the father entered into some oil deal which Jean considered dishonorable He told his father exactly how he felt about it He said that he refused to inherit money that was taken from the poor who had invested their savings in the wildcat scheme believing the firm to be honest Of course his father was angry and Jean refusing to take one penny of what he called tainted money left home to make his own way in the world The father did not seem to care at first for he had always loved Ken more than he did Jean but when Ken came home on a leave he took Jean s part and also denounced his father s dishonorable business methods Jane was sitting very erect and her breath came hard At last she interrupted Merry she said in a voice she could hardly recognize as her own Jean s father mister Willoughby was my father s partner Then she burst into unexpected tears Jean was nobler than I Oh Merry I never can be his friend again I am not worthy of him I want you to be his best friend You are so good I am sure that in his heart of hearts he must love you Merry leaned over and kissed her friend tenderly I hope Jean does love me she said simply He is to be my brother for I am engaged to Ken Willoughby His three years in the navy are nearly over Ken is coming home for good on September first Jane s heart was filled with conflicting emotions She was indeed happy when she heard the wonderful secret which Merry assured her she would have told her at once but Ken had wanted her to wait until he had given her the ring which he had bought for her in Paris But I just had to tell you dear girl when I realized that my friendship with Jean might lead you to believe that we cared for each other Then slipping an arm affectionately about her companion Merry continued And now there is just one thing for which I am going to wish until it comes true and that is that you and Jean may care for each other in the way Ken and I care Then Jane I will be your sister Think what that would mean for we would share all of the joy that the future holds But Jane tears brimming her eyes said sadly That can never be If Jean knew the truth if he knew that I wanted father to cheat those poor people who had trusted him he would scorn me even as I now scorn myself I never knew father s partners except by name We lived so very far apart and Dad always wanted to just rest when he reached our village home and so even when I was with him which was seldom we had no social life Then turning with a startled expression Jane inquired Oh do you suppose that Jean knows Do you suppose he recognized our name as being the same as his father s partner Merry replied thoughtfully There are a good many Abbotts in the world dear and just at first Jean did not suspect that your father was the one who had withdrawn from the firm and who by so doing had incurred the hatred and wrath of mister Willoughby but when I happened to mention why your father had lost everything as Dan had told him Jean s face brightened I am glad he said that the father of Jane had the courage to do the honorable thing I noticed at the time that he said the father of Jane and not of Dan That means dear that you are often in his thoughts But Jane had again burst into tears and rising she hurried to her own room and begged Merry who had followed her with tender solicitude to leave her alone I never never can be Jean s friend again but don t tell him how dishonorable I have been Merry Promise me that you will not tell him Of course I will not tell but oh Jane you are over imaginative tonight I am sure that you never wished your father to rob the poor that you might have luxury But there please don t answer me dear You are all worn out and your poor head is throbbing cruelly Let me help you undress Tomorrow morning when you awake you will see everything in a different light But Merry was wrong Because of Jane the young people did not start at sunrise as they had planned but delayed until after mister and missus Starr had been driven away to the Redfords station mister Packard accompanied them Bob was pleased indeed that he and his sister were to remain in the Rockies for another fortnight and Merry was glad to be with Jane who more than ever seemed to need her friendship When the young people were gathered at the corral preparing to start Jean glanced across at Jane and noting how pale and weary she looked he strode over to her saying Aren t you afraid the ride will be too hard for you Suppose we let the others start now if Meg feels that she must get home You and I could follow them more leisurely starting later when you are rested There was a sad expression in the dark eyes that were lifted to his but the girl s reply was Thank you Jean I would rather go now with the others Merry felt Jane s clasp tighten about her hand and well knew that she was suffering cruelly and that it was a mental not a physical torture Jean assisted both of the girls to mount and then the string of horses started toward the mountain trail for Bob was eager to visit the old deserted Crazy Creek mine Jean Sawyer glanced often at the pale beautiful face of the girl who seemed purposely to avoid him CHAPTER XXXI AN UNCANNY EXPERIENCE At the foot of the trail that led up the mountain Dan who had been in the lead with Meg called Jean we re waiting for you to go ahead since you have so often ridden this trail The boy who had been silently riding at Jane s side whenever it had been possible turned to ask Will you ride on ahead with me The girl tried to smile at him but her lips quivered No thank you Jean I think I will stay with Merry A boyish voice called Ask me and hear what I ll say It was Bob and before Jean could express a desire for his companionship the black horse which the younger lad rode was scrambling up the rocky trail following the leader Julie and Gerald on their agile ponies were next Meg and Dan followed while Jane and Merry rode more slowly each putting her entire trust in the horse on which she was mounted We do not need to try to guide them Merry had said Jean told me that the horses climb best without direction Just pull up on the rein if it should happen to stumble Bob s enthusiasm over all he saw was given such constant expression that Jane s silence was not so noticeable Dan now and then glanced back anxiously He also had noted Jean s apparent devotion to Merry on the two days previous and he wondered if it had saddened Jane and yet she had never said that she really cared for Jean When they reached a wide rock plateau their guide whirled in his saddle to ask if any of the riders were tired and wished to rest for a while but they all preferred to keep on A few moments later they were passing through the deserted mining camp There was not a breath of wind stirring and the only sounds they heard were the humming of insects and now and then a bird song The cabins many of them falling into ruins looked as though they might be haunted with ghosts of the men who had given their lives trying to find gold Say boy Bob drew rein to look about him This places gives one the shivers all right At any minute I expect to hear a ghost groan or Hark What was that Merry interrupted I did hear a groan I am positive that I did They all listened and there was no mistaking the fact that a groaning noise was coming from a cabin that stood near a deep pit beside which was a pile of red and yellow ore What do you suppose it is since we know there is no such thing as a ghost Dan turned toward Meg to inquire Surely the mountain girl would know But it was Jean who replied Don t you believe that some wounded animal may have dragged itself into the cabin to die They always do try to hide away when they are hurt don t they Meg The girl nodded her sweet face serious as she said I will ride over and see what it is A moan like that always means that some creature needs help You must not go alone Dan told her I will ride over there with you Meg turned to the others Please wait here she said If it is a hurt animal so many of us would frighten it In silence the group waited watching the two who rode toward the yawning pit When they were near the place Meg dismounted and Dan did likewise Together they approached the door of the isolated cabin Dan swung his gun from his shoulder and held it in readiness if harm were to threaten them Meg glanced at the door then turning motioned the lad to put up his gun Wondering what the girl had seen the boy hastened to her side Meg entered the old cabin and Dan standing at the door saw on the rotting floor the twisted form of the old Ute Indian His wrinkled leathery face showed how cruelly he was suffering but when he saw Meg who at once knelt at his side his expression changed to one of eagerness almost of gladness He tried to reach out his shriveled arm but groaned instead Dan stepped inside and looked down pityingly Meg glancing up with tears in her wonderful eyes said Poor old Ute He has had another stroke and this one is his last They both knew that the old Indian was making a great effort to speak and the lad bent to whisper Perhaps he is trying to tell you something Oh if he only would If he only could Meg was rubbing the poor limp hand that was crusted with dirt in her own Then close to his ear she asked clearly Could you tell me about my father Again there was a lightening of the eyes that were beginning to dim Fadder he die hid box Dig dig no find box You find box then you know The old Ute could say no more for another contortion had seized him and it was the last Meg was trembling so that Dan had to assist her to rise The others having been eager to know what had happened had approached the cabin and dismounted Jane saw that for the first time in their acquaintance the mountain girl was nearly overcome with emotion and going to her she slipped an arm about her saying sincerely Meg dear what is it Can we help you But almost at once Meg regained at least outward composure It is the old Ute Indian who has died she told them How thankful I am that we came this way for he has told me about my father Perhaps I shall know more but that much is enough Turning back she looked thoughtfully at the cabin then said Dan will you help me bar the door that no wild creature can get in The windows were long ago boarded up The old Ute shall have it for his tomb When this was done a solemn group of young people rode away Meg said little and Dan riding at her side understood her thoughtfulness When the Abbott cabin was reached Meg said goodbye to the friends who were to remain there but Dan insisted upon accompanying her to her home When they were quite alone the lad rode close to her and placed a hand on hers as he said Meg dear how much how very much this means to you Such a wonderful light there was in the dusky eyes that were lifted to his O Dan now I can feel that I have a right to accept your friendship yours and Jane s But with sincere feeling the lad replied It is for your sake only that I am glad Your parentage mattered not at all to me nor of late has it to Jane Then although Dan had not planned on speaking so soon he heard himself saying Meg you are all to me that my most idealistic dreams could picture for the girl I would wish to marry Do you think that some day you might care for me if I regain my health and am able to make a home for you There was infinite tenderness in the dark eyes but the girl shook her head Your companionship means very much to me Dan but I must teach I want to care for the two old people who took me in out of the storm and who have given me all that I have had You shall dearest girl That is we shall if you will let me help you Then before Meg could refuse Dan implored Don t answer me yet I can wait if you will try to love me They had reached the cabin and saw Ma Heger wiping sudsy hands on her apron hurrying out to greet them Dan detained the girl Promise me that you will try to care he pleaded I won t have to try she said then turned to greet the angular woman who had been the only mother she had ever known CHAPTER XXXII HUNTING FOR THE BOX Jean Sawyer troubled indeed because Jane Abbott continued to avoid him changed his plan and decided not to remain at the cabin until late afternoon and so bidding them goodbye he went down the road toward Redfords leading the string of horses The other young people climbed the stone stairway Oh Jane what a perfectly adorable place Merry exclaimed when the door had been unlocked and the young people had entered the long rustic living room I like it so much better than those elaborately furnished cottages at Newport They are too much like our own homes but this cabin savors of camping out It s a wonderful spot for a real vacation It surely is different Jane agreed as she led her friend into the comfortable front bedroom which they were to share Then she confessed I do like it much more than I had supposed that I would when I first came Honestly Merry I feel differently inside When I believed that those poor little children had been driven out of their home by my temper and might never be found something inside of me snapped something that had been holding me tense I can t explain it and I felt as though I had been set free from well free from myself Self that is it she continued bitterly planning for oneself living for oneself living for one s selfish pleasure and comfort slowly but surely deadens sympathy and love and understanding Then taking from the table near the wide window a delicate miniature Jane handed it to her companion That is my mother s portrait How beautiful she must have been Merry glanced from the sweet pictured face to that of the girl at her side You are so alike It is only the expression that is different I am sure that anyone in sorrow would have gone to your mother for comfort Jane nodded I am not like that yet but Dan thinks that if we choose a model and keep it ever in thought we will grow to be like that person or ideal and I have chosen my mother Silently Merry kissed her friend and then replaced the miniature on the table Jane had indeed changed that she could talk even with her best friend of these things of the soul A moment later there came a jolly rapping on their closed door and Bob called Come and see where I am going to hang out or hang up rather Merry and Jane went out on the front porch with the lad who was brimming with enthusiasm Oh aren t you afraid a bear will devour you in the night his sister inquired when she saw a hammock hung between two pines Hope one will Bob replied jubilantly What a yarn that would be to tell when I get back to college Practical Julie was wide eyed Why Bob Starr she exclaimed how could you tell about it after you were all eaten up Which reminds me Bob said irrelevantly of a story about the South Sea Islanders A missionary was teaching them that they must take great care of their bodies as they were to rise on the last day and one native asked what would become of his poor brother who had been eaten by a tiger Bob dear Merry rebuked you ought not to joke about such things It does not matter what we believe ourselves or how outlandish we consider the beliefs of others we ought to treat them with respect Yes m Bob pretended to be quite contrite I m willing to change the subject if the next subject is something to eat I ll get the lunch Julie leaning on the staff Dan had cut for her limped toward the kitchen but her sister caught her and put her on the porch cot and piled pillows under her head Indeed not little lady Jane kissed her affectionately It s your turn now to pretend you are a princess and I will be your maid of waiting Impulsively Julie threw her arms about her sister s neck and clung to her as she whispered Oh Janey I love you so And Jane when she arose felt in her heart a greater happiness than had ever been there when she had received the adulation of the admiring girls at Highacres And I will be your aide Merry who had gone to the top of the stone stairway to look down at the road skipped back to say and then arm in arm these two friends went and from their merry laughter it was quite evident that Jane s efforts as head cook were being mirthfully regarded by both of them However when the others were called to the back porch where the table was set they found as appetizing a lunch as could be desired But underneath all her apparent pleasure Jane was sorrowing She never again could be Jean Sawyer s friend He would not want her friendship if he knew how she had felt about her father s sacrifice but he must never never know Jane glanced often at Dan during the lunch Never had she seen him look so wonderfully happy He had expressed his regret that Jean had departed before his return and exclaimed But the horse I rode also belongs to mister Packard I wonder why he did not wait for it mister Packard told him to leave one horse with us his sister explained and more if we wished but I thought one would be all you would want to care for Dan was pleased He said We have made good friends since we came here It is hard to realize that it is not yet a fortnight ago Julie chimed in with Yep haven t we Then beginning with one small thumb to count First there s Meg Heger Next to Janey she s the nicest girl I guess there is Merry pretended to be quite offended Little one you surely are honest You ought always to say present company excepted Oh I do like you Merry awful much You can be third Will that be all right The golden haired girl laughed gaily Of course I was only teasing dear Now who comes next Jean Sawyer and mister Packard and then the little spotted pony and then my mountain lion baby The small girl put down her hand as she concluded I guess that s all the new friends I ve made here in the mountains Bob suddenly thought of something Say Dan there is a sort of mystery about that trapper s daughter isn t there I understand that at first the old Ute Indian pretended he was her father in order to get the girl to give him money and that this morning when he was dying he confessed that he was not Dan nodded Then turning to Jane he said I am sure that Meg would not wish it kept a secret from any of us and so I will tell you what the old Indian said His speech was almost incoherent but we understood him to say that Meg s father had died long ago He must have told the squaw in Slinking Coyote s hearing that he had hidden a box which he wished given to his little girl when she was older but he must have died before he could tell where he had placed the box How I wish it could be found Jane said earnestly for without doubt it would contain identification papers Although it is a great joy to Meg to know that she is not that old Ute s daughter she will have to seek out the squaw who took her to the Heger cabin before she can know who her father really was And even then I doubt if she would discover much Dan remarked My theory is that Meg s father was a miner who had brought the three year old little girl to Crazy Creek Camp and had remained there for a time even after the exodus In fact he must have stayed until the Indian tribe took possession of the otherwise deserted camp Perhaps just after they came he was seized with a fatal illness and left his little one with the kindly old squaw probably telling her to give the child to a white family since that is what she did I believe you are right Jane agreed It all sounds very reasonable to me But why do you suppose Meg s father remained at the camp after everyone else had left Do you think he had some clue to the whereabouts of the lost vein That we cannot tell Dan said He may have remained to hunt for it Then rising he smiled around at the group What shall we do this afternoon or do you want to just rest Nary for me was energetic Bob s reply I want to hunt for Meg Heger s hidden box Who will go with me and where shall we begin the search Bob s enthusiasm was contagious I believe that I now understand the real reason why the Ute Indian hung around the Crazy Creek Camp Dan told them He knew that the miner had hidden a box an iron one of course it must be and he has been searching for it probably believing it to contain whatever money Meg s father had Of course Bob agreed That s as clear as daylight We have clues enough but the thing is to try to reason out where would be a likely place for the miner to have hidden it Gerald not wishing to be left out of so interesting a discussion wisely contributed Maybe under the floor boards in the cabin where he lived or some place like that Dan smiled down into the chubby freckled face of his small brother as he replied One naturally might suppose so but I do believe Gerry that the old Ute suspected the same thing and has been ransacking those cabins all these years I would be more inclined to look in some of the dug outs or tunnels where if he were a miner Meg s father may have been searching for the lost vein While the boys talked Jane and Merry had been washing and wiping the lunch dishes When they joined the excited group on the front porch Bob stood up saying Shall we start now Jane also arose but happening to glance down at Julie she saw tears brimming the small girl s eyes and that her lips were quivering Instantly the older girl sat on the cot beside her and putting her arms about her little sister she said compassionately Is your ankle hurting again dearie Since you cannot go I will stay here with you and read to you Don t feel badly Julie Your foot will soon be well long before they find the box I am sure of that The small girl leaned happily against her sister and looked up at her with adoration in her dark violet eyes Then Merry announced This is a boys adventure anyway We girls will sit on the porch and have the best kind of a time all together And so the boys departed armed with stout staffs and guns and calling that they would surely be back by supper time But when at last they did return they had discovered nothing and Bob was eager to start at dawn the next day and search everywhere around the Crazy Creek Camp Merry shuddered Goodness don t she ejaculated It was ghostly enough before but now that we know that old Ute is entombed in one of those cabins you couldn t get me within a mile of the place Bob retorted Well we hadn t invited you girls had we So you need not refuse with such gusto We re going to take the horse so that Dan can ride most of the way But that lad interrupted You mean that we will take turns riding Although I have been in the Rockies so short a time my cold is entirely cured and as my lungs had not really been affected I am soon to be as husky as you Bob Of course you are old man Bob put a hand on his friend s shoulder but soon isn t now I won t go unless you will ride when I think it is the best for you to do so All righto Anything to be agreeable Dan sank down on the porch step as though he were rather tired after the climb they had just completed Bob then turned to the girls You maidens fair need not awaken We ll be as quiet as as Dan smilingly offered How would Santa Claus do He steals around very softly or so tradition has it Bob laughed I was going to say as a thief in the night but I don t like to use a simile which suggests an unpleasant picture and it s the wrong time of the year for Santa Claus A mouse is awful quiet Julie put in Or a cat They have cushions on their feet Gerald added We ll be as quiet as all of them Bob said and tomorrow young ladies we are going to bring home the box When the boys returned from Crazy Creek Camp they were weary and disappointed but not discouraged or so Bob assured the girls It was quite evident that they were much excited however but what had caused it they would not reveal When Merry asked if their search had taken them close to the tomb of the old Ute Indian Bob had looked over at Dan and had asked Shall we tell The older boy nodded Why yes we might as well Sooner or later they are likely to find it out The young people were seated about the hearth in the living room of the cabin resting and visiting before they retired for the night Gerald s eyes glowed with excitement Julie won t sleep a wink if she knows about it She ll be skeered as anything Julie will The small girl nestled closer to Jane and looked up at her inquiringly What does Gerry mean Janey she asked Are they trying to tease us But Dan replied seriously No it is the truth that something has occurred since we were last at the Crazy Creek Camp and the discovery of it did startle us Although we planned to give the tomb cabin a wide berth we at once went to a position where we could look at it You girls can imagine our surprise and I ll confess it horror when we saw the front door standing wide open Oh oo how dreadful Jane shuddered What did it mean Had someone opened the door out of curiosity do you suppose and what a shock it must have been when they found that dead Indian on the floor Dan and Bob exchanged curious glances Then the latter spoke up It is just possible that the old Ute was not really dead and that he revived and left the cabin But how could he Merry looked thoughtfully into the fire As I remember the door was barred on the outside True her brother replied but we also found a loose board on the floor which had been lifted leaving a hole large enough for the Ute to have crawled through After that he may have opened the door to procure his pick ax and shovel as both were gone Julie glanced fearfully at the dark windows of the room and Gerald said almost gloatingly There I told you so Julie is skeered She thinks the old Ute may be prowling around our cabin this very minute mister Heger ought to be told about this Dan had started to say when Gerry grabbed his arm What s that noise he whispered Someone is outside I hear em coming Dan and Bob were on their feet at once There was indeed the sound of footsteps outside the cabin then there came a rap on the door Julie implored O Dan don t don t open it Get your gun first The older boy hesitated for a moment but in that brief time his own fears were set at rest for a familiar voice called Daniel Abbott may I speak with ye The boy s tenseness relaxed and he threw open the door with a welcoming smile mister Heger we re mighty glad to see you Come in won t you The mountaineer glanced at the group about the fire but shook his head No I thank ye I jest came down to ask if a big brown mare I found whinnyin around my corral is the one mister Packard loaned ye I would have asked Meg hed she been to home but she went sudden like to Scarsburg along of some school work and she ll put up at the inn there for several days Dan thanked the mountaineer for the trouble he had taken adding There really is no place here to keep the horse I suppose that is why it wandered up to you As soon as Jean Sawyer comes again I will send it back The mountaineer assured the boy No need to do that Danny if you d like to keep it I ll jest let it into my corral along of Bag o Bones They seem to be actin friendly enough The man was about to leave when Dan said mister Heger we boys have been over to Crazy Creek Camp today and we are rather puzzled about something He then told what they had seen ending with We re afraid that old Ute came to life and that he will continue to blackmail Meg The mountaineer shook his head saying No Danny Slinkin Coyote ll never more be seen in these parts lest be it s his ghost Arter Meg tol me what had happened I went down to put the sheriff wise He reckoned twouldn t do no how to leave the body unburied and that the county d have to tend to it The girls uttered sighs of relief Jane rose when the mountaineer had departed saying Well now I guess we can all sleep without fear of a visit from Slinking Coyote CHAPTER XXXIII JANE S BIRTHDAY For the next two days the boys searched high and low far and near without finding the box On the morning of the third which was Saturday Jane announced at breakfast that as it was her birthday she wished to go down to the inn and get the mail The stage would not come up that way until the following Monday Instantly there was an uproar Julie whose foot was nearly well again hopped around the table and threw her arms about her big sister s neck without fear of being rebuked because the fresh muslin collar might be crushed The older girl slipped an arm lovingly about the child who stood with her cheek pressed against the soft dark hair Dan reached a hand across the table Jane so it is This is the wonderful day on which you are eighteen I congratulate you Gerry with a whoop had pounced upon her even as Julie had done without fear of rebuke The older girl had been so consistently loving during the past few days that childlike they had accepted the change as being natural and permanent Dan smiled happily at the group and in his eyes there was a tenderness that his sister rejoiced to see But the lad who had been her chum since little childhood also knew that Jane s heart held a sorrow which she was not sharing with him That it had something to do with Jean Sawyer he surmised but believed that it was because Jane still thought mister Packard s overseer liked Merry especially well Let s have a party Gerald shouted as he capered about the room unable it would seem to otherwise express his enthusiasm That would be sport Dan agreed Julie slipped from Jane s encircling arm Clapping her hands she sang out Goodie We re going to have a party and maybe there ll be ice cream There probably isn t any to be had nearer than Scarsburg Dan remarked Then he grew thoughtful wondering how long the girl he loved would be detained at the county seat along of school work As though voicing his thought Gerald ceased his antics to say earnestly It won t be a party unless Meg is at it And Jean Sawyer too Julie put in Let s ask Meg and Jean to our party You want them don t you Janey The other girl smiled as she arose to clear the breakfast table then turned away but not quickly enough to hide the sudden tears from Dan The boy s heart was sad He also believed that Jean Sawyer especially liked Merry and if this were true there was nothing for Jane to do but to try not to care Bob suggested that he and Dan go up to the Heger place to get the horse Then the girls can take turns walking and riding he ended Merry seemed to be very eager to go to the village far down in the valley I also am expecting some mail was all that she would tell the others I m glad it s such a shiny day Julie chirped Birthdays ought to be all gold and blue hadn t they ought to be Janey What a tangled up sentence that is dearie The older girl tried to hide her own sorrow that she need not depress the others who were all in a holiday mood But I do believe that birthdays ought to be sunny for they are a chance to start life all over Merry looked up brightly I love beginnings she said as she rolled her sleeves preparing to wash the dishes Whatever the mistakes or faults of the past have been I feel that on New Years and birthdays and even on Mondays I can clean off the slate so to speak and start all over When the two girls were alone in the kitchen Merry slipped an arm about her companion as she said Dear Jane I wish you would act more friendly toward poor Jean Willoughby I know that your seeming to avoid him the other day hurt him deeply But Jane shook her head and in her eyes there was an expression of suffering I can t Oh I can t she said miserably Some day he might find out how I had acted about father s renouncing his fortune and then he would scorn me I couldn t endure it Merry Oh indeed I couldn t I m going back East with you next week and then I shall never see Jean Sawyer An hour later the young people started down the mountain road Julie riding on the horse as the other two girls dressed in their natty hiking costumes declared that they would rather walk They had decided to have lunch at the inn for missus Bently was an excellent cook Jane covered her aching heart so well that Dan believed after all he had been mistaken in thinking that she was sorrowing for Jean Her loving devotion to her best friend plainly proved to him that she was not at all jealous of Merry Deciding that he must have been wrong he entered wholeheartedly into the joyousness of the occasion and a jolly procession it was that wended its way down the circling road toward the hamlet of Redfords At every turn Dan glanced down to see if by any chance Meg Heger might be returning to her home cabin Her foster father had not known how long she would have to stay at the Normal where Teacher Bellows had sent her for a time of intensive preparatory work but the lad hoped and believed that even if Meg would have to return to Scarsburg on the following Monday she would visit her home over the week end Nor was he wrong for at the bend just above the village Gerald who had been racing ahead turned to shout through hands held trumpet wise Say kids Meg Heger s coming Gee golly Now she can come to the party Luckily no one glanced at Dan for his sudden brightening expression would have revealed the secret he wished to share with none but Meg In another few moments the girl riding slowly up the mountain road on her spotted pony heard a chorus of shouts and glancing up saw the young people on the bend above waving caps and kerchiefs What a warmth there was in the heart of the girl who through all the years had been without a companion of her own age And when at last they met Jane was the first to hurry forward with outstretched hands We ve missed our nearest neighbor and we re so glad you came home today she said in her friendliest manner The beautiful girl looked from one to another of the group and seeing in each face a joyful expression she asked What is it Some special occasion Gerald shouted Yo bet it is It s ol Jane s birthday Instantly he remembered the time in the orchard at home when he had called his sister Ol Jane and how scathingly he had been rebuked and he looked quickly anxiously at the girl but she was laughingly saying You re right Gerald Eighteen is old I feel as ancient as the hills Then taking Meg s free hand for Julie was clinging to the other Jane said Won t you turn about and take lunch with us at the inn It s the first of the birthday celebrations But the mountain girl shook her head smiling happily into her friend s eyes as she replied Ma Heger is expecting me this noon and will have the things baked up that I like best I couldn t disappoint her nor dear old Pap either But you ll come later We ll be home by two o clock and then the real celebration is to begin Jane begged while Gerald said informingly We re going to do stunts I mean something extra different We don t know what yet but it ll be something awful jolly Meg beamed down at the eager freckled face I wouldn t miss it for worlds Of course I will be there Dan who had been standing silently at her side said I will come up to your cabin for you Then you will know when we are back and ready to begin the frolic whatever it is to be Is Jean Sawyer coming Meg glanced at Jane to inquire The mountain girl noted the sudden clouding of her new friend s eyes and although the reply was lightly given in the negative Meg knew that something was wrong She had been so sure that Jane and Jean liked each other especially well Glancing at the sun which was nearing the zenith she exclaimed I must go now my pony has had a long walk today and I do not want him to climb too rapidly Then with a direct glance out of her dusky long lashed eyes at Dan she said I ll be ready and waiting for you when you come missus Bently was indeed pleased when she heard that she was to have so many hungry guests for lunch and asked if she might have one hour for preparation The young people were disappointed when they learned that the mail had not arrived but they had not long to wait before the stage drew up in front of the inn mister Bently went out to get the leather bag which both Jane and Merry hoped might contain something of especial interest to them They all crowded around the tiny window in the corner which served as postoffice and waited eagerly while the innkeeper sorted out the papers letters and packages Wall now he beamed at them over his spectacles if here ain t that parcel ol Granny Peters been waitin fer so long Yarn s in it he informed his amused listeners Red black and yellar Granny sends to the city for a fresh batch every summer and knits things for Christmas presents I ve had one o Granny Peters mufflers every year for longer than I kin recollect He reached again into the bag An here s magazines enough to start a shop Them s for the Packard ranch They must have a powerful lot o time for settin around readin them two must Merry was watching eagerly for on the very next package she was sure that she saw her name The postmaster looked at it closely Then he held it far off to get a different angle evidently hoping for enlightenment Finally he shook his head and tossed it to one side Reckon thar s been a mistake as to that parcel he said Thar ain t no Miss Marion Starr in these here parts I m Marion Starr that maiden informed him laughingly holding out her hand But before the postmaster would give up the parcel he presented the girl with a paper to sign Reckon thar s suthin powerful valuable in that thar box he said bein as it s sent registered Then he leaned on his elbows as though planning to wait until Merry had opened her package before he finished distributing the mail but to his quite evident disappointment the girl slipped it into her sweater coat pocket I know what s in it she said brightly Jane noting the radiant happiness in her friend s face believed that she also knew but her attention was attracted again to the small window near which she stood for the postmaster was touching her arm with a long letter Miss Jane Abbott he said adding Wall golly be you re sort o popular I reckon Here are three letters an thar s another that come in yesterday It s Jane s birthday Julie piped up informingly A month before the older girl would have rebuked the younger for having been so familiar with one of a class far beneath her As it was she accepted smilingly the well meant remark Wall do tell How old be yo Miss Jane Not a day over sixteen jedgin by yer looks As soon as the two girls could slip away from the others Jane led Merry into the deserted parlor of the inn where hair cloth chairs and sofa a marble topped table and bright colored prints on the wall were revealed in the subdued light from windows hung with heavy draperies When they were alone Merry whirled and caught Jane s hands as she asked glowingly Can you guess what s in the box I told mother to forward it For answer Jane stooped and kissed the flushed cheek of her friend Of course I can guess she replied It s the ring Jean s brother was to send you from Paris Merry soon had the small box unwrapped and a dew drop clear diamond was revealed in a setting of quaint design Oh Merry how wonderfully beautiful it is Jane said with sincere admiration Her shining eyed friend slipped it on the finger for which it was intended then smiling up at her companion she prophesied Some day another ring as lovely as this one will make you my sister There was a wistful expression in the dark eyes but Jane s quiet reply was You are wrong Merry Even if Jean thinks he cares for me he would not if he knew and what is more I have no reason to believe that he even likes me better than he does his other girl friends Merry knowing that time alone could tell whether or not she was a prophet changed the subject by asking From whom are your letters dear How selfish I have been opening my box first when it is your birthday Jane glanced at the top envelope then tore it open with breathless eagerness Merry surmised and correctly that the letter was from Jean Sawyer It was the one mister Bently had taken from a pigeon hole where it had been since the day before It did not take long for Jane to read it and when she looked up there was an expression of happiness shining through the tears that had come Then suddenly and most unexpectedly the girl sank down in the stiff chair by the marble topped table and bending her head on her arms she sobbed bitterly Merry went to her and putting an arm about her she implored Don t don t cry dearie It will make your eyes red and the others will wonder Tell me what is in the letter and let us try to think what it is best to do Is it from Jean Jane lifted her head and wiped her eyes Then she held the letter out for her friend to read There were few words in it but they told how sincerely unhappy the lad was because Jane seemed not to wish for his friendship Jean had written All I can think of is that in some way I have hurt you and that I do so want to be forgiven At least be frank and tell me just why you do not wish my friendship Why don t you tell him dearie If it would be hard to talk it over with him write a little letter now and leave it until someone comes for the Packard ranch mail Will you do that if I get the materials Jane nodded miserably Yes I would rather write it Then I will go back with you next week and I shall never again see Jean Sawyer Merry procured from mister Bently the paper and envelope while Bob willingly loaned his fountain pen A glance at the big loud ticking clock on the wall showed that there was still twenty minutes before missus Bently would be ready for them Merry thoughtfully left Jane alone nor did she ask what her friend had written when at last she joined the others who were seated in the cane bottomed chairs on the front veranda of the inn The letter Jane had given to mister Bently asking him to place it with the rest of the mail for the Packard ranch The boys sprang up when Jane appeared and Bob being nearest offered his chair with a flourish Merry glanced anxiously at her friend but the beautiful face betrayed nothing Thank you Jane replied with a smile at Bob who had perched upon the rail near Then to Dan she said Brother I have such a nice letter from Dad and one from grandmother but best of all is the check in Aunt Jane s letter because now I can repay the debt that I owe our dear wonderful Meg Before she could say more missus Bently appeared in the doorway her face rosy her spotless blue apron wound about her hands The birthday lunch is ready to be dished up she announced Instantly Bob was on his feet making a deep bow before Jane and holding out his arm as he inquired May I have the great pleasure of escorting the guest of honor Gerald taking the cue bowed before Merry and Julie laughing up at Dan said ungrammatically but happily Me n you are all that s left The tall boy caught the little girl by one hand as he joyfully replied missus Tom Thumb and The Living Skeleton will end the procession Jane smiling over her shoulder said rebukingly Don t call yourself that brother You re not nearly as thin as you were When the dining room was reached the young people were surprised and pleased Say boy was Bob s comment missus Bently you ve decked it out in grand style The table to which they had been led was indeed resplendent with the best of everything that the good woman possessed On a real damask table cloth was glass that sparkled while a pink rose pattern wound about plates and cups They re my wedding presents the comely woman told them as she beamed her pleasure I never use them except for extra occasions like Christmas and Birthdays Gerald put in Then after the boys had moved the chairs out for the girls and all were seated they glanced about the room Two cowboys were at a table in a corner and Jane recognized that one of them was from the Packard ranch He ll take back their mail she thought and so this very day Jean Sawyer will know all He will never never want to see me after he reads what I have written The menu for that birthday lunch was indeed an excellent one but the children who sat next to each other were eagerly anticipating the dessert What do you spect it will be Gerald inquired softly and Julie whispered back I know what I wish it was It begins with I C You might as well wish for something else Dan who had overheard replied but when missus Bently appeared on her tray there were six dishes heaped high with chocolate ice cream Why missus Bently are you a miracle worker Jane pleased for the children s sake inquired Laughingly the woman confessed that the ice cream had been the reason she had asked for one hour in which to prepare So many folks motorin past want ice cream she told them and so Pa Bently fetched a new contraption from Denver last time he was up there an it ll freeze ice cream in one hour easy Then she disappeared to soon return with a mountain of a chocolate layer cake You ll have to get along without candles Miss Jane the good woman said an the frostin ain t very hard yet but I reckon it ll pass The girl who had felt scornful of these natives as she had called them only a short month before was deeply touched and she exclaimed with real feeling missus Bently I do indeed appreciate all the trouble that you have taken I have never had a nicer party A moment later Jane saw the two cowboys leave the dining room Almost unconsciously she pressed her hand against her heart to still its rapid beating as her panicky thought was questioning Do you really want to send that letter to Jean Sawyer There is yet time to get it Do you want him to know just how dishonorable you were about the money She half rose then sank down again for through the swinging door she had seen mister Bently handing the Packard mail pouch to the cowboy It was too late Then chancing to meet Merry s troubled glance Jane smiled as she said with an effort at gaiety Gerald if all of your wishes are to be fulfilled as magically as this one has been you are to be a lucky boy There s two things we ve wished for lately that don t happen aren t there Danny The small boy looked up at his big brother who smiled down as be replied I suppose you mean that we have not found Meg Heger s box What is the other unmaterialized wish Gerry The boy s wide eyes expressed astonishment Why Dan Abbott I do believe you ve forgotten that we wished we might find the lost gold mine The older boy laughingly confessed that was true Dan had found a gold mine that he valued much more than the one to which Gerald referred It was missus Bently who said It wasn t a lost mine exactly dearie The vein they d been workin petered out although there are folks who reckon that vein branched off somewhars but the miners went away hot foot when the Bald Mountain Strike was made Then she concluded There s not much use huntin for that lost vein how some ever Time and again there s been wanderin miners diggin around in them parts but they allays give up and go away Then as the young people rose they each expressed some characteristic praise for the meal and indeed missus Bently was almost as pleased about it as her guests had been The bill they found was surprisingly small Then after bidding the two queer characters goodbye the six merrymakers started up the trail with Julie again on the horse The other girls took turns riding with her and so at about two they reached the Abbott cabin Dan climbed to the back of the mare Calling that he would soon return he rode up the mountain toward Meg s home How very many things had happened in the few weeks they had been in the mountains he thought If only Jane could be happy Dan assured himself he would be supremely so But poor Jane found as the moments passed that she regretted more and more having sent the letter but she would not confide this to Merry whose suggestion it had been Meanwhile the letter had reached its destination and had been read by Jean Sawyer CHAPTER XXXIV SECRETS Merry glanced anxiously at Jane when they were alone Bob having gone with the children for a hike along the brook Dear she said slipping an arm about her friend you are regretting having taken my advice aren t you They were in the bedroom which they shared removing their tams and sweaters when to Merry s surprise and grief Jane threw herself down on the bed and sobbed as though her heart would break Oh I can t bear the humiliation of it all How I wish we could leave for the East today this very minute While I am here I may meet Jean Sawyer and if he looks at me scornfully as of course he will I would rather be dead honestly I would Merry indeed regretted that she had asked Jane to send the letter which was causing her so much unhappiness Try to forget about it Janey just for today she implored while we are celebrating your eighteenth birthday Then an inspiration came to her and she asked What would your mother have done if she had had a sorrow that would sadden others if they knew about it Jane sat up on the side of the bed and after glancing at the miniature on the table near she turned and looked thoughtfully out of the wide window and into the sun shimmering valley Merry wondered what her reply would be A moment later she knew for Jane sprang up and after kissing the golden haired girl impulsively she caught her by the hand saying I m going out to the brook to wash my face in that clear cold water just as Dan and I did the first day that we came And I ll try to wash away all selfish grievings and to think if I can only of the happiness of the guests at my birthday party That s what my mother would have done I am so glad that Dan told me that we can choose a model or an ideal and carve our own characters like it and I m grateful to you for having recalled it to me because for the moment I had forgotten The girls took their towels and hand in hand they skipped around to the brook Jane knelt by the big boulder and splashed the cold spring water over her tear stained eyes When she looked up her wet cheeks were rosy And later when they had gone back to the bedroom to complete their preparations for the party Merry begged Jane to wear a wine colored dress which was especially becoming to her It was of soft clinging crepe de chine and had a deep collar of Irish crochet Then they went into the living room to await the coming of their guest Merry whose dainty blue summer dress made her lovely eyes the color of a June sky sat smiling admiringly at her friend Jane she said you are wonderful But there is just one more touch needed to make you look a bit more partified I will get it Springing up Merry went into their bedroom took from her suitcase a box which contained a beautiful scarlet rose with satin and velvet petals This she pinned into Jane s soft dark hair just above her left ear Standing off to note the effect Merry declared that her friend was certainly the most beautiful girl she had ever seen A short month before Jane would have considered this praise her just due but so greatly had she changed her reply was given in entire sincerity I may be the most beautiful to you because you love me but Meg Heger is really the more beautiful Before Merry could reply there was an excited shouting without Both girls leaped to the open door They saw Meg Heger riding on her spotted pony while Dan on the big brown mare was at her side but they were conversing quietly The halloos came from the brook Turning to look in that direction the girls saw Julie Bob and Gerald racing toward them as fast as they could over the rocky way and it was quite evident that they were all very much excited I wonder what they have seen Jane said Before the children and Bob could reach the cabin Meg and Dan had climbed the stairway and had been greeted by the two girls The trapper s daughter wore a simply fashioned Scotch plaid gingham dress in which many colors were mingled They all turned toward the brook when the three who were racing toward them neared What ho Dan called gayly and Jane noted that never before had she seen in her brother s face an expression of such radiant happiness Did you three see a bear It never will do for us to go back East without having at least sighted a grizzly To the surprise of the four who awaited them the newcomers became suddenly embarrassed and even Bob acted as though he hardly knew what to say which was quite unusual in so straightforward and impulsive a lad Dan he said may I speak with you a moment The older boy walked away from the curious group of girls We did not know that Meg Heger had come Bob began and we were just going to call out that we had found another place where we would like to look for the lost box It s such a queer place Dan but it is one that as yet we have not investigated Can t we get away from the girls somehow Gerald and Julie and I want to show the spot to you at least Why I presume so Dan agreed and after explaining to the three older girls that Bob and the youngsters wished to show him something he followed them back along the brook It was the way that he had gone on that day when he had first visited the Heger cabin When they reached the waterfall which Dan had thought so pretty they climbed down to the red rock basin into which it fell Excitedly Gerald pointed back of the tumbling water Look it Dan he fairly shouted See that little cave opening in there Doesn t it look to you as if it had been made with a pickaxe Bob thinks it does Dan looked through the transparent sheet of hurrying water and smilingly shook his head as he replied I don t suppose that a human being has ever been through that crevice and moreover I don t quite see how we can investigate do you Bob Dan noting the disappointed expression on his small brother s face turned toward the older boy We sort of had it figured out that Gerald could stand back of the waterfall and then he could see better whether that is just a crevice in the rocks or the mouth of a cave The youngest boy looked up eagerly You know Dan I fetched along my bathing suit Mayn t I go back to the cabin and put it on Mayn t I Dan Why of course if you wish but perhaps you had better say nothing to the girls about it I do not like to have Meg know that we are searching for that box since there is no real likelihood of our finding it Luckily the girls were not in sight and so no questions were asked of the small boy who dived into his own room donned his bathing suit and raced away without having been seen Dan held the younger boy s hand in a tight clasp as Gerald went down into the clear cold pool Now hold your breath and step up on that ledge back of the waterfall the older brother advised Julie watched wide eyed almost frightened Oh Danny she suddenly exclaimed couldn t there be something terrible hiding in that crack But before Dan could assure her that it was not likely Gerald had leaped back into the rock basin crying It s a cave in there Oh boy Shall I go in it Dan shall I Not alone The older boy was almost sorry that the crevice had been found Bob he said turning to the lad who stood meditatively looking at the waterfall I don t believe that it would be wise to permit Gerald to go into that cave He might suddenly drop into a pit filled with water Let s give it up shall we and go back to the girls It was plain to see that Bob was disappointed but his reply was Of course Gerald ought not to go into that cave if it is one I had no intention of permitting him to do more than see if it really is an opening I also have a bathing suit and a flashlight I never will be satisfied unless I investigate but of course I will not take a step inside unless it is solid rock Against his better judgment Dan said Well go ahead Bob if you want to The girls had evidently sauntered away from the cabin for Bob did not see them when he went there to don his bathing suit He rejoined the others in a very short time Having been an athlete in college he swung himself down and back of the waterfall without aid Then flashing the light into the crevice he sang out There s a solid floor all right Dan but I think Gerald had better not come For a long five minutes the group on the outside waited listening with ever increasing anxiety Dan thought that he would be sincerely glad when this foolhardy adventure was over At last he called Bob haven t you investigated enough Come on out But there was no reply Another five minutes elapsed and Dan was just about to have Gerald again climb back of the waterfall to look through the crevice when Bob appeared carrying a pickaxe and a shovel rusted and dirt encrusted What do you say to that he exulted as he plunged through the fall and waded out of the red rock pool Dan was amazed Bob he exclaimed you were right about one thing at least The cave was made with a pick Was it large No that is not wide It is a narrow tunnel which stops abruptly I found these tools at the very end Dan lifted his shovel and looked at the handle Then he examined it more closely Picking up a stone he knocked away the dirt with which it was crusted A name was carved in the handle Letter by letter was deciphered and Dan wrote each in his small notebook When they had reached the last Bob asked Is it a message telling where the box is No Dan replied merely the name and address of the owner of the shovel and pick I judge A French name Giguette Yes that is it Franc Giguette But there is more to it Danny Gerald was trying to see the pad What s the rest Where the miner lived I suppose Dan told him Cabin ten I think it is Bob leaped around wild with joy Talk about a clue Why that s the number of the cabin at Crazy Creek where this miner lived Can t we go right over and hunt for it Dan Do you suppose that the girls would care if Gerald and I go We aren t at all necessary to the birthday party You and Julie are Of course you may do as you wish Dan acquiesced It s a long way to the camp though Not if we can ride Gerry put in You and Meg came down on the horses Where are they Back at the Heger cabin by this time the older brother replied Meg turned her pony s head up the mountain road and said Go home Pal and the brown mare seemed to be quite content to follow Perhaps you will overtake them Bob caught hold of Gerald s hand as he said We ll have to hustle old man if we get back before dark Gerry glanced at Julie to see if she were terribly disappointed but the small girl smiled though a bit waveringly Dan noting this spoke for her Julie and I will stay at the cabin It would hardly do for us all to leave Jane on her birthday These two sauntered slowly along the brook and before they reached the cabin they saw Bob and Gerald fully clothed starting to run up the mountain road Dan had little expectation that they would find the box of which the old Indian had told Meg but he knew that Bob would not be able to enjoy the quiet party when be might be out following a clue The girls were seated on the rustic front porch when Dan and Julie appeared Jane smiled a greeting to them then asked Do tell us what has happened to Bob and Gerry They dashed in and out again nor would they stop when we called to ask where they were going Boys will be boys was Dan s evasive answer as he sank down on the porch step and smiled up at Meg Then he heard his questioning thought asking Is it possible that Meg s real name is Giguette The five who remained at the cabin that afternoon found it difficult to converse idly for the thoughts of each kept returning to a subject of great interest to that individual Meg s good friend Teacher Bellows had told her that as soon as her examinations were completed he would accompany her and Pa Heger to a distant valley in the mountains where he had heard that the Ute tribe was then dwelling They believed the finding of the box to be impossible since all through the years the old Indian had searched for it Merry who had slipped her ring back into its case before any of her friends except Jane had seen it was wondering when would be the best time to put it on her finger and announce to them all that she was to become the wife of Jean s brother She had wanted to wait until Jean Willoughby should be with them but when that would be she could not conjecture Dan and Julie were very much excited over the discovery of the pick and shovel and the lad could see by the small girl s manner that she was finding the secret almost more than she could keep Every now and then in childish fashion Julie would look over at her brother hump her shoulders and put a finger on her lips Jane noted this but was too miserably unhappy to wonder about little girl secrets But she was being true to her resolve She was ever keeping the memory of her mother in thought and trying to be interested in what her companions were saying It was indeed a long afternoon tense with suppressed excitement At five thirty when the boys had not returned Dan began to regret that he had granted the permission for of course Gerry would not have gone to Crazy Creek Camp if his older brother had thought it unwise and Bob in all probability would not have gone alone Jane after glancing at her wrist watch sprang up announcing with evident gaiety Merry and I have a supper planned Then turning to the younger girl she invited Julie dear wouldn t you like to set the table and make it look real partified Oh goodie The small girl was glad to be asked to accompany the older two and away she skipped Meg and Dan were left alone for their offers of assistance had been refused Suppose we climb to Bald Rock and watch the sunset Dan suggested The girl smiling up at him arose at once As soon as they had started to climb along the singing brook Meg looked at her companion inquiringly Dan she said won t you share your secret with me Perhaps the lad countered if you will share yours with me A merry rippling laugh as silvery as the song of the brook they were following was the girl s first response Then We must be mind readers she told him Dan glanced down into the dusky uplifted face and in his eyes there was an expression almost of adoration Meg he said doesn t that alone prove that we are perfect comrades We can sense each other s unspoken thought Then with greater seriousness I have hesitated about telling you and moreover you have been in Scarsburg during the past week but it is your right to know Bob and Gerald and I have been searching for the box of which the dying Indian told you Why Dan the girl s surprise was unmistakable it is but wasting time If the old Ute could not find it surely it is not findable There is a simpler way to learn of my parentage and one which Pa Heger Teacher Bellows and I are planning to undertake Then she told of the journey into the mountains upon which they expected to start when her examinations were completed While Meg talked she realized that Dan had still more to tell and so she asked Where did you boys search and did you find anything at all Yes Meg we did unearth something and that is why Bob and Gerry hurried away in so mysterious a fashion Then the lad told about the dirt crusted shovel and pick and of the carved name Giguette the girl repeated as though she were searching her memory for something forgotten Then lifting a radiant face she exclaimed Dan Abbott that is my name I was only a little thing less than three when someone taught me to lisp that my name was Lalie Giguette when anyone asked Until now I had completely forgotten CHAPTER XXXV JANE AND JEAN Meanwhile the three girls in the kitchen were preparing the evening meal with much nonsensical chatter but Jane was finding the strain almost more than she could bear She felt that she might overcome her desire to go to her room and sob her heart out if only she could get away by herself for a few moments and so she suddenly exclaimed The one thing needed for our table is a bouquet I saw a clump of the prettiest wild flowers yesterday and if you girls will excuse me I ll go and get them Merry at once saw through the ruse Jane s flushed cheeks quivering lips and tear brimmed eyes told the story and so she urged Do go Jane before it is dark The cool mountain air will do you good She did not offer to accompany her friend realizing that she wanted to be alone Jane left the cabin and after crossing the brook she hurried toward the cleft in a rock where she had seen the flowers of which she had spoken but instead of gathering them she threw herself down on a wide flat boulder and sobbed bitterly She did not hear footsteps hurrying toward her but suddenly she was conscious that someone had taken her hand and was holding it with great tenderness Of course it is Dan she thought without glancing up Dear old Dan who always understood But in another second when the someone spoke Jane knew that it was Jean Willoughby and not her brother Instantly she was on her feet her cheeks flaming her hand pressed over her pounding heart There was a wild frightened expression in her eyes and she was about to run but she could not for two strong arms caught and held her as the lad implored Jane dear dear Jane don t spurn me any longer Don t you understand that I love you The very fact that you could write that letter to me reveals the true nobility of your soul I don t blame you in the least for finding it hard at first to adjust yourself to the changed conditions but when it came to the testing you would have told your father to do just what he did Then putting a hand over her quivering lips he begged Don t let s talk about that subject now There s something ever so much more interesting that I want to say Jane can you care enough for me to promise to be my wife The sudden change from misery to joy had been so great that the girl could hardly believe that it was real and she gazed uncomprehendingly into the eager handsome face of the lad Then slowly she read in his glowing eyes the truth of all he had said and she smiled tremulously It was enough for Jean Willoughby Joyfully he cried You do care Jane Then taking from his pocket a ring he added and there was infinite tenderness in his voice That last summer on the coast of Maine when little mother and I were alone together she gave me this for you dearest girl Again there were sudden tears in the dark eyes that were lifted to his Not for me Jean Your mother would have chosen a girl who could do useful things pare potatoes sew and darn The lad laughed happily and catching the slim left hand he slipped the ring on the finger for which it was intended Then he kissed each of the five finger tips as he confessed It may seem inconsistent but I want these lovely hands kept stainless We will have a Chinaman to pare and cook Then slowly they walked toward the cabin Meg and Dan had returned and with Merry and Julie were standing on the rustic front porch wondering where Jane had wandered and why she remained away so long When they saw the two coming toward them hand in hand their faces even in the dusk that had so quickly fallen revealing their secret there was joy in the hearts of Merry and Dan Jane would no longer be unhappy When they had entered the lighted living room of the cabin Merry exclaimed as she held out her left hand I also am to be congratulated I am to be married to Jean s brother on the first day of September Let s make it a double wedding Jane can t we her fiance implored I d like to The radiant girl glanced at Dan then added If my big brother will give his consent Indeed you have it Jane that lad said heartily I know that I am voicing our father s sentiments to be when I say that I am proud to welcome Jean Willoughby into our family Of their own secret Meg and Dan had decided to say nothing Then remembering the commonplaces Jane said We re waiting supper for the boys Where did they go and why She looked at both Julie and Dan You two surely know since you were with them It is nearly seven and getting dark rapidly Aren t you anxious about them Dan I shall be if they do not soon return the lad replied Perhaps we had better have the good supper you have prepared There is no need to spoil it for all I m not a bit hungry Jane said and Merry teased Why Janey you must be in love The table had been placed in the middle of the cabin living room Over it hung a drop lamp with a crimson shade and as there was a log burning on the hearth the room presented a most festive appearance It was with sincere regret that the six young people seated themselves leaving two chairs vacant All during the meal at intervals they paused to listen hoping that they would hear the halloos of the returning boys Dan was becoming thoroughly alarmed and at last after a consultation with Meg he turned to the others and said We have decided to tell you the mission on which the boys started out so hurriedly Of course Jane and Merry had surmised that they had gone in quest of the hidden box but they knew nothing of the finding of the pick shovel and carved name and they were much interested At eight o clock Jean Willoughby rose I had better be going he said I have a long hike ahead of me But Dan protested Indeed you shall not go tonight mister Packard will not be worried if you remain with us will he I may need your help to locate the boys if they do not soon return That settled the matter for Jean had not wished to leave Another hour passed and Dan who had really become very anxious arose but before he could get his coat and cap the halloos for which they had long listened were heard Leaping to the door Dan threw it open and a welcoming light streamed out into the darkness Bob and Gerry looking almost exhausted staggered into the room although Dan well knew that it was for effect and sank down on the vacant chairs Say talk about a climb We certainly had a steep one Bob gasped The young people at once noted that neither boy was carrying a box and so they decided that it had not been found It isn t such a terrible steep climb to Crazy Creek Camp Dan commented Half of the way is down grade The two younger boys exchanged glances that were hard for the watchers to interpret Then Bob sprang up exclaiming Come on kid Let s wash and have some of the good grub You must be nearly starved Jane said also rising and going toward the kitchen We are keeping your share of the party warm When they were gone Dan said softly I m inclined to believe that the boys have something of a surprising nature to tell us but after Gerry s usual fashion he wants to keep us guessing for a time The two mountain climbers were indeed hungry and they ate heartily talking aggravatingly of everything but the matter which they knew was uppermost in the minds of their companions When they declared that another bite could not be taken the table was cleared magazines and books again spread upon it and then Dan feeling it unfair to Meg to keep her longer in suspense exclaimed Now boys tell us your adventures CHAPTER XXXVI MYSTERIES HALF SOLVED It didn t take us long to get to Crazy Creek Camp I can tell you Bob glancing from one to another of the group about the fireplace saw in each face an eager interest in the tale he had to tell But in Meg s face there was more than interest and suddenly Bob realized that the finding of the lost box was of vital importance to the mountain girl while to him it had been merely an exciting adventure the mystery of which had lured him on After a thoughtful moment he continued We found most of the cabins unnumbered or if they had once been so marked time and storms had done away with the numerals But we did find a tunnel above which the figures ten had been chipped out of solid stone The opening of the small tunnel was closed however by red rocks that had fallen evidently in a landslide I suggested that we lift them away one by one but Gerry thought it a waste of time as the carving on the handle had been Cabin ten and not Tunnel ten But I was not so sure and so we went to work and in half an hour we had an opening large enough to enter one at a time I had my flashlight with me and stooping I looked in Strangely enough I saw a faint gleam of daylight at the other end Bob paused and glanced about the group to make sure that they were all properly curious before he continued The tunnel was not high enough for even Gerry to stand in erect and so on all fours we crept through it Since the opening had been stopped up I did not fear meeting wild creatures but as we neared the other end the daylight grew brighter and then to our great surprise we came out upon a wide ledge which hung there in the most dizzying manner On it was a rustic cabin and back of that a fenced in dooryard Surely we decided this was Cabin ten There was no way of reaching it except through the tunnel as the mountain wall was almost perpendicular above and below the ledge We were greatly elated and at once tried the door and found it unlocked There was only one room and it looked like the den of a student Books and papers were everywhere in evidence dust covered and yellowed with the years On the desk a bottle of dried ink was uncorked and a rusted pen lying there seemed to indicate that someone had suddenly stopped writing and for some reason had never again taken up the pen As further proof of this we found a letter which was lying near with even the last sentence unfinished It is addressed to My dear petite daughter Eulalie We didn t stop to read it because it was getting late and so we started for home Meg no longer able to keep silent leaned forward asking eagerly Bob may I see the letter that my father left for me Your father Jane and Merry exclaimed almost simultaneously Even then Meg s calm was not outwardly disturbed Yes she said turning her wonderful eyes toward her friends In them the girls saw an expression of radiant happiness which told them more than words could how great was Meg s joy that she had at last learned who her father really was Jane and Merry were perplexed How did Meg know Their question was answered before it was asked I should have told you girls this afternoon When Dan spoke the name that he had found carved on the handle of the old shovel instantly memory recalled to me that as a very small child I had been taught to lisp that my name was Lalie Giguette O Meg what a beautiful name May we begin at once to call you Eulalie The mountain girl smiled at Jane If you wish dear friend She then held out her hand for the letter which Bob had gone to his sweater coat to procure We found several books with your father s name on them as author the boy informed her and the girl looked up brightly to say O I am so glad Did you bring them No Bob replied we thought perhaps you would like to visit the cabin and find everything there just as he left it I would indeed Meg rose and going to the center table she spread the letter under the hanging lamp After a moment s scrutiny she turned toward the silently waiting group It is clearly written she said I will read it aloud To my dear petite daughter Eulalie Meg read Poor little wee lassie Not yet three and no one to care for you I shall try to get back to New York before the end comes but there is no one not even in France where I lived as a boy All all are dead But you will want to know much and I will be gone when you are old enough to question When I was twenty one I came to New York and married a girl who was as all alone as I We were very happy but my loved one your mother died when you were born For a long year I grieved until my health was broken For your sake Lalie I followed my doctor s advice and came to the Rocky Mountains I was about to put you in a convent school but you clung to me and would not loosen your hold I feared I had not long to live and I did so want you with me hence I brought you here But if I do not get stronger soon I will take you back to the kind sisters who will make you a home We reached this deserted mining camp after weeks of wandering and I built for us a cabin where we could be alone and unmolested At last my lost ambition had returned I wrote the book of my dreams and sent it to my publisher in New York I hope dear little daughter that it will be a success for your sake but as yet I do not know Meg looked up and her dusky eyes were filled with tears That is all on the first sheet she said The next was written at a later date Then again she read A tribe of Ute Indians has taken possession of the deserted cabins in the camp but as there is little game hereabouts I doubt if they will long remain Two weeks later I have not been as well as I had hoped to be I did very wrong to spend so many hours writing my dream book but now that it is completed I will write no more until I am stronger Every day with a pick and shovel I dig in different places for recreation and exercise endeavoring to find the fabled gold mine the vein of which was lost or so I have been told by an occasional miner who has passed this way Before starting out I take you each afternoon to the cabin of a most kindly squaw who understands some English and since I pay her well she is willing to care for you during my absence For a long moment Meg ceased reading and Dan noting that her hands trembled went to her side saying with tender solicitude Dear girl what is it I fear that reading aloud this letter from your father is very hard for you Wouldn t you rather read it to yourself The girl lifted tear filled eyes It isn t that Dan she said I want to share it with my friends who are so loving and loyal but I cannot decipher the rest There was a faded blur on the paper as though the pen had fallen Then it had evidently been picked up again but the scrawled letters that followed were very hard to read Slowly the girl deciphered Lalie when you are eighteen get box Then there was another blot and the pen had evidently rolled across the paper The girl held the letter up to Dan I fear we will never know where the box is she said for that is all But the lad after scrutinizing the sheet held it up to the light There is more written but evidently a drop of ink spread over it Gerry bring the magnifying glass The small boy glad to be of assistance leaped to get it Dan gazed through it for a long five minutes Then he began to name the letters and Bob who had seized a pencil and paper wrote them down B a n k Dan glanced questioningly at Meg What kind of a bank do you suppose it means Then to Bob Were there any banks of dirt near the cabin That lad shook his head Jane suggested Would it not be more natural to suppose it to be a New York bank since that had been mister Giguette s home for years They all decided this to be true Then Merry asked Meg or may I say Eulalie are you willing that I should wire my father all that we know He is a lawyer in New York and be will gladly find out what he can How the dusky face brightened Oh thank you Merry Please do Then rising the mountain girl held out both hands to Jane and Merry I must go now she said to the dear old couple who have been all the father and mother I have ever known Dan accompanied Meg up the winding mountain road CHAPTER XXXVII THE MYSTERY SOLVED What a glorious moonlit night it is Merry exclaimed when Meg and Dan having gone the others turned back toward the cabin I say sis Bob exclaimed why not get that telegram written and let me take it down to the village You can put heaps more into a night letter Why Bobby it must be after nine The innkeeper s family will be asleep by the time you could get there Jean Willoughby explained They have two sons and one of them is always on duty as night clerk Strangers motoring through put up there at all hours Then the young overseer added I wish now that I had ridden over and you could have used my horse We sent the two we had back to the Heger cabin Bob said but added as he took a handspring to prove to his sister that he was not at all tired I d just as soon walk Then as another thought occurred to him he turned to the younger lad asking If you re game Gerry come along with me We ll put up at the inn for the night and bring back the answer from father as soon as it comes Since there was no particular reason why they should not do this Merry and Jane made no further remonstrances Going indoors a carefully planned night letter was prepared and in great glee the two boys started out each carrying a gun as Jean told them that they might meet a wildcat Huh I hoped you were going to say a grizzly bear Gerry s tone seemed to imply that they were quite fearless Soon after the boys had departed Dan returned Glancing at Jean he questioned Ought we to follow them But the other lad replied They re safe enough Moreover I told Bob to swing a red lantern three times when they reach the inn The night is so clear we surely can see it And so they waited and an hour later the expected signal was plainly seen by all of them Now to bed everybody Dan sprang up and held both hands toward his sister Jane Julie had been prevailed upon to retire soon after the lads started out and was sound asleep The girls had decided to be up at an early hour but because they had gone to bed much later than usual they overslept It was after noon before Meg appeared Ma Heger had needed her help was all that she said Jane and Merry decided not to tell her about the night letter for the suspense would be far harder for her to bear than it was for them But after a time Meg began to wonder why at frequent intervals one or another of the young people went to the top of the stone stairs and through field glasses gazed down the mountain road It was two o clock when the old stage was seen slowly ascending I entirely forgot that the stage passes us on Saturday afternoon Dan exclaimed Of course Bob and Gerry waited to ride up But as the lumbering vehicle neared the passengers were seen to be all adults a west valley rancher his wife and grown daughters Then just as the watchers had given up hope the two laughing boys dropped from the back of the stage and ran up the stone stairs Paying no heed to the others Bob leaped over to where Meg was standing and making a deep bow he handed her a yellow envelope But this is for Merry the mountain girl told him True enough and Bob gave the telegram to his sister Opening it she read Franc Giguette author of The Star that Set Book was great success Publishers holding royalties as they were uncalled for Box in name of Eulalie Giguette at the First National Bank Contains contracts and papers of value also jewels Await further advice While all of the others congratulated the beautiful girl Dan stood aside with sorrow in his heart He had asked Meg to marry him when he thought her poor Even then they would have had a long wait for he had wanted to help his father for a time before he considered his own happiness Meg looked over at the lad whom she so loved Aren t you also glad for me Dan she asked Yes very glad he said but he was more than ever pleased that he and Meg had not told of their engagement which might never be fulfilled When the excitement had somewhat subsided Bob recalled that he had a letter for Jean Willoughby and bringing it forth presented it to the young man who looked inquiringly at the handwriting then with a quick questioning glance at Merry he tore it open and read its message Marion Starr he cried you wrote my father did you not telling him where you found me It was evident that he was not displeased The golden haired girl nodded then waited eagerly to hear what manner of message the letter contained Dan said Bob your father and mine are again partners for Dad has restored the money that had been supposedly lost Since your father had recompensed the investors the firm of Abbott Willoughby as re established is much richer than it was for while holding the money Dad made investments that have tripled the capital of the firm Nor is that all Father has set aside money to start my brother and me in any business we may choose and your father is to do the same for each of his boys as the need arises Before Dan could speak Jean hurried on with mister Packard has offered to divide his ranch in three parts and Jane and I are to have one of them Dan you love the West It agrees with you Won t you take the third That s wonderful news Dan cried glowingly Indeed I would like to own a third of the Green Hills ranch Then to the surprise of the others he went to the mountain girl with hands outstretched and said his voice tense with feeling Meg Eulalie may I set the day for our wedding The dusky eyes of the beautiful girl were more than ever starlike as she nodded up at him Great he cried joyfully Then we will all be married on the first of September Transcriber s note A
