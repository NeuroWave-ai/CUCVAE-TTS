THE Letters OF LORD NELSON TO LADY HAMILTON WITH A SUPPLEMENT OF INTERESTING LETTERS BY Distinguished Characters IN TWO VOLUMES VOL I London Printed by Macdonald and Son Smithfield FOR THOMAS LOVEWELL company STAINES HOUSE BARBICAN AND SOLD BY ALL THE BOOKSELLERS eighteen fourteen ADVERTISEMENT In presenting to the Public the Letters of LORD NELSON to LADY HAMILTON something may justly be expected elucidatory of them Their mutual attachment is so generally known that for the Editors to have given notes however desirable and explanatory might not perhaps have been deemed perfectly decorous They now stand on their own real merits Some parts though not very numerous have been suppressed from the most honourable feelings to individuals as they would certainly have given pain That portion of Letters now offered to the BRITISH NATION written by the first of her Naval Commanders will shew his most private sentiments of men and measures of countries and their rulers It is the duty of the Editors to state that every letter has been most accurately transcribed and faithfully compared with the originals in their possession Should our IMMORTAL HERO have expressed an erroneous opinion of some individuals and of things let us ever remember they were written often under the feelings of sickness and of disappointment by him who so repeatedly fought and almost as frequently bled for our country for his DEAR ENGLAND and let us never forget that to him we owe more than to any man for our existence as a great and powerful Nation His country has truly honoured him and it is not presumptuous in the Editors to affirm that his deeds will be remembered not only in name but in their consequences by our remotest posterity Were we to dedicate them unto whom should we To the BRITISH NAVY as the genuine sentiments of a true seaman the first even of their own Heroes for NELSON could forego all private feelings all selfish motives for that which will ever be the first object of a truly great and brave man the glory and happiness of his country Our task which has from various causes been attended with more difficulties than could be imagined is thus far accomplished and we have the pleasure to inform the public that a very large collection of LORD NELSON S most important public and private correspondence c with the most distinguished characters at home and abroad is now in preparation for the press Many of the documents will certainly throw a light on political transactions at present very imperfectly understood and those which we intend to present to the world we doubt not will be found more than usually interesting CONTENTS VOL I LETTERS FROM LORD NELSON TO LADY HAMILTON LETTER I Page three II seven III nine IV eleven V thirteen VI fifteen VII eighteen VIII twenty

413-22436-0000	train-other-500	After a long passage we are arrived and it is as I suspected the ministers at Naples know nothing of the situation of the island Not a house or bastion of the town is in possession of the islanders and the Marquis de Niza tells me they want arms victuals and support
413-22436-0001	train-other-500	He does not know that any Neapolitan officers are in the island perhaps although I have their names none are arrived and it is very certain by the Marquis s account that no supplies have been sent by the governors of Syracuse or Messina

413-22436-0004	train-other-500	but I feel my duty lays at present in the East for until I know the shipping in Egypt are destroyed I shall never consider the French army as completely sure of never returning to Europe However all my views are to serve and save the Two Sicilies

413-22436-0014	train-other-500	and also one for the courier boat To tell you how dreary and uncomfortable the Vanguard appears is only telling you what it is to go from the pleasantest society to a solitary cell or from the dearest friends to no friends I am now perfectly the great man not a creature near me

bless me very soon with a sight of your dear angelic face You are a nonpareil No not one fit to wipe your shoes I am ever have been and always will remain your most firm fixed and unalterable friend I wish Sir William had come home a week ago then I should have seen you here I have this morning been attending the funeral of two young Mids a mister Gore cousin of captain Gore and a mister Bristow One nineteen the other seventeen years of age Last night I was all the evening in the Hospital seeing that all was done for the comfort of the poor fellows I am going on board for nothing should keep me living on shore without you were here I shall come in the morning to see Parker and go on board again directly I shall be glad to see Oliver I hope he will keep his tongue quiet about the tea kettle for I shall not give it till I leave the Medusa You ask me what Troubridge wrote me There was not a syllable about you in it It was about my not coming to London at the importance of which I laughed and then he said he should never venture another opinion On which I said Then I shall never give you one This day he has wrote a kind letter and all is over I have however wrote him in my letter of this day as follows viz And I am this moment as firmly of opinion as ever that Lord saint Vincent and yourself should have allowed of my coming to town for my own affairs for every one knows I left it without a thought for myself I know he likes to be with you but shall he have that felicity and he deprive me of it No that he shall not But this business cannot last long and I hope we shall have peace and I rather incline to that opinion But the Devil should not get me out of the kingdom without being some days with you I hope my dear Emma you will be able to find a house suited for my comfort I am sure of being HAPPY by your arrangements I have wrote a line to Troubridge about Darby Parker will write you a line of thanks if he is able I trust in God he will yet do well You ask me my dear friend if I am going on more expeditions And even if I was to forfeit your friendship which is dearer to me than all the world I can tell you nothing For I go out if I see the enemy and can get at them it is my duty and you would naturally hate me if I kept back one moment I long to pay them for their tricks t other day the debt of a drubbing which surely I ll pay but when where or how it is impossible your own good sense must tell you for me or mortal man to say I shall act not in a rash or hasty manner that you may rely and on which I give you my word of honour Just going off Ever for ever your faithful NELSON BRONTE Every kind thing to missus Nelson LETTER XVI Medusa Downs August thirty first eighteen oh one MY DEAR EMMA DEAREST BEST FRIEND OF NELSON Sir William is arrived and well remember me kindly to him I should have had the pleasure of seeing him but for one of my lords and masters TROUBRIDGE therefore I am sure neither you or Sir William will feel obliged to him The weather is very bad and I am very sea sick I cannot answer your letter probably but I am writing a line to get on shore if possible indeed I hardly expect that your letter can get afloat I entreat you my dear friend to work hard for me and get the house and furniture and I will be so happy to lend it to you and Sir William Therefore if you was to take the Duke s house a cake house open to every body he pleases you had better have a booth at once you never could rest one moment quiet Why did not the Duke assist Sir William when he wanted his assistance why not have saved you from the distress which Sir William must every day feel in knowing that his excellent wife sold her jewels to get a house for him whilst his own relations great as they are in the foolish world s eye would have left a man of his respectability and age to have lodged in the streets Did the Duke or any of them give him a house then Forgive me you know if any thing sticks in my throat it must out Sir William owes his life to you which I believe he will never forget To return to the house The furniture must be bought with it and the sooner it is done the better I shall like it Oh how bad the weather is The devils here wanted to plague my soul out yesterday just after dinner but I would have seen them damned before they should have come in The Countess Montmorris Lady this that and t other came along side a mister Lubbock with them to desire they might come in I sent word I was so busy that no persons could be admitted as my time was employed in the King s service Then they sent their names which I cared not for and sent Captain Gore to say it was impossible and that if they wanted to see a ship they had better go to the Overyssel a sixty four in the Downs They said no they wanted to see me However I was stout and will not be shewn about like a beast and away they went I believe Captain Gore wishes me out of his ship for the ladies admire him I am told very much but however no Captain could be kinder to me than he is These ladies he told me afterwards were his relations I have just got your letters many thanks for them You do not say in the end Sir William is arrived I am glad that you approve You may rely my dear friend that I will not run any unnecessary risk No more boat work I promise you but ever your attached and faithful NELSON BRONTE To the Duke and Lord William say every thing which is kind and to missus Nelson I am so dreadfully sea sick that I cannot hold up my head LETTER XVII September twenty first eighteen oh one Quarter past Ten o Clock MY DEAR EMMA I wish you would send the letter to missus Dod s directly for otherwise he may inadvertently If done and it comes to London deliver some of the things The wardrobe is her s and if any of her clothes are at mister Dod s they had better be separated from mine and indeed what things are worth removing to have them directly sent to Merton A bed or two I believe belong to my father but am not sure I send you doctor Baird s comfortable note this moment received You will find Parker is treated like an infant Poor fellow I trust he will get well and take possession of his room at the farm Ever your affectionate NELSON BRONTE LETTER XVIII Amazon September twenty six eighteen oh one Eight o Clock MY DEAREST EMMA Your kind letters came on board about six o clock You may rely upon one thing that I shall like Merton therefore do not be uneasy on that account I have that opinion of your taste and judgment that I do not believe it can fail in pleasing me We must only consider our means and for the rest I am sure you will soon make it the prettiest place in the world I dare say mister Hazelwood acted like all lawyers whose only consideration was for their client but I am sure you will do for me all the civil things towards missus Greaves If I can afford to buy the Duck Close and the field adjoining it would be pleasant but I fear it is not in my power but I shall know when my accounts are settled at New Year s Day To be sure we shall employ the trades people of our village in preference to any others in what we want for common use and give them every encouragement to be kind and attentive to us From my heart do I wish that I was with you and it cannot be long for to day I am far from well violent head ache and very cold but it may be agitation Whatever my dear Emma you do for my little charge I must be pleased with Probably she will be lodged at Merton at least in the spring when she can have the benefit of our walks It will make the poor mother happy I am sure I do not write to her to day as this goes through the Admiralty but tell her all I would say You know my unchangeable thoughts about her I shall have the child christened when I come up Have we a nice church at Merton We will set an example of goodness to the under parishioners Would to God I was with you at Laleham I shall never forget our happiness at that place mister Davison will pay missus Nelson fifty pounds October first I dare say mister Shakespeare has some orders about it I had yesterday a letter from my father he seems to think that he may do something which I shall not like I suppose he means going to Somerset Street Shall I to an old man enter upon the detestable subject it may shorten his days But I think I shall tell him that I cannot go to Somerset Street to see him But I shall not write till I hear your opinion If I once begin you know it will all out about her and her ill treatment to her son But you shall decide Our accounts of dear Parker I fear preclude all hopes of his recovery It was my intention to have gone ashore this morning to have called on Admiral Lutwidge but the wind s coming fresh from the S W I have declined it for I doubt if I could get off again At ten o clock with your letters came off doctor Baird s note to say every hope was gone I have desired that his death should be sent by telegraph to the Admiralty They will surely honour his memory although they would not promote him What are our feelings my dear Emma but we must cheer up and with best regards to missus Nelson believe me ever for ever your most affectionate NELSON BRONTE Best regards to Sir William I send you the last report Who knows LETTER XIX Amazon October eight eighteen oh one MY DEAREST FRIEND I do not expect although I am writing that any boat can communicate with us to day What can be the use of keeping me here for I can know nothing such weather and what a change since yesterday It came on in one hour from the water like a mill head to such a sea as to make me very unwell If I had gone to make my visit I could not have got off again I rejoice that I did not go Until I leave the station I have no desire to go on shore for Deal was always my abhorrence That Parker is a swindler Langford owed our dear Parker twenty five pounds of which there was no account but Langford desired his agents to pay mister Parker Langford requested that he would wait two or three months as it would be more convenient to him To which the other agreed Aye as long as you please He got one pound eleven shillings and sixpence from Samuel by casting his account wrong The first thing he does is to desire Langford s agents to pay thirty four pounds for Langford nine pounds more than the debt He is worse than a public thief His conduct to me was absolutely the worst species of thieving for it was under false pretences He sent doctor Baird on board to me to say that in London his pocket book was stole in which was twenty pounds and begged my assistance to get him home and that he had not a farthing to buy mourning for his dear son At this time he had forty seven pounds in his pocket besides what he had sold of his son s He has behaved so unlike a gentleman but very like a blackguard to both Captain Sutton Bedford and Hardy I am now clear that he never lost one farthing and that the whole is a swindling trick So you see my dear friend how good nature is imposed upon I am so vexed that he should have belonged to our dear Parker I have now done with the wretch for ever I hope he has got nothing from you and if you have promised him any thing do not send it Ten o Clock Your kind letters are arrived I rejoice that you have got into Merton I hope to get the letter on shore but it is very uncertain Ministry my dearest friend think very differently of my services from you But never mind I shall soon have done with them afloat Make my kindest regards to Sir William and all our friends and believe me ever your faithful and affectionate NELSON BRONTE I have just got a very kind letter from Captain Read He says he will come and see me be where it will He inquired after you and Sir William LETTER XX Amazon Ten o Clock October twelve eighteen oh one MY DEAREST FRIEND This being a very fine morning and smooth beach at eight o clock I went with Sutton and Bedford and landed at Walmer but found Billy fast asleep so left my card walked the same road that we came when the carriage could not come with us that night and all rushed into my mind and brought tears into my eyes Ah how different to walking with such a friend as you Sir William and missus Nelson Called at the barracks on Lord George but he is gone to London From thence to the Admiral s found him up and waiting half an hour to see missus Lutwidge who entreated me to stay dinner came directly on board I did not even call to see poor Langford who has been worse these few days past and God knows when he will be well I am afraid it will be a long time for several pieces of bone are lately come away and more to come But Troubridge has so completely prevented my ever mentioning any body s service that I am become a cypher and he has gained a victory over Nelson s spirit I am kept here for what he may be able to tell I cannot but long it cannot shall not be Sutton and Bedford are gone a tour till dinner time but nothing shall make me but almost force go out of the ship again till I have done and the Admiralty in charity will be pleased to release me I am in truth not over well I have a complaint in my stomach and bowels but it will go off If you was here I should have some rhubarb but as you are not I shall go without Sutton has sent into Yorkshire for a cow that in the spring will give fourteen pounds of butter a week and he has given Allen the finest goat I ever saw The latter I am afraid will be troublesome Just as I was coming off I received your packet and thank you from my heart for all your kindness What can Reverend Sir want to be made a Doctor for He will be laughed at for his pains I thank you for the King s letters I shall write a kind line to Castelcicala and answer the King s very soon and write to Acton for he can make Bronte every thing to me if he pleases I dare say I did wrong never to write him but as he treated Sir William unkindly I never could bring myself to it I am glad the Duke has been to see you and taking plants from him is nothing Make my kindest remembrances to him I would have every body like your choice for I am sure you have as fine a taste in laying out land as you have in music I ll be damned if missus Billington can sing so well as you She may have stage trick but you have pure nature I always say every thing for you and Sir William I wish you had translated the King s and Acton s letters Banti cannot I may be able to dispose of Charles but not of the other and he would corrupt Charles For ever yours NELSON BRONTE missus Lutwidge inquires always particularly after you We all laugh and say she is more fond of soldiers than ever since General Don has shewn her how he would keep off the French LETTER XXI Amazon October fifteenth eighteen oh one MY DEAREST FRIEND I have received all your letters of yesterday and the one sent from the post at Merton and also one mis sent to Poole but I do not write direct to Merton till I hear that mine to Sir William sent yesterday gets to you before those by London The Admiralty will not give me leave till the twenty twod and then only ten days What a set of beasts My cold is now got into my head and I have such dreadful pain in my teeth that I cannot hold up my head but none of them cares a damn for me or my sufferings therefore you see I cannot discharge my steward And yet I think upon consideration that I will send up all my things and take my chance as to their sending me down again What do you think At all events every thing except my bed I have table spoons forks every thing at least I shall have soon two hundred pounds worth What a b that Miss Knight is As to the other I care not what she says My poor dear father is wrong But more of this when we meet which will be Friday the twenty threed at farthest if possible the twenty twod But the Admiralty are hard upon me I am sorry to hear that you have been ill and my cold is so dreadfully bad that I cannot hold up my head and am so damned stupid that you must my dear friend forgive my letter Admiral Lutwidge is going to Portsmouth Sir William Parker is going to be tried for something Make my kindest respects to Sir William and believe me ever your s most faithfully NELSON BRONTE I have wrote a line to Merton Excuse my letter LETTER XXII Amazon October sixteenth eighteen oh one MY DEAREST FRIEND It being a very fine morning and the beach smooth I went to call on Admiral Lutwidge and returned on board before ten o clock missus Lutwidge is delighted with your present Sutton c were called forth to admire it She joins in abusing the Admiralty She pressed me very much to dine with them at three o clock but I told her I would not dine with the angel Gabriel to be dragged through a night surf Her answer was that she hoped soon I should dine with an angel for she was sure you was one In short she adores you but who does not You are so good so kind to every body old young rich or poor it is the same thing I called on poor Langford who has a long time to look forward to for getting well he told me your goodness in writing him a line and I called upon doctor Baird he disapproves of rhubarb and has prescribed magnesia and peppermint and I called on mister Lawrence So you see I did much business in one hour I was on shore Civility to Lutwidge was proper for me and indeed my duty The moment I got your letters off I came and have read them with real pleasure They have made me much better I think at least I feel so I admire the pigs and poultry Sheep are certainly most beneficial to eat off the grass Do you get paid for them and take care that they are kept on the premises all night for that is the time they do good to the land They should be folded Is your head man a good person and true to our interest I intend to have a farming book I am glad to hear you get fish not very good ones I fancy It is I thank God only six days before I shall be with you and to be shewn all the beauties of Merton I shall like it leaves or no leaves No person there can take amiss our not visiting The answer from me will always be very civil thanks but that I wish to live retired We shall have our sea friends and I know Sir William thinks they are the best I have a letter from mister Trevor begging me to recommend a youngster for him but none before your Charles Banti I suppose must return but at present we know not what ships are to be kept in commission I have a letter from a female relation of mine She has had three husbands and he mister Sherstone three wives Her brother a Nelson I have been trying ever since I have been in England to get promoted The last and present Admiralty promised I never saw the man he is in a ship in the North Seas forty five years of age I have a letter from Troubridge recommending me to wear flannel shirts Does he care for me No but never mind They shall work hard to get me back again Remember me kindly to Sir William the Duke and all friends and believe me ever your most affectionate NELSON BRONTE Do you ever see Castelcicala He is a good man and faithful to his master and mistress LETTER XXIII Amazon October sixteenth eighteen oh one MY DEAREST FRIEND I send you a letter for Allen s wife and one for Germany which I wish you would make Oliver put in the Foreign Post Office and pay what is necessary I would send you the letter to which it is an answer but it would be over weight It is all compliments and the man says it is all truth The wind is freshened cold but very fine day Best regards to Sir William missus Cadogan mister Oliver and all friends For ever your s faithfully NELSON BRONTE I have a letter from Reverend Doctor he is as big as if he was a Bishop and one from the Bedel of the university to say how well he preached I hope you ordered something good for him for those big wigs love eating and drinking LETTER XXIV Amazon October seventeenth eighteen oh one MY DEAREST FRIEND Although my complaint has no danger attending it yet it resists the medicines which doctor Baird has prescribed and I fancy it has pulled me down very much The cold has settled in my bowels I wish the Admiralty had my complaint but they have no bowels at least for me I had a very indifferent night but your and Sir William s kind letters have made me feel better I send you a letter from Lord Pelham I shall certainly attend and let them see that I may be useful in council as I have been in the field We must submit and perhaps these Admiralty do this by me to prevent another application You may rely that I shall be with you by dinner on Friday at half past three or four at farthest I shall not dine with Pitt as mister and missus Long are staying there Not that I ever saw her in my life nor care if I never do I pray that I may not be annoyed on my arrival it is retirement with my friends that I wish for Thank Sir William kindly for his letter and the inclosure which I return Sutton is much pleased with your letter and with Bedford will certainly make you a visit They are both truly good and kind to me Our weather has been cold these two days but not bad I have got a fire in the cabin and I hope my complaint will go off May Heaven bless you I send this through Troubridge direct in Piccadilly I shall you may rely admire the pig stye ducks fowls c for every thing you do I look upon as perfect doctor Baird has been aboard to see me He thinks I shall be better and that a few days on shore will set me up again Make my kind remembrances to Sir William the Duke and all friends and believe me ever your most affectionate NELSON BRONTE Bedford has made me laugh missus Lutwidge has been babbling that she will go to Portsmouth with the Admiral who says he shall be so fully employed that he cannot be much with her She whispered Bedford I have many friends in the army there She will certainly marry a soldier if ever she is disposable But perhaps you will agree with me that no good soldier would take her I am sure the purchase would be dear even if it was a gift Don t call this a bull Sutton s man was on the farm and the sheep when not belonging to the farm always paid so much sheep so much lambs but I dare say you manage well Sir William s letter has delighted me with your activity and prudence LETTER XXV The two letters would have been over weight so I send you the letter I have answered Pray take care of it it is a curiosity Ever your faithful NELSON BRONTE Amazon two P M Yawkins is in great distress his cutter paid off and he like many others very little to live upon He begs his best respects to Sir William He breakfasted here this morning Many very long faces at peace LETTER XXVI MY DEAREST FRIEND Hardy begs you will send the inclosed to Naples I wish Tyson would come home for many are pulling at him and I want to pay him I will not be in his debt forty eight hours after his arrival Hardy is just anchored and his commodore gone on shore Ever your most faithful NELSON BRONTE missus Nelson had better direct her letters to me unless I am on the spot You see you paid postage and it lays me open to their Post Office conversation LETTER XXVII Amazon October nineteenth eighteen oh one MY DEAREST FRIEND What a gale we have had But Admiral Lutwidge s boat came off and as your letter was wrote it got on shore at least I hope so for the boat seemed absolutely swallowed up in the sea None of our boats could have kept above water a moment therefore I could not answer all the truly friendly things you told me in your letters for they were not opened before the boat was gone I am sure you did well to send missus Lutwidge a gown and she loves you very much but there is no accounting for taste She admires entirely red coats you true blue They dine with Billy Pitt to day or rather with mister Long for Pitt does not keep house in appearance although he asked me to come and see him and that I shall do out of respect to a great man although he never did any thing for me or my relations I assure you my dear friend that I had rather read and hear all your little story of a white hen getting into a tree an anecdote of Fatima or hear you call Cupidy Cupidy than any speech I shall hear in parliament because I know although you can adapt your language and manners to a child yet that you can also thunder forth such a torrent of eloquence that corruption and infamy would sink before your voice in however exalted a situation it might be placed Poor Oliver what can be the matter with him I must leave my cot here till my discharge when it shall come to the farm as cots are the best things in the world for our sea friends Why not have the pictures from Davison s and those from Dodd s especially my father s and Davison s A propos Sir William has not sat I fear to Beechey I want a half length the size of my father s and Davison s I wonder your pictures are not come from Hamburg You have not lost the directions for unfolding them nor the measure that I may have frames made for them For up they shall go as soon as they arrive What have your picture and not hang it up No I will submit in the farm to every order but that The weather to day is tolerable but I do not think I could well get on shore but Thursday I hope will be a fine day I shall call on mister Pitt make my visit at the Hospital and get off very early on Friday morning My cold is still very troublesome I cannot get my bowels in order In the night I had not a little fever But never mind the Admiralty will not always be there Every one has their day God bless you my dear friend and believe me ever your s most faithfully NELSON BRONTE Write on Wednesday Your letters of yesterday are received Reverend Doctor would like to be a Bishop I have sent poor Thomson s letter and the distressed missus to the Earl Kindest regards to Sir William LETTER XXVIII Amazon October twentieth eighteen oh one MY DEAREST FRIEND How could you think for a moment that I would be a time server to any Minister on earth And if you had studied my letter a little closer you would have seen that my intention was to shew them that I could be as useful in the cabinet as in the field My idea is to let them see that my attendance is worth soliciting For myself I can have nothing but for my brother something may be done Living with mister Addington a good deal never in your sense of the word shall I do it What leave my dearest friends to dine with a minister Damn me if I do beyond what you yourself shall judge to be necessary Perhaps it may be once and once with the Earl but that you shall judge for me If I give up all intercourse you know enough of Courts that they will do nothing make yourself of consequence to them and they will do what you wish in reason and out of reason I never should ask them It must be a great bore to me to go to the House I shall tell mister Addington that I go on the twenty ninth to please him and not to please myself but more of this subject when we meet doctor Baird is laid up with the rheumatism he will now believe that the cold may affect me This is the coldest place in England most assuredly Troubridge writes me that as the weather is set in fine again he hopes I shall get walks on shore He is I suppose laughing at me but never mind I agree with you in wishing Sir William had a horse Why don t you send to the Duke for a poney for him I am just parting with four of my ships Captains Conn Rowley Martin and Whitter who are proceeding to the Nore in their way to be paid off The surf is still so great on the beach that I could not land dry if it was necessary to day but I hope it will be smooth on Thursday if not I must go in a boat to Dover and come from thence to Deal Sutton says he will get the Amazon under sail and carry me down for that I shall not take cold Bedford goes with a squadron to Margate so that all our party will be broke up I am sure to many of them I feel truly obliged Make my kindest respects to Sir William and believe me ever your most faithful and affectionate NELSON BRONTE I wish Banti was separated from Charles for he is a knowing one I wish I could get him with a good Captain who would keep him strict to his duty Hardy cannot get paid a hundred pounds he advanced for mister Williams s nephew Many thanks for missus Nelson s letters The Reverend Doctor likes going about Only think of his wanting to come up with an address of thanks Why the King will not receive him although he is a Doctor and less for being my brother for they certainly do not like me LETTER XXIX Amazon October twentieth eighteen oh one MY DEAREST FRIEND Only two days more the Admiralty could with any conscience keep me here not that I think they have had any conscience I dare say Master Troubridge is grown fat I know I am grown lean with my complaint which but for their indifference about my health would never have happened or at least I should have got well long ago in a warm room with a good fire and sincere friends I believe I leave this little squadron with sincere regret and with the good wishes of every creature in it How I should laugh to see you my dear friend rowing in a boat the beautiful Emma rowing a one armed Admiral in a boat It will certainly be caricatured Well done farmer s wife I ll bet your turkey against missus Nelson s but Sir William and I will decide Hardy says you may be sure of him and that he has not lost his appetite You will make us rich with your economy I did not think tell Sir William that impudence had got such deep root in Wales I send you the letter as a curiosity and to have the impudence to recommend a midshipman It is not long ago a person from Yorkshire desired me to lend him three hundred pounds as he was going to set up a school Are these people mad or do they take me for quite a fool However I have wisdom enough to laugh at their folly and to be myself your most obliged and faithful friend NELSON BRONTE Best regards to Sir William missus Cadogan and all friends

5567-22441-0021	train-other-500	Only tell missus T that I will write her the first safe opportunity I am not sure of this I shall direct to Merton after June first Therefore as you change make Davison take a direction to Nepean but

none	none	 If I cannot find the Admiral by six o clock we must all go into the Amphion 
5567-22441-0024	train-other-500	and leave the Victory to my great mortification So much for the wisdom of my superiors I keep my letter open to the last for I still hope as I am sure there is no good reason for my not going out in the Victory

5567-22441-0026	train-other-500	MY DEAREST EMMA Although I have wrote letters from various places merely to say Here I am and There I am yet
none	none	 as I have no doubt but that they would all be read 
5567-22441-0027	train-other-500	it was impossible for me to say more than Here I am and well and I see no prospect of any certain mode of conveyance but by sea which
none	none	 with the means the Admiralty 
5567-22441-0028	train-other-500	has given me of small vessels can be but seldom Our passages have been enormously long From Gibraltar to Malta we were eleven days arriving the fifteenth in the evening and sailing
5567-22441-0029	train-other-500	in the night of the sixteenth that is three in the morning of the seventeenth and it was the twenty sixth before we got off Capri
none	none	 where I had ordered the frigate 
5567-22441-0030	train-other-500	which carried mister Elliot to Naples to join me I send you copies of the King and Queen s letters I am vexed that she did not mention you I can only account for it by her s being a political letter
5567-22441-0031	train-other-500	When I wrote to the Queen I said
none	none	 I left Lady Hamilton the eighteenth of May and so attached to your Majesty that I am sure she would lay down her life to preserve your s 
5567-22441-0032	train-other-500	Your Majesty never had a more sincere attached and real friend than your dear Emma You will be sorry to hear that good Sir William did not leave her in such comfortable circumstances as his fortune would have allowed
5567-22441-0033	train-other-500	He has given it amongst his relations But she will do honour to his memory although every one else of his friends call loudly against him on that account
none	none	 I trust my dear Emma she has wrote you 
5567-22441-0034	train-other-500	If she can forget Emma I hope God will forget her But you think that she never will or can Now is her time to shew it
none	none	 You will only shew the King and Queen s letters to some few particular friends 
5567-22441-0035	train-other-500	The King is very low lives mostly at Belvidere mister Elliot had not seen either him or the Queen from the seventeenth the day of his arrival to the twenty first On the next day he was to be presented
5567-22441-0036	train-other-500	I have made up my mind that it is part of the plan of that Corsican Scoundrel to conquer the kingdom of Naples He has marched thirteen thousand men into the kingdom on the Adriatic side and he will take possession
none	none	 with as much shadow of right of Gaeta and Naples 
5567-22441-0037	train-other-500	and if the poor King remonstrates or allows us to secure Sicily
none	none	 he will call it war and declare a conquest 
5567-22441-0038	train-other-500	I have cautioned General Acton not to risk the Royal Family too long but Naples will be conquered sooner or later as it may suit Buonaparte s convenience The Morea and Egypt are likewise in his eye

5567-22441-0042	train-other-500	some say nine sail of the line some seven some five If the former they will come out for we have only the same number including sixty fours and very shortly manned However
none	none	 I hope they will come out and let us settle the matter You know I hate being kept in suspence July eighth

5567-22441-0045	train-other-500	I sincerely hope that mister Booth has settled all your accounts Never mind my dear Emma a few hundred pounds which is all the rigid gripe of the law not justice can wrest from you I thank God that you cannot want
none	none	 although that is no good reason for its being taken from you 
5567-22441-0046	train-other-500	whilst I have sixpence you shall not want for fivepence of it But you have bought your experience that there is no friendship in money concerns and
none	none	 your good sense will make you profit of it I hope the minister has done something for you But never mind we can live upon bread and cheese 
5567-22441-0047	train-other-500	Independence is a blessing and although I have not yet found out the way to get prize money what has been taken has run into our mouths however it must turn out very hard if I cannot get enough to pay off my debts
5567-22441-0048	train-other-500	and that will be no small comfort
none	none	 I have not mentioned my Bronte affairs to Acton as yet 
5567-22441-0049	train-other-500	but if Naples remains much longer I shall ask the question But I expect nothing from them I believe even Acton wishes himself well and safely removed
5567-22441-0050	train-other-500	I think from what I hear that the King s spirits are so much depressed that he will give up the reins of Naples at least to his son and retire to Sicily Sir William you know always thought that he would end his life so
5567-22441-0051	train-other-500	Certainly his situation must be heart breaking Gaetano returned in the frigate I believe he saw enough of Naples He carried his family money and mister Falconet
5567-22441-0052	train-other-500	Gibbs being absent will pay mister Greville s pension to Gaetano s family I have now sent Gaetano to the post and he desires to present his duty and to tell you that mister Ragland

5567-22441-0054	train-other-500	I cannot afford to maintain him therefore I shall give no encouragement Old Antonio was allowed a carline a day that is now not paid Sabatello lives with mister Elliot

none	none	 every thing else in plenty The wages not being raised Gaetano says the poor of England are a million times better off So much for Gaetano s news He desires his duty to Signora Madre and remembrances to Mary Ann Fatima c July eighth We joined this morning the fleet The men in the ships are good but the ships themselves are a little the worse for wear and very short of their complements of men We shall never be better therefore let them come the sooner the better I shall write a line to the Duke that he may see I do not forget my friends and I rely my dearest Emma on your saying every kind thing for me to the Doctor missus Nelson missus Bolton mister and missus Matcham missus Cadogan whose kindness and goodness I shall never forget You will have the goodness to send the inclosed as directed and be assured that I am to the last moment of my life your most attached faithful and affectionate NELSON BRONTE LETTER XXXIII Victory off Toulon August one eighteen oh three I do not know that you will get this letter MY DEAREST EMMA Your letter of May thirty one which came under cover to mister Noble of Naples inclosing Davison s correspondence with Plymouth arrived by the Phoebe two days ago and this is the only scrap of a pen which has been received by any person in the fleet since we sailed from England You will readily conceive my dear Emma the sensations which the sight and reading even your few lines occasioned They cannot be understood but by those of such mutual and truly sincere attachment as your s and mine Although you said little I understood a great deal and most heartily approve of your plan and society for next winter and next spring I hope to be rich enough to begin the alterations at dear Merton It will serve to amuse you and I am sure that I shall admire all your alterations even to planting a gooseberry bush Sutton joined me yesterday and we are all got into the Victory and a few days will put us in order Every body gives a very excellent character of mister Chevalier the servant recommended by mister Davison and I shall certainly live as frugal as my station will admit I have known the pinch and shall endeavour never to know it again I want to send two thousand one hundred pounds to pay off missus Greaves on October first But I have not received one farthing but I hope to receive some soon But mister Haslewood promised to see this matter kept right for me Hardy is now busy hanging up your and Horatia s picture and I trust soon to see the other two safe arrived from the Exhibition I want no others to ornament my cabin I can contemplate them and find new beauties every day and I do not want any body else You will not expect much news from us We see nothing I have great fear that all Naples will fall into the hands of the French and if Acton does not take care Sicily also However I have given my final advice so fully and strongly that let what will happen they cannot blame me Captain Capel says mister Elliot cannot bear Naples I have no doubt but that it is very different to your time The Queen I fancy by the seal has sent a letter to Castelcicala her letter to me is only thanks for my attention to the safety of the kingdom If doctor Scott has time and is able he shall write a copy for you The King is very much retired He would not see the French General saint Cyr who came to Naples to settle the contribution for the payment of the French army The Queen was ordered to give him and the French minister a dinner but the King staid at Belvidere I think he will give it up soon and retire to Sicily if the French will allow him Acton has never dared give mister Elliot or one Englishman a dinner The fleet are ready to come forth but they will not come for the sake of fighting me I have this day made George Elliot post Lieutenant Pettit a master and commander and mister Hindmarsh gunner s son of the Bellerophon who behaved so well this day five year a Lieutenant I reckon to have lost two French seventy fours by my not coming out in the Victory but I hope they will come soon with interest This goes to Gibraltar by Sutton in the Amphion I shall write the Doctor in a day or two I see by the French papers that he has kissed hands With kindest regards to your good mother and all at Merton c c c ever your s most faithfully and affectionately NELSON BRONTE LETTER XXXIV Victory off Toulon August tenth eighteen oh three MY DEAREST EMMA I take the opportunity of mister Acourt s going through Spain with mister Elliot s dispatches for England to send this letter for I would not for the world miss any opportunity of sending you a line By Gibraltar I wrote you as lately as the fourth but all our ways of communicating with England are very uncertain and I believe the Admiralty must have forgot us for not a vessel of any kind or sort has joined us since I left Spithead News I absolutely am ignorant of except that a schooner belonging to me put her nose into Toulon and four frigates popped out and have taken her and a transport loaded with water for the fleet However I hope to have an opportunity very soon of paying them the debt with interest mister Acourt says at Naples they hope that the mediation of Russia will save them but I doubt if Russia will go to war with the French for any kingdom and they poor souls relying on a broken reed will lose Sicily As for getting any thing for Bronte I cannot expect it for the finances of Naples are worse than ever Patienza however I will I see many Bishops are dead Is my brother tired of Canterbury I wish I could make him a Bishop If you see him or write say that I have not ten minutes to send away mister Acourt who cannot be detained I hope Lord saint Vincent has sent out Sir William Bolton As soon as I know who is first Lord I will write him LETTER XXXV MY DEAR LADY HAMILTON Your friend s godson arrived safe yesterday afternoon and I shall you know always feel too happy in obeying your commands for you never ask favours but for your friends In short in every point of view from Ambassatrice to the duties of domestic life I never saw your equal That elegance of manners accomplishments and above all your goodness of heart is unparalleled and only believe for ever and beyond it your faithful and devoted NELSON BRONTE Victory August twenty fourth eighteen oh three LETTER XXXVI N B The Mysterious Letter appears to have been inclosed in this Packet August twenty sixth eighteen oh three Wrote several days past MY DEAREST EMMA By the Canopus Admiral Campbell I have received all your truly kind and affectionate letters from May twentieth to July threed with the exception of one dated May thirty first sent to Naples This is the first communication I have had with England since we sailed All your letters my dear letters are so entertaining and which paint so clearly what you are after that they give me either the greatest pleasure or pain It is the next best thing to being with you I only desire my dearest Emma that you will always believe that Nelson s your own Nelson s Alpha and Omega is Emma I cannot alter my affection and love is beyond even this world Nothing can shake it but yourself and that I will not allow myself to think for a moment is possible I feel that you are the real friend of my bosom and dearer to me than life and that I am the same to you But I will neither have P s nor Q s come near you No not the slice of Single Gloster But if I was to go on it would argue that want of confidence which would be injurious to your honour I rejoice that you have had so pleasant a trip into Norfolk and I hope one day to carry you there by a nearer tie in law but not in love and affection than at present I wish you would never mention that person s name It works up your anger for no useful purpose Her good or bad character of me or thee no one cares about This letter will find you at dear Merton where we shall one day meet and be truly happy I do not think it can be a long war and I believe it will be much shorter than people expect and I shall hope to find the new room built the grounds laid out neatly but not expensively new Piccadilly gates kitchen garden c Only let us have a plan and then all will go on well It will be a great source of amusement to you and Horatia shall plant a tree I dare say she will be very busy missus Nelson or missus Bolton c will be with you and time will pass away till I have the inexpressible happiness of arriving at Merton Even the thought of it vibrates through my nerves for my love for you is as unbounded as the ocean I feel all your good mother s kindness and I trust that we shall turn rich by being economists Spending money to please a pack of people is folly and without thanks I desire that you will say every kind thing from me to her and make her a present of something in my name doctor Scott is gone with my mission to Algiers or I would send you a copy of the King and Queen s letter I send you one from the Queen Both King Queen and Acton were very civil to Sir William Bolton He dined with Acton Bolton does very well in his brig but he has made not a farthing of prize money If I knew where to send him for some he should go but unless we have a Spanish war I shall live here at a great expence although mister Chevalier takes every care and I have great reason to be satisfied I have just asked William who behaves very well whether he chooses to remit any of his wages to his father It does not appear he does at present He is paid by the King eighteen pounds a year as one of my retinue therefore I have nothing to pay I have told him whenever he chooses to send any to tell mister Scott or Captain Hardy and he will receive a remittance bill so he may now act as he pleases A propos of mister Scott He is very much obliged to you for your news of missus Scott s being brought to bed No letters came in the cutter but to me and he was very uneasy He is a very excellent good man and I am very fortunate in having such a one I admire your kindness to my dear sister Bolton I have wrote her that certainly I will assist Tom Bolton at college It is better as I tell her not to promise more than I am sure I can perform It is only doing them a injury I tell her if vacancies please God should happen that my income will be much increased With respect to mister Bolton every body knows that I have no interest nobody cares for me but if he will point out what he wants I will try what can be done But I am sure he will not be half so well off as at present Supposing he could get a place of a few hundreds a year he would be a ten times poorer man than he is at present I could convince you of it in a moment but if I was to begin then it would be said I wanted inclination to render them a service I should like to see Sir H P s book I cannot conceive how a man that is reported to have been so extravagant of government s money to say no worse can make a good story I wrote to the old Duke not long since I regard him but I would not let him touch you for all his money No that would never do I believe mister Bennett s bill to be correct but it was not intended you should pay that out of the allowance for Merton and how could you afford to send missus Bolton a hundred pounds It is impossible out of your income I wish mister Addington would give you five hundred pounds a year then you would be better able to give away than at present But your purse my dear Emma will always be empty your heart is generous beyond your means Your good mother is always sure of my sincerest regard pray tell her so Connor is getting on very well but I cannot ask Captain Capel to rate him that must depend upon the boy s fitness and Capel s kindness I have placed another year s allowance of thirty pounds in Capel s hands and given Connor a present What a story about Oliver and mister Matcham buying an estate in Holstein and to sell out at such a loss I never heard the like I sincerely hope it will answer his expectations it is a fine country but miserably cold How can Tyson be such a fool I sincerely hope he will never want money I am not surprised at Troubridge s abuse but his tongue is no scandal You make me laugh when you imitate the Doctor I am quite delighted with Miss Yonge s goodness and I beg you will make my best respects to her and her good father and assure mister Yonge how much obliged I feel for all his kind attentions to you Those who do that are sure of a warm place in my esteem I have wrote to Dumourier therefore I will only trouble you to say how much I respect him I fancy he must have suffered great distress at Altona However I hope he will now be comfortable for life He is a very clever man and beats our Generals out and out Don t they feel his coming Advise him not to make enemies by shewing he knows more than some of us Envy knows no bounds to its persecution He has seen the world and will be on his guard I put Suckling into a frigate with a very good man who has a schoolmaster he does very well Bulkley will be a most excellent sea officer it is a pity he has not served his time I have answered mister Suckling s letter Gaetano is very well and desires his duty I think sometimes that he wishes to be left at Naples but I am not sure mister Denis s relation has been long in the Victory but if the Admiralty will not promote my lieutenants they must all make a retrograde motion But I hope they will not do such a cruel thing I have had a very affectionate letter from Lord Minto I hope George will be confirmed but the Earl will not answer his application I shall send you some sherry and a cask of paxoretti by the convoy Perhaps it had better go to Merton at once or to Davison s cellar where the wine cooper can draw it off I have two pipes of sherry that is bad but if you like you can send the Doctor a hogshead of that which is coming Davison will pay all the duties Send it entirely free even to the carriage You know doing the thing well is twice doing it for sometimes carriage is more thought of than the prime cost The paxoretti I have given to Davison and ordered one hogshead of sherry to Canterbury and one to dear Merton LETTER XXXVII Victory September tenth eighteen oh three MY DEAREST EMMA What can I send you buffeting the stormy gulph of Lyons nothing but my warmest affection in return for all your goodness to me and mine I have sent to Naples to try and get some shawls from the King s manufactory and have requested mister Falconet to ask his wife to choose some for you and also some fine Venetian chains I only wish my dear Emma that I knew what you would like and I would order them with real pleasure therefore pray tell me We have so very little communication with the Mediterranean world Malta and Toulon are in separate worlds It takes on the average six or seven weeks to get an answer to a letter and in fifteen to twenty days by the French papers which we get from Paris we have news from London not the best side of the question you may be sure but enough to give us an idea of how matters go on I am of opinion that we shall have a peace much sooner than is generally expected and that will be to me the very highest pleasure in this world to return to Merton and your dear beloved society Then I agree with you that I would not give sixpence to call the King my uncle I have wrote again to Gibbs about my Bronte affairs and the copy of a letter to missus Graefer I will send you if I can but you must preserve it for I have no other It may be necessary situated as I am to keep her in good humour for a thousand pounds may be easily sold off the estate and I never the wiser However you will see what I have said I have wrote to mister Elliot about Sabatello What a rascal he must be Gaetano is going to Naples and I shall tell him but of course he would rather favour Sabatello his brother in law than Julia I send you my dearest Emma an hundred pounds which you will dispose of as follows a present for yourself and if you like a trifle to the servants something to the poor of Merton something for missus Cadogan Miss Connor Charlotte c c I only send this as a trifling remembrance from me whose whole soul is at Merton September sixteenth The day after I wrote the former part of this letter mister Scott received from Venice and desired to present to you two very handsome Venetian chains received from Venice This I would not suffer for I allow no one to make my own Emma presents but her Nelson Therefore he will be paid for them but your obligation is not the less to him He is a very worthy excellent modest man and an excellent secretary doctor Scott is at times wrong in the head absolutely too much learning has turned him But we all go on very well I had a letter from Gibbs about Bronte and from Noble which will begin another letter only believe me at all times sides and ends most faithfully your s for ever NELSON BRONTE LETTER XXXVIII September twenty sixth eighteen oh three MY DEAREST EMMA We have had for these fourteen days past nothing but gales of wind and a heavy sea However as our ships have suffered no damage I hope to be able to keep the sea all the winter Nothing but dire necessity shall force me to that out of the way place Malta If I had depended upon that island for supplies for the fleet we must all have been knocked up long ago for Sir Richard Bickerton sailed from Malta the same day I left Portsmouth So that we have been a pretty long cruise and if I had only to look to Malta for supplies our ships companies would have been done for long ago However by management I have got supplies from Spain and also from France but it appears that we are almost shut out from Spain for they begin to be very uncivil to our ships However I suppose by this time something is settled but I never hear from England My last letters are July sixth near three months But as I get French newspapers occasionally we guess how matters are going on I have wrote mister Gibbs again a long history about Bronte and I hope if General Acton will do nothing for me that he will settle something but I know whatever is settled I shall be the loser Till next year the debt will not be paid off how LETTER XXXIX Victory off Toulon October eighteenth eighteen oh three MY DEAREST EMMA Your truly kind and affectionate letters from July seventeenth to August twenty fourth all arrived safe in the Childers the sixth of this month Believe me my beloved Emma that I am truly sensible of all your love and affection which is reciprocal You have from the variety of incidents passing before you much to tell me and besides you have that happy knack of making every thing you write interesting Here I am one day precisely like the other except the difference of a gale of wind or not Since September first we have not had four fine days and if the French do not come out soon I fear some of my ships will cry out You are very good to send me your letters to read missus D is a damned pimping bitch What has she to do with your love She would have pimped for Lord B or Lord L or Captain M N of or any one else She is all vanity fancies herself beautiful witty in short like you She be damned As I wrote you the consulship at Civita Vecchia will not in itself pay their lodgings and the bad air will tip her off There will be no Lord Bristol s table He tore his last will a few hours before his death It is said that it was giving every thing to those devils of Italians about him I wish he may have given missus Denis any thing but I do not think it and as for you my dear Emma as long as I can I don t want any of their gifts As for old Q he may put you into his will or scratch you out as he pleases I care not If mister Addington gives you the pension it is well but do not let it fret you Have you not Merton It is clear the first purchase and my dear Horatia is provided for and I hope one of these days that you will be my own Duchess of Bronte and then a fig for them all I have just had a letter from Gibbs of which I send you a copy You see what interest he is taking about Bronte I begin to think without some assistance like his that I never should have touched a farthing It will be eighteen oh five before I touch the estate Neither principal or interest of the seven thousand ounces have been paid and it is now eight thousand ounces debt You will see Gibbs at last has fixed on sending his daughter home and I shall be glad of so good an opportunity of obliging him as it will naturally tie him to my interest He was a great fool not to have sent the child with you as you wished I am glad to find my dear Emma that you mean to take Horatia home Aye she is like her mother will have her own way or kick up a devil of a dust But you will cure her I am afraid I should spoil her for I am sure I would shoot any one who would hurt her She was always fond of my watch and very probably I might have promised her one indeed I gave her one which cost sixpence But I go no where to get any thing pretty therefore do not think me neglectful I send you Noble s letter therefore I hope you will get your cases in good order they have had some narrow escapes I am glad you liked South End How that Coffin could come over and palaver Rowley Keith c and Coffin to abuse the Earl Now I can tell you that he is the Earl s spy It is Coffin who has injured Sir Andrew Hammond so much and his custom is to abuse the Earl to get people to speak out and then the Earl takes his measures accordingly To me it is nothing Thank God there can be no tales told of my cheating or I hope neglecting my duty Whilst I serve I will serve well and closely when I want rest I will go to Merton You know my dear Emma that I am never well when it blows hard Therefore imagine what a cruize off Toulon is even in summer time we have a hard gale every week and two days heavy swell It would kill you and myself to see you Much less possible to have Charlotte Horatia c on board ship And I that have given orders to carry no women to sea in the Victory to be the first to break them And as to Malta I may never see it unless we have an engagement and perhaps not then for if it is complete I may go home for three months to see you but if you was at Malta I might absolutely miss you by leaving the Mediterranean without warning The other day we had a report the French were out and seen steering to the westward We were as far as Minorca when the alarm proved false Therefore my dearest beloved Emma although I should be the happiest of men to live and die with you yet my chance of seeing you is much more certain by your remaining at Merton than wandering where I may never go and certainly never to stay forty eight hours You cannot I am sure more ardently long to see me than I do to be with you and if the war goes on it is my intention to get leave to spend the next winter in England but I verily believe that long before that time we shall have peace As for living in Italy that is entirely out of the question Nobody cares for us there and if I had Bronte which thank God I shall not it would cost me a fortune to go there and be tormented out of my life I should never settle my affairs there I know my own dear Emma if she will let her reason have fair play will say I am right but she is like Horatia very angry if she cannot have her own way Her Nelson is called upon in the most honourable manner to defend his country Absence to us is equally painful but if I had either stayed at home or neglected my duty abroad would not my Emma have blushed for me She could never have heard of my praises and how the country looks up I am writing my dear Emma to reason the point with you and I am sure you will see it in its true light But I have said my say on this subject and will finish I have received your letter with Lord William s and mister Kemble s about mister Palmer he is also recommended by the Duke of Clarence and he says by desire of the Prince of Wales I have without him twenty six to be made Captains and list every day increasing It is not one whole French fleet that can get through it I shall probably offend many more than I can oblige Such is always the case like the tickets those who get them feel they have a right to them and those who do not get them feel offended for ever But I cannot help it I shall endeavour to do what is right in every situation and some ball may soon close all my accounts with this world of care and vexation But never mind my own dear beloved Emma if you are true to me I care not and approve of all my actions However as you say I approve of them myself therefore probably I am right Poor Reverend mister Scott is I fear in a very bad way His head has been turned by too much learning and the stroke of lightning will never let him be right again The Secretary Scott is a treasure and I am very well mounted Hardy is every thing I could wish or desire Our days pass so much alike that having described one you have them all We now breakfast by candlelight and all retire at eight o clock to bed Naples I fancy is in a very bad way in regard to money They have not or pretend not to have enough to pay their officers and I verily believe if Acton was to give up his place that it would become a province of France Only think of Buonaparte s writing to the Queen to desire her influence to turn out Acton She answered properly at least so says mister Elliot who knows more of Naples than any of us God help him and General Acton has I believe more power than ever By Gibbs s letter I see he has sent over about my accounts at Bronte He can have no interest in being unfriendly to me Why should he I want no great matters from him and he can want nothing from me that it is not my duty to give his Sovereigns therefore why should he be against us For my part my conduct will not alter whether he is or not Our friend Sir Alexander is a very great diplomatic character and even an Admiral must not know what he is negotiating about although you will scarcely believe that the Bey of Tunis sent the man at my desire You shall judge viz The Tunisian Envoy is still here negotiating He is a moderate man and apparently the best disposed of any I ever did business with Could even the oldest diplomatic character be drier I hate such parade of nonsense But I will turn from such stuff You ask me Do you do right to give Charlotte things I shall only say my dear Emma whatever you do in that way I shall always approve I only wish I had more power than I have But somehow my mind was not sharp enough for prize money Lord Keith would have made twenty thousand pounds and I have not made six thousand Poor mister Este how I pity him but what shall I do with him However if he comes I shall shew him all the kindness in my power October twenty twod The vessel is just going off I have not a scrap of news Only be assured of my most affectionate regard Remember me kindly to Charlotte Shall always love those that are good to Horatia I will write her by another opportunity Remember me to missus Cadogan You may be sure I do not forget Charles who has not been well Captain Capel is very good to him I

Letters FROM LADY HAMILTON TO LORD NELSON Letters OF LADY HAMILTON c I Naples June thirtieth seventeen ninety eight DEAR SIR I take the opportunity of Captain Hope to write a few lines to you and thank you for your kind letter by Captain Bowen The Queen was much pleased as I translated it for her and charges me to thank you and say she prays for your honour and safety victory she is sure you will have We have still the regicide minister here Garrat the most impudent insolent dog making the most infamous demands every day and I see plainly the court of Naples must declare war if they mean to save their country Her Majesty sees and feels all you said in your letter to Sir William dated off the Faro di Messina in its true light so does General Acton But alas their First Minister Gallo is a frivolous ignorant self conceited coxcomb that thinks of nothing but his fine embroidered coat ring and snuff box and half Naples thinks him half a Frenchman and God knows if one may judge of what he did in making the peace for the Emperor he must either be very ignorant or not attached to his masters or the cause commune The Queen and Acton cannot bear him and consequently he cannot have much power but still a First Minister although he may be a minister of smoke yet he has always something enough at least to do mischief The Jacobins have all been lately declared innocent after suffering four years imprisonment and I know they all deserved to be hanged long ago and since Garrat has been here and through his insolent letters to Gallo these pretty gentlemen that had planned the death of their Majesties are to be let out on society again In short I am afraid all is lost here and I am grieved to the heart for our dear charming Queen who deserves a better fate I write to you my dear Sir in confidence and in a hurry I hope you will not quit the Mediterranean without taking us We have our leave and every thing ready at a day s notice to go but yet I trust in God and you that we shall destroy those monsters before we go from hence Surely their reign cannot last long If you have any opportunity write to us pray do you do not know how your letters comfort us God bless you my dear dear Sir and believe me ever your most sincerely obliged and attached friend EMMA HAMILTON II Thursday Evening June twelfth seventeen ninety nine I have been with the Queen this evening She is very miserable and says that although the people of Naples are for them in general YET things will not be brought to that state of quietness and subordination till the fleet of Lord Nelson appears off Naples She therefore begs intreats and conjures you my dear Lord if it is possible to arrange matters so as to be able to go to Naples Sir William is writing for General Acton s answer For God s sake consider it and do We will go with you if you will come and fetch us Sir William is ill I am ill it will do us good God bless you Ever ever your s sincerely E HAMILTON Letters FROM THE reverend EDMUND NELSON Lord Nelson s Father TO LADY HAMILTON Letters OF THE reverend EDMUND NELSON c I Madam I am much favoured by your polite letter and the very friendly regard with which Sir William Hamilton and yourself always mention my dear son who is certainly a worthy good brave man parental partiality apart But I myself am by no means satisfied with his present situation as to its importance its safety or its merited rewards It is his to sow but others reap the yellow harvests All things I trust however will work together for good Captain Parker s misfortune I see in every point of view with a friendly concern Langford will quickly be upon his legs Though the amusements of a dirty sea port are not the most refined good health and domestic cheerfulness will be a happy substitute I beg the

painful and can be removed only with much care and caution not venturing without a thick covering both head and feet even to admire your parterres of snow drops which now appear in all their splendour

5567-22447-0010	train-other-500	unless it changes it may be some time first Pray God it may be good when it does arrive I was rather surprised to hear Tom Tit that bad bird had taken his flight to town
5567-22447-0011	train-other-500	but he is a prying little animal and wishes to know every thing and as he is so small and insignificant his movements are not always observed

whose life the fate of the remaining governments in Europe whose system has not been deranged by these devils depends Pray do not let your fascinating Neapolitan dames approach too near him for he is made of flesh and blood and cannot resist their temptations Lady saint Vincent will be transported with your attention to her I have sent the fan mounts for Lady Nelson and her by Sir James Saumarez who after seeing the French prizes safe moored in the Tagus conveys the Duke d Hervie He poor man although a Grandee of Spain having been driven out of that kingdom by the insolent intrigues of Truguet I have obeyed your Ladyship s commands respecting Tom Bowen who is now Captain of L Aquilon and gone to Lisbon to take possession of her and his brother William who married a daughter of Sir William Parker I have appointed to the Caroline the finest frigate I have and he is employed on the most advantageous service for filling his pockets Should your Ladyship have any other protege I

my feelings upon the occasion I have taken up my residence here for some months that I may be ready to afford succour to the detachments of the fleet I have the honour to command in the Levant and

feet I am anxiously desirous to throw myself and as I have relinquished my intention of returning to England although in possession of leave to go I hope the period is not far distant In the meanwhile have the goodness to keep me alive in the remembrance of her Majesty assure her of my profound respect and admiration for her as Queen I dare not give utterance to what I feel for her as one of the first and most lovely of her sex Our possession of the island of Minorca will relieve her Majesty and the government from one embarrassment touching their last treaty with France as Lord Nelson will now be able to refit his squadron without committing an infraction of the treaty Our excellent friend General O Hara is very busy in erecting two rooms for the accommodation of your Ladyship and Sir William when you visit this curious rock He is among the most hospitable and entertaining of men and we live together as all commanders of his Majesty s land forces and fleets ought to do and I hope will do from the examples which have been shewn wherever I have acted with the army as Sir Charles Grey the Governor of this garrison and General Stuart will testify and if the immortal Wolfe could be conjured from the grave he would do so too I hope soon to hear our dear Lord Nelson is quite well under your fostering care and with my warmest wishes for every blessing to be showered down upon you

loyal subject and for your goodness to missus Lock who poor thing merits a more respectable situation than that of Consuless She is certainly a very comely woman and truly amiable The designation Sir William has in contemplation for him will place them in an honourable stile and I have no doubt from the protection they have at home will lead to ministerial character You are very good to my old friend Darby who is a good humoured blundering Irishman and will make you laugh in the midst of the pangs your Ladyship must suffer for the destiny of the delightful city and country to which you have so long contributed a large portion of the gaiety and charming society of Sir William s hospitable mansion for although I had not the good fortune to revisit Naples after Sir William s return all my travelling friends did ample justice to the liberality of the representatives of our Royal Master and Mistress mister Preston was charge when I was at Naples with the Duke of Gloucester and though a worthy gentleman and since a pious Bishop he was certainly a dry comedian Have the goodness to commend me to the Queen continue to nurse my excellent friend Nelson and when I have the happiness to see Sir William and your Ladyship here I will pour the effusions of my heart upon you both The Governor has added two rooms to the convent for your accommodation and missus Grey late Miss Whitbread wife

have the pleasure of seeing you and Sir William Hamilton in England this summer How very much I wished to be near you when you were reading the parliamentary effusions of gratitude and joy for the

flattering attention you have both been pleased to honour me with You must wait a month longer for the warm weather otherwise the transition may be too great for Sir William We are anxiously waiting for the Maltese deputies to return from Palermo The inhabitants are critically situated but I hope all will end well Good news from you will determine it I find that you fascinate all the navy as much at Palermo as you did at Naples If we had many such advocates every body would be a candidate for our profession God bless and protect you and Sir William May prosperous gales attend you May you live

5628-22450-0017	train-other-500	The weather changed so unmercifully yesterday
none	none	 that Lovel and I both grew ill 
5628-22450-0018	train-other-500	and this makes me the more anxious to hear of our too sensible and inestimable Queen My warmest wishes physical political and moral ever attend her B

none	none	 VI 
5628-22450-0022	train-other-500	Yesterday we dined on Mount Vesuvius to day we were to have dined on its victim Pompeii but by the grace of God which passeth all understanding since Bartolomeo himself that weather soothsayer
5628-22450-0023	train-other-500	did not foresee this British weather we are prevented In the mean time all this week and the next

none	none	 VII Wednesday MY DEAREST EMMA The very unexpected intelligence which Prince Augustus has most delicately communicated to me of poor Lord Hervey s decease 
5628-22450-0025	train-other-500	has quite bouleversee my already shattered frame I would not allow your friendly mind to learn an event so interesting to me from any other hand than that of your affectionate and devoted friend BRISTOL
none	none	 VIII MY EVER DEAREST LADY HAMILTON I should certainly have made this Sunday an holy day to me and have taken a Sabbath day s journey to Caserta had not poor mister Lovel been confined to his bed above three days with a fever 
5628-22450-0026	train-other-500	To day it is departed to morrow doctor Nudi has secured us from its resurrection and after to morrow I hope virtue will be its own reward
none	none	 and that my friendship for Lovel will be recompensed with the enjoyment 
5628-22450-0027	train-other-500	This moment I receive your billet doux and
none	none	 very dulcet it is All public and private accounts agree in the immediate prospect of a general peace It will make a delicious foreground in the picture of the new year many of which I wish from the top bottom and centre of my heart to the incomparable Emma quella senza paragona Dans ce moment on m assure que Mayence est prise Je ne vous garantis pas cette maudite nouvelle mais je me flatte que la paix se fait IX EVER DEAREST EMMA I went down to your Opera box two minutes after you left it 
5628-22450-0028	train-other-500	and should have seen you on the morning of your departure but was detained in the arms of Murphy as Lady Eden expressed it and was too late You say nothing of the adorable Queen I hope she has not forgot me
5628-22450-0029	train-other-500	but as Shakespeare says Who doats must doubt and I verily deem her the very best edition of a woman I ever saw I mean of such as are not in folio and are to be had in sheets
5628-22450-0030	train-other-500	I will come on Friday or Saturday but our British colony are so numerous that my duties obstruct my pleasures Ever and invariably dearest dear Emma most affectionately your B You see

5628-22450-0032	train-other-500	Milan twenty fourth November seventeen ninety eight I know not Dearest Emma whether friend Sir William has been able to obtain my passport or not but this I know
none	none	 that if they have refused it they are damned fools for their pains 
5628-22450-0033	train-other-500	for never was a Malta orange better worth squeezing or sucking and if they leave me to die without a tombstone over me to tell the contents tant pis pour eux In the mean time I will frankly confess to you
5628-22450-0034	train-other-500	that my health most seriously and urgently requires the balmy air of dear Naples and the more balmy atmosphere of those I love and who love me and that I shall forego my garret with more regret than most people of my silly rank in society forego a palace or a drawing room
none	none	 But I will augur better things from the justice of my neighbour and that they will not condemn against all rules of probability one of their best friends unheard especially one who if he be heard can say so much My project then in case I receive the passport is to travel on horseback as far as Spalato in Dalmatia 
5628-22450-0035	train-other-500	and from thence cross over to Manfredonia a passage of a few hours and which in the year seventeen seventy two I performed with my horses on board and afterwards had a most delightful jaunt through that unexplored region Dalmatia
none	none	 where the very first object that strikes both the eye and the imagination 
5628-22450-0036	train-other-500	is a modern city built within the precincts of an ancient palace for Spalato stands within the innermost walls of Diocletian s palace For that wise Sovereign quitted the sceptre for the pleasures of an architect s rule
none	none	 and when he had completed his mansion in that delightful climate 
5628-22450-0037	train-other-500	enjoyed that and life to a most advanced old age The world forgetting by the world forgot A propos to Spalato Do not fail hinting to Sir William that a most safe convenient
5628-22450-0038	train-other-500	and expeditious packet boat might be established in these perilous times between that and Manfredonia by which all dispatches and all travellers either for business or pleasure might make a very short and safe cut between Naples and Vienna
5628-22450-0039	train-other-500	and Naples and the rest of Europe without touching one palm of any ground but Austrian and Neapolitan and of course without the risk of being ever stopped The small towns too are in quick succession and the whole country being a limestone rock
5628-22450-0040	train-other-500	the roads will make themselves and afterwards pay themselves by means of good turnpikes Nothing can exceed the dreariness gloominess and humidity of a Milanese sky in winter which I conclude under the old regime
5628-22450-0041	train-other-500	led to all the hospitality and conviviality practised here by their voluptuous but social nobility Now we have nothing left to comfort but another Nudi a son of Esculapius born in Italy
5628-22450-0042	train-other-500	but an enthusiast for England and all that is English an excellent physician but a still better friend and like Nudi when he has a pint of Madeira in his belly and the fumes of it in his brain a most cheerful and improving companion for I protest to you that
5628-22450-0043	train-other-500	during my convalescence I made greater strides to recovery by his Attic evenings than by his morning potions or even his beef broth

concerns according to their influencing the opinion of my real friends Friendship has borne me up in the most difficult times and the general satisfaction which my friends express on my promotion

I twenty fifth of February eighteen hundred DEAR SIR I received your letter by mister Campbell He is lodged with us We find him a pleasant man and shall write fully by him He will tell you a little how we go on as to our domestic happiness We are more united and comfortable than ever in spite of the infamous Jacobin papers jealous of Lord Nelson s glory and Sir William s and mine But we do not mind them Lord N is a truly virtuous and great man and because we have been fagging and ruining our health and sacrificing every comfort in the cause of loyalty our private characters are to be stabbed in the dark First it was said Sir W and Lord N fought then that we played and lost First Sir W and Lord N live like brothers next Lord N never plays and this I give you my word of honour So I beg you will contradict any of these vile reports Not that Sir W and Lord N mind it and I get scolded by the Queen and all of them for having suffered one day s uneasiness Our fleet is off Malta Lord Nelson has taken Le Genereux and was after the frigates so the attempt to relieve Malta has failed I have had a letter from the Emperor of Russia with the Cross of Malta Sir William has sent his Imperial Majesty s letter to Lord Grenville to get me the permission to wear it I have rendered some services to the poor Maltese I got them ten thousand pounds and sent corn when they were in distress The deputies have been lodged in my house I have been their Ambassadress so his I M has rewarded me If the King will give me leave to wear it abroad it is of use to me The Q n is having the order set in diamonds for me but the one the Emperor sent is gold I tell you this little history of it that you may be au fait Ball has it also but I am the first Englishwoman that ever had it Sir W is pleased so I am happy We are coming home and I am miserable to leave my dearest friend the Q She cannot be consoled We have sworn to be back in six months and I will not quit her till Sir William binds himself to come back However I shall have a comfort in seeing some of my old friends and you in particular We have also many things to settle I think I can situate the person you mention about the Court as a Camerist to some of the R F y if her education is good It is a comfortable situation for life so I will bring her out The Q has promised me Let this remain entre nous II April eighteen oh three Lady Hamilton will be glad to know how long mister Greville can permit her to remain in the house in Piccadilly as she must instantly look out for a lodging and therefore it is right for her
