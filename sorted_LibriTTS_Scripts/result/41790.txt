QUINTUS OAKES CHAPTER I The Rescue It was a warm summer evening the air was stifling and still I Rodney Stone attorney at law left my apartment to stroll along Broadway seeking a roof garden wherein to spend a few hours of change from the atmosphere of the pavements and to kill the ennui that comes to all of us whom business compels to accept such circumstances As I walked down a side street I noticed ahead of me a colored man rush out from an apartment house shouting something that I did not understand His actions seemed peculiar for a moment but a curl of smoke from one of the third story windows made known the cause It was fire I found myself among the first to reach the spot From Broadway a crowd was coming such as collects readily under these circumstances I was soon mingling with it watching the police in their endeavors to rouse the tenants and to spread the alarm on all the floors The numerous dwellers were soon rushing out and I saw several deeds deserving of mention As the crowd looked up at the apartment in which the flames were showing and from which smoke was pouring a window was raised evidently in a separate room and a young girl appeared standing at the sill The effort of raising the sash had been a severe one for her for she was not over ten Looking back into the room she saw the smoke filling it and quickly scrambled out on the window frame The engines had not yet arrived but I could hear them shrieking in the distance and we all knew that help was coming Don t jump Don t jump was the cry from us all I advanced instinctively as did many to be nearer for we saw that fear had taken possession of the child and that she seemed about to slide outward and drop to almost certain disaster A tall handsome well built man in the crowd behind us spoke in a voice of confidence and assurance Hold tight little girl You re all right I noticed that he was breathing hard he had just arrived in haste Even as he spoke the little one s head moved from one side to the other and she seemed in distress Then something like an avalanche came from back of me tearing the crowd asunder A hand fell upon my shoulder and I reeled to one side as the tall stranger sprang forward saying She is going to faint Quick wit and quick eye had detected what none other realized that nature was being overcome and that the fall was inevitable The limp little body slid a second then pitched forward A groan went up at what seemed sure death But the stranger s rush was timed to the instant and as the child s body curved head downward in its flight his strong figure reached the spot and his arms caught the child The man braced as they swung downward to his side depositing the unconscious girl in my hands and those of a policeman She did not touch the sidewalk but the young giant came to his knees by the force of the impact It was a marvellous piece of work and the crowd cheered and closed in upon the rescuer and our burden The child was taken away by those who had escaped Then all hands looked at the man and somebody started to speak to him and to ask him his name He turned to me Sorry to have smashed into you that way sir he said I answered saying something about I was glad he did and upon looking up I saw he was gone We watched him and saw him turn into Broadway bound on avoiding further notice Who was he cried many A thick set tough looking character spoke up Oh he s de gazabo wot did the turn on de At this instant a policeman pushed toward us and shoving a club into the fellow s ribs shouted Come now get out o this or I ll The fellow was off and with him our chance of identifying the stranger vanished The police had been too busy with other matters to secure his name Another good act to be credited to an unknown The fire was soon under control and I renewed my walk emerging on Broadway as the shadows of night were coming on and the street was awakening to its characteristic summer life Suddenly I saw him the identical man walking across the thoroughfare I quickened my pace although going rapidly at the time It was my intention to get closer to him and notice him better as I was interested He turned up town and I saw that although he was walking easily his pace was quicker than mine What impressed me more than anything else was his graceful carriage and the fine cut of his clothes He was dressed in a dark suit without waistcoat and one of those soft white summer shirts which have become popular of late years On his head was a plain but expensive Panama As he passed up the street ahead of me gaining all the while with his easy stride he saluted a few gentlemen and the policemen seemed to know him He evidently was a striking figure to other eyes than mine for I noticed several men stop and half turn to look after him a thing that one sees on Broadway but seldom He turned into a side street and again I lost him I fancied he disappeared into one of the bachelor apartment houses of that section During the rest of the evening I regretted not having made stronger efforts to learn his name then I laughed at myself for being so impressed by a stranger s appearance The fact was that the man s action and personality had affected me so strongly that for days I frequently found myself thinking of the fire and the rescue I often looked along the street when walking in a vague hope of seeing the handsome clear cut face of the man who had acted so promptly but so unostentatiously Little did I then know how great a factor that man was to be in the moulding of my future how circumstances were shaping to link his active nature with my career and to lead me into one of the most peculiar experiences that ever came to any one Over a month passed and the first signs of fall were upon us The streets were assuming the appearance of activity and familiar faces reappeared in the public places all invigorated and refreshed by the summer s outings Early in October I found myself with my friend doctor Moore a well known physician standing in one of the popular theatres We had dropped in for one act or so and like many others were unable to secure seats owing to the hour and the popularity of the play At first engrossed with the performance we paid no attention to the audience but when the act closed and the lights were turned up we glanced around as we prepared to leave for a stroll My attention was called to some ladies in one of the lower boxes two fair haired and strikingly attractive young women and an older one evidently a relative for there was a resemblance in features that was noticeable The younger ones were certainly sisters their similarity of complexion face and figure rendered such an assumption a certainty My friend noticed them and a change came over his face he began to beam as one does who has seen a friend We were far off and in a position where we could admire without impoliteness Those are charming ladies I said You seem to know them Moore Yes I have not seen them for quite a while they are old patients of mine Do you see any one with them If I mistake not he is somewhere in the box continued Moore He Who As I spoke I noticed a gentleman a tall clear cut fellow lean forward and speak to one of the sisters As he moved his face came full in the light and I recognized him It s he I cried I ve found him at last Found whom exclaimed Moore Him that man Great Scott said Moore you must be sick What ails you anyway Have you been dining at the Club I turned to my friend and said Doctor I ve found him at last that man in the box Well did not I tell you he ought to be there said Moore Because you found him do you think you have accomplished a wonderful piece of work Of course he was there What do you mean Whom are you talking about anyway I asked Doctor Moore looked at me as though wondering if I were in my right mind then said Stone I am talking about the gentleman in the box I said he should be there he usually is with those ladies Yes I replied it is he Stone what s the matter Come and take something old man and seizing me by the arm my companion led me away to the nearest cafe where he watched me closely as he poured out a bracer I seized it and said Here s to the man in the box I ve found him Of course you found him old man I don t see what you are making such a fuss over that fact for it s not a question of priority No I said it s a question of identity Explain Well I want to know who he is He has worried my mind for a month Oh is that all and Moore heaved a sigh of relief he had been genuinely anxious about me that was plain Have you run up against him anywhere he asked No he ran up against me I answered Here sit down said Moore What in heaven s name has got into you Nothing Only I desire to know that man s name I have had an experience with him Indeed You re not the first then have you been up to anything shady Stone said Moore laughingly No only smoky a fire This man saved a child s life in a magnificent manner What s his name Oh I see His name is Oakes You should know that He left college just a year or so after you and I entered Don t you remember the fellow who saved those boys from drowning in the harbor that day You don t tell me Is that Quintus Oakes I never met him but of course I knew him everybody at college did after that Yes that s the same fellow Well I certainly did not recognize his face Only saw it a moment but there was something about him that seemed familiar that walk of his I remember it now As the memories of youth crowded upon me I recalled him well and realized that the years had filled out his figure and face but it was the same man the same walk and carriage I had seen them hundreds of times The quick easy stride erect figure and commanding bearing that had marked him so in his youth were as noticeable now in his full manhood as in those years of the long ago My companion and I did not return for the last act of the play but strolled out in the street where I told him of the episode of the fire and the part that Oakes had played in it His actions both at the time and afterwards when he tried to avoid notice are characteristic said Moore He is reputed as doing things vigorously and opportunely His presence of mind is marvellous I am told You remember he had that gift years back in college Now it seems to have developed greatly until everybody who knows him well speaks of it Are you well acquainted with him You seem to know all about him Yes indeed answered my friend I met him one night several years back and I became so attracted to him that I cultivated his acquaintance wherever possible Then you will understand how I was glad to identify him was my rejoinder Yes indeed if you like you can easily manage to meet him I expressed my earnest desire and doctor Moore promised to arrange it so that we could meet some evening at the Club By the way said my companion he is probably the best informed all round man you have ever met He did not cease learning at college Lucky for him I exclaimed laughingly Well don t be surprised if he starts in to discuss law with you and holds you up at your own profession he is a surprise party sometimes All right but what is his business Moore looked at me and said He is one of the most original detectives in the country Oh a detective Along what lines He surely is no ordinary one at that business No He used to work alone on unusual occurrences but his success was so great that now he has a large number of subordinates who do the ordinary details and he limits his work to the important points on select cases He is not heard of much and is seen very little but his work is in great demand I was interested and asked if he had ever done any special work of prominence Yes said Moore He solved the matter of the Red Rose of Trieste Do you remember hearing of that I exclaimed in amazement He Is he the man who solved that affair You must be mistaken That occurred or began in Europe Exactly said Moore Quintus Oakes works there as well as here He speaks German French Italian and perhaps more languages fluently and can secure evidence anywhere He has travelled over the world several times One year he was away ten months on a case and secured the necessary evidence for conviction in Sydney I see He is something decidedly out of the ordinary as his appearance suggests He is on a new case just now and he has promised to let me go if I want to It s a very short affair and perhaps I will take a vacation that way I have not been away yet this year continued Moore We now parted for the evening and as he started to go I called out after him Say Moore get me into it if it s exciting I have had no vacation yet myself Introduce me to mister Oakes as soon as you can anyway All right I ll arrange for a night at the Club provided Oakes is not too busy I returned to my rooms little knowing how things were shaping from an entirely independent direction to throw me willingly I confess for a few brief weeks into a vortex of turmoil to fight through it side by side with my friend Moore and vigorous cool quick witted Quintus Oakes CHAPTER II Quintus Oakes at Home It was therefore a great deal in the nature of a surprise when a few days after parting with Moore I received a note at my apartments by messenger requesting me to call on mister Quintus Oakes that evening on professional business It was written in a brisk courteous style but made no mention of doctor Moore Was it possible that I was to meet Oakes through other channels I realized that my profession of the law might give many opportunities for such an interview with him so I ceased to wonder and started up Broadway just before the hour appointed I turned into the long dimly lighted side street near Long Acre Square and found that the number designated was a bachelor apartment house It was where I had lost him the day of the fire Taking the elevator to the third floor I was directed to the door and admitted by a Japanese servant a bright eyed fellow of about twenty He was dressed in our fashion and spoke English well the kind of a chap that one sees not infrequently nowadays in the service of men who have seen the world know how to live and how to choose for personal comfort It was evident that I was expected for I was at once led into the front room and there met by Oakes himself The instant he saw me a look of recognition and mild surprise came over his face and as he shook hands he said We have met before at the fire the other day mister Stone Won t you please step into my sanctum We can be more comfortable there He led me through a short hall into a large airy room furnished as half lounging room half office There was a large flat top mahogany desk in the centre with a sofa and several upholstered chairs evidently for use as well as ornament On the walls were pictures of value views of foreign places and oil paintings that a mere novice could see were works of art There was that in the room which suggested education and refinement A telephone was on the desk and loose papers partly written upon bore evidence that the detective had been busy at work when I arrived At a motion from my host I seated myself in one of the large arm chairs facing him while he remained standing I saw that he was a man about thirty eight or forty years old straight as an arrow and splendidly proportioned He was dressed in a well fitting gray suit The light was from above and Oakes s face showed well the clear cut nose and generous mouth of the energetic American He looked at me critically with deep set steady blue eyes then smiled slightly in a well controlled dignified manner mister Stone I am very glad that you were able to come tonight Make yourself at home he said I made an appropriate answer of some kind and then Oakes took the seat near me and began without further ceremony I have arranged that our friend doctor Moore shall come here this evening meanwhile I will inform you briefly of the subject in hand A few months ago Mandel Sturgeon the attorneys whom you doubtless know consulted me regarding the unpleasant happenings at the mansion of one Odell Mark up State in the town of Mona Now Mandel Sturgeon suggested also that you might care to help unravel the matter acting as their legal representative I have completed my arrangements for starting on the case and am particularly glad to find that you are a friend of doctor Moore and that you had expressed to him a desire to enter into some such affair I assure you however that Mandel Sturgeon had previously spoken of you and that this offer was coming as a business proposition The fact that you and doctor Moore had spoken of such a trip is merely a coincidence He spoke with a well modulated voice and a fluency that told of the intelligence of the man His eyes fixed me but not in an embarrassing manner it was the habit of observation that prompted their concentration that was obvious His forehead was high and slightly furrowed with two vertical wrinkles between the eyebrows His face was mobile and expressive at times then suddenly calm In my very brief observation I knew that he was able to govern its expression well In the days that were coming I learned that in the presence of danger or possible trickery that face became stony and immovable a mask that talked and commanded while hiding the suppressed energy of the man The bell rang before Oakes could proceed with his statement and doctor Moore was shown in His coming enlivened us both and after a few words of greeting I found the opportunity and said mister Oakes it is not exactly clear to me why Mandel Sturgeon recommended me as their representative They have so many men in their office whom they might use in that capacity Doubtless you will hear from them yourself before we go mister Stone Meantime I may explain You were in their employ at one time I believe Yes a great many years ago They think that some legal matters might arise where a man on the spot would be of value and it seems best that their representative with me should be one not easily identified as working with them You know mister Stone we are not advertising our mission I have been in Mona as mister Clark their agent looking after the Mansion and other property and if I return there it must be under some business pretext or people will suspect me You being an independent party not known as connected with the firm in any way can accompany me in the role of a friend on an outing or as a possible purchaser You see we are trying to solve a mystery so the less attention we attract the better I see So you have been there already mister Oakes Yes gentlemen I will tell you about this affair very briefly now You will learn more later if you enter upon its solution with me The Mansion was originally the property of George Mark who died some years ago leaving it to his two sons Winthrop and Odell Both were single men at that time but Odell married a couple of years ago and persuaded his brother to sell his share of the property to him Winthrop who was the older did not care to part with it but finally disposed of his interest to his brother who immediately moved into the place with his bride The old servants were still in charge and everything had been kept up to a high standard of excellence although no one had lived there since the old man died Odell had travelled some and lived mostly in the city while Winthrop had been engrossed in amassing a large fortune in speculation He had resided in Mona keeping his own place saying he did not care for the Mansion as a home after his father died Then why did he not care to give up his interest to his brother asked Moore That is as yet a mystery But as he was a great business man it is supposed by some that he saw opportunities to convert the vast grounds into town lots and sell at a great advance some day when Mona should boom as the town will sooner or later owing to its natural advantages He told many however that it was merely a sentiment with him the place having belonged in Colonial times to the family Be that as it may however he finally sold and never would buy it back again even after the mystery had made it practically valueless His brother offered to sell it back for next to nothing but Winthrop only laughed and refused This conduct seemed to dispose of the supposition that he was in any way responsible for the occurrences there which had such a depressing effect in the value of the property Then if mixed up he had a deeper motive said I Yes if he has really been involved in the mystery at all You must remember however said Oakes that his story may be true Having disposed of his share of the property he may have seen no reason for bothering with it again at least until it was clear of the depressing occurrences which had lowered its value from half a million to practically nothing Goodness What were these mysteries said Moore with a feigned shudder Evidently they are unpopular Oakes proceeded slowly They consist of a series of assaults on those who have occupied the house and they are conducted in such a way that detection has been impossible One evening missus Mark was heard to shriek in her bedroom and when found by her husband was insane from fright In her ravings she spoke of a terrible thing choking her and of a swishing sound She never regained her reason and is now in an insane asylum Alienists at first thought that she had an experience common to those going mad that she had been subject to a delusion But evidences were against this as she had in no way shown any signs of mental trouble before While she was being cared for at the Mansion the two nurses in charge had similar experiences They reported hearing a tread on the stairs one night and of seeing a figure disappear into the dining room One stated up and down that it was a woman The patient was removed from the place Then mister Odell Mark received such a scare one night that he packed up and left the Mansion for good He was assaulted by an invisible party from behind and only escaped after a severe struggle Whoever or whatever assaulted him disappeared in an instant and he swore that he heard the closing of a door somewhere downstairs Everything was done to keep the truth quiet but of course it leaked out and the place has been regarded as haunted ever since The servants left save a few of the oldest who live away from the Mansion under a separate roof and have never seen anything unusual That sounds very thrilling I said but the affair may all be founded on nervous dread and hysteria So I thought said Oakes I went up there alone recently however and am glad to say that I got back alive What Did you see it No gentlemen I did not There was nothing to see but I learned enough to know that murder stalks there in the Mansion that the mystery is a deep one and my conduct nearly cost me my life I have faced danger often but I never faced an invisible violence or had such a fight for my life as I had at the Mansion about three weeks ago Quintus Oakes was speaking earnestly and we both were deeply interested That the celebrated detective should have met such an experience placed the tale outside the realm of fiction He was a calm man used to facing danger and not one to be easily deceived or frightened Great Scott said Moore you must have had a fine time Tell us about it It must have been what the boys call a lalapazooza of a time I had to smile at my friend able and successful and already a professional man of reputation but ever fond of an occasional slang expression as a relief from the care with which he was usually burdened He was well to do but had been no idler and knew the meaning of hard work Yes said Oakes I had a fine time At this moment the telephone on the desk rang and Oakes reached forward and placed the receiver to his ear After a few words of business he replaced it but I felt a curious sensation of something missing something unusual His hand had shot forward toward the hook and deposited the receiver thereon in one quick instantaneous movement The action had been so exact that the contact had given rise to no sound save the after tinkle of the bell Moore noticed it too and looked at me as much as to say How was that for measuring distance Then Oakes wheeled so as to face us again Excuse me for the interruption Now I will tell you my story in a few words CHAPTER III Oakes s Experience Oakes began Mandel Sturgeon gave me a letter to the chief care taker Cook and I went to Mona as Clark their agent giving as an excuse for my presence there that mister Odell Mark contemplated making radical alterations in the Mansion before returning to it Cook and his wife opened that portion of the Mansion which I thought best adapted for my temporary residence about half of the place I should say I spent a few quiet days looking around the estate and the house I was always on guard however lest I appear too inquisitive and thereby betray my true mission There was an old maid servant Annie by name and several gardeners about These latter I found were never admitted to the Mansion My meals were served in the dining room and this room was the one in which I spent most of my time The servants gave me but little information regarding the mysterious doings that had so frightened their employers I could tell by their action that they were genuinely afraid to be alone in the place and they all cautioned me repeatedly They seemed anxious that the affair should be investigated and said that mister Odell should have had detectives at work on the mystery It was evident they were afraid that they would lose their positions if no one returned to live at the Mansion soon I noticed a strong under current of contempt for mister Odell they seemed to think he was a cowardly fellow none too anxious to remain or he would have investigated the affair In fact they behaved sometimes as though they thought that he might have been at the bottom of the mystery Occasionally Cook and his wife and Annie had stayed in the Mansion cleaning up and had never seen anything unusual Nothing had occurred since mister Odell Mark had left which certainly was peculiar I could see that my true identity was not suspected My presence seemed to have inspired confidence in them all I called Cook and his wife or Annie into my rooms for a talk quite frequently Nothing happened and I began to feel that there was exaggeration somewhere but nevertheless I moved with caution and slept in the back room over the dining room with the doors carefully locked I insisted that mister and missus Cook sleep in the front room The servants at first demurred but finally consented when I told them that if they did not do so I would not remain and would report unfavorably as regards the remodeling of the Mansion I noticed that they bolted their doors carefully every night and kept a light burning in their room This I knew as its rays shone through under their door into the hall This satisfied me that they were on guard and afraid and consequently unaware of the real nature of the mystery Late one night after about a week I was looking out of one of the windows in the dining room watching a boat passing The lights upon her and the throbbing of her engines half a mile away were plunging me into a reverie when suddenly I felt a peculiar sensation of uneasiness I glanced along the porch and at the windows everything seemed all right I turned and saw Annie some distance up the hall attending to a lamp at the foot of the stairs The afternoon paper lay on the table I walked over to it and picked it up stationing myself a few feet away from the hall door where I commanded a view of the entire room the windows and the balcony I heard or fancied I heard a step or shuffle and then instantly something closed around my throat and I was pulled backward and downward I heard a rush in the hall and saw Annie s terrified face looking into the room but she did not see me I tried to cry out for help but was unable to raise my voice Realizing that I was being killed without aid I struggled with all my power I have an indistinct recollection of a shriek in the hall then a rustling sound as of garments near me The next I knew Annie Cook and his wife with two gardeners were working over me One of the gardeners had opened my shirt and thrown water upon my throat I was unconscious for some minutes they said but when I recovered my senses I ordered all hands to keep their mouths closed under pain of instant dismissal Inquiries instituted by me revealed that Annie had first heard my struggles and the shriek that had been given was hers Response had been quick but when Cook first entered the room backed up by the wife and old Annie I was lying limp and unconscious face downward on the floor as though I had been thrown violently forward The recital of this narrative had been given in a quiet dignified manner one of absolute conviction It was an impartial statement of fact and we were profoundly impressed doctor Moore turned to me and said Well do you feel like joining us Ah Then you are in this too I exclaimed Yes mister Oakes is going to let me have my vacation in his company I certainly shall go I said it appears to me that this matter is a serious one It is very serious Oakes repeated There is a deep mystery at the Mansion and its solution may be a dangerous one There is murder in that method of attack and terrible strength behind it What is it A man asked Moore That is conjecture as yet said Oakes I certainly beard the sound made by a woman s skirts or something of that sort but the strength was too great for most women hereabouts Yes if you were overcome by it I remarked The servants are firmly convinced that the whole business is supernatural That is hardly worth discussing I have no doubt that you two gentlemen as possible purchasers of the Mansion will have opportunities to settle the question for yourselves There was just the shadow of a smile on Oakes s face as he spoke Did you notice anything peculiar about the people at the Mansion the care takers I asked No I thought their actions were natural especially when I was assaulted One of the gardeners who did not do very much to help me seemed preoccupied and made advances for a better acquaintance before I left I think he will bear watching closely he knows something How long did you remain at the Mansion after the assault Only a few days said Oakes I could learn nothing alone It was too dangerous When we return it will be in greater numbers If our mission is suspected we will be obliged to work through other channels but I think we can fool the care takers they will say nothing to you about the mystery and they will think that I am more anxious than ever to dispose of the place Should our work be suspected however continued the detective we will be face to face with complications We may have to be reenforced by men from my agency but they will probably not be known even to you The reward for the solution of this mystery is a large one and the prosperity of the town depends upon it This matter at the Mansion has not only affected its own value as I said but has helped greatly to depreciate the worth of the surrounding properties Then turning to Moore I think your professional knowledge may come in handy in several ways so you may consider that your time will be well paid for and your vacation a profitable one that is of course if you return alive This was so seriously said as to cause me a momentary feeling of discomfort We now discussed details and arrangements for our start for we had decided to go Oakes and I were to leave first while Doctor Moore was to come a few days later owing to his inability to get away at once Having finished with his story and the necessary details of instruction Oakes changed his manner and offered us cigars The Jap brought in a few glasses and a bottle which opened up the social side of our interview Noticing that our host had not lighted a cigar I ventured the remark that he was not a heavy smoker No said he I very rarely use tobacco during business it is a peculiarity of mine I am told His face was quite smiling now He continued With some it acts as a concentrator of ideas at least so claim its devotees With me it dissipates them I use it simply as a pleasure when work is done While he spoke I was again impressed with that peculiar celerity of movement in small actions which I had noticed before He passed the cigars in an ordinary deliberate manner conversing the while but when he reached for a match I was amazed at the lightning like rapidity of the movement His hand shot out selected it from the stand on the table lighted it and the cigar and returned the burned stick to the tray with a rapidity and evenness which made of it almost a continuous act It reminded me forcibly of the movement with the telephone receiver I felt that given the necessity and the occasion his general action would be roused to quickness of the same kind sure and instantaneous He impressed me as a man with a tremendous reserve of strength and vitality When we left for the evening Oakes shook my hand with a stout firm grasp the kind that means friendliness and inspires confidence When outside I asked of my companion what he privately thought of the affair at the Mark Mansion There is something extraordinary there surely answered the physician Knowing Oakes as I do Stone I am fully convinced that he is deeply worried over the matter He would never think of having us in such an affair unless he desired our company He is as brave as any man his record shows that but he is also noted for caution He sees or thinks he sees a dangerous game here a plot perhaps where our presence will be a support He has often told me in conversation that he regards the legal and medical minds as particularly adapted to pass judgment on certain problems of a peculiar nature He has an idea that our training will perhaps help him in the matter I think With this remark we parted at Broadway and Forty second Street and went to our respective homes CHAPTER IV The Departure Next morning while at breakfast I received a letter from Mandel Sturgeon which was satisfactory to me and I went down to my office and notified my partner Hart that I was about to take a vacation Fortunately we had just successfully finished a long legal fight in the courts and my excuse was a natural one I then went out and bought a good revolver such as Oakes had told me to get when we discussed details the night before He had insisted upon our being armed all alike and furnished with the same kind of cartridges We could then exchange weapons in an emergency and still be supplied with ammunition Having completed my purchase I went to the Club where Oakes was awaiting me We lunched together and during the conversation he told me to express my baggage to the Mansion that afternoon and to meet him at the Central Station at eight o clock P M And be cautious in your movements he said Here is your ticket Wear serviceable clothes and a heavy dark overcoat such as you had on last night with a black Fedora hat Don t notice me but enter the same car as I do on the train I will contrive to be with you before we arrive at our destination Why all this I asked Well I wish to be able to identify you easily in a crowd If I know how you are dressed it might be valuable in several other ways also We may have to change our plans in which event it will be easier for me if I know how you look I do not exactly understand said I but I presume you do Precisely You may learn in time As we emerged from the Club a newsboy came up to Oakes from whom he bought a paper and as he did so the boy said Martin says you are followed sir Oakes turned to me Meet me as I said and do as I do afterwards in everything I shall be forced to change my plans The boy had gone after another customer and Oakes continued Martin is my aide he has posted me Good by See you later Explain some other time We parted and I went about my preparations for departure with that exhilaration that men feel when about to enter into some strange undertaking It was to be a novel experience for me and I frankly confess that certain misgivings haunted me That I was entering willingly to be sure upon a journey of many possibilities I did not for one moment doubt that I should need the weapon already purchased and the utmost coolness that I could muster seemed to me more than likely At this date I felt nothing akin to fear and the knowledge that Quintus Oakes was to be our leader prevented a too serious estimate of the possible consequences Later on I did feel some regrets at having hurled myself into the episodes that followed but this feeling vanished soon in the excitement of the events that transpired at Mona Shortly before the appointed time I arrived at the station and strolled about the rotunda in search of Oakes I espied him at the paper stand dressed in a dark heavy overcoat and a hat like mine His recognition of me was instantaneous but he made no movement until after buying a paper he walked past me to the door Looking at me with a glance that warned me he stepped out and into a car that was approaching I jumped on the same car and in a very few moments he and I were going up the Sixth Avenue Elevated stairway but acting as strangers to one another There were many persons boarding the Harlem train with us It was a tiresome ride to the terminus but when Oakes and I stepped out and down to the street he jumped into a carriage in waiting drawn by a pair of horses and beckoned to me I stepped in also and sat by his side on the back seat The driver started at a quick pace across the bridge and into Jerome Avenue Oakes turned to me It seems that my movements are watched by men in a rival agency I have detected no followers but time will tell if they exist I saw a fellow watching me at the station and we may have easily been followed on the elevated train in such a crowd one cannot detect Why do they watch you mister Oakes Are they suspicious that we are going to Mona No not at all answered Oakes They are watching to see where I am going You see he continued I am working on several other cases and perhaps they are too You realize there are times when men of my profession cross each other s paths and it is advantageous to know what the other fellow is doing I see Keeping tab on one another I said Rather expensive work is it not Oakes smiled Yes but it is business I like to know when a rival leaves town I keep a pretty close watch myself on some of them We drove rapidly and soon pulled up at an out of the way roadhouse Come said Oakes alighting A portly German was behind the bar evidently the proprietor Oakes made a sudden movement of his hand and the door was locked We two were then shown into a rear room where two other men were seated both tall well built fellows and both dressed as we were in dark overcoats and black Fedora hats They saluted Oakes and after a word or two stepped into the bar room where the German served them with drinks In a minute they were in our carriage and driving away toward Yonkers I see now why you were particular as to my dress Yes a substitution like this is useful sometimes I thought I might be forced to make one Much better than nonsensical disguises We will soon know if any one is coming after us he continued This is really the last place before the fork of the road and anyone following us would have to be in sight all the time or else stop here for information The proprietor motioned us upstairs to a front room and Oakes said to him Remember we have gone to Yonkers But the good natured German evidently knew his business for he only smiled and went off muttering something to himself about a damned good mix up In a few minutes two men drew up in a buggy and were admitted below by the obsequious old fellow Then we heard the question Have you seen two tall gentlemen in black coats and soft hats hereabouts Dutchy The German thought a moment Yah yah dare vas two big fellers just here dey vas took some viskey and got away quick Which way asked the men Dey vas gone up dar Yonkers Road Oakes chuckled The old fellow is all right an old friend of mine Then we heard the men say Here Dutchy here s something for you and we knew they had given him a tip In a moment they were gone and the old fellow was to be heard chuckling audibly to himself Five dollar for von great big mix up Oakes watched the team turn up the Yonkers Road after our decoy and then he said Come Stone move quickly He led the way downstairs to the back entrance and to the stable where we found a man with a team He saluted us It was the carriage in which Oakes s men had come out Drive hard for the Harlem Station we can catch the ten thirty train was the order Our driver evidently knew what to do and we soon passed out of the carriage way At the side of the door we halted a moment and I saw Oakes give the German a twenty dollar bill Remember he said not a word We caught our train after a long drive to the east and back over the Harlem River When we seated ourselves in the sleeper Oakes turned to me quietly Please remember Stone that you are a possible buyer and that I am Charles Clark agent for the owner of the Mark Mansion We have had a pleasant evening together so far have we not He smiled in his quiet unruffled manner as he spoke Yes rather active I said I presume those other fellows are thinking so too probably Only the last two said Oakes my men are home by this time Shortly after midnight we arrived at the station at the foot of the hill which hid the beautiful town of Mona Keep your senses alert said Oakes as we left the train for we are now in the region of uncertainty We had better not walk to the hotel although it is only about a mile The hour is too late The solitary hackman seeing us approach roused himself from his sleepy lethargy and soon we were slowly ascending the hill The well kept road was lighted here and there by electricity an agreeable witness to the civilization around us I saw Oakes place his weapon in his outside overcoat pocket as he said the most convenient place for it to rest clad as we were The action was a vivid reminder of the experiences of his last visit and of the caution of the man Without further adventure of any kind we arrived at the little hotel with its sleepy night clerk and its gloomy office This opened right on the sidewalk by means of a large wooden door hung a low step above the pavement and fitting so poorly in its frame that the rays of the light from within sought exit beneath it CHAPTER V The Letter While Oakes and I were in the first stages of our journey doctor Moore stood in his back office at the close of business hours wondering if the adventure that Oakes had so well described to us could in any way have been originated by other than physical forces Moore was a deep student of mental phenomena He had on more than one occasion heard histories of terrible tragedies so real in their wording that the picture conveyed was the practical guarantee of their origin at human hands but nevertheless these histories had been proved to be but the imaginings of a diseased mind products of a delusion In every other respect the narrators had been in appearance at least perfectly sane individuals While he hesitated to think that Oakes might have been suffering from an overworked brain at the time still he knew that it was not impossible The struggles that the servants had heard had been those of Oakes the actual evidences so far of assault were vague Oakes was in a partially unconscious condition to be sure but what evidence of violence was that Moore s cool professional judgment told him that queer sensations are common after a severe shock whether delusional in origin or not He had known Oakes for years and the good judgment and coolness that he had always shown spoke greatly against a recently developed mental disorder Still Moore was uneasy he longed for more evidence of physical force from without something more positive Of course Oakes was not alone in his experience there had been others but it was possible that the mere contagion of terror might be in part responsible for some of these There had been no witnesses The statement of violence rested on the word of the victims alone doctor Moore knew that men thinking constantly of the same thing to the exclusion of all else might develop similar delusions The physician had seen many strange things and was not a man to be easily deceived Could it be that Quintus Oakes was the victim of a mental process It was this very power which Moore possessed of thinking along such lines that made him in Oakes s opinion a particularly desirable addition to the party Little however did the detective imagine that the trained mind of the physician would first weigh the possibilities of Oakes s own mental instability While Moore was deep in thought he was suddenly interrupted by the bell and the receipt of a note which had been delivered by the postman He glanced at the postmark and saw that it was from Station O and was mailed at four thirty Somehow he felt an instinctive dread of its contents Of course he as yet had no adequate cause for misgivings but there was that in the subject of which he had been thinking that seemed to forecast evil and dread His mind was in a state of unrest at the very thought of the possibilities He tore the letter open and read DEAR doctor MOORE You may not deem it wise to pay attention to an anonymous communication but let me assure you that if you value a life you will pay attention in this case It has come within my province to know that a great tragedy may be averted by you Some short while ago a man tall straight as an arrow and with blue eyes went to the town of Mona and stopped at the Mansion There he came near being murdered and if he ever goes back I personally know that he will be killed in short order His business was said to be that of an agent for the owners I saw him in New York several years ago and he was pointed out to me as a celebrated detective but I cannot remember his name or that of the person who informed me At Mona he was known by another name I cannot go there however or learn any more particulars The reason I address this to you is that I know that you are acquainted with him as years ago I used to see him often in your company Now please communicate with this man you are the only thread that I have to his identity Reach him if possible at once Warn him Tell him to turn back to abandon his quest for death to him is the only alternative Do not attempt to trace my identity Act and act quickly if you wish to prevent a great horror The letter terminated abruptly doctor Moore realized in an instant that Oakes s movements were known to some outsider already someone who had either been in Manhattan that day or who had sent the letter there to one who had mailed it He saw the whole matter in a most serious light Oakes was in danger from forces he did not suspect perhaps and the assault he had described had been known to others besides the immediate household of servants For who of that household could have written such a letter Moore thought of his plans gone astray of his business engagements but they all paled into insignificance in the face of the danger to Oakes He decided to follow up Oakes by the very next train Finding he had time for one or two calls he rushed in his carriage to make them and as he entered his office upon his return he found an energetic young man awaiting him He knew him as Martin one of Oakes s aides Good evening Doctor You re on the rush tonight My but I had to hustle Good evening But how did you know so much of my movements how why did you have to hustle I just arrived here a few seconds ago I have been watching you this evening mister Oakes told me to take care of you and keep you out of mischief You see he feared trouble of some kind I was told to report to you once in a while and here I am The physician understood and then they discussed the recent development It was agreed that doctor Moore should leave for Mona and this after arranging his business by telephone and hastily making ready he succeeded in doing As he boarded the train he asked of Martin who was with him if he was to go to Mona also That depends upon who enters after you If I think you are followed I go too And Moore realized that Oakes s hand of caution had been shown once more CHAPTER VI The Murder The rising sun was invisible from the little station hidden in the gloom of the hill but away out on the river its rays reached the water and marked out sharply the shadow of the high ground Further down the stream the rugged outlines of the Mansion were cut in silhouette on the surface of the river which was as yet smooth as a mill pond but which soon would be moved by those thousands of ripples advancing from the opposite shore As the sun shot his beams clearer and sharper the mist of the distance unfolded and the rays struck the ragged granite cliffs of the shore and revealed them yellow and gray in the bluish haze of the morn Away up miles beyond the river broadened and the mountains of both sides rose abruptly and ruggedly apparently from the water s edge causing the effect of a wide placid lake All was quiet lonely and dark on this side of the shore under the hill but beyond where the rays of the sun had reached was beginning life and activity A schooner becalmed until now began to move with the breeze that greeted the waking of day The train had but just left the little station and again had two strangers alighted One the older trudged up the hill covered with a great coat and with hands in his pockets He walked rather rapidly looking sharply around once or twice As he neared the top where the country rolls off into the plain he turned to admire the spectacle of the breaking day His glance followed the road and he saw below the second figure walking along in a hurry as though to make up for lost time He smiled and said to himself That fellow Martin is a persistent youngster anyway A few yards more brought him to the crest of the hill then he suddenly stopped for before him was unfolded a stretch of rolling ground well filled with trees in autumnal foliage and beyond the spires and the sky line of a sleeping town To his right he beheld a large wooded tract extending for at least a mile down the river and in the dim distance the shaded outlines of an old mansion Over all was the glorious yellow sun The new fresh rays caught the leaves on the trees and on the ground and kissed away the frost of the October morning The traveller drew a long breath I have been over the world almost but never did I know such splendor was so near my office said he half aloud He had discovered what some few had already known that here at our doors if one is not too indifferent can be found the scenery one seeks in a month s journey While walking along Moore for he was the man was overtaken by a milk wagon which rattled by with its two horses the driver lashing his whip seemed to mark the actual awakening to life of this rural community Say how far to the hotel and which way asked Moore Down the road a piece Come get in I ll drive ye Moore jumped up alongside and was thankful for the lift As they sped along he started at a sound in the distance like the faint crack of a whip but duller What was that a shot he said Yes rather early but poachers like to get on to the Mark place most any time Didn t sound like much of a gun though They were now at the hotel and Moore registered in the old dilapidated book and went to his room before his breakfast As he lay down for a moment to rest all of the vivid experiences of the last twenty four hours coursed through his brain He followed the events of the evening before and congratulated himself on being now relieved from anxiety for a time at least He had seen my name and that of Clark whom he knew to be Oakes on the register and had located our rooms as right opposite his own Perhaps he had better communicate with Oakes and myself now it was six o clock he thought He looked into the corridor and saw no one about for no attendant watches in these little hotels in the country He locked his door and knocked at Oakes s In a moment he heard the key click and Oakes looked carefully through the partially opened door The recognition was quick and Moore was admitted In another moment I had joined them for Oakes s room and mine communicated he had thought it best that we should have access to each other at all times if possible We two hastily dressed and doctor Moore presented the cause of his visit as briefly as possible Let me see the letter said Oakes He read it carefully One thing is certain it is written by a person of some education That proves nothing however It may have been dictated originally by a very illiterate person It was sent from New York Oh yes said Oakes wearily but it may simply have been written there It may have gone under cover in different language from any place almost and been copied or put into shape by an accomplice Hard to trace it said Moore Yes practically impossible along those lines But in any event it was written on a woman s paper see the texture We all noticed its fineness and agreed And the odor of musk is not a man s favorite either remarked Oakes as we noticed the scent He was standing erect with a slightly abstracted air He was thinking Well said Moore we cannot find out much then Oh yes you can The letter speaks of the color of my eyes The originator has seen me many times at close range This is an unintentional clue The style of the writing the paper and the perfume point to a woman but the wording is a man s as is the description of myself I judge Well what do you think I hazard a guess that the letter was written or dictated by a man of some education and rewritten by a woman as a disguise Ah And where was it written That it is impossible to say Perhaps in New York but it may have been here in Mona As I said the originator is a man probably who knows me by sight and knows Mona and its affairs very well but who also knows New York and your city address Moore for the letter went there By his knowledge of late events in Mona I should imagine that he perhaps lives here but has recently been to New York or else has an accomplice there a woman who rewrote and remailed the letter for him At breakfast we contrived to keep the waitress busy filling orders for we wished to discuss our affairs and had no mind to be overheard Oakes had prepared the proprietor for Moore s arrival saying he expected him at any time so his coming excited no particular attention While the girl was out the doctor narrated his morning s experience as far as the walk up the hill We addressed Oakes as Clark as had been previously agreed Did Martin follow you asked the detective Yes I saw him ascending the hill after me Our leader thought a moment Curious Why has he not made himself visible here The chances are you were mistaken Moore Oh no I feel confident it was Martin We left the cheerless low ceiled dining room and walked out into the corridor where the porter was mopping the floor and the cigar stand opening for business I went over and bought something to smoke Moore took one but Oakes refused That meant he was worried and not at his ease Presently the doctor remarked Seems to be shooting around here How What do you mean asked Oakes Yes I heard a shot when I was in the wagon The milkman said it was poachers on the Mark property Oakes wheeled and regarded Moore austerely You heard shooting on the Mark grounds Why did you not say so You tell a poor story At this moment we heard a commotion outside and the cry A runaway We all stepped to the sidewalk where a few early risers had gathered and looked down the road Coming over the crest of the hill from the station was a milk wagon rushing along at a terrific rate The horses were leaping with heads hung low The smashing of cans was audible even at the distance That is no runaway said Oakes Look at the horses heads they are low Those animals are not scared We all looked and beheld what Oakes had already noticed Look at the driver said a by stander He was standing up on the dashboard plying his whip without mercy By his side was a boy hanging on for all he was worth In the quiet self possessed way that marks a leader in all emergencies Oakes spoke up That is a race for help boys not a runaway Down the long road came the wagon a heavy affair Milk cans were falling out and the roadway seemed scarcely enough for the swaying team The driver a strapping fellow balanced himself as best he could holding the reins with one hand and using the whip with the other The intelligent animals were straining to their limit in dumb intense brute desire to get there or die A murmur of applause arose from the crowd and the country apathy gave way to subdued excitement Never did Roman charioteer drive better Never did artillery horses pull harder In a minute or so the team came abreast of us and the driver by a wonderful control of his animals pulled up abruptly He dropped his whip and held up his hand There is a gentleman dying on the road by the top of the hill Who Who I don t know but he s on his face with blood all over his back He s been shot Oakes turned to Moore His arm made that quick silent movement so peculiarly his own and rested lightly on the physician s shoulder The shooting you heard he remarked Moore turned pale and seemed almost to stagger Meant for me he blurted out Yes and Martin got it instead said Oakes Come and in an instant he was off down the road We followed and the crowd of about thirty closed in It was a quick dash down that turnpike Never had early riser in Mona had such an experience before The terrific flight of the milk wagon and its dramatic ending had inspired life in the crowd Hotel porters barmen and milkman gentlemen and loafers all went down that road with one object in view the succoring of a fellow being As we ran the strongest forged ahead Moore and myself came abreast in the rear of the leaders but near to the bunch Terrible Poor Martin said Moore Keep quiet I said between breaths A murmur arose in the crowd Look at that fellow said a runner near us We looked It was Quintus he was steadily distancing all Gosh Ain t he a beaut said another Look at Oakes said I Shut up said Moore Call him Clark now The heavy breathing around us became noticeable men were tiring now It was a hard run Away up in the lead was the solitary figure of our friend running with body pitched a little forward and the long even stride of the athlete My mind now recalled that Oakes was a runner in college a noted one in his day Swish swish thump thump went the feet of those around us and always that tall figure in the lead taking the ground like a thoroughbred and steadily increasing the distance between us As we reached the crest of the hill to turn down the milk wagons were beginning to rumble behind us and the sounds of the approaching crowd of vehicles and belated citizens became distinct We dashed down the slope and beheld Oakes in the lead halt and bend over a figure He seemed to be speaking to the injured man As we drew near we saw the blood and heard the sighing breathing Dying said Moore by my side We all encircled the victim and doctor Moore bent over him Then he and Oakes straightened up suddenly and removed their hats We all knew what had taken place The motley crowd uncovered panting and pale faced Dead said Oakes and turned to Moore who had joined me in the crowd Be careful he said The murdered man is not Martin The rougher of the followers started to move the body so as to see the face Again Oakes showed his power to lead Stop men this is a crime Don t touch the body Wait for the police and the coroner They obeyed The first official now arrived on a wagon He hesitated as he saw the bloody back and then turned the face so that all could see it Several stepped forward and a cry of consternation arose It s Winthrop Mark CHAPTER VII The Inquest At the suggestion of Oakes we mingled with the crowd for a short time and then returned to the town with some of the hotel employees leaving the others in their excitement to await the action of the authorities This man Winthrop Mark seems to have been very well known Oakes inquired of the hotel porter by his side The latter anxious to identify himself with the town and its people and also to please the stranger beside him who had made himself so prominent during the last few moments gave much information Yes mister Clark the murdered man has lived hereabouts for a long time his brother owns the Mark Mansion over yonder the town has been very proud of it you know Yes a beautiful old place It is sir But no place to live in there has been something dangerous about it sir Seems to me I heard something of it when I was last in Mona said Oakes Did you have any experience sir Experience What do you mean I do not know sir but it always appears Something that scares people Hurts the town doesn t it Yes indeed sir and this murder will spoil everything here now I cannot quite follow you Oh sir you don t know how good mister Mark was Always improving the roads always giving the town money forever clearing up jealousies said the porter Oakes looked at him Say my man how long have you been a porter You don t speak like a man brought up in such work I was not sir I used to be a merchant years ago burned out no insurance broke went to work as a porter nothing else to do The old story mister Clark I am not the first one We knew Oakes was seeking some information so we remained quiet Sad enough said he perhaps times will improve for you The porter Reilly by name smiled and looked at Oakes with that expression of hopeful despair we have all seen we who rub the world in our continuous efforts Who could have shot mister Mark asked our companion did he have many enemies No mister Clark I know of none But and the man paused Well what said the detective in an off hand way Well it s peculiar said Reilly very peculiar to me Two or three years ago sir Smith the leading man of the town was shot at the very same spot in the road What I cried but a look from Oakes silenced me Indeed quite a coincidence said he Who shot him Nobody knows I was just going to work when it happened Early in the day then Just about six o clock sir and he was shot right through the chest volunteered our informant Well I hope they catch this fellow said Oakes You have a good police chief here Yes sir very He came up here first for his health but he was once chief in some large city Ah then he will get the murderer surely Mona is fortunate in having such a man Reilly looked pleased at the compliment and it seemed as though Oakes had won another follower Before we reached the hotel we saw that the town was now wide awake There were groups of men talking excitedly before nearly every business place the bank the dry goods stores drug stores and newspaper offices It was about their opening hour and rumor had travelled fast On the main street Oakes left us with a word of caution Be careful what you say There may be a connection between this affair and the Mansion mystery but we know nothing of either The inquest may tell us something Meantime you two find out what you can by mingling with the crowd Learn all about Reilly and anything you can pick up of the Smith murder he mentioned I am going to see the Chief of Police and if possible telephone to my office in New York Moore and I walked around in the fast increasing crowd and talked with those who were returning from the scene of the murder The people were settling down into a dull sullen silence as people will after a great tragedy This was a blow to the inhabitants here The death of mister Mark was the loss of a friend to many and of a leading citizen to all Those engaged in business in what had been until recently a most prosperous little town foresaw the probable after effect on confidence and the town s future The demon of vengeance was rising in many hearts The report of the coroner s jury was awaited with anxiety The murderer would probably have escaped by that time but better so if once his identity could be discovered than have another mysterious horror in the community The police headquarters a trim little brick building facing the square and the hotel was the centre of real activity Oakes made his appearance alone at the top of the steps coming out from the corridor that led to the Chief s room As he stood at the door glancing calmly around at the crowd I thought what a magnificent man he was He stood erect and composed as though inviting scrutiny His long overcoat was not carefully closed its collar was turned partly up He had put it on like the rest of us after our return from the run and he had done it quickly His left hand was hanging down in a natural position his right was in his overcoat pocket The Fedora hat was slightly tilted back He looked a half careless indifferent fellow but the keen eyes missed nothing they rested on me on Moore and then on the crowd He was the embodiment of searching coolness The crowd recognized him and knew that he had seen the Chief of Police They reasoned as one man that something important had been done The tall city fellow had been first at the side of the victim they had seen that What did he know And then they thought of that run and the exhibition of physical perfection that his powers had shown and like a gentle ripple on the brook came a murmur of admiration Oakes stepped down and was the centre of much questioning All the time the right hand remained in the coat pocket I knew that it held death at command that the revolver lay well in his grasp that Quintus Oakes was now on guard and the field was one with which he was well acquainted Soon he entered the hotel and we followed him to his room You must be at the inquest both of you doctor Moore you are well known as a surgeon and will view the body with the local doctors They wish you to do so They say you are known to them by reputation You will be required as an expert witness I have made my identity known to the Chief of Police Indeed I said then everybody will know it No they won t said Oakes The Chief knows me by name I know all about him he is a good shrewd man I have explained our mission here and have disclaimed any desire to have anything to do with this mystery unless unless it touches the other The Chief Hallen wants my evidence and he knows enough to see that we can all stand in together He may help in the Mansion affair later said Moore Yes said Oakes I thought I might need him Anyway this murder is for the police at present I succeeded in getting long distance telephone and found that Martin did not come here at all He returned to the office after seeing doctor Moore off on the train Good we exclaimed And what did you learn from the dying man He spoke to you we thought I learned something that has great possibilities said Oakes Wait for the inquest What have you learned I answered for us both Reilly is well known here and reliable We could learn nothing of the Smith murder save that it had occurred about as this one and was never solved The old Chief of Police resigned on account of public opinion of his incompetency the new Chief Hallen came in here a year or so ago Well said Oakes so far so good but it looks to me as though there is some connection between these murders I do not envy the local officials a bit the people won t stand much more mystery up here Suspicion of one s neighbors is a terrible thing in a small community By the way when I give my evidence watch me but little watch the audience more The criminal might be there Yes said Moore turning to me they often seek the court under such circumstances don t they I believe it has been recorded I rejoined Then seeing Oakes move away I asked where he was going I am going to look around for a while Better be cautious you may be the next to get a bullet for the criminal probably knows that you saw Mark alive He may be anybody in town I said Anybody Nonsense You may clear the women and children at least That wound was made by a heavy calibre weapon it takes strength to handle such Then he walked away The coroner empanelled the jury that afternoon It was composed of milkmen porters and farmers and some men of more substantial condition for instance the leading banker and the secretary of the Young Men s Christian Association They were all alert to the importance of their position and anxious to appear well in this drama that was opening in Mona The jury viewed the body in the anteroom and the wound was examined carefully They marched into the court room next to the apartments of the Chief of Police and were seated before the bench The large room was filled to its utmost with the representative men of the place To my eyes the scene was novel indeed My practice had been in the courts of the metropolis and the methods here interested me They were simple straight forward people The intensity of their faces the hush of the crowd was awesome I obtained a seat facing most of the people and doctor Moore was by my side The room looked on a lawn which extended to the next street and opposite to me were three windows the centre one of which was open At the open window was a young negro handsome and well built He leaned on the sill with folded arms and judging by the height of the window from the ground I knew he was standing on a box or a barrel A couple of other faces were visible outside the closed windows The crowd within was uneasy but quiet a volcano in its period of inactivity Then the milkman who discovered the body related his story He had come up the hill from the station and saw the body near the top of the hill He saw the wound from his seat on the wagon for realizing what had happened he did not alight Fear had seized him He knew he was perhaps watched by the assassin so he had lashed his horses and rushed for the town and aid The little boy who had ridden by his side was brave and cool in the court room the Chief of Police had his arm on his shoulder in a fatherly way He corroborated the milkman s story and said he was scared even more than his uncle the driver One or two others certified to the finding of the body and spoke of the stranger mister Clark who had reached the place first and of the wild run from the town Then came the coroner s physician who certified to the nature of the bullet a large one undoubtedly Then he said in a courteous professional way Gentlemen we have by accident among us doctor Moore from New York who witnessed the finding of the body and who has viewed the injury doctor Moore is a well known surgeon and perhaps he will favor us with an opinion only an opinion of the nature of the weapon used The coroner bowed and motioned to doctor Moore by my side The physician hesitated a moment then advanced before the crowd of strangers He was a surgical lecturer but this was an unusual audience doctor Moore you have seen many wounds from firearms have you not Please state where doctor Moore answered in his pleasant voice I have seen quite a number in hospital service in the last ten years and very many in Cuba during the Spanish War A murmur arose the crowd hung on every word State what your opinion is please said the coroner To begin with said Moore the bullet entered the breast the point of entrance is large about the size of a forty four bullet I know it entered there because a part of the coat was carried into the wound It came out at the back under the right shoulder blade and pierced that bone tearing it partly away from its muscles In piercing the bone it also fractured it and made a large hole of exit as was to be expected Explain please Under some circumstances a bullet losing its speed pushes the tissues before it and makes a larger hole of exit than entrance especially if it shatters the bone What do you think of the nature of the weapon used In my opinion it was certainly no modern pistol or rifle they are of smaller calibre and the powder used gives greater velocity and less tearing is evidenced How is that Well a small bullet going at great speed makes a clean hole usually at ordinary range This was a large bullet going only at moderate speed Could a rifle have done it Yes if fired at a long distance so that the speed was slackening What seems the probable weapon to you A revolver because a rifle of large calibre to have produced such a wound must have been discharged at considerable distance for the bullet was losing its velocity when it found the victim Now to have seen the victim from afar was impossible the banks on each side of the road and the incline of the hill would prevent it That to my mind excludes a rifle The assassin could not have seen mister Mark much more than one hundred and fifty feet away owing to the configuration of the ground Had he been much nearer than that distance the bullet would have travelled with greater speed than it did and would probably have pierced the shoulder bone without so much crushing and pushing effect Thus we see that a rifle in this case could not have been used far enough away to cause such a wound A heavy revolver discharged at good distance for such a weapon would have met the requirements however and I believe such a one was used The assassin could not have been farther off than the configuration of the ground permitted about one hundred and fifty feet and judging from the wound he was not very much nearer The crowd shifted and a deep sigh of emotion arose Now doctor Moore you arrived in town this morning Please tell us what you know about the events that transpired asked the coroner Well I arrived at six o clock A M and walked up the hill As I reached the top I noticed a man coming up behind A milkman came along and offered me a ride to the hotel there he is and he pointed to the fellow As we rode along we both heard a shot and I remarked upon it The man in the wagon with me said it probably was a poacher I have no doubt sir it was the murderer at work This was getting near the horror and the court room seemed to echo the deep breathing of the listeners Then the milkman who had picked the doctor up gave his testimony He had entered the highway at the Corners and had seen a man coming up the hill He drove in toward Mona and picked up doctor Moore as related He corroborated Moore in his statements and ended by saying that he went about his business after leaving Moore at the hotel and knew nothing of the finding of the body by the other milkman and the boy until about eight o clock I remember the shot it was short and dull We said it didn t seem like much of a gun When did you hear the shot About six point thirty sir was the answer And gentlemen of the jury said the coroner mister Mark lived until seven when he was found If that shot was the one he lived a long time I believe he might have done so however The hemorrhage was not very severe He may have lain unconscious for a while As you know the autopsy showed that the bullet entered in front and striking a rib followed that around and came out behind It followed a superficial deflected course as bullets frequently do Men sometimes live a long time with such wounds More evidence of an unimportant nature was given The station master remembered the man getting off the train and following Moore He knew him well he was mister Mark and had lagged behind and spoken to him The body was undiscovered before because most milk wagons entered the town at the Corners and no one had alighted from the seven o clock train to climb the hill Charles Clark was now called and the spectators made room for Oakes as he walked down and faced the audience Watching the crowd I saw its excited expectancy Here and there was a man pale as death nearly overcome by the strain of the evidence Everyone in that room knew that the important part was at hand Many expected the name of the assassin A man behind me sighed and said Gosh why don t you hurry I knew that he was nearly ready to collapse Oakes or as Mona knew him Clark crossed his hands behind him and inclined his body a little He glanced coldly around then at the clock and instinctively the audience followed the movement I noticed that the time was four and that the ticking was very heavy and noisy Then I remembered Oakes s orders and watched the crowd The coroner went through the usual formalities and Oakes began his testimony He spoke in that fluent style of his I reached the man ahead of the others he was breathing Realizing that his name was important I asked him for it He was conscious he opened his eyes and looked at me Mark is my name all Mona is my friend he answered At mention of those words I heard a sob and then another outbreak the audience was going to pieces Oakes resumed I then asked him Who did this deed He seemed to be losing consciousness I repeated the question This time he answered in an almost inaudible voice The man the man with the great arms As Oakes uttered this sentence he did it in a strong whisper heard clearly all over the court room He paused Moore and I noticed that one half the men in sight mechanically put their hands to their arms curious is the effect of such scenes Others seeing the actions of their comrades glanced at them harshly and suspiciously but instantly began to smile Just then the fat grocer thought it was funny and laughed outright in a paroxysm of hysteria The crowd began to titter and then a roar short sharp of pent up emotion a laugh of suppressed excitement pealed forth like a thunder clap then all again was intensity Oakes now continued He did not say more so I again asked quickly Who did it Speak man Speak Then he answered distinctly it was a last effort The audience leaned forward in awed expectancy The faces of some were hard and set and the eyes of all were riveted on Oakes Moore whispered to me Watch the negro I looked and saw him leaning forward over the window sill his face ashen gray one arm held on to the sill the other hung limply into the room mister Clark what did mister Mark say to you then just before he died asked the coroner He said It was the fellow the man with the blue cross on his left arm As Oakes spoke his voice became metallic and incisive while his quick eyes suddenly swept the audience There was a shuffling of feet a turning of bodies and a man of weak nerves cried out The blue cross on the left arm The negro made a lunge forward swung both arms into the room and cried out Oh Gawd Oh Gawd then dropped on the other side of the wall The Chief of Police stood up and pointed to the window Catch that coon he cried The tumult which followed was a relief but the crowd lost sight of the negro No one had ever seen him before and he escaped at least for the time being The jury brought in a verdict that mister Mark came to his death at the hands of a party or parties unknown As doctor Moore and I discussed matters later we could but agree that the identity of Quintus Oakes had apparently been well hidden in that of Charles Clark the agent and that our first day in Mona had been a memorable one CHAPTER VIII The Mansion 
4455-116276-0000	train-other-500	Mona was situated on a plateau terminating rather abruptly at the river on the west and elevated well above its waters In the neighborhood of the station it was high and a long climb A mile farther down stream
4455-116276-0001	train-other-500	where the Mansion sat on the edge of the cliff the elevation was not so great perhaps a hundred feet or more above the railroad tracks by the river The Mansion end of the plateau was lower therefore than the town
none	none	 Beyond up the river 
4455-116276-0002	train-other-500	the land lay at the same elevation as Mona The beautiful place itself was some distance back from the crest of the plateau and was approached from the river by the highway we had known so well that day This was intersected at right angles on the plain above
4455-116276-0003	train-other-500	by River Road which ran parallel to the waters below The junction of these two roads was known as The Corners Upon following River Road for nearly a mile toward the south one would arrive at the Mansion gate
none	none	 The other road the Highway as it was called led directly to Mona in the centre of the plateau which gradually terminated to the north south and east in the rolling hills of that region Never was town site better selected 
4455-116276-0004	train-other-500	never was place more hopeful until recently when the blackness and gloom of the unoccupied Mansion with its tale of dread seemed to have extended to men s minds and laid its grasp of uncanniness and uneasiness on business and pleasure
4455-116276-0005	train-other-500	And now to make the slough of despond deeper had come the sharp quick act of a murderer above all an unknown assassin and a crime similar to one scarce forgotten The Mansion gate opened directly from River Road
4455-116276-0006	train-other-500	and a walk of about two hundred yards brought the visitor to the front door The back of the Mansion faced the river directly to the west the balcony of the back parlor and dining room half circled the south and west sides of the house and had evidently been much used
4455-116276-0007	train-other-500	The woodwork was old and the flooring quite worn The front of the place was pillared in old Colonial style and was of stone hewn in the rough and built in a permanent fashion Across River Road right in front of the gate
none	none	 came an uneven roll of the country or break in the plateau The ground billowed deeply for at least a quarter of a mile parallel to the road The slope from the road was gradual 
4455-116276-0008	train-other-500	to a little pond of considerable depth at the bottom of the depression On the farther side the ground rose more abruptly but not so high as on the Mansion side The pond itself was about one hundred feet in width and one standing by the Mansion exit
4455-116276-0009	train-other-500	could see both the pond and the ascent beyond and over the crest of the billowy ground the distant woods and the country to the east
none	none	 Down from the road a little path dipped 
4455-116276-0010	train-other-500	and at its foot a frail bridge crossed the pond for here the two shores were quite close Either shore projected into a point and about fifty feet of bridge had been built with logs resting half way on a rude pillar of stones in the water
4455-116276-0011	train-other-500	This bridge continued the path up the far slope and over the crest beyond It was a short cut to the country and the southern suburb of Mona Within the grounds of the Mansion extending northward to the Highway and the scene of the murder
4455-116276-0012	train-other-500	and southward into the uninhabited country was a forest of oak and of elm interspersed with an occasional fir One could easily wander between the trunks of these trees but having entered a few rods
none	none	 all traces would be lost of the outside world 
4455-116276-0013	train-other-500	It afforded an excellent shelter for anyone desiring to escape detection
none	none	 We noticed all these points as we drove to the Mansion next morning 
4455-116276-0014	train-other-500	We found the care takers awaiting us and more than glad to again see mister Clark as they knew Oakes The events of the day before had crowded fast upon us and had left us well known in the town The name of Clark was on every tongue
4455-116276-0015	train-other-500	Oakes remarked that morning before we started for the Mansion that he hoped the people would not identify him If they do we cannot help it however he said we cannot control events like these Then he suddenly asked me How about that negro
4455-116276-0016	train-other-500	He was handsome you say Yes rather black with remarkably clear cut features Indeed Then he may be traced through his good looks Do you think he is the murderer
none	none	 That s difficult said Oakes but I should think not 
4455-116276-0017	train-other-500	Had the deed been done by a negro boy the victim would have remembered it they are uncommon here He would have said A negro good looking or something of that sort His color would have impressed the dying man
none	none	 Well why was the negro so scared I asked Probably recognized the description as that of someone he knew Perhaps not said Moore He may have been just emotional 
4455-116276-0018	train-other-500	the race is very superstitious If I make no mistake continued Oakes Mona is going to see queer doings The people s minds are at a great tension
none	none	 In any event this affair is not ours That is not as we see it now Our welcome from the servants seemed genuine in its sincerity and Cook and his wife ushered us up to our rooms The hall from the front door was a long one 
4455-116276-0019	train-other-500	and the stairs leading to the upper floor was broad and well carpeted Our rooms two in number were over the parlor and the dining room the latter the scene of the occurrences so frequently described Oakes was given the back room looking on the river and over the balcony
4455-116276-0020	train-other-500	Moore and I occupied the front room over the parlor On the other side of the hall were two large rooms
none	none	 guest chambers we were told 
4455-116276-0021	train-other-500	They formed the roof of the dance or reception hall below to the right of the door as we entered and always kept locked as Annie told us In fact the dance hall and the two large chambers overhead
4455-116276-0022	train-other-500	formed the north side of the house and had not been used for many years According to tradition the hall had been a gay centre in the years gone by when the Mansion was the leading house in the village It had now lost its prestige
4455-116276-0023	train-other-500	to new and magnificent residences of the rich New York men of affairs who had recently come into the town to make it their home and to transform all its social conditions and to add life and new energy to the country around
4455-116276-0024	train-other-500	During the forenoon we examined the downstairs rooms pretty thoroughly We did it in an unostentatious manner The rooms had several windows and the front one facing the road in the distance had a large fireplace
4455-116276-0025	train-other-500	Oakes examined this carefully and shook his head in a negative manner The back room facing the river on the west the lawn and the estate on the south was the dining room Its four large windows two on each side
4455-116276-0026	train-other-500	extended down in the old style to within a foot of the encircling porch Again there was a large fireplace and I looked over it closely but it was solidly built and seemed to have been undisturbed for years
none	none	 The entire room was paneled in oak and this appeared to be new It was right here that I had my experience said the detective as he stood by the windows to the west 
4455-116276-0027	train-other-500	I was near the centre of the room leaning upon the table and Moore was farther along on the other side of the fireplace near the eastern wall We were quite interested in the place and I am sure I felt anything but secure
4455-116276-0028	train-other-500	doctor Moore laughed in his careless way Look out old fellow said he it will catch you again Oakes and I stepped out on the balcony through the low silled window and looked across the river I heard a rustle I thought a half muffled tread
4455-116276-0029	train-other-500	a swish a peculiar noise and Oakes jumped to the centre of the balcony Look out That s the noise cried the detective We both glanced toward Moore and saw a terrible sight The strong man was unsteady on his feet his knees were bent and his head thrown forward
4455-116276-0030	train-other-500	Great drops of perspiration were rolling off his pale face He looked like a man about to fall Help for God s sake help he cried and clutched at his neck That instant the physician came across the room hurled by terrific force I caught him as he fell
none	none	 and saved him from an injury against the table He was overcome completely he held his neck in a pained position and groaned Oakes weapon in hand advanced to the hall We all heard a distant muffled noise 
4455-116276-0031	train-other-500	preceded by a slam At that instant our attention was called to the balcony A figure jumped on the porch from the west side and dashed past the windows leaving the balcony near its southern end and disappearing in the trees beyond
4455-116276-0032	train-other-500	A man said Oakes and he was hiding behind the porch Yes but he did not do it how could he have run there so quickly I answered Better take Moore upstairs
none	none	 saying which Oakes jumped from the room and instead of going out of the front door 
4455-116276-0033	train-other-500	he sprang to the west end of the hall near the dining room and opened a door I had not noticed Where are you going said I Into the cellar Don t follow unless I shoot He was gone
none	none	 I partly carried partly helped doctor Moore up to his room and placed him on the bed He was pale and I realized he was shocked I found my flask and gave him a good drink and then saw that the back of his neck was bleeding I bathed it and tied it up in a clean towel 
4455-116276-0034	train-other-500	As I worked he held his revolver in his hand and watched the door talking quickly and earnestly He told me about how he had wondered if Oakes were insane then of the assault on himself how he had heard the noise and had certainly been attacked by some living being
4455-116276-0035	train-other-500	and was satisfied that his suspicions could not be correct He had been thoroughly converted All this took some time and now we were wondering what had become of our friend The minutes passed and I decided to descend and see what the servants were doing and raise an alarm
4455-116276-0036	train-other-500	Just as I was setting off we heard two pistol cracks muffled but the noise from cartridges such as we carried nevertheless I grasped my weapon and started downstairs As I reached the top of the landing I heard the cellar door close with a bang on the floor below
4455-116276-0037	train-other-500	and heard a slow tread ascending the stairs I retreated so as to aid my wounded companion The tread advanced along the hall It was that of a man limping The next instant we recognized Oakes s voice Where are you anyway
none	none	 We spoke and the next instant he appeared on our threshold revolver in hand with his face pale and drawn 
4455-116276-0038	train-other-500	and his figure less erect less self reliant than usual He was bloody from a wound on his head and his clothes were torn in shreds He steadied himself with his left hand against the door frame
none	none	 Great goodness Oakes what is wrong said doctor Moore rising to help his friend 
4455-116276-0039	train-other-500	What the devil I exclaimed Where have you been In the cellar said Oakes
none	none	 What have you been doing said Moore in a most excitable way 
4455-116276-0040	train-other-500	Back came the answer in a feeble tone Really I don t know Having a little practice I guess
none	none	 Catch him Stone cried Moore I jumped forward and the stalwart figure dropped vertically collapsing at the knees then pitched headlong into the room I saved the face before it struck the floor CHAPTER IX Distrust and Suspicion The day following the murder of Winthrop Mark was one of uneasiness and dejection for the towns people of Mona The court scenes of the day before and the great excitement caused by the discovery of the crime had left their stamp Disquietude was bred and nurtured by the crime itself and the absence of clues save those of the arm It was rumored and reiterated that Chief Hallen had failed to discover the slightest evidence as to the perpetrator and that the bullet even had remained unfound as was most natural but people look at things in a narrow light sometimes and this was an occasion of deep trouble and much gossip for the town The peculiar action of the negro whom few had seen but all had heard and who was pronounced a total stranger by those who had seen him pointed strongly to him as the possible assassin With his escape had come mutterings against Chief Hallen Why had the court house not been watched Where were the local authorities Why had he been allowed to get away so easily All these questions remained unanswered for few stopped to think that there were no local detectives and only a few local policemen Then in the midst of these disgruntled thoughts and assertions appeared the mental picture of Clark known in the town before and now the most conspicuous man in it towering above all in his active personality as in his figure and sayings Talk is cheap in such a place and talk has made or unmade many a man The great run of Clark to the victim s side and the dramatic and terrible evidence he gave at the inquest was spoken of at first with awe and then with alarm And to think he had gone to the Mansion to spend a short time again gone to the place of all others that one should avoid at this time gone to the house where terror dwelt and at the end of whose grounds the murder had been committed Hallen whose word was known to be law had vouched for this The personality of Clark stood silhouetted on the sky of lowering discontent The only clue worth having was that one relating to the arms of the murderer and given to the public as it purposely had been by Clark in a moment of suspense it had found deep rooting place in all minds Who was the man with the great arms and with the blue cross on one of them the left Here was a small town perhaps one thousand grown men Who had the cross who Might it be anyone Yes almost anyone Did anyone know of such a scar No but who knew of his neighbor s arms Who could vouch for his friend Some few had been associated one with another as boys What of that It was years ago Suspicion was growing like a prairie fire first a light that goes out then flickers again and smoulders anon meeting resistance and apparently dying but all the while treacherously gaining and advancing in the roots and the dry stubble below then suddenly bursting into flame With the first flame comes the inrush of air then come the heat and the smoke and the low wall of fire then the glare the roar and the conflagration sweeping all before it So came suspicion to Mona And friendship respect and brotherly love fled at its breath as wild animals of the prairie flee before the advancing destruction By evening of the second day the far sighted and most influential citizens detected the condition of affairs The older residents had noticed the peculiar similarity of this murder to that of Smith The coincidence of time and place was another factor Could it be the same assassin Had he dwelt with them all the while since The most respected and wealthy of the inhabitants shared the unenviable position of being under suspicion there was no relief for anyone The two local newspapers published extras and could scarcely supply the demand The murders of Smith and Winthrop were reviewed carefully and their similarity much written about The hotel and the two leading business streets were filled with suspicious muttering groups Nothing had been found missing from the dead man his watch and money were untouched His arrival by such an early train was not unusual He frequently went to New York for an outing and returned before breakfast to his magnificent place on the hill to the east of the town where he lived with two old maiden aunts his mother s sisters Now all this uneasiness and suspicion had been noted by Hallen the Chief He was a man who after living in the country for many years had finally pushed himself to the top of a large police force in a city of importance The physical strain had told on him however and now he found himself back in a small town recovered in health but shut in as to future prospects The murder of Mark had come to him as a thunderbolt from a clear sky but he saw opportunities in it When Oakes had visited him and made himself known he had at first been jealous but the former with his wonderful insight had made a friend of him Hallen if you manage this affair well you will be famous They are looking for good men in New York all the while My work is in the Mansion if our paths cross let us work together So had suggested Oakes He had known about Hallen as he knew the history of all police officers and had thus given hope to the man who had been used to better things Instantly Hallen had seen that to antagonize Oakes would be foolish to aid him and perhaps obtain his advice and friendship would ultimately redound to his own future credit and possibly advancement For Oakes s work had brought him in contact with police heads in all the large cities His boldness and genius for ferreting out mysteries were known to them all and they had paid him the compliment of studying his methods carefully Hallen had agreed to have Oakes s testimony at the inquest taken at just the proper moment for effect and had agreed to call doctor Moore as an expert Of course the coroner did what the Chief asked As Oakes had said If you want expert evidence get it from Moore if you don t ask him you won t get it in Mona The idea of Oakes bringing in his testimony as he did was part of the plan to watch the audience The planning of the Chief and himself had accounted for the somewhat informal presentation of the evidence that I had noticed In rural courts affairs are not conducted as they are in the city and I had observed a quick swing to affairs hardly accounted for on the ground of practice I recognized the hand of Quintus Oakes and knew that the scene had been carefully manoeuvred Hallen sat in his office on the evening of the day after the inquest reviewing the happenings that had crowded so fast in Mona and thinking not without misgivings of the wave of suspicion that was rising to interfere with the affairs of the town At this moment the editor of the Mona Mirror entered a whole souled fat individual breezy and decidedly agreeable He was one of the natives a man of growing popularity and decided education Dowd was his name and he hated that fellow Skinner who edited the rival newspaper the Daily News Skinner had bossed things in a free handed fashion until Dowd a clerk in the post office until middle life had decided to enter the field of journalism less than two years before Dowd was inexperienced but he was bright and he wielded a pen that cut like a two edged sword and the love that was lost between the two editors was not worth mentioning As Dowd entered and found Hallen alone he took off his hat and overcoat and laughed sarcastically He really liked Hallen and was on intimate terms with him Hallen looked up Well what s ailing you now he said Oh nothing Only this town is going loony sure as fate Hallen What are you going to do Hallen chewed the end of a cigar viciously I am going to do the best I can to solve the mystery if I cannot do that I can at least keep order here Give me a few specials and the necessity and I will make these half crazy people do a turn or two The burly chief turned the conversation into other channels but Dowd was satisfied He knew the speaker well CHAPTER X The Cellar Meantime our first experience at the Mansion previously recorded bade fair to be a serious one When Oakes had collapsed on his return from the cellar doctor Moore fortunately was sufficiently recovered to reach his side in a few seconds Elevate his feet Stone He ll be all right in a few minutes he has fainted I did as directed and Moore threw the half of a pitcher of water on the unconscious man s neck and face Gravity sent the blood back to his head and when the water touched him he gasped and presently opened his eyes Then we carried him to the bed In an instant he attempted to rise but the Doctor refused to allow it giving him instead an enviable drink from his flask Keep your guns by you said Oakes and give me mine The tension had told on me and Moore was now by far the best man He smiled and ordered me to take a drink also and to sit down I obeyed for I felt after the excitement as limp as a boy after his first cigar doctor Moore was examining Oakes s head Fine scalp wound said he and proceeded to sew it up and dress it His pocket case came in handy He had been wise to bring it Hurt anywhere else old fellow asked he No sore as the devil all over that s all and Oakes arose took off his coat and began to bathe his face Keep an eye on that door said he I was myself now and took my chair to the hall door sitting where I could command the head of the stairs and could also hear anyone who might approach from below What happened asked Moore Well nothing very much said Oakes only I guess I got a mighty good licking You look it said I Did you shoot for help Yes I did I could not shout The shots saved my life How Did you kill anyone Don t know only the other party kindly quit killing me when I began to shoot I heard something drop however and there may be a dead body somewhere The shots had aroused the household and we heard shouting and cries from the Cooks and from Annie Soon they appeared hunting for us all distraught and frightened They said they were in the kitchen when they heard the shots and did not know whence they came This was probable as the cellar was away from their section Annie cried when she saw Oakes and ran out to bring in more help One of the gardeners returned with her and as he came into the room I received the impression of a silent stern looking man past forty and rather strong in appearance although not large He had seen better days Ah said he ye have run up aginst it agin sorr It s nerve ye have to go nigh that room after what ye got last time Oakes looked at me and at Moore and we saw he wished us to keep silent Yes I shan t try it again in a hurry What s your name he asked The question came quick as a flash I knew he was trying to disconcert the fellow My name is Mike O Brien sorr gardener you remimber twas me that helped you last time sorr You mean you stood by and let the others help me Mike We knew now that this was the indifferent gardener of whom Oakes had spoken Thrue for ye sorr twas little enough I did and that s a fact I m not used to being scared to death like ye be sorr Was that an unintentional shot or was it a feeler Oakes had a sharp customer before him and he knew it Where were you when you heard the shots Mike In the woods at the front of the house I was raking up the leaves be the same token What did you see Oakes spoke in a commanding voice and fingered the breech of his revolver in a suggestive way I seen a shadow come out av the cellar door What door The only cellar door near the side av the house sorr What sort of a shadow Twas the shadow av a man and a big one The sun cast it on the side av the house sorr Oakes thought a moment then arose and said Step here Mike and point out the side of the house you mean Mike hesitated The other servants withdrew at Oakes s suggestion that he wished to talk with the gardener The latter advanced We felt that Oakes was trying to spring a trap The side of the house where the cellar door is reiterated Mike Nonsense O Brien Your story is impossible The sun was then in the east and the shadow would have been thrown on the east wall There is no door on that side it is on the west side of the house O Brien looked at Oakes defiantly Yer intirely wrong sorr There is the cellar door to the east He pointed to a hatch opening about forty feet from the house near the well The door ye saw on the west is niver opened tis nailed up The tables were turned Oakes was disconcerted If what you say is true you have my apology I have not investigated closely So I thought sorr was the answer And we all wondered at the amazing coolness and self possession of the man It was one against three and he had held his own Sit down Mike said Oakes How long have you been here Only a matter av six weeks I came from New York and tried for a job Maloney the head man giv me wan Where is Maloney He was in the tool house whin I come by sorr He didn t hear the commotion being sort o deef All right Mike Stay where you are a moment Then Oakes turned to us Just after Moore was attacked I heard a sound like a quick footstep and having certain suspicions of my own made a dash for the cellar I found there was no cellar under the north wing but toward the west and directly beneath the dining room was a door As I opened it all was dark but my eyes soon accustomed themselves to the light and I made out a good sized chamber and what I took for a man near the farther end I remained silent pretending I had seen nothing and closing the door made a movement back up the cellar stairs There I waited for about five minutes The ruse worked The door of the chamber opened and a man dressed in a dark cloak and a mask partly emerged and I thought started for the other stairs at the west end of the cellar I jumped and grappled with him but he struck me with the butt end of a revolver and I was dazed in another minute he was punishing me severely I fired two shots then he threw me away from him and disappeared He was stronger than anyone I ever met said Oakes apologetically a regular demon and he got in the first blow I think I wounded him however What shall we do said Moore Go quickly and investigate was the answer Here Mike you lead the way Mike did not hesitate If playing a game he did it well Want a gun said Oakes No sorr not if youse all are armed Guess we can give him all the scrap he wants We descended the stairs Oakes last as became his condition He touched Moore and myself and pointed to Mike Watch him he may be already armed he whispered The cellar was lighted by one window at the western end A door at the same end which evidently led to some stairs was padlocked and as Oakes said had not been recently opened The dust lay upon it undisturbed and the padlock was very rusty This corroborated Mike s story The door above that opened on the ground It was boarded up he said No means was found of passing beneath the dance hall as Oakes had said From the lay of the ground we concluded that the cellar was very low there and not bottomed a shut in affair such as one finds in old buildings of the Colonial epoch Across the cellar to the other side the south the same thing pertained except at the western extremity under the dining room there a door opened into a cellar room or chamber Here take this said Oakes handing Mike a small pocket taper Light it Mike did as told and stepped into the room I after him Oakes held the cellar door open and I happening to look at him saw that he was watching Mike as a cat watches a mouse He had dropped a match at the moment and with his eye still on the gardener stooped to pick it up His hand made a swift double movement he had the match and something else besides but Mike had not observed and I of course said nothing The room was low and without windows but the air was remarkably clean and fresh Plenty of ventilation in here said I Yes and blood too said the gardener Sure enough the floor was spattered with it Mine I guess said Oakes Moore kindly fetch a lamp from upstairs Ask Annie for one Moore went and soon brought down a small lantern We could hear Cook s voice at the head of the stairs also his wife s and Annie s It was the long expected hunt that no one had ever before made and which might clear up the mystery at any time By the better light we saw evidences of the struggle that had taken place a strip of Oakes s coat and a piece of glazed red paper an inch or so long and perhaps half as broad white on one side red on the other Piece of a mask said I and Oakes placed it in his pocket doctor Moore walked to the east side of the room where he and I saw a door in the wall and some plastering on the floor under it Mike was busy examining a heap of rubbish at the other end His conduct had been most exemplary Moore turned the light on the door and we three observed it for a moment Mike had not seen it distinctly if at all Moore come here said the detective retreating and the Doctor followed with the light Come on Stone I left the room with them Curious he heard Mike say behind us What is curious asked Oakes The smart hired man answered mister Clark the air is good in here Where does it come from I guess we have learned all we need this time Mike was the reply and the gardener came out reluctantly Oakes had seen the door in the wall it was all he wanted to know He closed the outer entrance of the room and called to Cook for hammer and nails The man brought them quickly then the leader took a board that was standing against the wall and Mike and Cook nailed it across the door from frame to frame mister Clark ye will have the devil now sorr said Mike Oakes took a pencil out of his pocket and wrote Clark on one end of the board then with a single movement continued his hand over its edge carefully and on to the frame where the line terminated in a second signature Clark Anyone removing that board has got to put it back to match that line said Oakes and that with a board is practically impossible where nailing has been done Now for the exit that opens near the well We went back through the cellar hall and found at the east end a door ajar It did not lock and was hung on rusty hinges Beyond was a dark passage Where does this lead Mike To the opening by the well sorr How do you know I don t know myself but Maloney said the outside opening by the well led into the cellar Cook says so too Tis a passage they used in wet weather sorr Mike you and Cook go round and guard that outer door by the well Open it I m going through mister Clark don t go in there alone I ll attend to that said Oakes You go with Cook The two went to the well and lifted the hatch door As they did so Oakes held a lighted match inside one end of the tunnel It blew strongly toward us the air was rushing in and we knew the passage led to the opening We heard their voices calling to us doctor Moore spoke Oakes you shall not go in there you have done enough to day you are a wounded man I caught up the lantern and my revolver and Moore followed Hold on said Oakes You are in the most dangerous part don t be rash Here Stone you go first and Moore you follow about ten feet behind without a light in order that you may be undetected Take matches I ll stay here with the taper and watch When you get to the other end don t go up the steps leading to the ground until both Mike and Cook show themselves We know nothing about them you know Be cautious The man we want went out this way whoever he is I threw the light ahead and advanced some ten feet I heard Moore following Careful said he in a whisper Again I threw the light ahead and beheld only the walls of the square tunnel I could hear the breathing of Moore behind me I knocked on the wall here and there with my revolver it rang true and solid We gradually advanced until we beheld the daylight and saw the men waiting at the head of the stone steps I ascended Moore took the lantern and called back to Oakes addressing him as Clark In a moment he came Stay where you are Stone said he to me Come here Mike Mike descended willingly enough I watched Cook and looked all around Open that door Oakes pointed to a little wooden opening in the side of the stairs Mike obeyed but instantly closed it again with a bang A man said he Oakes and Moore levelled their revolvers Come out said the detective or take the consequences I shall shoot Mike opened the door again hiding his figure behind it for protection as it swung out I expected to see some one shot but Moore threw the light in and instantly Oakes dived forward into the alcove of stone We could hear him chuckle Cook at my side was standing on one leg in his excitement Then doctor Moore burst into laughter What is it What s the matter I cried I could not see very well and ran half way down Oakes was standing beside Moore trying to look grave In his hand was a red paper mask and a long black robe O Brien looked on his eyes twinkling but his face serious I m thinking it s lucky mister Clark sorr that ye saved yer ammunition said he Yes retorted Oakes and it s still more fortunate you re a good actor O Brien s somewhat insolent manner changed instantly to one of civility and Oakes turned to us No wonder some said there was a woman in this affair Then he ordered the hatch door nailed down and handed the things to me Please take these upstairs Stone we must investigate this more fully and we withdrew to discuss our findings What do you think of O Brien Oakes I asked He seems to be a cool sort of a customer Yes he is no ignoramus He s a shrewd fellow and a deep one but I have learned a few things CHAPTER XI The Night Walk Events were following each other rapidly at the Mansion After leaving the cellar Oakes led us back through the grounds around the south side of the house There was no entrance to the cellar there apparently When we reached our rooms and I had deposited the mask and gown on my table Oakes turned to the care taker Cook who accompanied us You have been several years here have you not Yes mister Clark When did the first trouble begin About three years ago sir following some repairs that were made after mister Odell Mark bought the place from his brother What do you know of those repairs Well sir as perhaps you have noticed the door from the dining room to the parlor opens on a short hall about three feet deep Now sir mister Odell Mark had the wall thickened between the rooms he thought it was weak and this hall represents the thickness of the wall Oakes stood at the window his hands in his pockets looking out Did you see that wall being built yourself Cook I didn t notice particularly sir Well Stone we ll try the simplest theory first Will you kindly go with Cook up to the roof and look around carefully I have an idea that the wall is double and that you will find an opening up there somewhere We went and as Oakes had surmised soon found a small opening like a chimney grated in solidly and protected by a covering and so reported Good said Oakes The wall is double in part at least and the opening was carried into the cellar room and a door placed there What for said I Perhaps to ventilate it We may find some other reason We seem to be solving the mystery was Moore s comment Oakes looked at him quizzically Are you satisfied Doctor that there is a physical agent at work here Moore grew red Certainly he said And Quintus smiled I thought probably you would be convinced in time A thorough licking is an excellent argument It is my belief that the escapes were made through that double wall and that we shall find movable panels in the dining room But the motive We are strangers we gave no provocation I cried We have yet to learn the motive also why a man should wear a robe The mask is sensible enough but why he impeded himself with a robe is beyond us as yet It would hide his body to be sure as the mask would hide his face but it would certainly greatly affect his chances of escape if pursued Cook why was no investigation ever made before I don t know sir mister Odell was very timid Did you ever go through the tunnel to the well Yes sir I used to go before the mystery began but never afterward How about the place in the stairs where the robe was found That was always there sir and used for the gardener s tools Then the gardener knew of it Maloney the older one did I am sure he has been here a long time Was he here before the mysteries Yes sir he has been five years on the place Cook what do you think of the murder of Winthrop Mark It was one of those sudden questions that sometimes bring results I don t know sir it is terrible sir of course Where was Maloney yesterday Cook The man looked long at us He was here when I got up at six o clock raking the leaves on the front walk Indeed said Oakes We could not tell whether the answer surprised him or not I suppose Mike worked all day Yes sir he was about on the place the entire time Oakes made no remark whatever at this but dismissed Cook We cannot go too far in presence of the servants said he for I am only Clark the agent here you remember The time is coming when we may have to declare ourselves and we may need police help to make arrests but he smiled we have Hallen as a friend I guess Oakes was calmly sanguine I could see but of course he did not know that collateral events were brewing of grave importance to us all Now for the robe and mask said he I handed over the mask an old affair and considerably worn from usage A piece of it was missing which Oakes replaced with the fragment of paper picked up in the cellar it fitted exactly settling the fact that the mask had been worn by the man who fought him in that place The detective looked it all over and said This is such as was sold in New York years ago It is ordinary and offers no clue as to the owner or the place of purchase I know the kind The robe was fairly long and made of old velvet lined with satin quite shiny inside and out The name of its maker had been carefully cut away It was spotted with blood Oakes s no doubt for it was fresh It served a good purpose this time anyway said I saved the man s clothes from being marked Medium chest measure said Oakes Try it on Stone I did so and it just met around me Good The fellow who wore it is not a giant in chest measure at all events though larger than you probably since he wore it next to his undershirt How in the world do you know that Oakes said the doctor Look at the discoloration of the lining on the shoulders and also across the chest and back The soil is old but there is a moisture about the front yet the moisture of fresh perspiration it has been used quite recently That would not have come through a coat or a vest I should not be surprised if he had worn it over his naked chest Where do you suppose the outfit came from I asked Probably a relic of some masquerade ball of many years ago This house used to be a popular place for entertainments What did you pick up in the cellar when you stooped for the match Oh you noticed that See for yourselves and he showed us an old fashioned heavy calibre cartridge And how about the closet in the steps from which you took the robe I pursued I happened to see the door although both of you missed it The person who hid the disguise there is quite familiar with that exit evidently That narrows the search considerably said Oakes But the robe is a mystery it is a senseless thing to use under such circumstances Yes senseless that is the word spoke up Moore Oakes s eyes searched the physician s but the latter made no further remark I thought Oakes was sizing him up as pretty far from senseless himself We now examined the robe more carefully and saw that it was soiled with what appeared to me to be soot Oakes shook his head No it seems to be wood ash of some kind see how light some of it is he said He ran his hand along the inside of the robe and found a small well worn slit an opening to a deep pocket Instantly he turned it inside out and a small roll of paper dropped from it He carefully unfolded it and spread it on the table It is a piece of an old newspaper said he and has been read much It has been thumbed till it is ready to fall apart Read it Stone Your eyes are best I studied a while and then began DAILY NEWS October thirty one hundred eighty nine The body was found face downward on the main Highway just below the crest of the Mona Hill It was first seen by John Morney who was going to the reservoir in advance of his gang of laborers They were in sight when he discovered it the time was therefore shortly before seven The men were going to work at six point thirty from Mona They recognized it instantly as the body of Orlando Smith our beloved and esteemed citizen Death had occurred only a short time before and the murder must have been done about daybreak It was evident that mister Smith was returning from his factory where he had spent the night the shift having been doubled recently owing to the pressure of business Later examinations showed that the bullet entered the chest and was from a large revolver a forty four or forty five calibre The ball was not found We are unable to give any more particulars now before the time of going to press That is all I said We remained standing while we thought over the matter There was a satisfied air about the detective that I could not quite fathom and doctor Moore seemed to be quite pleased also Well what is it I asked With a voice that betrayed traces of elation Oakes answered me The man in the cellar wore this robe if he thumbed this paper the murder of Smith interested him The murder of Mark was similar and I believe our Mansion affair is going to involve us in a peck of unexpected trouble The clues are showing now and we must know more about the Smith murder as well as the Mark affair Yes put in Moore and all about the suspected motives in the Smith affair Oakes smiled Don t be too previous my boy If Hallen looks for our help well and good Otherwise remember I have given my word not to interfere with his search at present Meanwhile we must get into town and look around You must remain here said Moore You cannot go out until that wound begins to heal in a day or so That is so said Oakes But perhaps Stone can find out what is going on So it was arranged that I should call on Chief Hallen that evening and spend a few hours in Mona At supper Oakes said that tomorrow he would have men from the city who would make a complete search of the walls and perhaps tear down some partitions Masons and other workmen you know said he and I saw a twinkle in his eyes and realized that he was going to surround himself with men in case of an emergency Are you expecting trouble I asked No said he grave again in a second but I believe in being forearmed This matter is capable of developing into a very serious affair for all hands especially if we have a band of conspirators against us A band said I Yes certainly Has it never occurred to you that there may be several desperate characters in this affair and the murder This is no boy s play we are facing unknown dangers Now Stone go about town carefully and send this cipher to New York first thing When you come back tell Chief Hallen that I want you escorted to the Mansion by two men Remember He will understand for he spoke to me of the advisability of giving me aid It all seemed strange to me but I was not fearful when I left just at seven for the town I took the short cut over the bridge and up the hill beyond and they watched me as I crossed the rolling plains to Mona It was a clear night and I could see well over the hills the three quarters moon giving me excellent light I could not help thinking how careful was this man Oakes and what a peculiar nature was his alert severe even to austerity at times then solicitous friendly and even fond of a joke I was more than glad that I came although I realized that perhaps it was foolish to interfere in such affairs Of course that murder of Mark had been cast upon our notice by curious circumstances and unexpectedly As I walked over the rolling ground I kept my eyes well upon my surroundings but not a living thing did I see except myself and the night birds until I entered the town There was an air of subdued excitement about the place As I walked to the post office to send my despatches the loungers seemed numerous and some were amiss in their greetings others whom I knew approached in an affable manner enough but there seemed no genuine friendliness The telegraph manager took the cipher and smiled when he saw it Then he said to me in a whisper Tell mister Clark there is trouble coming To my look of surprise he answered Oh that s all right I had a visit from your friend before he went to the Mansion Again I recognized the work of careful Oakes and understood why he did not hesitate to send the cipher a thing unusual in a small town The indications of impending trouble in town were quite impressed upon me The little hotel was the centre of a lounging crowd large and composed of representative men as well as the usual hangers on There were evidences of much interest around the police building also much more than would occur under normal circumstances in a town of this size and even more than was present the night before I noticed a couple of brawls and considerable raising of voices many men were walking about as though watching the others The prairie fire had been lighted the sparks were burning near the roots of the grass the air was uneasy ready to rush in as wind to fan and feed the first flame I visited the Chief who was with his subordinates He invited me into the private room and then said mister Stone I am doing all I can to detect this murderer and to satisfy the public demand for his apprehension but the clues are practically worthless The populace is uneasy and suspicious Then he detailed to me all that he knew I then told him how the people s actions had impressed me I am going to have all I can do to keep order I am going to ask your friend Oakes to take a hand He will do it I said for he is greatly interested It is for the welfare of the town which I serve that I ask him to join me in this matter Go to him and tell him I shall see him in the morning if possible I was glad that affairs were taking such a turn for I knew the facts in our possession and that Oakes s counsel would be valuable I then requested an escort of two men to accompany me on my return to the Mansion as Oakes had suggested Certainly I had no intention of letting you go back alone he said and then he summoned two of his men clad in citizen s clothes and introduced them to me Now take a walk to the outskirts and return the same way by which you came My men will follow you at a short distance Before I left I noticed my companions fine looking fellows both of them and saw the tell tale pouching of the hip pockets and knew that we were all well armed In order not to attract attention we will walk some distance behind you We will keep you within sight and hearing If we fire a shot return to us I started across the rolling country and saw the two figures behind me Why were they so careful Why did they not accompany me They separated and we advanced I myself following the narrow path The night was still I halted occasionally and looked back a dim figure would halt on my left and on my right It was lonesome but I felt I had company I neared the slope to the pond and looked down there was nothing visible and I began to descend with an easy stride Although nearing the Mansion I felt an unaccountable dread This was the trying part of the journey and my followers were now invisible to me being on the plain above the crest of the hill I gripped my revolver firmly and stepped rapidly on to the bridge but as I did so I heard a pistol shot from above and knew instantly that I was in danger that my companions had signalled me to return I faced about and commenced my ascent of the hill From somewhere near a voice came to me clearly Run for your life it said I could see nothing but retreated hurriedly and was soon with the others at the top of the hill Why did you tell me to run I panted They looked at me We said nothing was the answer we merely signalled you to come back Well someone ordered me to run for my life Ah said they We thought we heard a voice We saw a figure at the other side of the pond We came over the crest cautiously and he did not expect us He was crossing in range of the light from the Mansion gate when we detected him So much for following you Well but who spoke to me He could not have done so his voice would not have sounded so near No evidently someone near you was watching him he was about to waylay you and the watcher knew it and warned you We heard a commotion and saw a figure dash from the bridge away toward the north end of the pond and disappear Then another figure showed at the crest on the River Road and followed him at breakneck speed See the man on the bridge was the fellow who warned you The other is after him He won t catch him however Come I cried and we darted down and over the bridge to the road above but nothing was visible Suddenly a couple of figures emerged from the darkness by the Mansion gate We recognized Oakes and Moore who had been awaiting us We related the circumstances of our return to the Mansion to them Yes said Oakes we were watching the man near the road He had a gun and was evidently waiting for you We were just going to make a rush at him when we saw you run back at the signal Who was he asked I I will answer the question by asking Who was the man who warned you I haven t the least idea said I You see you were in great danger and only that man s foresight saved your life But there are two unknowns now the friend and the enemy We watched my escorts descend and cross the bridge mount the ascent and disappear over the crest toward Mona Then the moonlight silhouetted their figures for an instant as they turned and waved a farewell CHAPTER XII The Witness mister George Elliott aristocratic well to do club man and all round agreeable fellow lived in bachelor apartments on the upper West side of New York He was engaged now in the brokerage business but times having been dull he found it rather difficult to occupy himself and was anticipating taking a vacation but where he had not yet decided Events were shaping themselves however to bring him into the happenings at Mona as one of our party On the corner near the apartment was a boot blacking stand presided over by one Joe an intelligent and wide awake colored youngster whose general good nature and honesty had made him popular with many Among his patrons and general well wishers was mister Elliott to whom Joe had taken a particular liking and whose opinions the young negro had often sought in an off hand way for despite his general air of reserve and hauteur Elliott was kindness itself at heart and a man who could be easily approached by those who were suffering from worry and hardship At about the time of the beginning of this story Joe s mother had been taken sick and had died in Troy and the boy had gone up there for a few days Then he had gone to Lorona a little town farther south and from thence to Mona on his way home to New York At Mona he had seen a terrible thing a murder Bewildered frightened overawed by his fateful knowledge he had managed however to reach New York where he sought out mister Elliott for counsel he knew the latter was kind and good and would tell him what to do Joe realized that he needed advice that he was in a terrible fix being the only witness so far as he knew of a crime of the worst kind As Joe told mister Elliott the things he had witnessed that gentleman realized the tremendous value of the evidence being told him By adroit questioning he determined that the celebrated Quintus Oakes was in Mona The boy said he recognized him for he had frequently shined mister Oakes s shoes in times past on Broadway Elliott realized that as he was called Clark at the inquest according to Joe the people in Mona did not know him as Oakes he must be travelling under an alias on important business probably Elliott also grasped the fact that Oakes was there at the time of the murder by coincidence only He had read of the affair in the evening paper but only in a careless manner It was all of deep interest now What should he do with Joe If he allowed the boy to think that he was in a tight place he might run away and that would defeat justice There was the alternative of telling the police that would mix himself up in an unpleasant affair and Joe might not be believed might be falsely accused of the murder Again he knew mister Oakes He had seen him at the Club and he did not desire to frustrate whatever investigations the detective might be making The best solution would be to find Quintus Oakes and tell him He certainly would be able to give some attention to the murder even if not in Mona for that purpose Meanwhile he himself would hold the boy at all hazards With skill scarcely to be expected from one of his easy going type he told Joe to remain and sleep in his flat that night and that he would fix things for him The terror stricken negro was only too glad of sympathy and protection from one of mister Elliott s standing and complied for he was at the mercy of his friends What could he a colored boy do alone After tired nature had asserted herself and Joe had fallen asleep in a room which had been given him Elliott called up Oakes s office by telephone In less than an hour a dapper young man sought admission to the apartment and was met by Elliott He introduced himself as Martin from Oakes s place In a few words Elliott explained matters and Martin said Let Joe go to his boot blacking stand in the morning Get your shoes shined and place your hand on his shoulder in conversation so that he can be identified before you leave Our men will be in sight Then meet me at the elevated station and we will go to Mona together if you care to do so Good said Elliott I am willing I will take my vacation that way And that was how several hours later Joe went to his boot blacking stand feeling secure in being near friends and oblivious of the fact that strange eyes were watching all his movements A little later Elliott patronized the stand and in leaving placed his hand on Joe s shoulder and said Nobody will trouble you old fellow Don t say a word it will all come out right I will back you to the limit And after that several pairs of eyes watched every movement of the boot black Several affable strangers gave him quarters for ten cent shines Joe was not in the police net but he was in the vision of those silent men whom one cannot detect those experts employed by men like Oakes Escape was impossible for the negro Joe remained in good spirits for had not mister Elliott befriended him He was ignorant of the doings of those brief hours when he slept Elliott s going to Mona was perhaps unnecessary but he felt a natural curiosity to know Oakes better as well as to see the outcome of the case and the effect of the evidence the negro possessed He was also actuated by a desire to do all he could to establish the accuracy of the boy s statement and to see that he obtained as good treatment as was consistent with the ends of justice He and Martin arrived at Mona the day after the murder our first one at the Mansion The two stayed at the hotel and studied the town finding it impossible to go to the Mansion without creating talk As Martin said We must go slowly and not appear too interested in Oakes or rather Clark as he is known up here so the office informed me So far as we know he has nothing to do with the murder case and we being strangers and consequently subject to comment must be guarded in our actions I have seen and heard enough to realize that there is much suppressed excitement among the people We must communicate with Oakes quietly and find whether it is wise to see him He may not desire our presence at the Mark place CHAPTER XIII The Plan of Campaign Next day as we were at breakfast at the Mansion the masons and carpenters came Curiously enough one of them brought a note from Martin asking if it would be convenient for him to bring a stranger with valuable information to see mister Oakes that morning and the man found it convenient to drop into town a little later and incidentally to meet Martin and let him know that Oakes expected him Then he went to the hardware store and bought a few trifling things 
7946-116281-0000	train-other-500	as any carpenter or mason might do Looks as though I am going to hold a reception this morning said Oakes
none	none	 The Chief of Police making an engagement last night for an interview this morning 
7946-116281-0001	train-other-500	and now Martin asking for another What is Martin doing up here asked Moore Well don t get impatient He has something important anyway Just wait
7946-116281-0002	train-other-500	I think Moore felt aggravated at Oakes s apparent indifference Of course it was simulated but he seemed so calm and oblivious of the mass of happenings
7946-116281-0003	train-other-500	that had put Moore and myself in a state of extreme excitement It was not long before Martin and mister Elliott were with us Oakes received Elliott in a most agreeable manner
none	none	 which placed us all at ease He said he knew mister Elliott by sight and esteemed it greatly that he should extend information to him 
7946-116281-0004	train-other-500	Also he was sure it must be of great value since the gentleman had travelled all the way from New York to place him in possession of it And this was said before any information was given
7946-116281-0005	train-other-500	We saw that our friend was a diplomat Quickly mister Elliott gave all the particulars of the negro s confession and the detective said
none	none	 If I am called into the case by Chief Hallen I shall want to see the boy if not the information should be given to the Chief 
7946-116281-0006	train-other-500	as the matter belongs to his jurisdiction Looking out of the window at that moment
none	none	 I espied Hallen coming up the walk 
7946-116281-0007	train-other-500	Good said Oakes Now mister Elliott will you kindly retire with doctor Moore while Stone Martin and I hear what the Chief has to say When Hallen came up he seemed very cordial but worried
7946-116281-0008	train-other-500	and made no attempt to disguise the fact that he anticipated trouble with the unruly element in Mona by Saturday night You see he said we are few here
7946-116281-0009	train-other-500	and I have been kept busy with the brewing uneasiness in town and cannot handle the murder affair satisfactorily I have come to ask you to help me if you are sufficiently at leisure We cannot get any clues at all
none	none	 save that the man was killed by a bullet of large calibre 
7946-116281-0010	train-other-500	in the hands of a good shot as the distance from which it was fired would seem to show
none	none	 The road has been searched but nothing found and the crowd that went with you to the dying man s side trampled away all clues on the ground 
7946-116281-0011	train-other-500	My men have reported to me the curious affair of last night continued the Chief I suppose you have a explanation for it in any event it must be followed up The people must be diverted
7946-116281-0012	train-other-500	and more must be done at once than I can do Will you help me Yes said Oakes Of course Hello what ails your head said the Chief after thanking him
7946-116281-0013	train-other-500	And then Oakes told him as much as was necessary of the events of the day before I am very glad your carpenters have arrived said the Chief they may help He smiled as did Oakes They understood one another they
7946-116281-0014	train-other-500	were in similar lines of business
none	none	 Now that I have a hand in this thing let s all get acquainted 
7946-116281-0015	train-other-500	said Oakes and he called in Moore and Elliott and the discussion became general Elliott was admitted unreservedly to our councils especially as Oakes knew that he held the keys to the conviction of the assassin
7946-116281-0016	train-other-500	the witness Oakes in his fluent style acquainted the Chief with the fact that the negro was already under surveillance and that in his opinion he should be brought to Mona for further examination Yes
none	none	 but we must smuggle him in It would be unwise to let the populace know we have him now 
7946-116281-0017	train-other-500	they might infer he was the murderer and violence would certainly be done him At present I have all I can do to keep order in the town said Hallen Then he gave a lucid account of the wave of suspicion and of the evidences
none	none	 of nervous tension the citizens were showing Why said he almost every man suspects his neighbor 
7946-116281-0018	train-other-500	Life long friends are suspicious of one another and business is nearly at a standstill
none	none	 One man looked at another in an absent minded sort of a way to day 
7946-116281-0019	train-other-500	and the other retaliated with a blow and an oath and asked him if he would look at his own arms not his neighbor s Yes said Oakes
none	none	 we have here a great mental emotion suspicion to deal with which may amount to a public calamity unless checked 
7946-116281-0020	train-other-500	One must always take account of the actions and reasonings of communities Emotional waves rush through them as through individuals sometimes
7946-116281-0021	train-other-500	Look at history and consider the waves of religion emotional in character that have occurred Look at the unreasonableness developed in our own country from ignorance and fear
none	none	 when witches were burned 
7946-116281-0022	train-other-500	at the stake Oakes said Moore with a smile you seem to make mental processes and conditions
none	none	 as much of a study as the physician does 
7946-116281-0023	train-other-500	Certainly Oakes replied It is most important Did we not study the workings of a criminal s mind for instance
none	none	 we would often be baffled 
7946-116281-0024	train-other-500	You see the determination of the probable condition of such a one s mind is often paramount especially in such a case as this In other words was the motive
7946-116281-0025	train-other-500	one that would naturally sway an ordinary healthy individual under the conditions appertaining to the crime the so called sane motive Or was it in any way dependent upon peculiarities
7946-116281-0026	train-other-500	of the criminal s reasoning a motive built up of something unreal a delusion in the mind of one not in his right senses
7946-116281-0027	train-other-500	I myself had frequently had cause to study such mental processes in the practice of my profession but I was amazed at the knowledge shown by Oakes
7946-116281-0028	train-other-500	and stated in such a broad untechnical manner The man was no ordinary one to be sure but I had scarcely expected him to show such education in these matters I now recalled what Moore
7946-116281-0029	train-other-500	had once told me of Oakes s all round attainments doctor Moore broke the silence
none	none	 You are a lalapazooza Oakes 
7946-116281-0030	train-other-500	Oakes did not notice the remark but said
none	none	 I don t know what other men do but I have tried to bear in mind such things 
7946-116281-0031	train-other-500	Yes said Hallen and consequently there is only one Quintus Oakes It seems to me continued Hallen
none	none	 that your work here at the Mansion will soon lead to results 
7946-116281-0032	train-other-500	and I trust that you will find time to consider the murder also Gentlemen said Oakes very seriously
none	none	 from what I saw after the Mark murder in town and from what you report I feel that Mona is in a very serious plight 
7946-116281-0033	train-other-500	I shall make time Hallen to do what little I can And thus Quintus Oakes became the leader in the unravelling of the Mark murder mystery After a few remarks of no particular consequence
7946-116281-0034	train-other-500	and a more or less general conversation he resumed Suppose Chief that we now smuggle the negro into Mona as soon as possible and bring him here I believe that if mister Elliott goes back with Martin
none	none	 and they explain things to the boy he will come without much trouble 
7946-116281-0035	train-other-500	It must be impressed upon him that he is regarded in the light of a hero appeal to the innate weakness of the race desire for flattery
7946-116281-0036	train-other-500	I believe we can bring him here easily said Elliott for he has confidence in me If he refuses to come said Hallen we can get him here in plenty of ways Yes said Oakes
none	none	 Martin knows how leave it to him Only we must have him soon and he must come here by way of another station 
7946-116281-0037	train-other-500	incognito lest the people become too excited
none	none	 This being agreed upon the conversation became more general and in answer to questions we found that Oakes had not as yet formulated any solution to the mystery of the identity of the murderer As he said the affair of downstairs 
7946-116281-0038	train-other-500	might be connected with the murder indirectly or directly but as yet we had not had sufficient opportunities for studying the surroundings of the house or the life of its attaches to venture an opinion
7946-116281-0039	train-other-500	He laid particular stress upon the fact that opinions should never be formed on poor evidence since a biased mind was incapable of appreciating new discoveries or new clues
7946-116281-0040	train-other-500	To theorize too much was very easy but sometimes fatal to detection of crime He preferred to work along several lines of investigation before concentration on any one idea
none	none	 The affair of last night in my estimation said he 
7946-116281-0041	train-other-500	is one of very grave import Unquestionably from what you saw Stone and from the evidence of us all there were two men near the place you were going to pass
7946-116281-0042	train-other-500	That the first one warned you and was in a sense a friend is mysterious enough it needs solution but that the man who warned you should have run away and been pursued by the other is peculiar to say the least
none	none	 The signals of your companions were heard by the man at the bridge 
7946-116281-0043	train-other-500	undoubtedly and he ran to escape detection himself The other
none	none	 the one on this side who was a probable assassin 
7946-116281-0044	train-other-500	would under ordinary circumstances have run away when he saw you were warned He did run but it was after the man who warned you To my mind the explanation is this continued the detective

spoke and we knew that he was thinking over some little scheme to help Hallen back into popular favor CHAPTER XIV Clues The carpenters and masons came and went in a very business like way all that morning while we were closeted upstairs with our companion and Chief Hallen After he left us Moore and I walked down to the gate and around the grounds leaving Oakes to attend to details with Martin Carpenters were very busy around the dining room carrying in boards and implements and examining the woodwork and the balcony A few of the masons were about the grounds engaged on small details and all seemed to be on good terms with Cook and his wife and Annie Mike was busy at one end of the garden and Maloney was not far off This Stone is to be a day of events here But things are being done very quietly are they not You would suspect nothing out of the way far less a hunt for a murderer or the investigation of a mystery would you No were I not informed I should think that Oakes had merely a gang of laborers at work He has that but he has also a body of the best detectives for the purpose to be had Maloney and Mike are puzzling him considerably Stone they are very close to one another always and seem quite intimate Yes I replied I have noticed it They both show a great deal of interest in these alterations Have you noticed how Maloney is watching O Brien He keeps him continually in sight We had approached the front door of the Mansion as we spoke Oakes was standing just outside his eyes likewise upon the two gardeners Our last remarks were made in his presence and he entered the conversation with a quiet observation to the effect that Maloney seemed to fear that Mike might not attend to his business but that Mike would nevertheless I was obliged to acknowledge that I did not quite understand Oh Mike is a good laborer he explained he needs no such watching and there seemed to be a peculiar significance in his words They were stated in a slow indifferent manner that caused me to look at the speaker but his face wore the inscrutable expression which I had frequently seen before and I learned nothing I knew him well enough by this time however to realize that something was taking shape in his thoughts Now let us go inside said he After lunch we will attack the final solution of the manner in which these mysterious assaults were performed Like all such things it will be simple enough I know and the point remaining to determine will be not how it was done but by whom I feel confident that that door in the cellar room leads upward to an interspace which communicates with the dining room through panels in the walls The peculiar noise the swish that I heard resembled the sudden sliding of a board and it was the conviction that the person who assaulted Moore disappeared into the wall which made me run downstairs I felt sure there would be some explanation of it below That afternoon a systematic search of the entire house was made The cellar room in which the assault upon Oakes had occurred was thoroughly lighted and examined The heap of rubbish which Mike had been investigating at our previous visit proved to be composed of plaster and bricks The wall in which the door was cut was found to be about three feet thick and one of the foundations of the house It was solid save for a chimney like opening which had been trapped with the door Above at the level of the dining room floor the great wall ceased From one edge was continued upwards the original partition between that room and the next the parlor but it was thin and had evidently been recently strengthened by another wall slightly thicker and built from the opposite edge of the foundation leaving a space between the two Into this space entered at a certain point the opening from the cellar room below It was a peculiar arrangement As Oakes remarked the new wall had been made with no regard to the economizing of space for had it been built immediately back of the old considerable room would have been saved for the parlor One of the carpenters thought that the original idea had been to utilize the space for closets The only other possible use for it so far as we could discover was the one which Oakes had surmised ventilation for the cellar Still to our ordinary minds a chimney would have answered that purpose quite as well A little further investigation however showed the top of the foundation wall to be covered with cement well smoothed and the walls themselves were plastered It was generally conceded therefore that the first idea had been to use it as closet room which could easily have been done by cutting doors through the walls As Oakes said the notion had evidently met with opposition and been abandoned so communication had been made with the cellar instead and the roof opened to afford ventilation The opening into the cellar was large A man could easily enter it and standing reach the top of the foundation wall then by a little exertion he could raise himself into the intermural space Oakes Moore and I proved this by actual experiment and found that the passage was quite wide enough to accommodate a man of average proportions I have said that the dining room was finished in oak panels These had been reached from our side of the wall by removing the bricks and mortar the same stuff evidently which helped to form the rubbish heap in the room below One of the larger panels had been made to slide vertically It had been neatly done and had escaped detection from the dining room because of the overlapping of the other panels Some debris still remained between the walls The fellow we are after knew of the space between the walls and worked at the panel after the repairs were completed was Oakes s remark How do you know that asked Moore Oakes looked at him and smiled then said Moore where is your reasoning ability Do you think if the panel had been tampered with at the time the repairs were made that the debris would have been left behind No It would have been removed with the rest of the dirt We had gone to our rooms upstairs while the men were hunting through the tunnel to the well They found nothing everything was as we had left it after our adventures there It seemed to us that all things considered the work on the panel must have been done by someone within the household or at least that some of its members must have been involved in the matter It may have been accomplished at night however and by an outsider said Oakes The servants quarters are separate from the house Anyone might easily have entered the cellar by the tunnel route Still there may have been collusion also It seems a nonsensical idea to leave the debris in the cellar I said No I think not was the answer The care takers are afraid even to enter that place The miscreant knew that detection would be probable at the hands of strangers only That evening Elliott and Martin left for New York They were to bring the negro boy Joe to Mona Late at night before we retired Oakes asked us to go with him into the parlor What for said I To forge another link in the chain the strongest yet he said What Do you remember the cartridge I found in the cellar Yes yes but you did not pay much attention to it I thought He looked gravely at me Stone that cartridge probably corresponds in calibre to the one which was used in the murder of Mark Ah said Moore I had a notion of that myself Why did you not tell us your opinion before Because when I found it we were working on the Mansion affair only I divined the value of the find but why should I have mentioned it I was not hunting the Mark murderer then Quintus you consummate fox you worked Hallen well Not at all business is business What is the use of gossiping There are no ladies to be entertained in my profession Doctor He led the way to the parlor we meekly following to where a cluster of arms hung upon the wall one of those ornaments of crossed swords guns and a shield so common in old houses He remarked that he had noticed these arms on his previous visit He looked at a revolver hanging across the shield with a pouch beneath it and then suddenly in surprise said Last time I was here a few weeks ago there was a large old fashioned revolver here of forty four or forty five calibre I remember it well being interested in firearms This one now here is of a similar pattern and appearance but of smaller calibre and newer Look The cartridges in this pouch are of about forty five size they belong to the old weapon and cannot be used with this one Again some of them are missing there were at least a dozen before now there are only three or four The old revolver and some cartridges have been taken away and a newer weapon substituted Indeed But why said Moore sceptically Partly because and Oakes was decisive curt master of the situation because this one cannot be loaded See He then tried to turn the chamber and showed us that the mechanism was faulty The old revolver said he in a low tone and some cartridges were taken away and in order that its absence should be less noticeable this one was left here it being useless Now boys the cartridge I found downstairs on the cellar floor is a forty five calibre and belongs to those of the pouch and the original revolver as you see He took it from his pocket and showed us that it did not fit the weapon in his hand but matched the cartridges in the pouch It belonged to the old weapon We are closing in said I Yes the man of the robe has the old revolver and cartridges he took them within the last few days finding his own weapon out of order It is he who is responsible for the mystery in this house and in all probability it is he who shot Winthrop Mark You remember the evidence at the inquest showed that a heavy revolver had been used a forty four or forty five calibre exactly such an one as the old weapon which I saw here Excellent Oakes remarked Moore There s only one objection Yes I know said Oakes You were going to ask why the fellow did not take all these cartridges and put his own in the pouch to match the weapon he left here Exactly said Moore Well said the detective he either had no cartridges of his own handy or else like all criminals however smart he tripped the brain of no man is capable of adjusting his actions precisely in every detail Guess you re right No man can be perfect in his reasoning and no matter how clever the criminal he is almost certain to make an error sooner or later said Moore Yes but it takes peculiar power to discover it I chirped The events of the day had tired me and my mind was growing confused I desired to go to bed Oakes smiled slightly No Stone it takes study worry and patient reasoning to discover the faulty link in a clever criminal s logic that is why there is a profession like mine I was half asleep but I heard him continue We may consider we have excellent cause to look for a man who has in his possession an ancient revolver and some very old dirty cartridges covered with verdigris like these here Murder will out I interpolated Yes eventually sometimes However it is easy to say he who had that revolver did the murder but as it may have been destroyed since then or thrown into the river it is another thing to find the man We were crestfallen Oakes himself looked wearied I wish the whole Mansion was in the river and there were a decent cafe round here protested Moore You re a vigorous pair of assistants I must say said Quintus I have some samples in my room Come and we all adjourned CHAPTER XV The Ruse After all however the doctor and I decided to spend the night at the hotel and acquire any information that we could as to occurrences in town We chose to walk along the River Road to the Corners keeping ourselves on the alert for any treachery The night was cool and bracing and the sky cloudless As we journeyed the moon rose throwing its rays athwart the tangled outline of the wood The great high trees were just beginning to drop their leaves Occasionally a woody giant separated from the rest would fix our attention standing silhouetted against the background of forest majestic alone like a sentinel guarding the thousands in column behind An occasional flutter of a night bird or the falling and rustling of the dead leaves was all that we heard as we walked rapidly the mile to the Corners As we were about to round into the Highway and leave the forest of the estate behind us Moore grasped my arm and led me to the deep shadow of a tree by the roadside Hark That sounds peculiar he said We listened and heard a thumping sound repeated at intervals An uneasy horse standing somewhere in the woods hereabouts said I Yes What is he doing there at this time of night and in these particular woods We consulted together and waited Then having satisfied ourselves that the noise came from the woods of the estate near the crest of the hill we decided to investigate as quickly as possible and entered the forest stealthily and with but little noise Unused to the life of the woods we doubtless made more rustling than was necessary but we were favored by the fact that the trees were not very close together and in consequence the carpet of dead leaves was not thick Halting behind the trunks of trees occasionally we listened for the sound which came from further within the wood Soon we came to an opening a glade perhaps two hundred feet from the road The moonlight fell upon the far side but on the side next us all was shadow dark and sombre We stood well within it among the trees I fancied I heard a horse whinny The animal was certainly restive I saw the doctor take out his revolver and lie carefully down behind a tree I remained standing We both waited we were within a few feet of one another but did not speak Suddenly on the far side we saw a figure walking towards the shade and heard him say a few words to the horse Quickly he led the animal away into what appeared to be a path Moore whispered to me Watch the road he is going there We retraced our steps and soon saw the horse appear on the edge of the wood He was a large powerful animal and seemed to act as though he understood what was expected of him The man was still leading the horse but was now also speaking in a low voice to someone else who disappeared toward the town and came out on the Highway further down walking rapidly toward the village as any belated citizen might See said Moore He brought the horse and is going back Watch the rider The latter had been standing in the shade looking after the man who had gone when suddenly seeming satisfied that he was not watched he vaulted into the saddle He came out into the moonlight in a second or two and rode rapidly up River Road past the Corners and northward away from the town We had managed to get near the road and as he dashed into the open we saw that he held the reins with the left hand his right resting on the horse s neck and in it as we both recognized a revolver A splendid rider was my remark Yes said Moore Did you recognize him It was Mike I thought Yes Mike it was and acting in a very suspicious manner He has done this before evidently knew the road and the horse and was on the lookout for trouble for he was armed We decided to follow the first man it being useless to attempt to overtake the rider Taking the darkest side of the road we walked on after the figure in the distance Soon my companion s spirits began to rise and he laughed at our adventure as he called it Stone I cannot help thinking that you and I are destined to become great sleuths We have been away from the Mansion only a short half hour and already have detected a man on horseback who is carrying a revolver and have identified him as Mike Yes we re improving but why did you lie down behind that tree Afraid No answered Moore with a laugh I have been studying caution I want to see Broadway again Then he continued Stone this adventure is becoming more and more complicated and occasionally I wonder if I was not foolish in coming here It is so different from practising surgery this being assaulted by invisible foes seeing victims of murder and things like that to say nothing of men chasing one another by moonlight He was half serious and I acknowledged that the affair was rather nerve wearing Then we looked ahead and suddenly realized that the figure we were following had vanished Moore gasped in astonishment Hang it all we certainly are a pair of apes to let that fellow get away Won t Oakes be disgusted Yes and he will have good cause The lesson was a needful but costly one Thenceforth when on business we ceased to discuss our feelings and endeavored to use our eyes and ears more and our tongues less We received a cordial welcome from the people at the hotel and gossiped around the corridor for some time The crowd outside was sullen but within the atmosphere seemed less strained We learned that Chief Hallen had made several arrests that afternoon a measure which had had a sobering effect The saloons had been warned not to abuse their privileges Many persons spoke of the work done by Hallen as excellent indeed we were both impressed by the fact that the sentiment toward him of the better citizens was friendly Considerable disgust was expressed however privately of course at the lack of evidence so far bearing upon the murder itself In the course of the evening we managed to see Reilly the porter and he pointed out several men to us These fellows are new in town they must be detectives If they discover things well and good but if they don t the people here won t stand it they will resent what they call outside work Hallen must have gone in for business said I Reilly grew confidential No it ain t Hallen they say There s a lot of talk about some New York man coming up here to run things Who Oh they say that Quintus Oakes you ve heard of him of course is coming soon and these are some of his men Indeed And Moore and I exchanged glances But say continued the porter that is confidential only we fellows round here know it We parted from Reilly Moore said If they know about it in here of course half of the town has heard already Yes The tale was doubtless started by Hallen as a great secret he knew it would spread Evidently Oakes has not been recognized by the people as yet No I rejoined but the fact that the rumor is out shows to my mind that Hallen and Oakes have some little scheme on hand At any rate we must know nothing of Oakes remember that he is Clark to all but a select few We decided to go to one of the newspaper offices after a brief call on Chief Hallen who gave us no news of value but was nevertheless very agreeable He advised us to see Dowd and gave us a note to him We found the newspaper man at his office just finishing his night s work He was very attentive in furnishing us back copies of his rival s paper the Daily News He said he kept them filed as samples of daring journalism I have only been a couple of years in this business but I have the pedigree of the town in these newspapers I got them from people who had saved them as country people will Skinner would not sell me any the rascal Whenever he grows fresh and criticises things improperly I investigate what he has previously said on the subject and then publish a deadly parallel column He has a rather poor memory and I worry him once in a while he remarked with a laugh We found the paper which corresponded in date to the piece we had taken from the robe There was a full account of the murder of Smith which we read but nothing that seemed to us of any value On that occasion no clues whatever had been found Only again the local physicians had thought the wound was made by a large ball The old chief of that time had been succeeded by Hallen who had never been able to gain any definite clue to the murderer The interest had then died out and the mystery became a thing of the past Dowd discussed the similarity of the recent murder to that of Smith and hinted moreover that he knew the identity of our friend Clark He said Hallen had made a confidant of him as he might want to make use of his newspaper By the way speaking of the old murder there is something that has never been published but which some of the old codgers about here have cherished as perhaps relating to it What is it asked the doctor Well a couple of old men who have since died both milkmen used to say that once or twice they had seen a woman near the scene of the murder at that hour in the morning Also that she always ran into the woods and was dressed in black Who were those old men Well they were both reliable fellows Their tales were laughed at so they refused to discuss the matter any more They both claimed to have seen her at a distance however and since they were on different wagons their stories seemed to corroborate each other We expressed our great interest in the news and Dowd advised us to see Reilly the porter who had heard the story of the woman from the men themselves We returned to the hotel feeling much elated at the courtesy of Dowd and at the prospect of learning something not generally known and bearing upon the murder Soon we managed to find Reilly He came to our rooms on the excuse that we had some orders to give concerning baggage that had not yet arrived from New York The porter was decidedly intelligent having been reduced to his present position through adversity as we already knew It took only a little questioning to elicit his story which he told about as follows You see gentlemen about the time of Smith s murder the milkmen were in the habit of watering their horses at an old fountain just by our curb but since done away with Well about two weeks before Smith was murdered one of the milkmen Moses Inkelman a driver for a large farm north of here told me that he had that morning seen a very large woman on the crest of the hill as he was driving to town She was seemingly anxious to avoid notice and stepped into the woods as he passed by Moses asked me if I thought she was anyone from Mona He seemed so curious about the matter that several who had heard his story laughed at him He was very sensitive and did not mention the episode again until after the murder long after I remember and then only to me when he said If these people would only stop making fun of a Jew and believe me they might learn something He disappeared a little while afterward and we learned from his successor that he had suddenly died of heart disease on the farm The other milkman never told his story save to a few one night around the stove in a grocery store The others were inclined to scoff at him but I remembered what Moses had told me and saw this fellow Sullivan alone It was about a year after the affair He said that he had seen a woman s figure lurking around the crest of the hill on two different occasions before the murder Did he say anything about her appearance I asked No He said he never came very near to her but he saw that she always wore black and ran very heavily He thought she was one of the drunken creatures that sometimes infest the water front on Saturday nights You see gentlemen there were more factories here then and the town was tougher than it is now especially along the railroad and shore where the canal boats came in The new piers farther down the river have changed all that Sullivan told his story to the police but they saw nothing in it or pretended they didn t so Sullivan shut up What became of him Moore asked Well sir that s the curious part of it to my mind He was found dead only a short time ago on River Road way down near Lorona and there were marks on his throat and blood in his mouth The examiner said he had had a hemorrhage and had choked to death scratching himself in his dying struggles But Well continue commanded Moore Gentlemen I believe he was murdered Why what makes you think so I asked I saw the body at the undertaker s in Lorona gentlemen and the marks on the neck were not only scratches but black and blue patches The examiner was a drunkard himself and not a good reasoner I always had the idea that the milkman was choked to death by the woman because he had seen her And the other fellow Moses I think he was done away with likewise continued Reilly I tell you gentlemen there is more to all this than is perhaps wise to know unless one keeps pretty quiet We tipped Reilly a good fee and then turned in for the night in a most uncomfortable frame of mind As Moore said things are coming up so rapidly here that we will all be twisted before long Our visit to the town had so far proved more valuable than we had hoped for and we both wished that Oakes could have been with us Several times in the night I awoke and each time heard footsteps passing to and fro and subdued voices in the corridor downstairs and could but reflect how very different this was from the usual quietude of such a place When we arose in the morning Moore remarked that he never knew of such a noisy hotel in a small town Guess the place is going to give me nervous prostration pretty soon if things keep up like this said he While we were at breakfast Chief Hallen walked in and sat down beside us in a rather pompous manner I thought He seemed desirous of calling attention to himself Well gentlemen he said in a quiet enough way don t be taken aback at anything you may witness to day You may have a surprise I want you to meet me in the hotel corridor soon and see who comes on the nine o clock train He bade us adieu and walked out in an unnaturally aggressive manner He s showing off like a schoolboy said I Or else acting corrected Moore We sat down in the corridor by and by Hallen was talking with the clerk at the desk The hangers on were numerous and wore an air of expectancy they were waiting for some one The rickety old carriage from the station arrived at this moment and the man on the box opened the door with more than usual courtesy Out stepped a medium sized man of good figure and a most remarkable face It was bronzed like that of a seafaring man the eyes were black as jet and piercing the nose hooked and rather long He wore a thick short moustache which matched his hair and eyes in blackness otherwise his face was smooth shaven and his attire was in the perfection of good taste for a business man When he spoke one noticed particularly his strong white even teeth He looks like a pirate from the Spanish Main dressed up said Moore A remarkably attractive fellow anyway Yes I said he has the air of a celebrated man of some kind As he walked to the desk the by standers spoke in subdued tones watching him the while I heard one lounger say Sure that is the fellow I ve seen him before Ain t he a wonder in looks Chief Hallen advanced and spoke a few words to the stranger and then shook hands with him He registered and the clerk thumped the bell for Reilly with an air of tremendous importance As though by accident Chief Hallen espied us and taking the stranger by the arm walked over to us We arose and bowed as the Chief repeated our names saying so that those near could hear Gentlemen you are from the city Let me make you acquainted with one of your fellow citizens mister Quintus Oakes of New York Moore calmly shook hands and mumbled something and then in a side whisper to me said It s up to you Stone say something Although I was nearly as surprised as he I managed to make a few audible remarks about how glad the town would be to know that Quintus Oakes was here I saw a merry twinkle in Hallen s eyes but the stranger made a suitable reply and left us with that peculiar business like air of his I turned to Moore and half gasped What does this mean old man A decoy said he Just keep your nerve Hallen has been giving us practice in acting The by standers and the groups in the street were discussing the stranger with peculiar suppressed excitement Many of the smart ones claimed to have seen him before and to know all about him already Quintus Oakes rang familiarly from their lips We presently returned to the Mansion and related to our leader the facts we had learned from Reilly regarding the woman s appearances before the murder the sudden ending of both the milkmen who had seen her and Reilly s own suspicions in the matter Oakes was thoughtful for quite a while You have done more than I thought you could in so brief a time said he at last Have you any theories regarding the identity of the woman We had none to offer and he began to smile ever so slightly Well it seems to me your woman is a mistake there was no woman The assassin was a man in a black robe He ran heavily of course You have drawn the murderer of Smith nearer to that of Mark As regards the sudden deaths of the milkmen probably both were killed the examinations after death conducted as these were amount to nothing The murderer of Smith the two milkmen and of Mark is probably one and the same Stone you nearly fell a victim at the bridge the other night too I did not reply but a cold perspiration broke out over me The chain of events seemed clearer now in the light of Oakes s reasoning Then he turned to Moore Doctor loan me your cigar cutter will you The physician reached for it but it was gone I think this must be it said Oakes holding out the missing article Next time you hide on your stomach behind a tree do it properly Moore was dumfounded What I cried you know that too We did not tell you No you did not You began your narration at the wrong end or perhaps you forgot and his eyes twinkled But how did you learn of it demanded Moore recovering And Quintus smiled outright My man was behind another tree only ten feet away from you the whole time When you left he picked up this as a memento of your brilliant detective work Moore and I smarted a little under the sarcasm and I asked what the man was doing there Oh he was watching Mike and incidentally keeping you two from mischief You need a guardian You never even suspected his presence and suppose he had been the assassin Well I said I suppose that you know all about your namesake in town and don t need any of our information He heard the chagrin in my voice and smiled as he replied Don t mind those little things they happen to all of us I am glad Quintus Oakes has arrived Chief Hallen and I concluded that the sudden arrival of such a man as our decoy would have a salutary effect on the citizens An appearance of action on Hallen s part would tend to quiet their restlessness and now that public attention is focused upon him mister Clark and his friends can work more freely During the discussion that followed he told us that Mike s errand on horseback was as yet unknown but that the man whom we followed and lost on the way was from a stable in Lorona You see continued he Mike has been doing this before The horse is brought from Lorona in a roundabout way Doubtless on his return he leaves it at some spot where it is met and returned to the stable Mike is a mystery What is he up to said Moore Can he be the murderer Wait and see replied Oakes enigmatically as he ended the conversation CHAPTER XVI The Negro s Story Saturday came and went without event So far at least Hallen s arrangements for the preservation of order had been effective Or was it that the eyes and hopes of the people were centred upon the new arrival in town the great detective as they were led to believe who had grown famous through his skill in ferreting out just such mysteries In any case the Chief s forebodings of a lawless outbreak were unfulfilled The real Oakes spent most of his time in the Mansion while we remained in town but our little party came and went as it pleased Our movements had ceased to attract that attention which Oakes found so undesirable As he said in the well known phrase of the sleight of hand operators the more you look the less you see The eyes of Mona were focused on the false Oakes the wrong hand we ourselves the hand doing the trick were over looked And the more absorbed they became in the movements of the decoy the more oblivious were they of the fact that keen eyes were studying them deeply The criminal unless very educated and clever would be fooled with the multitude and caught off his guard A rather curious fact was that while Dowd s newspaper published an article in its personal column about the great detective s arrival and all that he was expected to accomplish Skinner s journal remained absolutely silent Dowd said he could not understand it unless the ruse had failed to deceive Skinner in which case we might hear from him soon We knew that our friend Quintus Oakes held the same idea As he said if the cheat were discovered it would lead to trouble which must be met as it arose Moore and I became daily more imbued with the spirit of the adventure besides which we were keenly alive to Oakes s feelings and his desire to succeed The newspapers far and near were following the case carefully and we knew that his reputation and financial success depended largely on the outcome of this case A few evenings later Moore and I were standing in the square discussing the very apparent change in the temper of the crowd since their attention had been directed by the arrival of the man they believed to be Quintus Oakes Yes said Moore in answer to a remark of mine it is a clever scheme and makes the people think that Hallen is doing something but how will they take it if they discover the trick Well perhaps by that time the real Oakes our friend will be in position to reveal his identity that would calm any bad feeling they would realize that work had been done quietly all the while Moore shook his head doubtfully I don t like Skinner s attitude he said he knows something Reilly approached us at this moment to say that Clark wanted us at the Mansion immediately and that a conveyance was waiting for us at the hotel We went at once and found it a four seated affair with Hallen and Dowd on the back seat We two sat in front with the driver one of Oakes s men and after we had left the town I turned to the Chief and asked him if he knew what Oakes wanted of us Yes said he the negro is here Oakes was awaiting us upstairs with Martin and Elliott The first thing we learned was that Oakes had recognized the negro Joe as a former boot black on Broadway Joe s identification of him during the court scene had placed the negro in a state of less fear than would otherwise have been the case He came readily enough said Martin he was threatened with arrest if he did not but he is acting peculiarly Seems more worried than an innocent man should be He naturally dreads the ordeal innocent men frequently appear guilty to the onlooker The really guilty ones are prepared and go through more coolly said Oakes Yes sir I know that but this one is different I should hardly say he is guilty still his actions are peculiar I cannot explain how Think a little Martin said Oakes It was the tone of the superior firm but kindly Martin thought a few seconds then he said Well sir he seems anxious to describe what he saw and seems to think that you are his friend and will believe him but he appears to be actually fearful of punishment Rather ambiguous said Oakes Perhaps he is hiding some vital point Martin Is he not Yes sir and that point is against himself Of course it is or he would not hide it against himself or one dear to him Oakes s correction was without malice polite and patient He was the clear reasoner the leader instructing a trusty subordinate the kindly Chief and his young but able lieutenant We ranged ourselves round the centre table we four who had come in the carriage besides Elliott and Martin who had brought Joe from New York Oakes stood near a chair away from the table and the group After a moment the negro entered ushered to the door by one of the men We must have looked a formidable conclave to the poor fellow for he halted just inside the door at sight of us all He was a negro of that type seen in the North strong lithe with a clear cut face whose features showed the admixture of white blood He advanced to the chair besides Oakes and sat down at a sign from the latter He was nervous but a pitiful effort at bravery showed in his carriage and manner Bravery was necessary A lone negro boy facing such a gathering and worst of all to him that mysterious awe inspiring person Quintus Oakes With consummate tact Quintus won the boy s confidence Elliott spoke to him kindly and reassuringly and Hallen walked over and shook his hand with a protecting air Joe brightened visibly It was plain that the men who hunted crime were going to try kindness and sympathy first It has always seemed to me a pity that such tactics are not more in vogue especially toward witnesses The master detective can throw a sympathy into his every act which will win secrets actually barred from other methods of attack Reassured Joe presently began his story In a clear remarkably able way for he had been to school and with the peculiar dramatic power possessed by some negroes he brought vividly before us the scenes he had witnessed As he warmed to his subject Oakes and Hallen watched him carefully but without emotion occasionally questioning him adroitly to develop points which seemed to them valuable Dowd took notes at Oakes s suggestion for future use When Joe s mother died in Troy he went up to attend the funeral On his return he stayed a few days in Lorona a little place already mentioned It was without railway connections and lay to the east of Mona along the Highway He had passed through the latter place afoot late at night and had walked the ten miles to Lorona His sister lived there in service also his sweetheart Jennie Naturally he did not pass it by He had left very early one morning to go back to New York and had cut across country from the Highway on the east of Mona coming around by the hill and the pond in front of the Mansion to River Road He had arrived at the Corners in time to see a milkman pick up a gentleman on the road and drive with him into the town Joe wanted to get back to New York early and begin work for he had been absent a week He was to catch the seven o clock train so he had abundance of time as he could tell by the sun He started down the hill slowly but took the woods along the north side of the Highway he was fond of the woods and he knew the way he had travelled it on previous visits Just after he entered among the trees he heard a shot followed by a groan on the road he thought a little way above him He trembled and stood still then his courage manifested itself and he crept cautiously to the roadside which was hidden below by a few feet of embankment What he saw paralyzed him A man was lying in the road and a little lower down on this side not a hundred feet from himself stood another in full view with a smoking revolver in his hand Instantly the negro understood A murder and he was a witness He did nothing waited To have shouted would have been to invite death But he kept his eyes open I se the only witness I must look at him good he thought The man s back was partly turned but Joe took in all that he could at that distance and saw him retreat after a moment into the woods Then he grew frightened The assassin was not far from him but fortunately going deeper into the woods and down toward the stony glade below Did the negro run No He gathered a couple of good sized stones and followed He thought the man on the road was dead and he saw the other one going down into the gully to cross the small stream at the bottom Good he thought I ll follow him If he sees me now and comes after me I can run a long way before he can climb that hill The assassin was picking his way carefully until he came to the rocky bottom He wanted to cross the stream where a large flat rock gave an invitation for stepping He had followed the stony formation carefully avoiding the earth he did not wish to leave marks to be traced Now at this moment the negro became conscious of a new danger he was near the scene of the crime alone and if found he would be suspected of having done it So he looked about for a moment and then decided to run back to Lorona and his people He was growing scared Who could blame him He saw the murderer stoop down right below him deep in the gully and the negro obeying a sudden impulse swung one arm and hurled a stone straight at him It struck the fugitive on the shoulder turning him half around and he broke into a run full tilt for the brook and the stepping stone Joe had not seen the murderer s face but he told us that the man s chest was protected only by an undershirt It was a chilly morning and the fact had impressed him afterward as curious He watched and saw the assassin take the brook like a frightened stag landing first on the rock in the centre then on the other side As he stepped on the rock in the middle of the stream the boy saw something fall from his waist something red It fell into the water I d like to know what that is he thought but I d better skip Then horror took possession of him he crossed the road quickly and dashed into the Mark property Then he ran to River Road and the bridge up the incline on the other side of the pond and into the fields beyond On he went until Mona was passed then he sat down in a little patch of wood and thought He was sure nobody had seen him except a farmer in the distance too far away to know he was a negro He was innocent and perhaps he had better wait and see the police Had he done so then and there all would have been solved sooner than it was but poor boy he had no one to advise him and he was alone with a terrible secret He had done well he could identify the murderer perhaps his was a great responsibility He stayed around and from afar witnessed the crowds of the morning In the afternoon he sneaked into town hungry and worn and terribly cold When he saw the people gathering in the court room curiosity conquered He listened with all his soul and made up his mind to go in and tell what he knew He saw Oakes come forward to give his testimony and his heart beat fast and furious He felt ill the cold sweat poured from him as he heard but he remained entranced He was going to tell all for surely that tall fellow Clark they were calling him was the great detective Oakes he had shined his shoes many times at the stand on Broadway before he went up town How peculiar that they didn t seem to know him Then intelligence came and he said to himself These people don t know him because he does not want them to Joe did not understand all that had been said but he knew things were uncanny and that this man Oakes was playing a game Suddenly had come the statement of Oakes about the arms and the tension became too great He cried out and ran like the fleet footed boy that he was for Lorona There he told nothing except that he had missed the train His friends gave him food the murder story was yet vague in the little village and then he dashed on for New York He shook the dust from his clothes and catching a train miles down the line arrived safely in town He was far away from Mona at last but he must see mister Elliott his good friend and tell him all that he could As the negro finished his story he looked around and partially recovered from the state of ecstasy into which the recitation had thrown him His eyes were rolling and shifting his dark skin had that peculiar ashen color that comes to the negro under stress of great excitement doctor Moore arose and walked to the boy and placing his hands on his wrist said reassuringly Good boy Joe you are a brave fellow Oakes handed him a drink of brandy he needed it and then we all joined in praising him He soon recovered himself and then Oakes took up his position beside him again Now Joe what did the murderer drop when he jumped over the stream from the rock I dunno Master Oakes but it was a banana I think What said Hallen a banana The negro looked worried Yes it did look like one of dose red white spotted cloths wat de niggers down South wear on their heads We all laughed Oh a bandana handkerchief Joe And Joe laughed also in relief And now continued Oakes what did it do Did it float away The boy thought a moment then his quick brain came to his aid No no Master Oakes it splashed sure enough it did It went down so help me Gawd Good said Oakes It contained something heavy then Now Joe he continued slowly and clearly tell me when you heard the evidence that the murderer was the man with a mark on his arm why did you say Oh Gawd and run away We all felt uneasy the question was so unexpected to some of us at least The negro hesitated stammered and lurched forward in his chair Great beads of perspiration stood out on his brow and on the back of his hands Oakes was behind him and in a caressing way slid his left arm across the boy s chest We divined instantly that that arm was ready to shoot up around the boy s neck for a strangle hold Joe tried to speak but could not I saw Hallen prepare for a spring and Martin edge toward the door doctor Moore s breathing came deep and fast and I began to feel like shouting aloud What did it mean Come Speak boy speak said Oakes No answer Then Oakes stooped forward and said loudly enough for us all to hear but right in the negro s ear Boy you ran because you have a scar on your left arm We were on our feet in an instant The murderer we cried The negro made a frantic effort to rise but the arm closed on his neck and Oakes s right hand came down on his right wrist Joe s left hand went to the arm at his neck but he was powerless In a voice as firm as a rock clear and emotionless Oakes cried out Don t move boy Don t try to run And then he said to us This boy is not the murderer he is only a scared unfortunate negro and I will prove it The meaning of the words came to the boy gradually and he became limp in the chair Oakes relaxed his hold Now boy if you try to run we will bore you and Chief Hallen drew his revolver and put it before him on the table Now Joe show us your arm commanded Oakes The negro arose staggering and took off his outer garment and his shirt There on his left arm was a large irregular birthmark blue and vicious looking Oakes looked at it Gentlemen this boy is a victim of circumstances This is no cross but the coincidence of a mark on the left arm has scared him nearly to death That in my opinion is why he was afraid and why he acted so peculiarly This was said deliberately and with emphasis The negro fell on his knees Oh Gawd Oh mister Oakes Dat is it Dat is it I never done any murder No no no and he burst into racking sobs The strain was terrible Dowd opened a window Hallen spoke How are you to prove his innocence mister Oakes as you said There was a slight element of doubt in the question Get up boy said Oakes get up And turning to us the cool man looked long at us all then said The evidence showed conclusively that the weapon used was a heavy one of forty five calibre probably a revolver in all likelihood and fired from a distance of about one hundred and fifty feet That means a good shot Now this boy is right handed as you have noticed but he could not use his right hand to shoot with for the first two fingers have been amputated near the ends Plenty of loss to preclude good pistol shooting To have used such a weapon with the left hand and with such accuracy is out of the question save for a fancy shot If this boy could shoot like that he would not be boot blacking for a living Again he has not noticeably strong arms nor a wrist powerful enough to handle a heavy weapon properly The boy is innocent in my opinion Oakes you are a demon said Hallen Oh no I hope not only I hate to see mistakes made too often Poor devil And Oakes patted the boy on the back With a pathetic dog like expression sobbing with joy the befriended negro seized the man s right hand and kneeling showered kisses upon it CHAPTER XVII Checkmated The negro was led away He was in better spirits now and smiling as only a negro can That extraordinary genius the mystic Oakes had by a process of reasoning that Joe himself was able to follow not only cleared him of suspicion but made a hero of him The innate vanity of the race was reacting on the boy and coming to the rescue of his nervous system recently so severely strained When he had gone Oakes turned to us and interrupting our exclamations remarked Now that we are all here together it would be wise perhaps briefly to review what clues we have obtained and their probable significance We all assented to this suggestion and by tacit consent Quintus Oakes began First we have found that the cartridge picked up in the cellar and evidently dropped by the man in the robe is of the same pattern as the old ones in the pouch upstairs They all belong to the old revolver which was taken away from its place and for which another was substituted since my first visit here With regard to its calibre the important point that old revolver meets the requirements of our deductions about the weapon used to murder mister Mark Therefore we have a chain of evidence connecting my assailant in the cellar the man in the robe with the assassin We know also that the revolver was fired not far from the hundred and fifty foot distance the man was an excellent shot for you must consider the old style of weapon He must have been large or at least strong in the wrist for a good shot with such a weapon cannot be made by a weak person I interrupted The murder of Smith was considered to be due to a pistol ball of large calibre Could the same weapon have been used It could said Oakes That one has been in the family for years The style of the cartridges is somewhat similar to our modern ones but they are very old as we know by their appearance Further he continued in my opinion the woman story connected with the Smith murder is based on a man in a black robe It may have been the same man who is at the bottom of these later mysteries though we are to remember that when mister Mark was killed Joe saw no robe In the annals of crime we find very few women doing murder in that way it is a man s method We must look then for a strong wristed man a man who has also strong arms and a cross on the left one finally a man with a knowledge of revolvers and who has in his possession or has had a large old fashioned weapon and cartridges and also a robe And one thing more strikes me added Oakes in a slow deliberate voice he is a man with a mania an insane man always or at intervals Yes said the doctor I had concluded so too Oakes The wearing of a robe especially in a confined place like the wall space the cutting out of a panel and the peculiar method of attack seem nonsensical and without proper reason And the absence of provocation for those assaults and for the murder of good men like Smith and Mark point strongly to an unbalanced mind Probably correct Oakes replied And I should say that the insanity is present at intervals only mister Oakes said Chief Hallen then don t you think it advisable to investigate that story of the bandana handkerchief as soon as possible Affairs in town may become pressing at any time and we may be needed there Yes Chief certainly We should lose no time about it said Oakes Then he spoke to Martin and the latter retired and presently returned with Joe The detective asked the boy if he would go and point out the stone from which the murderer was leaping when the handkerchief fell into the water You know it is nearly full moon and several of my men will go with you and so will mister Martin The negro assented reluctantly though bravely for he was not devoid of superstition Oakes called in four of his men and said Go with mister Martin and Joe Take lanterns and find the handkerchief which is at the bottom of the stream if the boy is telling the truth and the murderer has not recovered it He did not notice it drop did he Joe No Master Oakes he just flew along and never looked round He did not know where it dropped The negro was using good English and standing erect with a very important expression He was innocent and the central figure now He realized that dignity was becoming An educated boy of his race can show great self control under such circumstances Vanity thou Goddess of Transformation While the searching party was gone we spent the time discussing Mike s peculiarities most of all his horseback ride in the moonlight a curious departure for a hired man This whole thing is unusual in the extreme Stone Since the night that you were escorted to the pond by Chief Hallen s men and there warned of impending danger and your unknown friend was chased by the man lying in wait for you I have had a net around Mike and Maloney and Cook but with negative results said Oakes You see Maloney and Cook go about their business in a quiet fashion while Mike cannot be approached very well the men report him as very shrewd and suspicious Did you find out where Mike went on his horseback trip No that is another curious thing The Lorona man who brought him the horse says he has done it for a few days and received good pay The horse was always returned promptly once or twice by a boy the other times by Mike himself To have done that Mike must have walked back from Lorona said Hallen No he may have ridden part way We found a man this evening who saw him take a team on the Lorona Highway and ride into Mona after dark Where is Mike now I inquired Since the episode of that horseback ride witnessed by doctor Moore and yourself he has disappeared Disappeared Yes eluded all our men and never returned the horse Skipped Got away we cried in amazement Yes but he won t stay away long he will come back We did not quite understand Oakes s speech but there evidently was something behind it At this point with his characteristic swiftness of movement he lighted a cigar and began to smoke offering the box to us all That meant that as far as he was concerned talking on business had ceased for a time He was now recreating Elliott and I walked to a window and looked out upon the front walk and the road conversing upon the manner in which Joe had been brought to Mona He had resisted the idea at first but through the efforts of Martin and Elliott and the promise of a reward he had finally consented to the journey They had explained to him that his refusal would defeat the ends of justice and that escape was impossible and when he realized that he had been unconsciously talking to watchers and polishing their shoes in his innocence he saw the folly of further remonstrance Thus was the important evidence of the negro secured The strain of events was telling on us all Quintus Oakes showed his deep concern by a tendency to leave us and remain alone As Elliott and I were talking he looked at the rolling hills beyond the pond and exclaimed Look Can I be mistaken mister Stone Look in the direction of Mona away off on the plateau is not that a horse I followed his pointing and discovered in the moonlight the figure of a horse advancing rapidly over the blue green fields along the path that led to the bridge Oakes advanced to the window and gazed intently shading his eyes with his hands On the crest of the hill that dipped to the pond the horse soon stood out clearly against the dark blue of the sky We could see a figure which had lain low on his neck rise and sit straight in the saddle then flash a light From near the road on our side of the pond came an answering light a man stood there and exchanged signals with the horseman The rider was moving his arms rapidly and with them the light The other was answering in a similar manner Oakes remained quiet and we all gathered at the window about him What is it I asked He turned and said to me Here write as I read I took an envelope and pencil from my pocket and wrote as Oakes deciphered the signals A message from Mona he cried Quick Then he read the letters as they appeared Discovered Skinner has extra out Pronounces me false says Hallen has tricked the town Beware of Skinner Tell Hallen to look out Am off for New York Then came a long wave over the head and the horseman dashed back toward Lorona We detected another horseman at a little distance who joined him they rapidly disappeared together Excellent exclaimed Oakes He has done his duty well We saw the man on this side run post haste for the Mansion As he rushed up the steps Oakes met him All right boy I saw the signals myself Then to us he said Quintus Oakes the false is discovered That was he he came to warn us Then Skinner has caught on confound him said Dowd and we all silently assented Oakes paced the room slowly Boys we have been unexpectedly checked The enemy has a strong hand there is trouble ahead Yes there is that retorted the vigorous Hallen I must get away to headquarters gentlemen Correct answered Oakes and we will go with you Chief If trouble is coming we will be useless here With one accord we prepared to depart for Mona immediately The carriage was brought to the door and saddle horses also Then we waited anxiously for the return of Martin s party We were not long delayed A commotion in the hall was heard and in stepped Joe and Martin followed by the men Oakes s assistant advanced and laid a red handkerchief dotted with white spots upon the table It was wet and heavy and knotted by its four corners so as to form a pouch We found it sir in about two feet of water partly covered with sand Its weight was gradually sinking it into the bottom Joe laughed hysterically and lapsed into negro dialect See Mars Oakes see boss I dun tole you the truth Oakes seized the handkerchief and we all looked inside It contained a few large cartridges They match the one I found in the cellar and those of the old revolver said Oakes The man of the Mansion mysteries and assaults is the murderer of mister Mark We were intensely excited as we stood there viewing the evidence that was so conclusive Not one of us made a remark but the deep breathing of some and the pale faces of others showed the interest that was felt by one and all Oakes discovered on one end of the handkerchief the initial S and we all studied its appearance closely Then Oakes asked Hallen if such handkerchiefs were unusual in Mona No not at all there are hundreds of them sold here especially to the laborers on the water works the Italians and Poles answered the Chief It is a very peculiar S said Oakes as he folded the handkerchief and put it in his pocket giving the cartridges to Martin He said nothing more but seemed serious and thoughtful as usual And then we set out all together on a wild drive to police headquarters Despite the lateness of the hour the crowds were increasing The square with the hotel on one side and headquarters on the other was the centre of a vicious body of men pushing struggling and forcing its way along and pausing now and again to surge around headquarters We could all see that Hallen was to have his hands full I should like to see Skinner very much remarked Oakes in a sarcastic vein I should like to see his arms said Moore they might be interesting Oakes looked at the speaker with one of his undefinable expressions We could not tell whether the shot had been a true one or not CHAPTER XVIII Misadventures Toward morning the crowd thinned The street grew more quiet although the very air still throbbed with action even as the heart strokes within us Quickly as events had come we were yet only in the midst of our experiences The clock in the Chief s room was striking three and drowsiness was stealing over me as over the outside world when a knock came at the front door and Hallen admitted a man weary eyed and panting I recognized him as one of the men who had been masquerading about the Mansion as a carpenter He was dressed in a heavy jersey without a coat and was evidently suffering from fatigue He walked over to Oakes and spoke to him in a low voice The detective asked a question or two and turning looked at doctor Moore asleep in a chair fagged out then at me I was wide awake anticipating more trouble Stone said he are you good for a ride with me on horseback We have found something important Yes I answered I am ready Speaking a word to Hallen and Martin Oakes drew me aside Leave your overcoat Come we are needed We passed out into the night and down a side street led by the man who had summoned us In a few minutes we reached a stable and found horses and I knew that it had been so arranged We were mounted and off without notice from any but an hostler and the proprietor who had told me that my horse was strong and capable We pounded to the east along the Highway toward Lorona for a mile or so then swerved into a narrow road winding across the plateau to the south and west I knew we were making for the River Road below the Mansion I had heard of this lane which swept in a long curve around the southern end of Mona connecting the Highway with River Road about two miles south of the Mansion gate As we galloped along Oakes communicated to me the cause of our trip Two of my men have located a hut deep in the forest at the south end of the Mansion grounds There is something going on there They think they have the murderer One of the men came for me the other is watching I felt the blood surge to my brain and the hardships of the night were forgotten in the intensity of my anticipations At last and I was to be at the finish Instinctively I felt for my revolver It was safe and the assurance that it was with me gave relief Fortunately I was a fair horseman and my mount was one of those animals that respond to the rider s every command My two companions were also well mounted and the long ride was soon over Arriving at River Road we dismounted and left the horses in charge of the man who had accompanied us Another man now came from the darkness another of Oakes s retinue He was to lead us to the hut Then we three entered the fringe of the woods and cautiously followed our guide deep into the denser section The moon was hidden occasionally by fleeting clouds and as we advanced farther and farther its rays ceased to reach us All was gloom deep and almost impenetrable Our guide whispered He is in the hut sir waiting for someone Follow me Then he advanced a few paces and led us through a more open section of the forest Soon he stopped Stay here until you see a light flash ahead that is his signal He has been here an hour but his friend is slow in coming Perhaps he knows it is too dangerous said Oakes Our guide went from us to a short distance to keep separate watch The giant trees around were more scattered than elsewhere in the forest through which we had passed Occasionally the sheen of the moonlight was visible far above us as the branches swayed in the breeze Here below the air was quiet and the gloom deep Our eyes accustomed to it now could detect the silent army of tree trunks around us for a considerable distance The air was chilly but excitement kept us from feeling the need of our great coats Beneath our feet the ground was soft but dry and the leaves were scattered about in profusion for this was the fall of the year and the woods had begun to strip at the touch of the frost king Quintus Oakes stood by my side behind a tree We were both gazing intently in the direction that had been indicated to us Nothing was visible for a few moments when suddenly Oakes pressed my shoulder with his hand and said in a low quiet voice See off there that flash I had noticed nothing but as I drew breath to answer I beheld the diverging rays of a light probably a lantern play up and down a tree trunk at least a hundred feet away It moved quickly and then jumped to another trunk in its transit it threw a long narrow yellow streak on the ground between Then it would be lost suddenly to our view I thought the trees intervened in our line of vision at such times but Oakes explained He is waiting and signalling with a dark lantern see how the light is shut off at will He is surely within a hut of some kind I can see the outlines occasionally What can he be up to I whispered He is at least a mile from the Mansion and nearly as much from the road That light is a guide said Oakes His confederate cannot find the hut without it the forest is too dense We waited in silence stealing very carefully nearer to the hut and our patience was finally rewarded We saw the door which was sidewise to us open with a quick movement and a man enter Then all was dark within and without save in one little spot where through the back wall of the hut a few rays found exit in long narrow streaks of yellow light scarcely visible to us He has turned his bull s eye away from the window and the door and has not shut it They are using the light for some purpose said the detective touching my arm and motioning me to follow him With utmost caution we advanced until we were near enough to hear voices At first they came to us as a low indistinct muttering but as we neared the hut we determined that they were raised in argument At our distance however we were unable to recognize either Keep away from the front said Oakes lest the door be opened and we be discovered We stationed ourselves in the shadow near the window which was low in the side of this curious log cabin for such we saw it to be It was boarded inside evidently for the light was kept from without too well Through the window we beheld two dim forms bending over a board table One was handling something like paper in the diverging streak of illumination from the bull s eye opening of the lantern which was on the table facing the back wall of the hut just as Oakes had said The figure could not be distinguished either as to face or form for the light was very indistinct save in the immediate path of the rays As we moved ever so little from our chosen positions our vision of the table and the streak of light upon it was cut off owing to the small size of the window I knew by the movement of Oakes s arm that he had secured his weapon and I closed my hand about mine holding it muzzle down by my side ready for instant use The voices within became louder and I distinguished the words You must man you MUST get away It was answered by a half mumbled protest and then we saw one figure arise and stoop over the light on the table Here take this and go Oakes touched me The murderer preparing to get away he said We could see a pair of hands counting what appeared to be money then they extended their contents to the other hands that awaited them The figure who had given the money arose and with his back to us made as if to leave Suddenly without an instant s warning we saw the form of the other come partially into view and an arm steal slowly upward As the first figure moved away it closed about his neck and a death struggle began revealed to us by the blurred swaying of the two and a deep despairing gasp from the man being strangled Murder said Oakes and we moved toward the door of the hut with one thought in mind the helping of a fellow being meeting his death at the hands of what we believed to be the assassin of Mona I was excited it was unquestionably the most trying moment of my life and I met it as we had not foreseen Advancing two steps hurriedly my feet caught in one another somehow and with a wild war whoop of distress I fell forward on my face carrying Oakes with me in a crashing headlong mix up that must have been heard for a hundred yards in that still morning air It was all over The two in the hut heard us the strangler released his hold and the light was extinguished instantly Out of the door the figures flew like demons They were both anxious to escape detection that was evident They must have thought it was the charge of the Light Brigade Oakes and I were up and after them He shouted a word of command then I heard more footsteps and our guide answered Instantly came the sounds of a struggle fierce but short in the darkness beyond We could see nothing but we heard a heavy fall and then the rush of an escaping man or men Oakes and I were quick to reach the spot and managed to find our forest guide groaning on the ground At Oakes s suggestion we carried him back to the hut which I ascertained was now quite empty It was a grewsome experience this Oakes refused to allow a match to be struck saying Don t draw their fire Stone we may be in a nest of them My chagrin was deep as I thought of the opportunity that my clumsiness had brought to naught We soon succeeded in reviving our man he had been felled by a fist blow on the face evidently Did you see the other fellow asked my companion Yes sir I saw one he was Skinner I caught his face in the lantern light just as they doused it Indeed cried Oakes Skinner You mean the man who runs the newspaper the one I have ordered shadowed Yes sir the same It was he who was counting the money Yes that agrees Go on Who was the other I did not see him at all mister Oakes but I ran into him or rather he into me I have a piece of his shirt here sir The man handed something to Oakes and together we peered at it in the dim morning light We soon determined that it was a good sized piece of the neck of a shirt Then watching carefully the woods around I stood on guard while Oakes examined the inside of the hut It was an old hunter s cabin evidently and had not been recently used The table was made of rough boards and was supported by two stumps It might have served as a place to lie upon also Oakes uttered an exclamation as the guide handed him a piece of paper money that was on the floor Nothing else was found The lantern had gone with the men One man was giving money to the other to get him away and nearly lost his life in defense of the rest in his possession This is a piece of a bill torn off in the struggle said Oakes Do you recognize this shirt pattern asked he Yes sir said our guide it is like what O Brien wears Exactly said Oakes And you he addressed the man come with us to the road Can you walk that far Yes indeed I am all right now but I was finished for a few minutes You were knocked out well remarked Oakes lucky you were not killed We returned to River Road by the way we had come arriving there as dawn was breaking and the sun beginning to throw his rays across the plateau before us We found our horses and the man who had escorted us from Mona Oakes spoke to him Here Bob let Paul ride on your horse he has had a smash You walk Both of you go to the Mansion and tell the others to find O Brien if possible Paul will explain Make no arrests but don t let your man get away We vaulted into our saddles and galloped ahead As we were returning to headquarters by way of the Corners I felt like a culprit I was devoured by chagrin and thoroughly ashamed of my awkwardness Oakes s face was grave much more so than usual but he rode his horse with alertness and confidence and I wondered at the endurance he displayed also at his consideration for in this hour when keen disappointment must have been his he did not mention my mishap which had so changed events He acted as though it were beneath him to notice it and that made me all the more mortified but at the same time I vowed to redeem myself in his eyes Dashing toward the Mansion gate we both pulled up our horses as Oakes uttered a sudden exclamation He rested one hand on the pommel of his saddle and pointed with the other at a man inside the Mansion gate His back was toward us and he had been raking the walk apparently Look notice and the voice of my companion grew sharp and significant look The man was now reaching upward with one hand the rake held within its grasp and with a graceful well calculated swing he was deftly denuding a branch overhead of its dying leaves Well I see I answered it s Maloney cleaning up Exactly came the staccato answer but how about the strength of the wrist that can handle such a heavy rake with such certainty Oh yes he s strong I cried He s got plenty of muscle apparently He has a strong wrist and a strong arm and not such an awfully large chest answered Oakes calmly as though speaking of the weather or of something of no importance Fool that I was it was only then that his meaning suddenly went home to my slow acting brain I saw a light in Oakes s eyes that I had never seen before cool steely calculating No I whispered impossible but you are searching for just such a person Yes of course was the laconic answer but let s talk with the gentleman of the rake Oakes led the way to within a few feet of the gate then rising in his stirrups shouted to Maloney The latter turned and with a look of recognition came quickly toward us Good morning sir good morning mister Clark I was going to headquarters for you soon sir they told me you had gone there with Chief Hallen Yes Why did you wish to go there Maloney Because sir there is something wrong something about the mystery here You know sir you left word to report if anything unusual happened Maloney spoke quietly and without embarrassment We had noticed before that he was fairly well educated another victim of unfortunate circumstances What has occurred There was a hard ring in Oakes s voice It told me to be discreet I had heard that accent before mister Clark I went down to Lorona last night to see my brother who is sick When I returned it was late I was on horseback and I noticed a man on the road lighting a lantern I spoke to him he would not answer but started into the timber at the far south end of the grounds Well what was peculiar It was Skinner sir Skinner Yes sir I saw his face by the light I thought it strange tied my horse and followed him He went a long way into the woods to a hut and waited a couple of hours with the light Then another man came and they had a quarrel There was a terrible noise and then the light went out and they disappeared I went back to my horse and have just got here Who was with Skinner I don t know sir I was facing the door of the hut but it was too dark to see They worked with a dark lantern We had quietly walked our horses up to the gate while listening to Maloney Oakes s eyes were upon the ground Suddenly he looked up Thank you very much Maloney You have done well in reporting to me I will see Chief Hallen this is a matter perhaps for the police certainly not for me to work on Wheeling our horses we darted to the Corners and on toward Mona Quintus Oakes was very quiet he seemed annoyed or nonplussed and the pace that he set was terrific As we neared the town we slowed up and I asked excitedly of the taciturn man by my side Tell me what s up He turned slightly in his saddle Maloney was there he acknowledged it So far he told the truth but he lied about returning on horseback There were no hoof marks going toward the stable none entered the Mansion gate And he lied also about his brother in Lorona for there is no such relative of his there Maloney has no brothers or sisters hereabouts I now remembered Oakes s careful scrutiny of the ground while we were talking with Maloney and I also realized how close was the net he had spread about everyone at the Mansion If Maloney was at the hut how did he get back ahead of us I asked Ran of course took the inside way through the woods he knows the paths well He may not only have been near the hut Stone he may have been in it If so he tried to kill Skinner for the old man had money Then Oakes continued Perhaps it was Maloney who was about to get away if he could But he can t the detective added with a sardonic laugh as he closed his jaws firmly But I exclaimed suppose it was Maloney what of O Brien He was there we have his shirt in part at least Oh bother O Brien he makes me tired cried Oakes enigmatically he will get himself into trouble some day Yes yes I contended but he too has strong arms and a strong wrist and could have used the revolver Surely So could many men These clues are merely the primary ones Many men answer their requirements They are worth very little by themselves They simply point to a certain type of man They are simply links as yet unforged into the chain But one thing more Oakes I cried why should Maloney volunteer the information that he was at the place if he had no good excuse for being there That s it exactly Perhaps he mistrusts he was seen and wants to get in his story first Perhaps he cannot hold his tongue perhaps his mind is weak We are looking for a mind somewhat unusual Stone remember that We were now at the Square in front of the little hotel and dismounting we proceeded to enter the door of the inn As we did so I took my companion by the arm and drew him aside Say Oakes I said don t tell doctor Moore how I involved matters by that stumble I would never hear the end of it Oakes looked surprised then his eyes beamed in merriment He smiled ever so slightly That certainly was a beautiful charge you made over me said he He did not promise not to tell however but months afterwards doctor Moore learned all about it from me and I then found that Quintus had remained silent CHAPTER XIX A Faulty Story After breakfast while Oakes gave the doctor a brief resume of our night s adventure the two rival newspapers came out with extras on the recent doings Skinner s comments were sarcastic and bitter and while not actually inciting to lawlessness played upon the roused feelings of the towns people by scathing allusions to Hallen s inefficiency and by reiterating the story of the false Quintus Oakes Our friend Dowd on the other hand came forward with a moderate well worded article that swayed the minds of the more thoughtful The reading of his words won us more friends Who does not like to hear two sides of an argument or to read cool words of wisdom from one whose career entitles him to respect We had learned at breakfast that Hallen had taken hold with a grip of iron during the night Many arrests had followed his activity and the quietude of the forenoon was largely due to his efforts of the night before As we stood outside the hotel remarking upon the changed appearance of the streets our attention was attracted to a small crowd approaching the Square from the direction of the Corners There were men running ahead and shouting then a close compact body swaying around a central attraction We thought we detected a man being helped along as though he were severely injured and we clearly distinguished the words Shot at The murderer and many expressions of anger and terror Oakes looked into the mass of men and scanned the pale face of the injured one It s Maloney he said seizing the doctor and myself by the arm He pushed his way forward as the crowd recognized and opened for mister Clark Well Maloney what is it asked Oakes I was shot at sir he exclaimed shot at in the very spot where mister Mark was killed and then sir someone hit me a blow on the head and I fell I saw Oakes run his hand over Maloney s scalp I was dazed sir when these men found me finished the gardener Yes said two laborers we found him on the ground just waking up and acting queer like And here s the revolver it was lying behind the rock sir How did it happen asked Oakes I heard a shot near me Maloney answered a heavy revolver shot I turned and was then hit with something like a sand bag I guess for everything got dim Hallen walked him into the headquarters building to avoid the rapidly increasing crowd Shut the doors he ordered The command was quickly obeyed and we who had worked together were all within the building now away from the crowd Who was it asked Hallen of Maloney The man hesitated a while but upon being pressed for an answer finally replied I have not dared to mention my suspicions sir but the fellow looked like Mike O Brien At any rate he was wounded he was walking with a limp sir and I saw blood on his trousers leg He must have been in a scrap or an accident When I was coming to he continued I saw him hiding a revolver behind a rock I pointed out the place to the men when they came a few moments after and they found it Why did you not cry out for help asked Oakes suddenly even viciously I thought Maloney answered quickly Because he thought I was dead and I let him think so If I had made any noise sir he would have finished me I did not move until I knew help was near Good said Oakes you had presence of mind Let us see the revolver the men left it here did they not Hallen stepped forward with the weapon Oakes examined it but his look informed us that it was not the old one taken from the wall in the Mansion Further questioning failed to reveal anything of importance but it seemed clear from what Maloney said that the assaulter escaped on horseback after he was seen by his intended victim for Maloney insisted that he had heard a galloping horse afterwards He was wounded you said queried the detective Yes sir quite badly I thought Moore examined Maloney s injury and took careful note of his condition then the gardener was told to go and he was soon joined outside by the two laborers his new found friends Together they went for the hotel bar across the street As they disappeared Oakes exchanged glances with the doctor and I knew that something was wrong There came a long silence which Hallen finally broke This is a queer story Oakes I don t understand it Is it the murderer at work again and O Brien accused You say the Mansion mysteries are the work of the same hand that shot mister Mark and possibly mister Smith But those mysteries are old and O Brien is a recent arrival here and knows very little of the Mansion I cannot see his guilt How do you explain it Oakes The keen man addressed faced the Chief and we all knew the words that were coming were valuable Chief I have just told you of mister Stone s adventures with me this morning of my proof that Maloney lied to us Well he has lied again Yes chimed in doctor Moore the man s a fake He was not seriously injured if at all I saw through Maloney s story instantly continued Oakes He said he was assaulted by O Brien who was according to his own story a badly wounded man He said O Brien hid the revolver afterwards while he Maloney was shamming death and that O Brien sought to escape It is nonsense Why I fail to see I asked excitedly Oakes turned to me Why Stone don t you see the flaws Would a seriously injured man attempt deliberate murder What show would he have to escape Then again if able to get away himself would he hide the revolver near the scene of the crime behind a rock No he would take it with him as a defensive weapon or else hide it where it never could be found in the Hudson for instance or the brook both near at hand True enough cried Hallen his face showing his admiration but what s your idea then Oakes Just this gentlemen Maloney himself shot O Brien and seeing the latter escape knew that his game was up for he had been identified by O Brien So he hid the revolver that he himself used and then pretended to have been sand bagged and shot at He relied on the weight of his word against O Brien s not knowing anything of the evidence collected against him or that we were anything but agents and workmen about the Mansion The Chief looked long and half sceptically at Oakes then asked Does Maloney meet your requirements Does he fill the bill Well he has a strong wrist and long arms answered Oakes that places him among the possibles he also has a comparatively narrow chest such as the man had who wore the robe you remember we reasoned that out Those three things cover much ground Then again he is an old resident knows all about the Mansion was here when Smith was murdered Elliott now spoke up Oakes you said the murderer was a good shot Is Maloney a good shot with a revolver Yes he was he used to belong to the National Guard years ago He was a splendid shot then according to evidence procured by my men But the revolver to day was not the old one queried the Chief No answered Oakes but he can easily have two I had better arrest him now as a suspicious person exclaimed Hallen excitedly Not yet Let us be sure first remember Skinner has a motive for crossing us he has tried to defeat the aims of justice right through He was dealing money this morning to someone suppose it was to Maloney what is his reason Hallen thumped the table furiously as though a new thought had come to him Skinner answers the physical requirements also mister Oakes he was also a guardsman a good shot Yes answered Oakes but scarcely strong enough to overpower me at the Mansion Unless he was acting while in mania as we presume this criminal acts said Moore I sat spellbound as these men discussed the intricacies of the affair realizing the truth of their reasonings and marvelling at the clues conceptions and brilliant memories revealed especially by the masterly Oakes Too bad you cannot find Skinner and see what he is up to I remarked We must let Hallen keep watch on him until we are ready for our final move It would be easy to arrest him on suspicion but that might defeat our object and again I do not believe in making arrests until my case is clear said Oakes Do you not think Skinner might be the murderer I asked Not as I see things now It seems more probable that he is interested in someone whom he wants to get out of harm s way His motive throughout this affair has been to hide the guilty I think And what do you make of that man O Brien queried Dowd he seems to be a mysterious fellow Oakes and Hallen exchanged knowing glances He s another possibility he s a little Tartar said the detective But won t Maloney get away now asked Elliott Nit was the answer from Hallen Those two laborers with him are my specials I was getting entirely tied up now but desiring to appear erudite and worthy of such company I blurted forth Who is Mike O Brien anyway Oakes looked at us all coolly and exasperatingly He seems to be a little extra thrown in I ll tell you all about it when you tell me if the S on the handkerchief has anything to do with mister Skinner An exclamation of surprise went up We had all forgotten that But before we could resume a message arrived for Oakes It was brought by one of the men whom we knew so well by sight around the Mansion He told of the finding of a burned tree hidden in the forest near the scene of the murder of mister Mark Those who were searching had discovered that the tree was recently struck by lightning and that within its burned interior was ash The man had brought some with him and also a small crumpled piece of newspaper Oakes looked carefully at them as we glanced over his shoulder At last cried he Here is wood ash wet as was that on the robe and here is paper like that of the Daily News which we found in the robe is it not Yes cried Moore It is indeed can it be Yes came the answer from Oakes my orders to search for the origin of the ash have been crowned with success The robe was in that tree But I cried of what value is that Just this the robe was not worn at the time of the murder Remember Joe did not see it it had been hidden probably The murderer used it to go and to come in but for some unknown reason discarded it at the shooting Excuse me said the messenger excuse me mister Oakes but that s about right The tree was beyond the stone where he crossed and lost the handkerchief He was running for the robe sir the murderer was after his disguise Oakes looked at his subordinate calmly and smiled ever so slightly The man bowed and retreated abashed at his own impetuosity Hallen turned to our friend Oakes and said I never in my life saw anything like this like you Oakes always ready to side step praise in any form answered with one of his chilling glances Oh bother You re young yet Hallen you need age Hallen half resentfully yanked his cap on his head and strode to the door Well he remarked here s where I take a look at Maloney s arms I am dead tired of theorizing Stop commanded Oakes you ll spoil it all I won t spoil the cross on the arm the cross of indigo if it s there and if it ain t there it ain t Hang it all anyway And forthwith Hallen strode out the door down the steps toward the hotel bar room with Oakes and the rest of us following in a vain endeavor to head him off When we reached the bar room Hallen was already in the side room We rushed toward the little room door expecting to see Maloney in the grasp of Hallen but instead we beheld the Chief gazing in stupefaction at his two men dead drunk heads between their hands on the little round table cried the Chief in a voice that shook the glasses on the shelves in the bar room and brought the white coated attendant with one bound to the door Hell en Maloney s escaped Escaped cried the bar keeper Escaped nit Why he paid for the drinks and walked out half an hour ago said he had a job at the Mansion These fellows gosh cried the man as he shook them drunk What s up what does it mean Chief Then Quintus Oakes spoke in tones of dulcet and ineffable sweetness cooingly charmingly It means that Chief Hallen pays for a round of the best you ve got In order to see a cross on a man s arm it becomes necessary first to catch the man something like the bird s tail and the salt proposition Mix em up quick shouted Hallen advancing to the bar Hell en be damned Get the two samples of Mona s police out into the air Hell en CHAPTER XX A Man s Confession 
8240-116288-0000	train-other-500	The assault upon Maloney was now the talk of the town Hallen who had enjoyed a respite from censure was again furiously blamed for inability and incompetence
8240-116288-0001	train-other-500	None but our select few discerned that Maloney was lying for none knew as much of the intricacies of the case as did we
8240-116288-0002	train-other-500	All were crying out for the instant arrest of the one who had attempted to kill him but none but the few who had heard Maloney s statement within headquarters knew that it was O Brien
none	none	 he had accused and only those few knew that his story was probably false Although the order had gone forth quietly as we knew to find Mike O Brien still it was not known to any save Hallen s and Oakes s men 
8240-116288-0003	train-other-500	The masses were in ignorance of the strides we had made twards the solution of the horrible happenings at Mona and of course Hallen was getting more than he deserved in the way of criticism
8240-116288-0004	train-other-500	Oakes told us that he momentarily expected some new developments in the case as Hallen was endeavoring to find Skinner and bring him to the Mansion
8240-116288-0005	train-other-500	His surmises proved true for it was found an easy matter to locate the old man and early in the evening Hallen arrived at the Mansion and joined us in the apartments upstairs and with him
8240-116288-0006	train-other-500	were Martin and Skinner Dowd the rival of the old man was with us having begged earnestly of Oakes to be allowed to follow as close to the action as possible
8240-116288-0007	train-other-500	and having stuck by us like a veritable leech since the morning Dowd was a nice fellow and a newspaper man from start to finish and he seemed to have developed a great liking for Oakes
8240-116288-0008	train-other-500	We were all upstairs when Martin ushered in the tall rather slender but powerful old man Skinner None of us save Hallen had seen him at close range before
8240-116288-0009	train-other-500	but I saw a curious expression half of defiance half of dismay in his face that made me watch him most closely doctor Moore was scanning his features carefully
8240-116288-0010	train-other-500	in a way that showed he had detected something but Quintus Oakes rising from his seat and advancing politely to meet the old gentleman seemed neither to have seen anything nor to know anything
none	none	 He was just the polished gentleman we all knew so well but I noticed that as he shook hands with mister Skinner he cast a quick glance at the man s arm and the wrist 
8240-116288-0011	train-other-500	and then at the old man s eyes Moore whispered He has excluded Skinner as the criminal Look see him take it all in Oakes was leading Skinner to a seat
8240-116288-0012	train-other-500	and as he walked he spoke freely He had discovered that which doctor Moore had also seen but which I had failed to detect
none	none	 mister Skinner allow me said he gracefully 
8240-116288-0013	train-other-500	It s not well lighted here
none	none	 I imagine that little white scar on your right eye 
8240-116288-0014	train-other-500	on your cornea just in front of the pupil interferes somewhat with your vision Yes mister Clark it does interfere just a trifle Just enough to spoil duck shooting eh I
none	none	 understand you used to be quite fond of that sort of thing mister Skinner Moore and Hallen exchanged glances and the knowledge was general to us the old man was not the murderer 
8240-116288-0015	train-other-500	for the assassin could shoot well and the old scar on the eye prevented that in Skinner s case But to what do I owe the honor of a request to call at the Mansion escorted by such a nice young man
none	none	 to see mister Clark the agent queried Skinner The old fellow was shrewd he looked at Hallen and smiled half heartedly Then he looked at me and remarked that we had met before somewhere 
8240-116288-0016	train-other-500	and extending his hand to Moore he said he guessed he was glad to know us all better Then turning quietly to Chief Hallen he laughed and gave us a shock from which we were unable to rally for a few moments
8240-116288-0017	train-other-500	Well Chief they re keeping you busy They tell me you don t like it because I exposed that fellow who palmed himself off as mister Quintus Oakes that man Rogers you know
none	none	 No I did not like it particularly 
8240-116288-0018	train-other-500	it interfered with my plans I am trying to catch the murderer of mister Mark you know Suppose you are you haven t got him yet You can search me Chief
none	none	 I think mister Quintus Oakes here is entitled to all the credit so far eh 
8240-116288-0019	train-other-500	don t you The old fellow turned to Oakes as he spoke the words that showed he was not to be fooled into believing Oakes was Clark We moved nearer Skinner knew all apparently
8240-116288-0020	train-other-500	Then Oakes arose to meet the occasion and stood before the old man mister Skinner I thank you for warning me not to come to Mona it was your letter I received But why did you warn me
8240-116288-0021	train-other-500	Was it to protect your secret Oakes had acted all along as though he had learned some things he had not spoken of to us he and Hallen had seemed to comprehend more than we others knew
8240-116288-0022	train-other-500	but I was scarce prepared for such a sudden revelation Stop cried the old man stop you have no right I did warn you to keep away from Mona I knew of the Mansion mysteries
8240-116288-0023	train-other-500	I knew you by sight in New York I recognized you here on your first visit I did not want to see a good man get in trouble Thank you said Oakes thank you
8240-116288-0024	train-other-500	Your kindness was appreciated but you have another motive you are shielding someone None no one came the answer Nonsense and Oakes s eyes blazed as he spoke
8240-116288-0025	train-other-500	you tried to send him away this morning You gave him money at the hut You were nearly killed by the man you are protecting Can you explain it The old man was shaking violently
8240-116288-0026	train-other-500	He arose tottered and sat down Then burying his head in his hands he remained silent for a space of seconds Then shaking his head he moaned No
8240-116288-0027	train-other-500	I can t explain I had given him all mister Oakes he was not robbing me he seemed angry he I
none	none	 could not understand 
8240-116288-0028	train-other-500	I can said Oakes The man you have befriended these many years the man Maloney who used to work with you in your shop to whom you gave among many other things
8240-116288-0029	train-other-500	a red bandana handkerchief with your initial S upon it one of those handkerchiefs you use about the printing office that man we think is a maniac We surmise that he has the killing mania
8240-116288-0030	train-other-500	Did you not suspect it The old man s manner changed to one of terrified inquiry Why I never suspected I I thought he was peculiar
8240-116288-0031	train-other-500	I mistrusted he was at the bottom of the Mansion mysteries I wanted to send him away to give him a show Oakes hesitated then answered evasively but forcefully
8240-116288-0032	train-other-500	Maloney is probably irresponsible He is the man of the Mansion the woman so called of the Smith murder the murderer of mister Mark we believe but we are without proof as yet
none	none	 The old man s face filled with the blood dammed back from the throbbing heart then paled as the heart strokes weakened and the cold sweat of collapse appeared in beady drops upon his brow 
8240-116288-0033	train-other-500	Moore was at his side with a drink and we all placed him on the sofa and watched the color return to the yellow white face and the respirations deepen again Oakes bent solicitously above him
8240-116288-0034	train-other-500	There is something back of all this Skinner Maloney is more than a friend Then as the old man rose the detective in tones gentle but strong called Skinner s attention to the fact
8240-116288-0035	train-other-500	that his conduct in using the influence of his journal against Hallen and the discovery of the criminal needed an explanation Skinner arose steadied himself
none	none	 and turning to Hallen said 
8240-116288-0036	train-other-500	in a voice scarcely audible Chief I have always been a good citizen till now I wanted Maloney to get away He would not go I thought he might be at the bottom of the Mansion mysteries
8240-116288-0037	train-other-500	but I had no idea he could be a murderer I did not wish his identity revealed I tried to discourage mister Oakes I tried to save my reputation Chief
8240-116288-0038	train-other-500	to save a name good as the world goes but this is my punishment Study my face Chief study my eyes my chin Then imagine a handsome Spanish face dark haired
8240-116288-0039	train-other-500	dark skinned Do you see why Maloney has blue eyes and a square chin with hair black as the Indian s and skin swarthy as night Gentlemen do you understand She is dead
8240-116288-0040	train-other-500	Maloney does not know I cared for the lad He is my son
none	none	 He always has been eccentric 
8240-116288-0041	train-other-500	but although perhaps insane I had no proof I tried to hide my secret but if Justice demands his capture Chief I am at your disposal
8240-116288-0042	train-other-500	The old man extended his hands his lips quivering with the words that spelled ruin and advanced to the Chief as though expecting arrest while we all remained motionless
none	none	 in pitying 
8240-116288-0043	train-other-500	silence Hallen glanced at him Then the burly fellow turned suddenly to Martin Here you son of a dandy said he as we all smiled and Oakes bit his lip in suppressed emotion
8240-116288-0044	train-other-500	here you go on down to the stable and tell my coachman to drive round to the front door I am going to have him drive home with mister Skinner Then they walked to the door
8240-116288-0045	train-other-500	the old man half leaning on the thick set muscular shoulders of Hallen At the threshold the Chief turned quickly If any of you ducks say anything you re a lot of dudes
8240-116288-0046	train-other-500	and the two disappeared downstairs to the coach After Hallen had returned to the room and as the rumble of the wheels died away in the distance Dowd addressed a question to Oakes
8240-116288-0047	train-other-500	He wanted to know how Oakes had secured advance information as to the history of Skinner and the handkerchief Well Dowd as soon as Skinner began antagonizing our moves I suspected
8240-116288-0048	train-other-500	that he was the writer of the letter of warning Then I ordered his history you know those things are easily obtained He came here years ago it seems comparatively unknown and worked his way up
none	none	 employing a young fellow for many years in his office This young fellow went West but returned later He was Maloney He had not the mental attainments for his employer s business but the older man kept in touch with the younger even after he found it necessary to dispense with his services When I saw Skinner I detected some resemblance between them 
8240-116288-0049	train-other-500	this seems to have escaped general notice but doctor Moore was not deceived A study of the eyes and the ears and the nose confirmed my suspicions of the paternity of Maloney
none	none	 but all that while interesting was not so valuable as the knowledge that Maloney had several handkerchiefs given him by Skinner You see Skinner s conduct was so suspicious throughout 
8240-116288-0050	train-other-500	that we have investigated him thoroughly We found he wore such handkerchiefs around his neck in the printing office We found missus Cook was aware that Maloney had some of them he told her
8240-116288-0051	train-other-500	that mister Skinner gave them to him He always was proud of Skinner s friendship Then you knew all about it this morning Quintus I cried exasperated at the man s taciturnity
8240-116288-0052	train-other-500	you knew when you said you would tell who O Brien was if I would tell whether the S had anything to do with Skinner No but I mistrusted the proofs were only more recently secured
none	none	 Then as you now have the answer regarding the S it seems only fair that you tell us who O Brien is I cried Oakes became very serious I believe O Brien was the man watching 
8240-116288-0053	train-other-500	on the balcony when doctor Moore was assaulted also that he was the man at the bridge who warned you Stone of danger but who has kept his identity hidden We had strong proof
8240-116288-0054	train-other-500	that he was at the hut watching as were we he accidentally left a part of his shirt with my man remember I also believe that he was wounded and is in hiding wounded by Maloney
8240-116288-0055	train-other-500	on the Highway when he was about to close in upon him What do you mean cried Moore What curious conduct for a man to keep in hiding No not at all answered Oakes sharply
8240-116288-0056	train-other-500	Remember how you saw him on horseback one night revolver in hand Well he was attending to business O Brien is working on the Mansion mysteries
8240-116288-0057	train-other-500	I believe he only knows half of the affair he does not realize Maloney may be the murderer of Mark his conduct is in accord with that of a brave detective working single handed
8240-116288-0058	train-other-500	and desiring to keep his identity secret A detective Yes I fancy so answered Oakes with a smile on his face Why not We are not the only bees around the honeysuckle
8240-116288-0059	train-other-500	By George I never thought of that exclaimed Moore Indeed retorted Oakes in dulcet tones Why should you You have not played this game before it is new to you
8240-116288-0060	train-other-500	And does Hallen know does he mistrust that O Brien is a detective Oakes laughed Boys you re slow Of course he does He has even found out there is a well known detective
8240-116288-0061	train-other-500	by the name of Larkin who is fond of the alias O Brien This Larkin has a scar under his hair in front We will perhaps be able to identify O Brien soon
8240-116288-0062	train-other-500	What made you first mistrust I asked Why remember how curiously O Brien acted when we hunted the robe how indifferent he was how he used dialect
none	none	 Yes but why how Well interrupted Oakes that dialect was poor unnatural consequently perhaps assumed 
8240-116288-0063	train-other-500	That was the first clue to explain the curious actions of Maloney s loving friend who has stuck to him like molasses to a fly s leg Let us go into town and have dinner at the hotel I cried
8240-116288-0064	train-other-500	disgusted at my lack of perspicacity My invitation was accepted with the usual alacrity of hungry men and we soon were striding along Hallen Oakes and Moore in front
8240-116288-0065	train-other-500	and Dowd Elliott and myself behind We walked close together discussing the events and joking at one another in great good natured animal spirits for things were coming to a head now
8240-116288-0066	train-other-500	and Broadway was not so far off after all As the darkness closed in upon us relieved only by the faint glimmering of the rising moon we were in a compact body
8240-116288-0067	train-other-500	an excellent target Strong in the presence of each other we had for a moment forgotten that we were in the land where a brain disordered was at liberty We the criminal hunters were but human
none	none	 and this was our error CHAPTER XXI The Attack We had advanced along River Road to its junction with the Highway and Martin had just closed in from behind as doctor Moore started to say something about the dinner that was coming when just as we came into the shadows of the great trees to our left a flame instantaneous reddish blue streaked forth from the side of the road and a deep muffled crashing sound came to our ears Everyone recognized it instantly it was not the high crack of a modern weapon such as we carried but the unmistakable guttural of an old style heavy revolver An instant and the voice of Oakes rang out cool but intensely earnest To cover and we covered Never before had six men melted from a close formation so rapidly so silently so earnestly doctor Moore Elliott and I reached the trees on the other side together and lost our identity trying to find a place for our hunted bodies We lay down in a heap behind a burned tree stump and said damn together Somewhere around was the fiend of Mona and somewhere were Oakes Hallen and Dowd but not with us we could swear to this for we were in a class by ourselves and we knew one another even in the darkness We heard a sudden scuffle in the road and saw a giant figure rush by us throwing a silhouette on the roadway It turned faced about and crouched as another figure darted from the woods across the road Then the figure crouching made a spring and the two swayed to and fro before us like great phantoms and then the figures separated and one started down the Highway followed by the other at breakneck speed Then we heard the voice of Oakes from somewhere Halt or I ll shoot The fugitives stopped ducked dashed toward us and by us into the woods and after them came the report of Oakes s revolver we knew it by the quick high pitched note and then Oakes himself It was evident to us he had fired in the air for we all saw the small flame point heavenward as his weapon was discharged Neither fugitive slackened his speed but both rushed across the plains east by northeast into the face of the moon as it rose off the plateau of Mona What is who gasped Moore The which I answered as a polar chill chased up my spine Oh the d l soliloquized Elliott See the second man limps he must be O Brien he is chasing the first one whispered the doctor as we gazed into the night And Oakes is cavorting after the bunch I play him straight and place spoke Elliott he is gaining We watched Oakes fleeter than ever steadier disappear in the distance as the moon entered a passing cloud bank and all became lonesome and dark Let s get on the plain said Elliott and we crawled as best we could out of the woods toward the place where the three were last seen by us Let s be in at the finish I cried and we started in the dim steely haze of the obscured moon to follow the chase Darkness impenetrable came on and suddenly a wild moan of anguish reached us an awful convulsive cry of terror It neared us and was in our very neighborhood in our midst and again away and with it came the rush of feet heavy and tired and soon the light tread of the pursuer the athletic soft tread of Oakes I shall never forget that cry of terror It was as though the soul had left the body in anguish it was a cry of fear greater than man seemed capable of uttering From out of the darkness came the voice of Moore A maniac in terror Then the heavy tread was upon us again a body darted past me and the heavy revolver spoke again I felt a stinging sensation in my arm a numbness a feeling of dread and of fear then I reeled and recovered and looking around me saw the figure dashing away like mad The moon was uncovering again and the fighting instinct of the brute was aroused within me I knew I was wounded but it was a trivial matter I felt the surging of blood to my brain the pumping of my heart the warmth and glow of the body that comes when one rallies from fear or surprise and the next instant I was off in pursuit Always a good runner I seemed endowed with the speed of the wind slowly I gained The man before me ran rapidly but heavily he was tired He glanced around and moved his arms and I realized that he was unarmed His weapon had fallen I shut my mouth and saved my breath and loosened joints which had not been oiled since the days of long ago when I played on my college foot ball team Slowly I closed in the capture was to be mine the honor for Stone yours truly lawyer I unreefed some more and the ground went by under me like mad I was dizzy with elation and courage and bull hearted strength and then just as I came within talking distance of the fleeing terror there was a report and my right leg dragged my stride weakened and tied itself into bowknots and I dropped my revolver I realized I was done for We all know the symptoms the starboard front pulley of my new Broadway suspenders had busted The next instant the terror had turned and was upon me I felt a crashing fist in my face and another in my neck a swinging blow on my jaw and a quick upper cut in my solar plexus and as the moon had just again disappeared behind the cloud I sank to the plain of Mona nearly unconscious overpowered I felt hands with the power of ten men seize my wrists I felt them being tied together with handkerchiefs I felt a heavy weight on my stomach and realized that I was being used as a sofa Then I started to call for help to speak and to struggle but the terror who had murdered and frightened and held up this part of the State soaked me again with both fists I thought of home and New York and mint juleps and of the two dollars I spent to railroad it up to Mona and realized that it was cheap for all I was getting Then I started in to die and the fiend struck a match in my face and I nearly did die For it was that quiet aristocratic Elliott You re the darndest ass I ever saw said he as he got off why didn t you tell who you were Couldn t I muttered I was thinking of I never finished that remark for the next instant Elliott was borne down to the ground by the force of the impact of a great body He rolled about with the unknown and tore and twisted I heard the deafening blows rain on his head and was powerless to aid for my hands were tied and I was strangely weak I was done for You d fiend I ve got you You will murder Stone along with the others will you You terror you I recognized the voice as I heard the handcuffs click on Elliott and realized it all It was too much Hallen I murmured Thank God Soak him again and I heard the blows descend on Elliott s anatomy Then I relented Spare him Chief it s mister Elliott Hallen roared in surprise Then the murderer has gotten away with Oakes after him I beg pardon I I ha ha and then the Chief roared again as he undid us and called for the others Lanterns were now brought from the Mansion and a crowd of Oakes s men collected around us I noticed that Moore and Hallen were looking at me curiously and then Oakes stepped to my side from somewhere out in the darkness You re sick old fellow he said softly Sick and then I realized that things were strangely distant that faces seemed far far away and that Moore s voice was miles off as he rushed to my side Wounded Look at his arm he cried Yes I murmured it was that last shot I forgot it I tried to raise the arm and saw that a red blue stream was running down and dripping from my hand upon the ground I stepped forward to point to Hallen and to tell about how he slugged Elliott but as I moved I lurched forward and a great strong arm closed about me and a tender voice whispered miles miles away It was Oakes s voice Here Hallen give us a hand and I felt myself lifted tenderly and carried across the plateau I was dimly conscious that Moore was working silently rapidly at my side and that the strong supple arm of Oakes was about me and that Hallen was helping A great wave of affection came over me for these tender dear fellows and I talked long and loud as Elliott wiped my face and I told Moore that Elliott was a past master at slugging and all the time the crowd grew I heard the name of mister Clark shouted and then my own and then as they bore me in at the Mansion gate I passed away off into the distance and went into a deep dark tunnel where all was quiet and still And then I again heard Moore s voice saying He has fainted Oakes Get him to bed or he will faint again There was such gentle tenderness in the faces around me such gentle strong words and such gentle strong lifting of my body that I sighed at the deliciousness of it all the splendor the beauty of my journey and all for two dollars railroad fare I heard some curious statements about great bravery in dashing after the unknown and all that sort of thing and I knew enough to realize that the crowd had things twisted Oakes was speaking to me like a big brother and Hallen had somehow quit all his bluster and was quiet and grave and Moore and Elliott seemed foolishly attentive I appreciated their kindness but did not quite understand and their attentions amused me I should have laughed outright but things were becoming confused Then I realized that they were worried How peculiar it seemed The angel of friendship was about me I felt a strange peacefulness as I entered the great Mansion It seemed like a palace with golden walls and the familiar voices of welcome warmed me Then I heard a deep thumping rhythmic tremor as it was borne through the air and I knew that the boat on the river was passing the Mansion I laughed long and loud at the peculiar words it was saying I talked to it commanded it to breathe more quietly or it would disturb those asleep on the shore Then I tried to explain to the judge that I was not a brave man that it was all a mistake that I had chased Elliott instead of the murderer that the jury had failed to understand and I laughed again My merriment grew as I caught sight of Oakes s face it was so nonsensical of him not to have perceived that the steamer was at the bottom of the whole mystery I tried to explain then I shouted at their stupidity and finally laughed angrily and in despair I was in the grip of delirium During the night they searched for the bullet and found it and some time next day I awoke in my right mind CHAPTER XXII The Insane Root During the next few days Elliott called frequently and apologetically Although he had suffered considerably at the hands of Hallen he appreciated how much attention he had given me on the plains of Mona where was my Waterloo and he kept me informed of the doings of our party in the search for the murderer But it was several days before he brought me the information that both O Brien and Maloney had been found O Brien in a farm house nursing his leg Maloney walking about town cool and collected apparently with nothing to conceal I was told that he was not yet under arrest but had been coaxed back to the Mansion to give evidence against O Brien as he was led to believe But why doesn t he suspect He must realize that suspicion is against him Well doctor Moore told me recently that the criminal if insane as we surmise may be oblivious during his lucid intervals of what he has been through during his periods of aberration I see I answered remembering that such had been often recorded and as his attacks of mania may be unwitnessed he escapes detection because he carries but little ordinary evidence of these during the interval of quiescence Before my companion could frame an answer there was a sudden commotion below a hurrying of feet and the quiet commanding voice of Oakes heard now and then above all We knew the time had at last arrived for the closing scene we both felt that the hour had come when the final settlement was to take place Next moment Oakes appeared I had not seen him for many hours He was changed haggard worn His handsome face showed worry and loss of sleep but his carriage and voice were as usual vigorous independent Grasping my hand firmly and turning a pleased glance of recognition at Elliott he said Come Stone you re strong enough and next moment he had thrown a coat over my shoulders and was helping me down the stairs to the dining room He seemed to me to have grown more serious more quiet than was his wont but his actions were as ever strong quick easy of execution and I knew that it was the steadying of the mind and body for the final strain Oakes s reputation was at stake and he was fully cognizant that an error of judgment a flaw in his reasonings a mishap in the execution of his well formulated plans might readily result disastrously not only to his reputation but to the cause of justice Then I stepped across the threshold of the dining room and beheld a scene that will always linger in my mind At the head of the table sat Hallen and to his right was doctor Moore whose dress contrasted strangely with the Chief s blue uniform and brass buttons Across the table from Moore was Dowd and here and there about the room were some of Oakes s men and some of Hallen s as well lounging looking out of the windows carelessly but comprehensively As we entered a deep guttural of welcome greeted me and Oakes seated me by Moore s side and Elliott went over and sat with Dowd Then the detective took the chair at the foot of the table near which was an empty one It was evident at a glance that Oakes was to be the chief actor while to Hallen had been given the chief position There was a moment s silence then Hallen turned to doctor Moore Are you positive he said that Maloney is insane I see no evidence I am not positive as yet was the reply Some signs indicate that he may be in the so called interval between outbreaks of mental disease but he is clever as are almost all the insane and he covers his condition well Still we can and will put him to the test we will soon determine if we are dealing with the insane root that takes the reason prisoner But how can it be He is not violent I do not comprehend Moore glanced at the Chief Let mister Oakes explain I should be too technical I fear he has an easier flow of words Hallen looked surprised Well how is it Oakes How can you suspect such a man Nobody ever saw him violent What reason have you Then Oakes turned He was somewhat nettled I thought at Hallen s manner but his voice did not betray him His words came clearly even curtly but as he revealed his comprehensive knowledge of the matter in plain every day language Hallen s manner changed wonderfully Never before had he had such an opportunity to see the education of the man before him Now it came as an overwhelming surprise A lunatic does not necessarily rave or carry the ordinary signs of rending passion began Oakes as he turned a quiet face of acknowledgment toward doctor Moore The one who hears voices real to him but really arising in the diseased mechanism of his own brain ordering him to be a martyr a saviour of his country or to spend the millions he imagines he possesses is usually melancholy reserved cautious ever on the watch deceptive but doubtful sometimes as to his own brain workings Likewise the man who possesses the homicidal mania may be cautious and quiet to the ordinary observer a normal citizen But the aura of insanity is around him he lives and moves and deceives and hides from the outside world the words that come to him day or night the words that arise not in the voice of a living man but in his own diseased mind The sufferer says nothing of the voices that tell him he is persecuted that the world s hands are against him By accident in a moment of unwariness he may reveal that he hears such voices but it is an even chance that he will be laughed at and the warning fall on ears that fail to understand He is considered a crank Then the unfortunate shrinks more into himself becomes absolutely dominated by the ideas and commands generated in his own false mind He may become violent by degrees may scare and haunt the places where he believes himself abused and all the while the voices tell him he is foolish being put upon and finally he becomes controlled by the delusion that he is being persecuted Then perhaps suddenly comes the incentive usually a command of false origin within his own brain that makes the worm turn that reveals to the world that he is a maniac a killer He hears the word kill and his mind no longer even suspicions of its own disease as it was at first becomes frenzied He sometimes attacks openly but usually does so secretively with the cunning of the tiger and kills and slaughters Then he returns to his dreams quiet satisfied spent Oakes paused You understand Hallen he said I am no expert but such cases have come to my notice it is not easy for me to explain more fully Go on was Hallen s answer go on sir I am deeply interested it amazes me The Chief showed his words were those of genuine interest and surprise The insane man leads a dual life continued Oakes perhaps for a long time Such a man is not yet an inmate of an asylum His case is unrecognized he is a soul battling with madness until some awful tragedy occurs like that of Mona to reveal his greatest of all misfortunes the loss of reason We were all silent when Oakes finished speaking Not a man there but now recognized and realized more fully what we had been fighting against Then Hallen rose and looked at Oakes then at all of us Boys he said according to custom being Chief of Police of Mona I am to make the arrest That I will do but let me tell you right here it is mister Oakes who will point out the culprit I have been unable to get a clue and I am damned if I ll take credit from a man like that As he spoke he thumped the table with his hamlike fist Hallen was not a clever man He was about the average perhaps a little above but he was as honest as the day was long a staunch vigorous man and we all admired him Sit down commanded Oakes harshly Don t give us any more such nonsense and the Chief sat down while we all half smiled at the discomfiture of both Now gentlemen said Oakes let us keep our wits about us First let me identify O Brien if possible and let us study Maloney afterward Remember if O Brien is not Larkin the detective my case is not ready if he is the man we suspect then we must turn to Maloney regardless of any presence of insanity now as he maybe in the quiescent period so called and may succeed in baffling us Having once excluded O Brien from suspicion we will be justified in action against Maloney We must prove his knowledge of the heavy revolver if possible Then if we succeed in forging that link to our chain we will move quickly upon his arm should be the cross seen by the dying mister Mark CHAPTER XXIII The Test As Oakes ceased speaking there came a silence Although we were many there there was not a motion for a space of seconds not a sound save the deep breathing of Hallen and of some of the others upon whom the duty of the hour was to fall Men trained for such scenes always alive to the possibilities always alert for trickery or treachery are yet but human and subject to the tension that is felt even by the most courageous Then in obedience to a signal from Oakes Martin appeared escorting O Brien who was limping into the room and to the chair facing Oakes It soon became evident to us that Oakes s real identity was unknown to O Brien Even if the latter were the detective Larkin he had failed to realize that mister Clark was anything but the agent for the property You are wounded my man They tell me it happened in the Highway the other day and that afterwards at night you chased Maloney on the plains of Mona after he had fired upon us Tell us about it O Brien Oakes s voice was calm and strong but in it I fancied I detected a note of pity O Brien hesitated stammered How did you know when I was shot he exclaimed I told no one Oakes smiled slightly Out with your story O Brien Did you chase Maloney for revenge or for revenge and business O Brien straightened in the chair Who is this man Clark How peculiar these questions are his look plainly said Why for revenge of course he answered Let s see your wound commanded Oakes O Brien bared his leg the injury was now nearly healed but was still enough to make the man limp Then as he bent down to readjust his trousers Oakes accidentally as it were brushed against his forehead throwing back the hair from O Brien s brow We all saw a long white glistening scar now exposed to full view at the line of the heavy hair The man before us was Larkin the detective Oakes with marvelous tranquillity apologized for the accident and said Why should Maloney have shot you what is behind it all Speak I do not know It was evident to us all that O Brien was avoiding the issue I see exclaimed Oakes As O Brien you know nothing as mister Larkin the detective you know more than it suits you to tell O Brien was on his feet in an instant Who dares insinuate who dares say I am a detective sir Nonsense Keep cool The Chief here has satisfied himself Tell us why should Maloney hate you O Brien glanced around and fixed his gaze on Hallen I am Larkin He hates me because I have been watching him Maloney is the man responsible for the Mansion mysteries I think he said Indeed What else queried Hallen suddenly I believe he may be the murderer of mister Mark What proofs have you asked Oakes as we all leaned forward intently No proof as yet Exactly But mister Larkin you deserve much credit said Oakes as he led O Brien to a chair by Hallen s side Sit here he continued I am going to have Maloney brought in now He has always been a good gardener a decent sort of fellow I must hear his story before I give him up to the Chief It has been suggested that Maloney may be mentally unbalanced you will excuse me mister Larkin if I use you as a foil to draw him out while doctor Moore assists me Then by way of explanation Oakes whose identity was still unknown to Larkin went on You see Chief Hallen wishes to be sure of some little points and so do I Perhaps Maloney will not resent my questioning he should have no feelings against the agent of this property whereas he might object to Hallen as an interlocutor Oakes was now a trifle pale I thought There were furrows on his forehead his manner was suave and deliberately slow But little did I dream the true depth of the man the masterly manner in which he was about to test the mental balance of Maloney To one who was ignorant of the terrible events this story tells of and the dire necessity of discovering once for all who was responsible for them the efforts of these keen scientific men to entrap a weakened brain would have seemed unfair and cruel But for those who knew the story and knew of the murderous deeds done in Mona by some unfortunate with a cunning diabolic although probably unbalanced mind there remained only one alternative to uncover and catch the criminal at all hazards Martin left the room and returned escorting the suspect who was dressed in his working clothes his coat covering a gray jersey His face was stolid but not unprepossessing his bearing quiet and reserved His blue eyes shifted quickly Then as Oakes stood facing him he respectfully saluted mister Clark The detective met him cheerily Good morning Maloney I have asked you as a favor to come here and identify the man who shot at you the other day O Brien has reached the end of his rope now As Oakes finished his sentence Maloney s face changed hue but he faced O Brien hesitatingly as though somewhat at a loss There s the man Yes he shot me he cried Then again Oakes began to speak and we all knew that he was purposely deceiving Maloney playing with him waiting for the moment when he would make the slip when if of diseased mind he would fail to differentiate facts from fiction when the false paths suggested to him would hopelessly entangle him The other night Maloney someone fired upon us on the road We have well nigh proved O Brien is the guilty one You chased him across the plain We owe our thanks to you one and all of us Had you not been so close behind him he would have killed mister Stone here Oakes motioned toward me as he spoke I saw it all He was twisting the facts drawing Maloney into a false idea that he was unsuspected that he was a hero Yes I cried seeing the point instantly I owe my life to you old man I thank you A sudden flash of remembrance seemed to cross the suspect s face Then his brow darkened There was some error here he was no hero But what was it Somehow things were wrong but where Dim recollection came to him then a calmness curious to witness but his eyes were shifting quickly and the fingers of one hand were moving silently over one another as though rolling a crumb of bread The man was suspicious of something but clever enough to be apparently calm although not yet able to understand the flaw in the presentation of facts Then with a supreme effort he seemed to rally to the occasion and cleverly evaded the issue I only did a little thing he said you need not thank me The voice was uncertain the tone pathetic groping Oakes had befuddled the poor intellect Maloney was at sea and sinking Maloney said Oakes again there was gentleness in the detective s voice he knew the man before him was going down Maloney when we were fired upon you were watching the would be murderer this man O Brien You acted with the promptitude of lightning O Brien dropped the weapon he had with him Did you see where it fell It was a great army revolver a forty five calibre weapon Maloney started and straightened up there at least was a familiar subject He remembered that even though his mind failed to remember the details of the assault But Maloney knew there was some mistake it was his weapon not O Brien s that they were talking about Suddenly like a flash came full remembrance momentarily only and he unguardedly blurted out There is only one in the county like it then cunningly ceased speaking as though he feared his tongue but could not exactly reason why There was a scarcely audible sigh of anxiety around the room Oakes had proved Maloney s knowledge of the old revolver doctor Moore was gazing intently at the gardener s neck The carotid arteries were pumping full and strong down deep beneath the tissues moving the ridges of his neck in rhythmic but very rapid undulations the man was showing great excitement Maloney said Oakes again quickly returning to the attack before we were fired upon we fancied we heard a cry over the plain a curious one like someone yelling an oath or an imperious command Did you hear it Yes interpolated Moore We thought the words were Fire or Kill kill We all realized what the clever men were doing telling imaginary things trying to draw from Maloney an acknowledgment of a delusion They were sounding his mind playing for its weak spot The suspect looked surprised bewildered then suddenly fell into the trap His weakened mind had been reached at its point of least resistance As in nearly all insane individuals it took but a proper mention of the predominant delusion to reveal that which might otherwise have gone undetected for a long period Yes whispered Maloney I heard the command It was Kill Murder I have heard it before I am glad you heard it then that proves that I am right I knew I was right I can prove it Surely it is not uncommon Gentlemen I have heard it before I know I believe it was meant for ha ha O Brien ha ha no no for me Moore stepped toward the man whose speech now came thick and fast and unintelligible Hallen closed nearer Maloney was shaking His face was turning dark his jugulars were bulging like whip cords down his neck his eyes sparkling with the unmistakable light of insanity He stooped There it is again Kill kill he cried in thick mumbling tones and bending low Then he straightened up suddenly and flung himself around felling Hallen and Martin as though they were wooden men He seized a chair and hurled it across the table at Elliott who dodged successfully allowing it to crash through the opposite window Quick to see this means of escape Maloney followed through the smashed panes a raving delirious maniac The test carried out with such consummate skill had not only proved Maloney s knowledge of the revolver and that he was subject to delusions but it had also precipitated an unexpected attack of insane excitement an acute mania And now Maloney was gone escaped As Hallen and Martin staggered to their feet the Chief bellowed forth an order in a voice of deepest chagrin and alarm Catch him he cried If he escapes the people will rise in fury We all heard a sickening wild yell of defiance from Maloney as he reached the ground a deep guttural maniac cry that struck terror to my weakened nerves and which froze our men for an instant in their tracks like marble statues Someone broke the awful spell it was Oakes crying out He is going for the pond and the bridge And next instant he and Hallen were out of the front door the men following in a rushing compact body CHAPTER XXIV Across the Bridge As I staggered behind the pursuers I saw the tall erect figure of Quintus glide rapidly across the road and disappear down the decline In the briefest space we were at the crest by the road looking down upon the pond I saw Moore and O Brien by my side the latter swearing like a trooper Who is that mister Clark anyway How did he know who I was Since Hallen s men found me at the farm house this man Clark this agent has had a lot to say He is a man by the name of Oakes I said O Brien or rather Larkin looked at me a moment Quintus Oakes The same The deuce you say No disgrace to me then I understand things now But I should have suspected The murderer reached the bridge and hesitating stooped suddenly at its near side He had evidently picked up something from under one of the logs that formed the span He straightened up and turning suddenly fired at Oakes who was rapidly approaching The deep tones of a heavy revolver were unmistakable Maloney had secured his murderous weapon when he stooped he had had it in hiding under the log He was armed now with a weapon of terrible possibilities In another instant he was across and mounting the green sunlit slope beyond A hundred feet behind was Quintus untouched by the bullet that had been sent his way A few steps and he reached the other side but as he struck the ground the bridge frail thing that it was loosened from its centre support and went crashing into the pond leaving Hallen who was close behind Oakes on this side of the bridge with the rest of us Oakes was alone pursuing the murderer up the slope of the hill on the other side of the water facing us We saw him turn as the bridge fell and look at us then he made a sweeping gesture toward the north and south and turned again after the murderer who was just half way up the slope now his body dotting the surface of the ground with a shadow at his side a shadow of himself company in the race for freedom We all simultaneously interpreted the gestures made by Oakes and Hallen dashed to the north end of the pond to skirt it while Martin and Moore dashed for the southern end leaving Elliott Larkin and myself standing where we commanded full view of what was coming We were conscious of several other figures dashing by us and we knew that his men were straining every nerve and muscle to reach Oakes in his dangerous position It was a long run to skirt either end of the pond and to swing around the opposite shore and thence up the sloping sides to Quintus s aid We three remaining behind were anxious beyond expression I leaned heavily on Elliott and really prevented him from joining in the chase where he would have been useless the others were so much fleeter of foot God that man Oakes is alone with the murderer cried Larkin He is too good a man to lose his life in the fight that is coming Look We saw Maloney halt and face about Then came a slight flash followed by the heavy report of the revolver in his hand Quintus was running slowly up toward him and was perhaps one hundred feet away At the report he staggered and dropped upon the green slippery sward He is wounded cried Elliott I felt sick at heart and weak and sat down Larkin by my side we two were powerless being only convalescent An elegant shot That Maloney is a crack one cried the detective Yes said Elliott it was determined before that Mark s murderer was a good shot Then came another report and we saw that again the murderer had fired Oakes remained quiet His body showed sprawled on the hill side Damnation cried Elliott Is Oakes dead He does not answer with his revolver No cried Larkin I saw him move and see he is braced to prevent himself slipping down the hill He knows he is a poor target and is not anxious to move lest he slide into the pond That grass is frosty and very slippery Then came the delayed crack of Quintus s weapon and Maloney sprang into the air as he ran He now went slowly and painfully lurching forward along the crest of the hill Slightly wounded thank Fate but Oakes could have killed him had he wished cried Larkin We saw Quintus rise and follow Maloney then drop to his chest again as the latter wheeled and fired three shots rapidly at him in delirious excitement Oakes remained quiet and huddled and despite the fact that Maloney was now an excellent target he did not fire Oakes is hit badly exclaimed Elliott Then the speaker did an unexpected thing Seizing his revolver he discharged the weapon again and again in the direction of Maloney A long shot he muttered but I ll keep him guessing We could see the bullets hit somewhere near the fugitive for he seemed disconcerted and turned toward the northern end of the pond to run in that direction he was now outlined on the crest of the hill We heard another shot ring out a shot sharp staccato it was and we then emitted a yell for we knew by it that Oakes was alive Maloney fired again and again Elliott by our side tried two more long shots with his revolver We heard Oakes s voice clear and firm it came wafted across the pond Don t shoot again He has no more ammunition I will get him And Elliott in suppressed excitement exclaimed He was drawing Maloney s fire all the time He was not wounded Yes he knew Maloney had the old six shooter and he knows it is empty now That Oakes keeps everything in mind said Larkin He is a good one Then we saw the figures of the runners skirting the northern end of the pond Hallen was leading He fired at Maloney evidently not having understood Oakes s word and again came that clear voice across the pond Don t fire Hallen remember he is a lunatic and he can t get away now We saw Oakes rush to close in on Maloney but the latter met his attack and the detective was borne to the ground heavily Shoot Oakes shoot I yelled as did Hallen but Quintus responded not We saw that the fight was furious but were unable at first to distinguish the figures as they remained on the ground They were locked in one another s embrace in a deadly awe inspiring struggle Then across one man s neck we saw a forearm the cuff was shining in the sunlight and Elliott cried out That is Oakes The two rose to their feet powerful black objects and by the outline we recognized the tall figure of our friend as they swayed and surged gradually slipping and sliding down the incline toward the deep waters of the pond below Oakes has got him cried Larkin choking him Look at them We saw the murderer s body arch sideways and backward with Oakes s hands around his neck As Maloney s body came down down to the ground again Larkin and Elliott by my side shouted in admiration at the power and skill displayed Suddenly like a flash the maniac turned twisted and next moment encircled Oakes s body with both his arms and rolled toward the water with him He is going to drown Oakes see The words came in a hurried gasp from Elliott who was throwing off his coat and his shoes in a movement quick as the thought that had come to him He s too good a man he cried and with a sudden rush Elliott was at the water s edge and into the pond swimming with strong overhanded strokes head low and sideways toward the opposite shore Larkin and I could scarcely believe our eyes The man was apparently gifted with great powers for he cut through the water steadily surely with a rapidity that was amazing Over opposite the fight was furious always nearing the edge of the pond Help for Oakes was no nearer than Hallen who we could see was dashing around the northern end of the pond in a desperate race to save him On the other end moving like the wind but farther away from the fighting men I distinguished young Martin leading several others in the race for life And down beneath us quarter way across the pond was the solitary swimmer lifting his shoulders well out of the water each time his stroke reached its limit each moment advancing steadily surely I saw at a glance that Oakes was doomed Elliott could not reach him neither could Hallen Larkin by my side supported me for my head was reeling with weakness Suddenly he shouted across the pond Fight him fight him Oakes strangle him I could see now that somehow Oakes s arm was around the maniac s neck and that they were on their feet again Neither had a weapon they had long since been lost in the hand to hand fight Oakes can t do it Why in the devil s name did he try to capture him alive Why did he not shoot to kill instead of to wound simply cried my companion Now Maloney was surging dragging Oakes close to the water s edge closer ever closer Suddenly Oakes weakened and half stepped half retreated to the water s edge then as suddenly the two figures swayed up the hill a few feet again and with a quick cat like movement Oakes was free It was his one supreme effort a masterly wonderfully executed vigorous shove and side step It was evident Maloney was dazed Oakes s strangle hold had told at last We heard a mighty shout from Hallen and another from the swimmer now rapidly approaching the bank Maloney faced Oakes a moment his chest heaved once or twice as his breath returned he crouched then sidled into position for a spring and launched himself toward Oakes who pale as death stood swaying his arms by his side apparently all but done for Then we all witnessed that which thrilled us to the heart the sudden wonderful mastery of science aided by strength over sheer brute force Maloney came toward Oakes in a fearful rush that was to take both together out into the pond to death Instantly Oakes s swaying body tightened and steadied I knew then as did Larkin that Oakes had been deceiving Maloney that the detective was still master of himself As the heavy body closed upon him Oakes stepped suddenly forward His left arm shot upward with a vicious swinging motion and as his fist reached the jaw his body lurched forward and sideways in a terrible muscular effort carrying fearful impetus to the blow Then instantly as Maloney staggered Oakes swung himself half around and the right arm shot upward and across to the mark with fearful speed and certainty The on rushing maniac was half stopped and twisted in his course His head swung sideways and outward with the last impact upon the jaw his legs failed to lift and with a wabbling shuddering tremor the body sank to the water s edge The next instant Hallen came tumbling on to the murderer I heard the click of handcuffs I saw the white shirt and black trousers of Elliott squirm up the bank and next moment the vigorous swimmer the aristocratic great hearted club man caught Oakes in his arms as the detective lurched forward and fell momentarily overcome by his last supreme effort A great rousing cheer reverberated from bank to bank We took it up and sent it back in lessened volume but undiminished spirit They now came back from the other side of the pond by the way of the north end the men assisting Oakes carefully up the incline to us and bringing also Maloney His eyes were bloodshot his features squirming in horrible movements and through it all he talked and talked his brain was working with great rapidity he was shouting declaiming laughing and all the while his sentences were without significance without lucidity Oakes pointed to the maniac I regret extremely he said that I was forced to wound him slightly I could not let him escape with that weapon in his hand An approving murmur rose from the men but Oakes checked them frowning his displeasure Then he turned to Martin Look at his left arm boys Hallen and Martin ripped off the sleeve and Dowd after peering at the arm excitedly exclaimed The blue cross Quintus Oakes you are right Yes surely there on the left arm just below the shoulder was a cross done by some skilled tattooer s hand in days long past a cross of indigo Then in the road a team appeared from the Mansion and Dowd jumped in and waved his hand as he started Where are you going cried Hallen To Mona to get out an extra to tell how Clark mister Clark of the Mansion has captured the murderer aided by Hallen of Mona As the team started Dowd yelled back again And I am going to tell Mona that Clark is QUINTUS OAKES Hallen waved his arms while we all again cheered the name of our friend as we bore him in triumph back to the Mansion CHAPTER XXV The Man of the Hour Soon we heard the tones of a bell from far away one two three then a pause then a few quick strokes followed by a low single deep note Hallen answered our looks of astonishment That s the old bell of headquarters The Mayor promised to ring it day or night when the mystery was solved and Dowd has carried the news Then again came the deep tones in quicker rhythm and we knew it was all the old bell could do in the way of joy We scarce had time to congratulate Oakes on the splendid termination of his work before Hallen was away with his men taking Maloney to town by a roundabout way Then came the crowd to besiege the Mansion and to call for Oakes and for Hallen in fact for us all The growling and discontent had vanished the past uneasiness was gone Oakes and Hallen were now the heroes of Mona Oakes spoke a few words of thanks to the crowd and tried to dispose of it by saying that Hallen had returned to town with the prisoner but it lingered long before the Mansion discussing the successful termination of Mona s woes Now that a master had unravelled the mystery details were not difficult to supply Many recalled suddenly that they had always thought Maloney queer though they had never considered as significant the points that might have been vital Such is always the case with untrained observers We made our farewells that night for we were to return to New York next day but Quintus kept the hour of our going private for as he said to us he had had too much of the kindness of Mona already and there were whispers of an ovation or something of that sort reserved for our departure You know Stone Oakes said to me we really don t deserve all this good feeling these people will never stop I am going to slip out quietly tomorrow and you and doctor Moore can come later Nonsense said I stay and let them show their appreciation of what you have done Why old man you have changed the course of events in Mona you cannot help being in their minds You don t understand said he I dislike heroics Mona overestimates matters I am going away unexpectedly Here he set his jaws hard and looked determined self reliant half disgusted I knew that he was in earnest and that his nature was calling once more for action and not for praise At eleven o clock next morning Oakes walked over to the police headquarters while doctor Moore and I remained in the hotel casually watching him He was going to make a short call on Chief Hallen as he had frequently done before and it was to be his farewell He had planned to have a horse at the proper moment and to mount quickly and leave for the station alone thus avoiding notice and any demonstration Since we remained at the hotel he hoped that the people would be misled into thinking that he would return to us and that we would all go together But for once Quintus Oakes was wrong Mona was on the lookout for him and he had no sooner gone into headquarters than some one started the rumor that the man was going away quietly In a minute the place was the centre of a seething happy expectant crowd When Oakes finally appeared at the steps instead of seeing his horse rounding the corner as he had planned he beheld the crowd in waiting He made a step back to enter the headquarters door but Chief Hallen laughingly held him and Quintus Oakes was cornered Moore and I were now with the crowd and joined in the laugh at his expense A deep flush appeared on his face but we all noticed a merry twinkle in his deep blue eyes nevertheless Somebody cried for a speech Oakes hesitated and again tried to retreat but at that moment all eyes were turned suddenly to a wagon coming down the side street and accompanied by a small crowd It turned into the Square and a hush fell over all for there in the vehicle was Maloney the murderer and an old gray haired man Skinner The murderer of mister Mark was handcuffed and sat heavily guarded but the old man was not a prisoner his head was bowed in silent grief as he sat by Maloney s side It was evident to all that the prisoner was being removed from headquarters to the court house for trial and that the father was bearing his burden before the world Quintus Oakes gave a glance of pity at the prisoner and an extremely sorrowful expression crossed his strong handsome face as he recognized the old man by Maloney s side The populace recovering from its surprise at sight of the wagon changed its mood and surrounded it with angry demonstrations hissing and threatening The face of the prisoner was calm proud defiant the face of a man in triumphal entry He was unconscious of his awful position his awful crimes He saw only the notoriety doctor Moore turned to me See Maloney see his face he thinks himself a hero he is too insane to appreciate the truth But Skinner looked out upon the crowd and paled then glancing up he caught the eyes of Quintus Oakes and with a harrowing beseeching expression bent his gray head into his hands The populace in fury tried to stop the wagon but now at this instant Oakes rose to the occasion and the man showed the mettle and the humanity that was in him Rising to his full height he spoke Stop This is no time to hiss Remember the murderer is irresponsible the other is his father an old old man As Quintus s voice rang out in its clear strong notes with a marvelously tender accent and as the full meaning of his words became apparent a sudden silence seized the crowd a silence intense uneasy sympathetic Quintus Oakes was single handed alone but the master mind the controlling man among us all The silence deepened as men glanced about with ill concealed emotion deep suppressed The wagon moved on and the stillness was broken only by the crunching of the wheels and the occasional sighing heavy breathing of the populace Over all was the suspense the quick awe inspiring change from vicious hatred to pity and grief blended instantly in the hearts of all by that strong vigorous quick minded man of action and of justice OAKES Taking advantage of the lull Quintus stepped into the crowd and before any could foresee his purpose he threw his coat over the pommel of a saddled horse just being led around the corner his horse and springing lightly gracefully to the saddle took the reins The crowd divining his intent closed about him but with horsemanship beautiful to behold he forced the animal to canter to one side and then to rear making an opening in the crowd The next moment he darted forward away as the people realizing the tenderness of his speech and that he was leaving them perhaps for always bellowed a reverberating tumultuous farewell Chief Hallen shouted a hurried command and the next moment we were all electrified to hear the deep tones of the bell of headquarters ringing out its ponderous God speed Oakes turned in his saddle at the first stroke and with blazing eyes and suppressed pride waved a last vigorous acknowledgment FINIS Transcriber s note A few printer s errors in the punctuation have been corrected as has the spelling
