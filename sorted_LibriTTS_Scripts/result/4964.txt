important to note that this book is part of the Caledonian series The Caledonian series is a group of fifty books comprising all of Sir Walter Scott s works WAVERLEY OR T IS SIXTY YEARS SINCE BY SIR WALTER SCOTT VOLUME I PUBLISHERS NOTE It has long been the ambition of the present publishers to offer to the public an ideal edition of the writings of Sir Walter Scott the great poet and novelist of whom William Hazlitt said His works are almost like a new edition of human nature Secure in the belief not only that his writings have achieved a permanent place in the literature of the world but that succeeding generations will prize them still more highly we have after the most careful planning and study undertaken the publication of this edition of the Waverley Novels and the complete poetical writings It is evident that the ideal edition of a great classic must be distinguished in typography must present the best available text and must be illustrated in such a way as at once to be beautiful in itself and to add to the reader s pleasure and his understanding of the book As to the typography and text little need be said here The format of the edition has been most carefully studied and represents the use of the best resources of The Riverside Press The text has been carefully edited in the light of Scott s own revisions all of his own latest notes have been included glossaries have been added and full descriptive notes to the illustrations have been prepared which will we hope add greatly to the reader s interest and instruction in the reading of the novels and poems Of the illustrations which make the special feature of this edition something more may be said In the case of an author like Sir Walter Scott the ideal edition requires that the beautiful and romantic scenery amid which he lived and of which he wrote shall be adequately presented to the reader No other author ever used more charming backgrounds or employed them to better advantage To see Scotland and to visit in person all the scenes of the novels and poems would enable the reader fully to understand these backgrounds and thereby add materially to his appreciation of the author Before beginning the preparation of this edition the head of the department having it in charge made a visit in person to the scenes of the novels and poems determined to explore all the localities referred to by the author so far as they could be identified The field proved even more productive than had been at first supposed and photographs were obtained in sufficient quantity to illustrate all the volumes These pictures represent the scenes very much as Scott saw them The natural scenery mountains woods lakes rivers seashore and the like is nearly the same as in his day The ruins of ancient castles and abbeys were found to correspond very closely with his descriptions though in many instances he had in imagination rebuilt these ruins and filled them with the children of his fancy The scenes of the stories extend into nearly every county in Scotland and through a large part of England and Wales All of these were thoroughly investigated and photographs were made of everything of interest One of the novels has to do with France and Belgium one with Switzerland one with the Holy Land one with Constantinople and one with India For all of these lands which Scott did not visit in person and therefore did not describe with the same attention to detail as in the case of his own country interesting pictures of characteristic scenery were secured By this method the publishers have hoped to bring before the reader a series of photographs which will not only please the eye and give a satisfactory artistic effect to the volumes but also increase the reader s knowledge of the country described and add a new charm to the delightful work of the author In addition to the photographs old engravings and paintings have been reproduced for the illustration of novels having to do with old buildings streets et cetera which have long since disappeared For this material a careful search was made in the British Museum the Advocates Library and City Museum Edinburgh the Library at Abbotsford the Bibliotheque Nationale Paris and other collections It has been thought too that the ideal edition of Scott s works would not be complete without an adequate portrayal of his more memorable characters This has been accomplished in a series of frontispieces specially painted for this edition by twenty of the most distinguished illustrators of England four PARK STREET BOSTON ADVERTISEMENT TO THE WAVERLEY NOVELS IT has been the occasional occupation of the Author of Waverley for several years past to revise and correct the voluminous series of Novels which pass under that name in order that if they should ever appear as his avowed productions he might render them in some degree deserving of a continuance of the public favour with which they have been honoured ever since their first appearance For a long period however it seemed likely that the improved and illustrated edition which he meditated would be a posthumous publication But the course of the events which occasioned the disclosure of the Author s name having in a great measure restored to him a sort of parental control over these Works he is naturally induced to give them to the press in a corrected and he hopes an improved form while life and health permit the task of revising and illustrating them Such being his purpose it is necessary to say a few words on the plan of the proposed Edition In stating it to be revised and corrected it is not to be inferred that any attempt is made to alter the tenor of the stories the character of the actors or the spirit of the dialogue There is no doubt ample room for emendation in all these points but where the tree falls it must lie Any attempt to obviate criticism however just by altering a work already in the hands of the public is generally unsuccessful In the most improbable fiction the reader still desires some air of vraisemblance and does not relish that the incidents of a tale familiar to him should be altered to suit the taste of critics or the caprice of the Author himself This process of feeling is so natural that it may be observed even in children who cannot endure that a nursery story should be repeated to them differently from the manner in which it was first told But without altering in the slightest degree either the story or the mode of telling it the Author has taken this opportunity to correct errors of the press and slips of the pen That such should exist cannot be wondered at when it is considered that the Publishers found it their interest to hurry through the press a succession of the early editions of the various Novels and that the Author had not the usual opportunity of revision It is hoped that the present edition will be found free from errors of that accidental kind The Author has also ventured to make some emendations of a different character which without being such apparent deviations from the original stories as to disturb the reader s old associations will he thinks add something to the spirit of the dialogue narrative or description These consist in occasional pruning where the language is redundant compression where the style is loose infusion of vigour where it is languid the exchange of less forcible for more appropriate epithets slight alterations in short like the last touches of an artist which contribute to heighten and finish the picture though an inexperienced eye can hardly detect in what they consist The General Preface to the new Edition and the Introductory Notices to each separate work will contain an account of such circumstances attending the first publication of the Novels and Tales as may appear interesting in themselves or proper to be communicated to the public The Author also proposes to publish on this occasion the various legends family traditions or obscure historical facts which have formed the ground work of these Novels and to give some account of the places where the scenes are laid when these are altogether or in part real as well as a statement of particular incidents founded on fact together with a more copious Glossary and Notes explanatory of the ancient customs and popular superstitions referred to in the Romances Upon the whole it is hoped that the Waverley Novels in their new dress will not be found to have lost any part of their attractions in consequence of receiving illustrations by the Author and undergoing his careful revision ABBOTSFORD January eighteen twenty nine GENERAL PREFACE TO THE WAVERLEY NOVELS And must I ravel out My weaved up follies Richard II Act IV Having undertaken to give an Introductory Account of the compositions which are here offered to the public with Notes and Illustrations the Author under whose name they are now for the first time collected feels that he has the delicate task of speaking more of himself and his personal concerns than may perhaps be either graceful or prudent In this particular he runs the risk of presenting himself to the public in the relation that the dumb wife in the jest book held to her husband when having spent half of his fortune to obtain the cure of her imperfection he was willing to have bestowed the other half to restore her to her former condition But this is a risk inseparable from the task which the Author has undertaken and he can only promise to be as little of an egotist as the situation will permit It is perhaps an indifferent sign of a disposition to keep his word that having introduced himself in the third person singular he proceeds in the second paragraph to make use of the first But it appears to him that the seeming modesty connected with the former mode of writing is overbalanced by the inconvenience of stiffness and affectation which attends it during a narrative of some length and which may be observed less or more in every work in which the third person is used from the Commentaries of Caesar to the Autobiography of Alexander the Corrector I must refer to a very early period of my life were I to point out my first achievements as a tale teller but I believe some of my old schoolfellows can still bear witness that I had a distinguished character for that talent at a time when the applause of my companions was my recompense for the disgraces and punishments which the future romance writer incurred for being idle himself and keeping others idle during hours that should have been employed on our tasks The chief enjoyment of my holidays was to escape with a chosen friend who had the same taste with myself and alternately to recite to each other such wild adventures as we were able to devise We told each in turn interminable tales of knight errantry and battles and enchantments which were continued from one day to another as opportunity offered without our ever thinking of bringing them to a conclusion As we observed a strict secrecy on the subject of this intercourse it acquired all the character of a concealed pleasure and we used to select for the scenes of our indulgence long walks through the solitary and romantic environs of Arthur s Seat Salisbury Crags Braid Hills and similar places in the vicinity of Edinburgh and the recollection of those holidays still forms an oasis in the pilgrimage which I have to look back upon I have only to add that my friend still lives a prosperous gentleman but too much occupied with graver business to thank me for indicating him more plainly as a confidant of my childish mystery When boyhood advancing into youth required more serious studies and graver cares a long illness threw me back on the kingdom of fiction as if it were by a species of fatality My indisposition arose in part at least from my having broken a blood vessel and motion and speech were for a long time pronounced positively dangerous For several weeks I was confined strictly to my bed during which time I was not allowed to speak above a whisper to eat more than a spoonful or two of boiled rice or to have more covering than one thin counterpane When the reader is informed that I was at this time a growing youth with the spirits appetite and impatience of fifteen and suffered of course greatly under this severe regimen which the repeated return of my disorder rendered indispensable he will not be surprised that I was abandoned to my own discretion so far as reading my almost sole amusement was concerned and still less so that I abused the indulgence which left my time so much at my own disposal There was at this time a circulating library in Edinburgh founded I believe by the celebrated Allan Ramsay which besides containing a most respectable collection of books of every description was as might have been expected peculiarly rich in works of fiction It exhibited specimens of every kind from the romances of chivalry and the ponderous folios of Cyrus and Cassandra down to the most approved works of later times I was plunged into this great ocean of reading without compass or pilot and unless when some one had the charity to play at chess with me I was allowed to do nothing save read from morning to night I was in kindness and pity which was perhaps erroneous however natural permitted to select my subjects of study at my own pleasure upon the same principle that the humours of children are indulged to keep them out of mischief As my taste and appetite were gratified in nothing else I indemnified myself by becoming a glutton of books Accordingly I believe I read almost all the romances old plays and epic poetry in that formidable collection and no doubt was unconsciously amassing materials for the task in which it has been my lot to be so much employed At the same time I did not in all respects abuse the license permitted me Familiar acquaintance with the specious miracles of fiction brought with it some degree of satiety and I began by degrees to seek in histories memoirs voyages and travels and the like events nearly as wonderful as those which were the work of imagination with the additional advantage that they were at least in a great measure true The lapse of nearly two years during which I was left to the exercise of my own free will was followed by a temporary residence in the country where I was again very lonely but for the amusement which I derived from a good though old fashioned library The vague and wild use which I made of this advantage I cannot describe better than by referring my reader to the desultory studies of Waverley in a similar situation the passages concerning whose course of reading were imitated from recollections of my own It must be understood that the resemblance extends no farther Time as it glided on brought the blessings of confirmed health and personal strength to a degree which had never been expected or hoped for The severe studies necessary to render me fit for my profession occupied the greater part of my time and the society of my friends and companions who were about to enter life along with me filled up the interval with the usual amusements of young men I was in a situation which rendered serious labour indispensable for neither possessing on the one hand any of those peculiar advantages which are supposed to favour a hasty advance in the profession of the law nor being on the other hand exposed to unusual obstacles to interrupt my progress I might reasonably expect to succeed according to the greater or less degree of trouble which I should take to qualify myself as a pleader It makes no part of the present story to detail how the success of a few ballads had the effect of changing all the purpose and tenor of my life and of converting a painstaking lawyer of some years standing into a follower of literature It is enough to say that I had assumed the latter character for several years before I seriously thought of attempting a work of imagination in prose although one or two of my poetical attempts did not differ from romances otherwise than by being written in verse But yet I may observe that about this time now alas thirty years since I had nourished the ambitious desire of composing a tale of chivalry which was to be in the style of the Castle of Otranto with plenty of Border characters and supernatural incident Having found unexpectedly a chapter of this intended work among some old papers I have subjoined it to this introductory essay thinking some readers may account as curious the first attempts at romantic composition by an author who has since written so much in that department Footnote See Appendix No I And those who complain not unreasonably of the profusion of the Tales which have followed Waverley may bless their stars at the narrow escape they have made by the commencement of the inundation which had so nearly taken place in the first year of the century being postponed for fifteen years later This particular subject was never resumed but I did not abandon the idea of fictitious composition in prose though I determined to give another turn to the style of the work My early recollections of the Highland scenery and customs made so favourable an impression in the poem called the Lady of the Lake that I was induced to think of attempting something of the same kind in prose I had been a good deal in the Highlands at a time when they were much less accessible and much less visited than they have been of late years and was acquainted with many of the old warriors of seventeen forty five who were like most veterans easily induced to fight their battles over again for the benefit of a willing listener like myself It naturally occurred to me that the ancient traditions and high spirit of a people who living in a civilised age and country retained so strong a tincture of manners belonging to an early period of society must afford a subject favourable for romance if it should not prove a curious tale marred in the telling It was with some idea of this kind that about the year eighteen oh five I threw together about one third part of the first volume of Waverley It was advertised to be published by the late mister John Ballantyne bookseller in Edinburgh under the name of Waverley or Tis Fifty Years Since a title afterwards altered to Tis Sixty Years Since that the actual date of publication might be made to correspond with the period in which the scene was laid Having proceeded as far I think as the seventh chapter I showed my work to a critical friend whose opinion was unfavourable and having then some poetical reputation I was unwilling to risk the loss of it by attempting a new style of composition I therefore threw aside the work I had commenced without either reluctance or remonstrance I ought to add that though my ingenious friend s sentence was afterwards reversed on an appeal to the public it cannot be considered as any imputation on his good taste for the specimen subjected to his criticism did not extend beyond the departure of the hero for Scotland and consequently had not entered upon the part of the story which was finally found most interesting Be that as it may this portion of the manuscript was laid aside in the drawers of an old writing desk which on my first coming to reside at Abbotsford in eighteen eleven was placed in a lumber garret and entirely forgotten Thus though I sometimes among other literary avocations turned my thoughts to the continuation of the romance which I had commenced yet as I could not find what I had already written after searching such repositories as were within my reach and was too indolent to attempt to write it anew from memory I as often laid aside all thoughts of that nature Two circumstances in particular recalled my recollection of the mislaid manuscript The first was the extended and well merited fame of Miss Edgeworth whose Irish characters have gone so far to make the English familiar with the character of their gay and kind hearted neighbours of Ireland that she may be truly said to have done more towards completing the Union than perhaps all the legislative enactments by which it has been followed up Without being so presumptuous as to hope to emulate the rich humour pathetic tenderness and admirable tact which pervade the works of my accomplished friend I felt that something might be attempted for my own country of the same kind with that which Miss Edgeworth so fortunately achieved for Ireland something which might introduce her natives to those of the sister kingdom in a more favourable light than they had been placed hitherto and tend to procure sympathy for their virtues and indulgence for their foibles I thought also that much of what I wanted in talent might be made up by the intimate acquaintance with the subject which I could lay claim to possess as having travelled through most parts of Scotland both Highland and Lowland having been familiar with the elder as well as more modern race and having had from my infancy free and unrestrained communication with all ranks of my countrymen from the Scottish peer to the Scottish plough man Such ideas often occurred to me and constituted an ambitious branch of my theory however far short I may have fallen of it in practice But it was not only the triumphs of Miss Edgeworth which worked in me emulation and disturbed my indolence I chanced actually to engage in a work which formed a sort of essay piece and gave me hope that I might in time become free of the craft of romance writing and be esteemed a tolerable workman In the year eighteen oh seven eight I undertook at the request of John Murray esquire of Albemarle Street to arrange for publication some posthumous productions of the late mister Joseph Strutt distinguished as an artist and an antiquary amongst which was an unfinished romance entitled Queenhoo Hall The scene of the tale was laid in the reign of Henry VI and the work was written to illustrate the manners customs and language of the people of England during that period The extensive acquaintance which mister Strutt had acquired with such subjects in compiling his laborious Horda Angel Cynnan his Regal and Ecclesiastical Antiquities and his Essay on the Sports and Pastimes of the People of England had rendered him familiar with all the antiquarian lore necessary for the purpose of composing the projected romance and although the manuscript bore the marks of hurry and incoherence natural to the first rough draught of the author it evinced in my opinion considerable powers of imagination As the work was unfinished I deemed it my duty as editor to supply such a hasty and inartificial conclusion as could be shaped out from the story of which mister Strutt had laid the foundation This concluding chapter Footnote See Appendix No II is also added to the present Introduction for the reason already mentioned regarding the preceding fragment It was a step in my advance towards romantic composition and to preserve the traces of these is in a great measure the object of this Essay Queenhoo Hall was not however very successful I thought I was aware of the reason and supposed that by rendering his language too ancient and displaying his antiquarian knowledge too liberally the ingenious author had raised up an obstacle to his own success Every work designed for mere amusement must be expressed in language easily comprehended and when as is sometimes the case in QUEENHOO HALL the author addresses himself exclusively to the antiquary he must be content to be dismissed by the general reader with the criticism of Mungo in the PADLOCK on the Mauritanian music What signifies me hear if me no understand I conceived it possible to avoid this error and by rendering a similar work more light and obvious to general comprehension to escape the rock on which my predecessor was shipwrecked But I was on the other hand so far discouraged by the indifferent reception of mister Strutt s romance as to become satisfied that the manners of the middle ages did not possess the interest which I had conceived and was led to form the opinion that a romance founded on a Highland story and more modern events would have a better chance of popularity than a tale of chivalry My thoughts therefore returned more than once to the tale which I had actually commenced and accident at length threw the lost sheets in my way I happened to want some fishing tackle for the use of a guest when it occurred to me to search the old writing desk already mentioned in which I used to keep articles of that nature I got access to it with some difficulty and in looking for lines and flies the long lost manuscript presented itself I immediately set to work to complete it according to my original purpose And here I must frankly confess that the mode in which I conducted the story scarcely deserved the success which the romance afterwards attained The tale of WAVERLEY was put together with so little care that I cannot boast of having sketched any distinct plan of the work The whole adventures of Waverley in his movements up and down the country with the Highland cateran Bean Lean are managed without much skill It suited best however the road I wanted to travel and permitted me to introduce some descriptions of scenery and manners to which the reality gave an interest which the powers of the Author might have otherwise failed to attain for them And though I have been in other instances a sinner in this sort I do not recollect any of these novels in which I have transgressed so widely as in the first of the series Among other unfounded reports it has been said that the copyright of Waverley was during the book s progress through the press offered for sale to various book sellers in London at a very inconsiderable price This was not the case Messrs Constable and Cadell who published the work were the only persons acquainted with the contents of the publication and they offered a large sum for it while in the course of printing which however was declined the Author not choosing to part with the copyright The origin of the story of Waverley and the particular facts on which it is founded are given in the separate introduction prefixed to that romance in this edition and require no notice in this place Waverley was published in eighteen fourteen and as the title page was without the name of the Author the work was left to win its way in the world without any of the usual recommendations Its progress was for some time slow but after the first two or three months its popularity had increased in a degree which must have satisfied the expectations of the Author had these been far more sanguine than he ever entertained Great anxiety was expressed to learn the name of the Author but on this no authentic information could be attained My original motive for publishing the work anonymously was the consciousness that it was an experiment on the public taste which might very probably fail and therefore there was no occasion to take on myself the personal risk of discomfiture For this purpose considerable precautions were used to preserve secrecy My old friend and schoolfellow mister James Ballantyne who printed these Novels had the exclusive task of corresponding with the Author who thus had not only the advantage of his professional talents but also of his critical abilities The original manuscript or as it is technically called copy was transcribed under mister Ballantyne s eye by confidential persons nor was there an instance of treachery during the many years in which these precautions were resorted to although various individuals were employed at different times Double proof sheets were regularly printed off One was forwarded to the Author by mister Ballantyne and the alterations which it received were by his own hand copied upon the other proof sheet for the use of the printers so that even the corrected proofs of the Author were never seen in the printing office and thus the curiosity of such eager inquirers as made the most minute investigation was entirely at fault But although the cause of concealing the Author s name in the first instance when the reception of Waverley was doubtful was natural enough it is more difficult it may be thought to account for the same desire for secrecy during the subsequent editions to the amount of betwixt eleven and twelve thousand copies which followed each other close and proved the success of the work I am sorry I can give little satisfaction to queries on this subject I have already stated elsewhere that I can render little better reason for choosing to remain anonymous than by saying with Shylock that such was my humour It will be observed that I had not the usual stimulus for desiring personal reputation the desire namely to float amidst the conversation of men Of literary fame whether merited or undeserved I had already as much as might have contented a mind more ambitious than mine and in entering into this new contest for reputation I might be said rather to endanger what I had than to have any considerable chance of acquiring more I was affected too by none of those motives which at an earlier period of life would doubtless have operated upon me My friendships were formed my place in society fixed my life had attained its middle course My condition in society was higher perhaps than I deserved certainly as high as I wished and there was scarce any degree of literary success which could have greatly altered or improved my personal condition I was not therefore touched by the spur of ambition usually stimulating on such occasions and yet I ought to stand exculpated from the charge of ungracious or unbecoming indifference to public applause I did not the less feel gratitude for the public favour although I did not proclaim it as the lover who wears his mistress s favour in his bosom is as proud though not so vain of possessing it as another who displays the token of her grace upon his bonnet Far from such an ungracious state of mind I have seldom felt more satisfaction than when returning from a pleasure voyage I found Waverley in the zenith of popularity and public curiosity in full cry after the name of the Author The knowledge that I had the public approbation was like having the property of a hidden treasure not less gratifying to the owner than if all the world knew that it was his own Another advantage was connected with the secrecy which I observed I could appear or retreat from the stage at pleasure without attracting any personal notice or attention other than what might be founded on suspicion only In my own person also as a successful author in another department of literature I might have been charged with too frequent intrusions on the public patience but the Author of Waverley was in this respect as impassible to the critic as the Ghost of Hamlet to the partisan of Marcellus Perhaps the curiosity of the public irritated by the existence of a secret and kept afloat by the discussions which took place on the subject from time to time went a good way to maintain an unabated interest in these frequent publications There was a mystery concerning the Author which each new novel was expected to assist in unravelling although it might in other respects rank lower than its predecessors I may perhaps be thought guilty of affectation should I allege as one reason of my silence a secret dislike to enter on personal discussions concerning my own literary labours It is in every case a dangerous intercourse for an author to be dwelling continually among those who make his writings a frequent and familiar subject of conversation but who must necessarily be partial judges of works composed in their own society The habits of self importance which are thus acquired by authors are highly injurious to a well regulated mind for the cup of flattery if it does not like that of Circe reduce men to the level of beasts is sure if eagerly drained to bring the best and the ablest down to that of fools This risk was in some degree prevented by the mask which I wore and my own stores of self conceit were left to their natural course without being enhanced by the partiality of friends or adulation of flatterers If I am asked further reasons for the conduct I have long observed I can only resort to the explanation supplied by a critic as friendly as he is intelligent namely that the mental organisation of the novelist must be characterised to speak craniologically by an extraordinary development of the passion for delitescency I the rather suspect some natural disposition of this kind for from the instant I perceived the extreme curiosity manifested on the subject I felt a secret satisfaction in baffling it for which when its unimportance is considered I do not well know how to account My desire to remain concealed in the character of the Author of these Novels subjected me occasionally to awkward embarrassments as it sometimes happened that those who were sufficiently intimate with me would put the question in direct terms In this case only one of three courses could be followed Either I must have surrendered my secret or have returned an equivocating answer or finally must have stoutly and boldly denied the fact The first was a sacrifice which I conceive no one had a right to force from me since I alone was concerned in the matter The alternative of rendering a doubtful answer must have left me open to the degrading suspicion that I was not unwilling to assume the merit if there was any which I dared not absolutely lay claim to or those who might think more justly of me must have received such an equivocal answer as an indirect avowal I therefore considered myself entitled like an accused person put upon trial to refuse giving my own evidence to my own conviction and flatly to deny all that could not be proved against me At the same time I usually qualified my denial by stating that had I been the Author of these works I would have felt myself quite entitled to protect my secret by refusing my own evidence when it was asked for to accomplish a discovery of what I desired to conceal The real truth is that I never expected or hoped to disguise my connection with these Novels from any one who lived on terms of intimacy with me The number of coincidences which necessarily existed between narratives recounted modes of expression and opinions broached in these Tales and such as were used by their Author in the intercourse of private life must have been far too great to permit any of my familiar acquaintances to doubt the identity betwixt their friend and the Author of Waverley and I believe they were all morally convinced of it But while I was myself silent their belief could not weigh much more with the world than that of others their opinions and reasoning were liable to be taxed with partiality or confronted with opposing arguments and opinions and the question was not so much whether I should be generally acknowledged to be the Author in spite of my own denial as whether even my own avowal of the works if such should be made would be sufficient to put me in undisputed possession of that character I have been often asked concerning supposed cases in which I was said to have been placed on the verge of discovery but as I maintained my point with the composure of a lawyer of thirty years standing I never recollect being in pain or confusion on the subject In Captain Medwyn s Conversations of Lord Byron the reporter states himself to have asked my noble and highly gifted friend If he was certain about these Novels being Sir Walter Scott s To which Lord Byron replied Scott as much as owned himself the Author of Waverley to me in Murray s shop I was talking to him about that Novel and lamented that its Author had not carried back the story nearer to the time of the Revolution Scott entirely off his guard replied Ay I might have done so but there he stopped It was in vain to attempt to correct himself he looked confused and relieved his embarrassment by a precipitate retreat I have no recollection whatever of this scene taking place and I should have thought that I was more likely to have laughed than to appear confused for I certainly never hoped to impose upon Lord Byron in a case of the kind and from the manner in which he uniformly expressed himself I knew his opinion was entirely formed and that any disclamations of mine would only have savoured of affectation I do not mean to insinuate that the incident did not happen but only that it could hardly have occurred exactly under the circumstances narrated without my recollecting something positive on the subject In another part of the same volume Lord Byron is reported to have expressed a supposition that the cause of my not avowing myself the Author of Waverley may have been some surmise that the reigning family would have been displeased with the work I can only say it is the last apprehension I should have entertained as indeed the inscription to these volumes sufficiently proves The sufferers of that melancholy period have during the last and present reign been honoured both with the sympathy and protection of the reigning family whose magnanimity can well pardon a sigh from others and bestow one themselves to the memory of brave opponents who did nothing in hate but all in honour While those who were in habitual intercourse with the real author had little hesitation in assigning the literary property to him others and those critics of no mean rank employed themselves in investigating with persevering patience any characteristic features which might seem to betray the origin of these Novels Amongst these one gentleman equally remarkable for the kind and liberal tone of his criticism the acuteness of his reasoning and the very gentlemanlike manner in which he conducted his inquiries displayed not only powers of accurate investigation but a temper of mind deserving to be employed on a subject of much greater importance and I have no doubt made converts to his opinion of almost all who thought the point worthy of consideration Footnote Letters on the Author of Waverly Rodwell and Martin London eighteen twenty two Of those letters and other attempts of the same kind the Author could not complain though his incognito was endangered He had challenged the public to a game at bo peep and if he was discovered in his hiding hole he must submit to the shame of detection Various reports were of course circulated in various ways some founded on an inaccurate rehearsal of what may have been partly real some on circumstances having no concern whatever with the subject and others on the invention of some importunate persons who might perhaps imagine that the readiest mode of forcing the Author to disclose himself was to assign some dishonourable and discreditable cause for his silence It may be easily supposed that this sort of inquisition was treated with contempt by the person whom it principally regarded as among all the rumours that were current there was only one and that as unfounded as the others which had nevertheless some alliance to probability and indeed might have proved in some degree true I allude to a report which ascribed a great part or the whole of these Novels to the late Thomas Scott esquire of the seventieth Regiment then stationed in Canada Those who remember that gentleman will readily grant that with general talents at least equal to those of his elder brother he added a power of social humour and a deep insight into human character which rendered him an universally delightful member of society and that the habit of composition alone was wanting to render him equally successful as a writer The Author of Waverley was so persuaded of the truth of this that he warmly pressed his brother to make such an experiment and willingly undertook all the trouble of correcting and superintending the press mister Thomas Scott seemed at first very well disposed to embrace the proposal and had even fixed on a subject and a hero The latter was a person well known to both of us in our boyish years from having displayed some strong traits of character mister T Scott had determined to represent his youthful acquaintance as emigrating to America and encountering the dangers and hardships of the New World with the same dauntless spirit which he had displayed when a boy in his native country mister Scott would probably have been highly successful being familiarly acquainted with the manners of the native Indians of the old French settlers in Canada and of the Brules or Woodsmen and having the power of observing with accuracy what I have no doubt he could have sketched with force and expression In short the Author believes his brother would have made himself distinguished in that striking field in which since that period mister Cooper has achieved so many triumphs But mister T Scott was already affected by bad health which wholly unfitted him for literary labour even if he could have reconciled his patience to the task He never I believe wrote a single line of the projected work and I only have the melancholy pleasure of preserving in the Appendix Footnote See Appendix No III the simple anecdote on which he proposed to found it To this I may add I can easily conceive that there may have been circumstances which gave a colour to the general report of my brother being interested in these works and in particular that it might derive strength from my having occasion to remit to him in consequence of certain family transactions some considerable sums of money about that period To which it is to be added that if any person chanced to evince particular curiosity on such a subject my brother was likely enough to divert himself with practising on their credulity It may be mentioned that while the paternity of these Novels was from time to time warmly disputed in Britain the foreign booksellers expressed no hesitation on the matter but affixed my name to the whole of the Novels and to some besides to which I had no claim The volumes therefore to which the present pages form a Preface are entirely the composition of the Author by whom they are now acknowledged with the exception always of avowed quotations and such unpremeditated and involuntary plagiarisms as can scarce be guarded against by any one who has read and written a great deal The original manuscripts are all in existence and entirely written horresco referens in the Author s own hand excepting during the years eighteen eighteen and eighteen nineteen when being affected with severe illness he was obliged to employ the assistance of a friendly amanuensis The number of persons to whom the secret was necessarily entrusted or communicated by chance amounted I should think to twenty at least to whom I am greatly obliged for the fidelity with which they observed their trust until the derangement of the affairs of my publishers Messrs Constable and company and the exposure of their account books which was the necessary consequence rendered secrecy no longer possible The particulars attending the avowal have been laid before the public in the Introduction to the Chronicles of the Canongate The preliminary advertisement has given a sketch of the purpose of this edition I have some reason to fear that the notes which accompany the tales as now published may be thought too miscellaneous and too egotistical It maybe some apology for this that the publication was intended to be posthumous and still more that old men may be permitted to speak long because they cannot in the course of nature have long time to speak In preparing the present edition I have done all that I can do to explain the nature of my materials and the use I have made of them nor is it probable that I shall again revise or even read these tales I was therefore desirous rather to exceed in the portion of new and explanatory matter which is added to this edition than that the reader should have reason to complain that the information communicated was of a general and merely nominal character It remains to be tried whether the public like a child to whom a watch is shown will after having been satiated with looking at the outside acquire some new interest in the object when it is opened and the internal machinery displayed to them That Waverly and its successors have had their day of favour and popularity must be admitted with sincere gratitude and the Author has studied with the prudence of a beauty whose reign has been rather long to supply by the assistance of art the charms which novelty no longer affords The publishers have endeavoured to gratify the honourable partiality of the public for the encouragement of British art by illustrating this edition with designs by the most eminent living artists Footnote The illustrations here referred to were made for the edition of eighteen twenty nine To my distinguished countryman David Wilkie to Edwin Landseer who has exercised his talents so much on Scottish subjects and scenery to Messrs Leslie and Newton my thanks are due from a friend as well as an author Nor am I less obliged to Messrs Cooper Kidd and other artists of distinction to whom I am less personally known for the ready zeal with which they have devoted their talents to the same purpose Farther explanation respecting the Edition is the business of the publishers not of the Author and here therefore the latter has accomplished his task of introduction and explanation If like a spoiled child he has sometimes abused or trifled with the indulgence of the public he feels himself entitled to full belief when he exculpates himself from the charge of having been at any time insensible of their kindness ABBOTSFORD first January eighteen twenty nine WAVERLEY OR T IS SIXTY YEARS SINCE Under which King Bezonian speak or die Henry IV Part II INTRODUCTION The plan of this edition leads me to insert in this place some account of the incidents on which the Novel of Waverley is founded They have been already given to the public by my late lamented friend William Erskine esquire afterwards Lord Kinneder 
4710-24606-0000	train-other-500	when reviewing the Tales of My Landlord for the Quarterly Review in eighteen seventeen The particulars were derived by the critic from the Author s information
none	none	 Afterwards they were published in the Preface to the Chronicles of the Canongate 
4710-24606-0001	train-other-500	They are now inserted in their proper place The mutual protection afforded by Waverley and Talbot to each other upon which the whole plot depends is founded upon one of those anecdotes which soften the features even of civil war
4710-24606-0002	train-other-500	and as it is equally honourable to the memory of both parties we have no hesitation to give their names at length When the Highlanders on the morning of the battle of Preston seventeen forty five made their memorable attack on Sir John Cope s army
4710-24606-0003	train-other-500	a battery of four field pieces was stormed and carried by the Camerons and the Stewarts of Appine The late Alexander Stewart of Invernahylewas
none	none	 one of the foremost in the charge and observing an officer of the King s forces who scorning to join the flight of all around remained with his sword in his hand as if determined to the very last to defend the post assigned to him the Highland gentleman commanded him to surrender and received for reply a thrust which he caught in his target The officer was now defenceless and the battle axe of a gigantic Highlander 
4710-24606-0004	train-other-500	the miller of Invernahyle s mill was uplifted to dash his brains out when mister Stewart with difficulty prevailed on him to yield He took charge of his enemy s property protected his person and finally obtained him liberty on his parole
4710-24606-0005	train-other-500	The officer proved to be Colonel Whitefoord an Ayrshire gentleman of high character and influence
none	none	 and warmly attached to the House of Hanover 
4710-24606-0006	train-other-500	yet such was the confidence existing between these two honourable men though of different political principles that while the civil war was raging and straggling officers from the Highland army were executed without mercy Invernahyle hesitated
4710-24606-0007	train-other-500	not to pay his late captive a visit as he returned to the Highlands to raise fresh recruits on which occasion he spent a day or two in Ayrshire among Colonel Whitefoord s Whig friends as pleasantly and as good humouredly as if all had been at peace around him
none	none	 After the battle of Culloden had ruined the hopes of Charles Edward and dispersed his proscribed adherents it was Colonel Whitefoord s turn to strain every nerve to obtain mister Stewart s pardon He went to the Lord Justice Clerk 
4710-24606-0008	train-other-500	to the Lord Advocate and to all the officers of state and each application was answered by the production of a list in which Invernahyle
none	none	 as the good old gentleman was wont to express it 
4710-24606-0009	train-other-500	appeared marked with the sign of the beast as a subject unfit for favour or pardon At length Colonel Whitefoord applied to the Duke of Cumberland in person From him also he received a positive refusal
4710-24606-0010	train-other-500	He then limited his request for the present to a protection for Stewart s house wife children and property This was also refused by the Duke on which Colonel Whitefoord taking his commission from his bosom
4710-24606-0011	train-other-500	laid it on the table before his Royal Highness with much emotion and asked permission to retire from the service of a sovereign who did not know how to spare a vanquished enemy The Duke was struck and even affected He bade the Colonel take up his commission
4710-24606-0012	train-other-500	and granted the protection he required It was issued just in time to save the house corn and cattle at Invernahyle from the troops who were engaged in laying waste what it was the fashion to call the country of the enemy
4710-24606-0013	train-other-500	A small encampment of soldiers was formed on Invernahyle s property which they spared while plundering the country around and searching in every direction for the leaders of the insurrection and for Stewart in particular
none	none	 He was much nearer them than they suspected for hidden in a cave like the Baron of Bradwardine he lay for many days so near the English sentinels that he could hear their muster roll called His food was brought to him by one of his daughters a child of eight years old whom missus Stewart was under the necessity of entrusting with this commission for her own motions and those of all her elder inmates 
4710-24606-0014	train-other-500	were closely watched With ingenuity beyond her years the child used to stray about among the soldiers
none	none	 who were rather kind to her 
4710-24606-0015	train-other-500	and thus seize the moment when she was unobserved and steal into the thicket when she deposited whatever small store of provisions she had in charge at some marked spot where her father might find it Invernahyle supported life for several weeks by means of these
none	none	 precarious supplies and as he had been wounded in the battle of Culloden the hardships which he endured were aggravated by great bodily pain After the soldiers had removed their quarters he had another remarkable escape As he now ventured to his own house at night and left it in the morning he was espied during the dawn 
4710-24606-0016	train-other-500	by a party of the enemy who fired at and pursued him The fugitive being fortunate enough to escape their search they returned to the house and charged the family with harbouring one of the proscribed traitors
4710-24606-0017	train-other-500	An old woman had presence of mind enough to maintain that the man they had seen was the shepherd Why did he not stop when we called to him said the soldier He is as deaf poor man
4710-24606-0018	train-other-500	as a peat stack answered the ready witted domestic Let him be sent for directly The real shepherd accordingly was brought from the hill and as there was time to tutor him by the way
none	none	 he was as deaf when he made his appearance as was necessary to sustain his character 
4710-24606-0019	train-other-500	Invernahyle was afterwards pardoned under the Act of Indemnity The Author knew him well and has often heard these circumstances from his own mouth He was a noble specimen of the old Highlander far descended gallant
none	none	 courteous and brave even to chivalry He had been out I believe in seventeen fifteen and seventeen forty five was an active partaker in all the stirring scenes which passed in the Highlands betwixt these memorable eras and I have heard was remarkable among other exploits for having fought a duel with the broadsword with the celebrated Rob Roy MacGregor 
4710-24606-0021	train-other-500	at the clachan of Balquidder Invernahyle chanced to be in Edinburgh when Paul Jones came into the Firth of Forth and though then an old man I saw him in arms and heard him exult to use his own words
4710-24606-0022	train-other-500	in the prospect of drawing his claymore once more before he died In fact on that memorable occasion when the capital of Scotland was menaced by three trifling sloops or brigs
none	none	 scarce fit to have sacked a fishing village 
4710-24606-0023	train-other-500	he was the only man who seemed to propose a plan of resistance He offered to the magistrates if broadswords and dirks could be obtained to find as many Highlanders among the lower classes as would cut off any boat s crew
none	none	 who might be sent into a town full of narrow and winding passages in which they were like to disperse 
4710-24606-0024	train-other-500	in quest of plunder I know not if his plan was attended to I rather think it seemed too hazardous to the constituted authorities who might not even at that time desire to see arms in Highland hands
4710-24606-0025	train-other-500	A steady and powerful west wind settled the matter by sweeping Paul Jones and his vessels out of the Firth If there is something degrading in this recollection it is not unpleasant
none	none	 to compare it with those of the last war when Edinburgh 
4710-24606-0026	train-other-500	besides regular forces and militia furnished a volunteer brigade of cavalry infantry and artillery to the amount of six thousand men and upwards which was in readiness to meet and repel a force of a far more formidable description
none	none	 than was commanded by the adventurous American Time and circumstances change the character of nations and the fate of cities and it is some pride to a Scotchman to reflect that the independent 
4710-24606-0027	train-other-500	and manly character of a country willing to entrust its own protection to the arms of its children after having been obscured for half a century has during the course of his own lifetime recovered its lustre
4710-24606-0028	train-other-500	Other illustrations of Waverley will be found in the Notes at the foot of the pages to which they belong
none	none	 Those which appeared too long to be so placed are given at the end of the chapters to which they severally relate Footnote In this edition at the end of the several volumes PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION To this slight attempt at a sketch of ancient Scottish manners the public have been more favourable than the Author durst have hoped or expected He has heard with a mixture of satisfaction and humility his work ascribed to more than one respectable name Considerations which seem weighty in his particular situation prevent his releasing those gentlemen from suspicion by placing his own name in the title page so that for the present at least 
4710-24607-0000	train-other-500	it must remain uncertain whether Waverley be the work of a poet or a critic a lawyer or a clergyman or whether the writer to use missus Malaprop s phrase be
none	none	 like Cerberus three gentlemen at once The Author as he is unconscious of anything in the work itself except perhaps its frivolity which prevents its finding an acknowledged father leaves it to the candour of the public to choose among the many circumstances peculiar to different situations in life such as may induce him to suppress his name on the present occasion He may be a writer new to publication and unwilling to avow a character to which he is unaccustomed or he may be a hackneyed author who is ashamed of too frequent appearance and employs this mystery as the heroine of the old comedy used her mask to attract the attention of those to whom her face had become too familiar He may be a man of a grave profession 
4710-24607-0001	train-other-500	to whom the reputation of being a novel writer might be prejudicial or he may be a man of fashion to whom writing of any kind might appear pedantic He may be too young to assume the character of an author or so old as to make it advisable to lay it aside
none	none	 The Author of Waverley has heard it objected to this novel that in the character of Callum Beg and in the account given by the Baron of Bradwardine of the petty trespasses of the Highlanders upon trifling articles of property he has borne hard and unjustly so 
4710-24607-0002	train-other-500	upon their national character Nothing could be farther from his wish or intention The character of Callum Beg is that of a spirit naturally turned to daring evil and determined by the circumstances of his situation to a particular species of mischief
none	none	 Those who have perused the curious Letters from the Highlands 
4710-24607-0003	train-other-500	published about seventeen twenty six will find instances of such atrocious characters which fell under the writer s own observation
none	none	 though it would be most unjust to consider such villains as representatives of the Highlanders of that period any more than the murderers of Marr and Williamson 
4710-24607-0004	train-other-500	can be supposed to represent the English of the present day
none	none	 As for the plunder supposed to have been picked up by some of the insurgents in seventeen forty five it must be remembered that although the way of that unfortunate little army was neither marked by devastation nor bloodshed but on the contrary was orderly and quiet in a most wonderful degree yet no army marches through a country in a hostile manner without committing some depredations 
4710-24607-0005	train-other-500	and several to the extent and of the nature jocularly imputed to them by the Baron were really laid to the charge of the Highland insurgents for which many traditions and particularly one respecting the Knight of the Mirror may be quoted as good evidence
4710-24607-0006	train-other-500	Footnote A homely metrical narrative of the events of the period which contains some striking particulars and is still a great favourite with the lower classes gives a very correct statement
4710-24607-0007	train-other-500	of the behaviour of the mountaineers respecting this same military license and as the verses are little known and contain some good sense we venture to insert them
4710-24607-0008	train-other-500	THE AUTHOR S ADDRESS TO ALL IN GENERAL Now gentle readers I have let you ken My very thoughts from heart and pen Tis needless for to conten Or yet controule For there s not a word

To live in peace For many I see for being o er crouse Gets broken face WAVERLEY OR TIS SIXTY YEARS SINCE CHAPTER I INTRODUCTORY The title of this work has not been chosen without the grave and solid deliberation which matters of importance demand from the prudent Even its first or general denomination was the result of no common research or selection although according to the example of my predecessors I had only to seize upon the most sounding and euphonic surname that English history or topography affords and elect it at once as the title of my work and the name of my hero But alas what could my readers have expected from the chivalrous epithets of Howard Mordaunt Mortimer or Stanley or from the softer and more sentimental sounds of Belmour Belville Belfield and Belgrave but pages of inanity similar to those which have been so christened for half a century past I must modestly admit I am too diffident of my own merit to place it in unnecessary opposition to preconceived associations I have therefore like a maiden knight with his white shield assumed for my hero WAVERLEY an uncontaminated name bearing with its sound little of good or evil excepting what the reader shall hereafter be pleased to affix to it But my second or supplemental title was a matter of much more difficult election since that short as it is may be held as pledging the author to some special mode of laying his scene drawing his characters and managing his adventures Had I for example announced in my frontispiece Waverley a Tale of other Days must not every novel reader have anticipated a castle scarce less than that of Udolpho of which the eastern wing had long been uninhabited and the keys either lost or consigned to the care of some aged butler or housekeeper whose trembling steps about the middle of the second volume were doomed to guide the hero or heroine to the ruinous precincts Would not the owl have shrieked and the cricket cried in my very title page and could it have been possible for me with a moderate attention to decorum to introduce any scene more lively than might be produced by the jocularity of a clownish but faithful valet or the garrulous narrative of the heroine s fille de chambre when rehearsing the stories of blood and horror which she had heard in the servants hall Again had my title borne Waverley a Romance from the German what head so obtuse as not to image forth a profligate abbot an oppressive duke a secret and mysterious association of Rosycrucians and Illuminati with all their properties of black cowls caverns daggers electrical machines trap doors and dark lanterns Or if I had rather chosen to call my work a Sentimental Tale would it not have been a sufficient presage of a heroine with a profusion of auburn hair and a harp the soft solace of her solitary hours which she fortunately finds always the means of transporting from castle to cottage although she herself be sometimes obliged to jump out of a two pair of stairs window and is more than once bewildered on her journey alone and on foot without any guide but a blowzy peasant girl whose jargon she hardly can understand Or again if my Waverley had been entitled A Tale of the Times wouldst thou not gentle reader have demanded from me a dashing sketch of the fashionable world a few anecdotes of private scandal thinly veiled and if lusciously painted so much the better a heroine from Grosvenor Square and a hero from the Barouche Club or the Four in Hand with a set of subordinate characters from the elegantes of Queen Anne Street East or the dashing heroes of the Bow Street Office I could proceed in proving the importance of a title page and displaying at the same time my own intimate knowledge of the particular ingredients necessary to the composition of romances and novels of various descriptions but it is enough and I scorn to tyrannise longer over the impatience of my reader who is doubtless already anxious to know the choice made by an author so profoundly versed in the different branches of his art By fixing then the date of my story Sixty Years before this present first November eighteen oh five I would have my readers understand that they will meet in the following pages neither a romance of chivalry nor a tale of modern manners that my hero will neither have iron on his shoulders as of yore nor on the heels of his boots as is the present fashion of Bond Street and that my damsels will neither be clothed in purple and in pall like the Lady Alice of an old ballad nor reduced to the primitive nakedness of a modern fashionable at a rout From this my choice of an era the understanding critic may farther presage that the object of my tale is more a description of men than manners A tale of manners to be interesting must either refer to antiquity so great as to have become venerable or it must bear a vivid reflection of those scenes which are passing daily before our eyes and are interesting from their novelty Thus the coat of mail of our ancestors and the triple furred pelisse of our modern beaux may though for very different reasons be equally fit for the array of a fictitious character but who meaning the costume of his hero to be impressive would willingly attire him in the court dress of George the Second s reign with its no collar large sleeves and low pocket holes The same may be urged with equal truth of the Gothic hall which with its darkened and tinted windows its elevated and gloomy roof and massive oaken table garnished with boar s head and rosemary pheasants and peacocks cranes and cygnets has an excellent effect in fictitious description Much may also be gained by a lively display of a modern fete such as we have daily recorded in that part of a newspaper entitled the Mirror of Fashion if we contrast these or either of them with the splendid formality of an entertainment given Sixty Years Since and thus it will be readily seen how much the painter of antique or of fashionable manners gains over him who delineates those of the last generation Considering the disadvantages inseparable from this part of my subject I must be understood to have resolved to avoid them as much as possible by throwing the force of my narrative upon the characters and passions of the actors those passions common to men in all stages of society and which have alike agitated the human heart whether it throbbed under the steel corslet of the fifteenth century the brocaded coat of the eighteenth or the blue frock and white dimity waistcoat of the present day Footnote Alas that attire respectable and gentlemanlike in eighteen oh five or thereabouts is now as antiquated as the Author of Waverley has himself become since that period The reader of fashion will please to fill up the costume with an embroidered waistcoat of purple velvet or silk and a coat of whatever colour he pleases Upon these passions it is no doubt true that the state of manners and laws casts a necessary colouring but the bearings to use the language of heraldry remain the same though the tincture may be not only different but opposed in strong contradistinction The wrath of our ancestors for example was coloured gules it broke forth in acts of open and sanguinary violence against the objects of its fury Our malignant feelings which must seek gratification through more indirect channels and undermine the obstacles which they cannot openly bear down may be rather said to be tinctured sable But the deep ruling impulse is the same in both cases and the proud peer who can now only ruin his neighbour according to law by protracted suits is the genuine descendant of the baron who wrapped the castle of his competitor in flames and knocked him on the head as he endeavoured to escape from the conflagration It is from the great book of Nature the same through a thousand editions whether of black letter or wire wove and hot pressed that I have venturously essayed to read a chapter to the public Some favourable opportunities of contrast have been afforded me by the state of society in the northern part of the island at the period of my history and may serve at once to vary and to illustrate the moral lessons which I would willingly consider as the most important part of my plan although I am sensible how short these will fall of their aim if I shall be found unable to mix them with amusement a task not quite so easy in this critical generation as it was Sixty Years Since CHAPTER II WAVERLEY HONOUR A RETROSPECT It is then sixty years since Edward Waverley the hero of the following pages took leave of his family to join the regiment of dragoons in which he had lately obtained a commission It was a melancholy day at Waverley Honour when the young officer parted with Sir Everard the affectionate old uncle to whose title and estate he was presumptive heir A difference in political opinions had early separated the Baronet from his younger brother Richard Waverley the father of our hero Sir Everard had inherited from his sires the whole train of Tory or High Church predilections and prejudices which had distinguished the house of Waverley since the Great Civil War Richard on the contrary who was ten years younger beheld himself born to the fortune of a second brother and anticipated neither dignity nor entertainment in sustaining the character of Will Wimble He saw early that to succeed in the race of life it was necessary he should carry as little weight as possible Painters talk of the difficulty of expressing the existence of compound passions in the same features at the same moment it would be no less difficult for the moralist to analyse the mixed motives which unite to form the impulse of our actions Richard Waverley read and satisfied himself from history and sound argument that in the words of the old song Passive obedience was a jest And pshaw was non resistance yet reason would have probably been unable to combat and remove hereditary prejudice could Richard have anticipated that his elder brother Sir Everard taking to heart an early disappointment would have remained a bachelor at seventy two The prospect of succession however remote might in that case have led him to endure dragging through the greater part of his life as Master Richard at the Hall the Baronet s brother in the hope that ere its conclusion he should be distinguished as Sir Richard Waverley of Waverley Honour successor to a princely estate and to extended political connections as head of the county interest in the shire where it lay But this was a consummation of things not to be expected at Richard s outset when Sir Everard was in the prime of life and certain to be an acceptable suitor in almost any family whether wealth or beauty should be the object of his pursuit and when indeed his speedy marriage was a report which regularly amused the neighbourhood once a year His younger brother saw no practicable road to independence save that of relying upon his own exertions and adopting a political creed more consonant both to reason and his own interest than the hereditary faith of Sir Everard in High Church and in the house of Stuart He therefore read his recantation at the beginning of his career and entered life as an avowed Whig and friend of the Hanover succession The ministry of George the First s time were prudently anxious to diminish the phalanx of opposition The Tory nobility depending for their reflected lustre upon the sunshine of a court had for some time been gradually reconciling themselves to the new dynasty But the wealthy country gentlemen of England a rank which retained with much of ancient manners and primitive integrity a great proportion of obstinate and unyielding prejudice stood aloof in haughty and sullen opposition and cast many a look of mingled regret and hope to Bois le Due Avignon and Italy Footnote Where the Chevalier saint George or as he was termed the Old Pretender held his exiled court as his situation compelled him to shift his place of residence The accession of the near relation of one of those steady and inflexible opponents was considered as a means of bringing over more converts and therefore Richard Waverley met with a share of ministerial favour more than proportioned to his talents or his political importance It was however discovered that he had respectable talents for public business and the first admittance to the minister s levee being negotiated his success became rapid Sir Everard learned from the public News Letter first that Richard Waverley Esquire was returned for the ministerial borough of Barterfaith next that Richard Waverley Esquire had taken a distinguished part in the debate upon the Excise Bill in the support of government and lastly that Richard Waverley Esquire had been honoured with a seat at one of those boards where the pleasure of serving the country is combined with other important gratifications which to render them the more acceptable occur regularly once a quarter Although these events followed each other so closely that the sagacity of the editor of a modern newspaper would have presaged the two last even while he announced the first yet they came upon Sir Everard gradually and drop by drop as it were distilled through the cool and procrastinating alembic of Dyer s Weekly Letter Footnote See Note I For it may be observed in passing that instead of those mail coaches by means of which every mechanic at his six penny club may nightly learn from twenty contradictory channels the yesterday s news of the capital a weekly post brought in those days to Waverley Honour a Weekly Intelligencer which after it had gratified Sir Everard s curiosity his sister s and that of his aged butler was regularly transferred from the Hall to the Rectory from the Rectory to Squire Stubbs s at the Grange from the Squire to the Baronet s steward at his neat white house on the heath from the steward to the bailiff and from him through a huge circle of honest dames and gaffers by whose hard and horny hands it was generally worn to pieces in about a month after its arrival This slow succession of intelligence was of some advantage to Richard Waverley in the case before us for had the sum total of his enormities reached the ears of Sir Everard at once there can be no doubt that the new commissioner would have had little reason to pique himself on the success of his politics The Baronet although the mildest of human beings was not without sensitive points in his character his brother s conduct had wounded these deeply the Waverley estate was fettered by no entail for it had never entered into the head of any of its former possessors that one of their progeny could be guilty of the atrocities laid by Dyer s Letter to the door of Richard and if it had the marriage of the proprietor might have been fatal to a collateral heir These various ideas floated through the brain of Sir Everard without however producing any determined conclusion He examined the tree of his genealogy which emblazoned with many an emblematic mark of honour and heroic achievement hung upon the well varnished wainscot of his hall The nearest descendants of Sir Hildebrand Waverley failing those of his eldest son Wilfred of whom Sir Everard and his brother were the only representatives were as this honoured register informed him and indeed as he himself well knew the Waverleys of Highley Park com Hants with whom the main branch or rather stock of the house had renounced all connection since the great law suit in sixteen seventy This degenerate scion had committed a farther offence against the head and source of their gentility by the intermarriage of their representative with Judith heiress of Oliver Bradshawe of Highley Park whose arms the same with those of Bradshawe the regicide they had quartered with the ancient coat of Waverley These offences however had vanished from Sir Everard s recollection in the heat of his resentment and had Lawyer Clippurse for whom his groom was despatched express arrived but an hour earlier he might have had the benefit of drawing a new settlement of the lordship and manor of Waverley Honour with all its dependencies But an hour of cool reflection is a great matter when employed in weighing the comparative evil of two measures to neither of which we are internally partial Lawyer Clippurse found his patron involved in a deep study which he was too respectful to disturb otherwise than by producing his paper and leathern ink case as prepared to minute his honour s commands Even this slight manoeuvre was embarrassing to Sir Everard who felt it as a reproach to his indecision He looked at the attorney with some desire to issue his fiat when the sun emerging from behind a cloud poured at once its chequered light through the stained window of the gloomy cabinet in which they were seated The Baronet s eye as he raised it to the splendour fell right upon the central scutcheon inpressed with the same device which his ancestor was said to have borne in the field of Hastings three ermines passant argent in a field azure with its appropriate motto Sans tache May our name rather perish exclaimed Sir Everard than that ancient and loyal symbol should be blended with the dishonoured insignia of a traitorous Roundhead All this was the effect of the glimpse of a sunbeam just sufficient to light Lawyer Clippurse to mend his pen The pen was mended in vain The attorney was dismissed with directions to hold himself in readiness on the first summons The apparition of Lawyer Clippurse at the Hall occasioned much speculation in that portion of the world to which Waverley Honour formed the centre But the more judicious politicians of this microcosm augured yet worse consequences to Richard Waverley from a movement which shortly followed his apostasy This was no less than an excursion of the Baronet in his coach and six with four attendants in rich liveries to make a visit of some duration to a noble peer on the confines of the shire of untainted descent steady Tory principles and the happy father of six unmarried and accomplished daughters Sir Everard s reception in this family was as it may be easily conceived sufficiently favourable but of the six young ladies his taste unfortunately determined him in favour of Lady Emily the youngest who received his attentions with an embarrassment which showed at once that she durst not decline them and that they afforded her anything but pleasure Sir Everard could not but perceive something uncommon in the restrained emotions which the young lady testified at the advances he hazarded but assured by the prudent Countess that they were the natural effects of a retired education the sacrifice might have been completed as doubtless has happened in many similar instances had it not been for the courage of an elder sister who revealed to the wealthy suitor that Lady Emily s affections were fixed upon a young soldier of fortune a near relation of her own Sir Everard manifested great emotion on receiving this intelligence which was confirmed to him in a private interview by the young lady herself although under the most dreadful apprehensions of her father s indignation Honour and generosity were hereditary attributes of the house of Waverley With a grace and delicacy worthy the hero of a romance Sir Everard withdrew his claim to the hand of Lady Emily He had even before leaving Blandeville Castle the address to extort from her father a consent to her union with the object of her choice What arguments he used on this point cannot exactly be known for Sir Everard was never supposed strong in the powers of persuasion but the young officer immediately after this transaction rose in the army with a rapidity far surpassing the usual pace of unpatronised professional merit although to outward appearance that was all he had to depend upon The shock which Sir Everard encountered upon this occasion although diminished by the consciousness of having acted virtuously and generously had its effect upon his future life His resolution of marriage had been adopted in a fit of indignation the labour of courtship did not quite suit the dignified indolence of his habits he had but just escaped the risk of marrying a woman who could never love him and his pride could not be greatly flattered by the termination of his amour even if his heart had not suffered The result of the whole matter was his return to Waverley Honour without any transfer of his affections notwithstanding the sighs and languishments of the fair tell tale who had revealed in mere sisterly affection the secret of Lady Emily s attachment and in despite of the nods winks and innuendos of the officious lady mother and the grave eulogiums which the Earl pronounced successively on the prudence and good sense and admirable dispositions of his first second third fourth and fifth daughters The memory of his unsuccessful amour was with Sir Everard as with many more of his temper at once shy proud sensitive and indolent a beacon against exposing himself to similar mortification pain and fruitless exertion for the time to come He continued to live at Waverley Honour in the style of an old English gentleman of an ancient descent and opulent fortune His sister Miss Rachel Waverley presided at his table and they became by degrees an old bachelor and an ancient maiden lady the gentlest and kindest of the votaries of celibacy The vehemence of Sir Everard s resentment against his brother was but short lived yet his dislike to the Whig and the placeman though unable to stimulate him to resume any active measures prejudicial to Richard s interest in the succession to the family estate continued to maintain the coldness between them Richard knew enough of the world and of his brother s temper to believe that by any ill considered or precipitate advances on his part he might turn passive dislike into a more active principle It was accident therefore which at length occasioned a renewal of their intercourse Richard had married a young woman of rank by whose family interest and private fortune he hoped to advance his career In her right he became possessor of a manor of some value at the distance of a few miles from Waverley Honour Little Edward the hero of our tale then in his fifth year was their only child It chanced that the infant with his maid had strayed one morning to a mile s distance from the avenue of Brerewood Lodge his father s seat Their attention was attracted by a carriage drawn by six stately long tailed black horses and with as much carving and gilding as would have done honour to my lord mayor s It was waiting for the owner who was at a little distance inspecting the progress of a half built farm house I know not whether the boy s nurse had been a Welsh or a Scotch woman or in what manner he associated a shield emblazoned with three ermines with the idea of personal property but he no sooner beheld this family emblem than he stoutly determined on vindicating his right to the splendid vehicle on which it was displayed The Baronet arrived while the boy s maid was in vain endeavouring to make him desist from his determination to appropriate the gilded coach and six The rencontre was at a happy moment for Edward as his uncle had been just eyeing wistfully with something of a feeling like envy the chubby boys of the stout yeoman whose mansion was building by his direction In the round faced rosy cherub before him bearing his eye and his name and vindicating a hereditary title to his family affection and patronage by means of a tie which Sir Everard held as sacred as either Garter or Blue mantle Providence seemed to have granted to him the very object best calculated to fill up the void in his hopes and affections Sir Everard returned to Waverley Hall upon a led horse which was kept in readiness for him while the child and his attendant were sent home in the carriage to Brerewood Lodge with such a message as opened to Richard Waverley a door of reconciliation with his elder brother Their intercourse however though thus renewed continued to be rather formal and civil than partaking of brotherly cordiality yet it was sufficient to the wishes of both parties Sir Everard obtained in the frequent society of his little nephew something on which his hereditary pride might found the anticipated pleasure of a continuation of his lineage and where his kind and gentle affections could at the same time fully exercise themselves For Richard Waverley he beheld in the growing attachment between the uncle and nephew the means of securing his son s if not his own succession to the hereditary estate which he felt would be rather endangered than promoted by any attempt on his own part towards a closer intimacy with a man of Sir Everard s habits and opinions Thus by a sort of tacit compromise little Edward was permitted to pass the greater part of the year at the Hall and appeared to stand in the same intimate relation to both families although their mutual intercourse was otherwise limited to formal messages and more formal visits The education of the youth was regulated alternately by the taste and opinions of his uncle and of his father But more of this in a subsequent chapter CHAPTER III EDUCATION The education of our hero Edward Waverley was of a nature somewhat desultory In infancy his health suffered or was supposed to suffer which is quite the same thing by the air of London As soon therefore as official duties attendance on Parliament or the prosecution of any of his plans of interest or ambition called his father to town which was his usual residence for eight months in the year Edward was transferred to Waverley Honour and experienced a total change of instructors and of lessons as well as of residence This might have been remedied had his father placed him under the superintendence of a permanent tutor But he considered that one of his choosing would probably have been unacceptable at Waverley Honour and that such a selection as Sir Everard might have made were the matter left to him would have burdened him with a disagreeable inmate if not a political spy in his family He therefore prevailed upon his private secretary a young man of taste and accomplishments to bestow an hour or two on Edward s education while at Brerewood Lodge and left his uncle answerable for his improvement in literature while an inmate at the Hall This was in some degree respectably provided for Sir Everard s chaplain an Oxonian who had lost his fellowship for declining to take the oaths at the accession of George I was not only an excellent classical scholar but reasonably skilled in science and master of most modern languages He was however old and indulgent and the recurring interregnum during which Edward was entirely freed from his discipline occasioned such a relaxation of authority that the youth was permitted in a great measure to learn as he pleased what he pleased and when he pleased This slackness of rule might have been ruinous to a boy of slow understanding who feeling labour in the acquisition of knowledge would have altogether neglected it save for the command of a taskmaster and it might have proved equally dangerous to a youth whose animal spirits were more powerful than his imagination or his feelings and whom the irresistible influence of Alma would have engaged in field sports from morning till night But the character of Edward Waverley was remote from either of these His powers of apprehension were so uncommonly quick as almost to resemble intuition and the chief care of his preceptor was to prevent him as a sportsman would phrase it from over running his game that is from acquiring his knowledge in a slight flimsy and inadequate manner And here the instructor had to combat another propensity too often united with brilliancy of fancy and vivacity of talent that indolence namely of disposition which can only be stirred by some strong motive of gratification and which renounces study as soon as curiosity is gratified the pleasure of conquering the first difficulties exhausted and the novelty of pursuit at an end Edward would throw himself with spirit upon any classical author of which his preceptor proposed the perusal make himself master of the style so far as to understand the story and if that pleased or interested him he finished the volume But it was in vain to attempt fixing his attention on critical distinctions of philology upon the difference of idiom the beauty of felicitous expression or the artificial combinations of syntax I can read and understand a Latin author said young Edward with the self confidence and rash reasoning of fifteen and Scaliger or Bentley could not do much more Alas while he was thus permitted to read only for the gratification of his amusement he foresaw not that he was losing for ever the opportunity of acquiring habits of firm and assiduous application of gaining the art of controlling directing and concentrating the powers of his mind for earnest investigation an art far more essential than even that intimate acquaintance with classical learning which is the primary object of study I am aware I may be here reminded of the necessity of rendering instruction agreeable to youth and of Tasso s infusion of honey into the medicine prepared for a child but an age in which children are taught the driest doctrines by the insinuating method of instructive games has little reason to dread the consequences of study being rendered too serious or severe The history of England is now reduced to a game at cards the problems of mathematics to puzzles and riddles and the doctrines of arithmetic may we are assured be sufficiently acquired by spending a few hours a week at a new and complicated edition of the Royal Game of the Goose There wants but one step further and the Creed and Ten Commandments may be taught in the same manner without the necessity of the grave face deliberate tone of recital and devout attention hitherto exacted from the well governed childhood of this realm It may in the meantime be subject of serious consideration whether those who are accustomed only to acquire instruction through the medium of amusement may not be brought to reject that which approaches under the aspect of study whether those who learn history by the cards may not be led to prefer the means to the end and whether were we to teach religion in the way of sport our pupils may not thereby be gradually induced to make sport of their religion To our young hero who was permitted to seek his instruction only according to the bent of his own mind and who of consequence only sought it so long as it afforded him amusement the indulgence of his tutors was attended with evil consequences which long continued to influence his character happiness and utility Edward s power of imagination and love of literature although the former was vivid and the latter ardent were so far from affording a remedy to this peculiar evil that they rather inflamed and increased its violence The library at Waverley Honour a large Gothic room with double arches and a gallery contained such a miscellaneous and extensive collection of volumes as had been assembled together during the course of two hundred years by a family which had been always wealthy and inclined of course as a mark of splendour to furnish their shelves with the current literature of the day without much scrutiny or nicety of discrimination Throughout this ample realm Edward was permitted to roam at large His tutor had his own studies and church politics and controversial divinity together with a love of learned ease though they did not withdraw his attention at stated times from the progress of his patron s presumptive heir induced him readily to grasp at any apology for not extending a strict and regulated survey towards his general studies Sir Everard had never been himself a student and like his sister Miss Rachel Waverley he held the common doctrine that idleness is incompatible with reading of any kind and that the mere tracing the alphabetical characters with the eye is in itself a useful and meritorious task without scrupulously considering what ideas or doctrines they may happen to convey With a desire of amusement therefore which better discipline might soon have converted into a thirst for knowledge young Waverley drove through the sea of books like a vessel without a pilot or a rudder Nothing perhaps increases by indulgence more than a desultory habit of reading especially under such opportunities of gratifying it I believe one reason why such numerous instances of erudition occur among the lower ranks is that with the same powers of mind the poor student is limited to a narrow circle for indulging his passion for books and must necessarily make himself master of the few he possesses ere he can acquire more Edward on the contrary like the epicure who only deigned to take a single morsel from the sunny side of a peach read no volume a moment after it ceased to excite his curiosity or interest and it necessarily happened that the habit of seeking only this sort of gratification rendered it daily more difficult of attainment till the passion for reading like other strong appetites produced by indulgence a sort of satiety Ere he attained this indifference however he had read and stored in a memory of uncommon tenacity much curious though ill arranged and miscellaneous information In English literature he was master of Shakespeare and Milton of our earlier dramatic authors of many picturesque and interesting passages from our old historical chronicles and was particularly well acquainted with Spenser Drayton and other poets who have exercised themselves on romantic fiction of all themes the most fascinating to a youthful imagination before the passions have roused themselves and demand poetry of a more sentimental description In this respect his acquaintance with Italian opened him yet a wider range He had perused the numerous romantic poems which from the days of Pulci have been a favourite exercise of the wits of Italy and had sought gratification in the numerous collections of novelle which were brought forth by the genius of that elegant though luxurious nation in emulation of the Decameron In classical literature Waverley had made the usual progress and read the usual authors and the French had afforded him an almost exhaustless collection of memoirs scarcely more faithful than romances and of romances so well written as hardly to be distinguished from memoirs The splendid pages of Froissart with his heart stirring and eye dazzling descriptions of war and of tournaments were among his chief favourites and from those of Brantome and De la Noue he learned to compare the wild and loose yet superstitious character of the nobles of the League with the stern rigid and sometimes turbulent disposition of the Huguenot party The Spanish had contributed to his stock of chivalrous and romantic lore The earlier literature of the northern nations did not escape the study of one who read rather to awaken the imagination than to benefit the understanding And yet knowing much that is known but to few Edward Waverley might justly be considered as ignorant since he knew little of what adds dignity to man and qualifies him to support and adorn an elevated situation in society The occasional attention of his parents might indeed have been of service to prevent the dissipation of mind incidental to such a desultory course of reading But his mother died in the seventh year after the reconciliation between the brothers and Richard Waverley himself who after this event resided more constantly in London was too much interested in his own plans of wealth and ambition to notice more respecting Edward than that he was of a very bookish turn and probably destined to be a bishop If he could have discovered and analysed his son s waking dreams he would have formed a very different conclusion CHAPTER IV CASTLE BUILDING I have already hinted that the dainty squeamish and fastidious taste acquired by a surfeit of idle reading had not only rendered our hero unfit for serious and sober study but had even disgusted him in some degree with that in which he had hitherto indulged He was in his sixteenth year when his habits of abstraction and love of solitude became so much marked as to excite Sir Everard s affectionate apprehension He tried to counterbalance these propensities by engaging his nephew in field sports which had been the chief pleasure of his own youthful days But although Edward eagerly carried the gun for one season yet when practice had given him some dexterity the pastime ceased to afford him amusement In the succeeding spring the perusal of old Isaac Walton s fascinating volume determined Edward to become a brother of the angle But of all diversions which ingenuity ever devised for the relief of idleness fishing is the worst qualified to amuse a man who is at once indolent and impatient and our hero s rod was speedily flung aside Society and example which more than any other motives master and sway the natural bent of our passions might have had their usual effect upon the youthful visionary But the neighbourhood was thinly inhabited and the home bred young squires whom it afforded were not of a class fit to form Edward s usual companions far less to excite him to emulation in the practice of those pastimes which composed the serious business of their lives There were a few other youths of better education and a more liberal character but from their society also our hero was in some degree excluded Sir Everard had upon the death of Queen Anne resigned his seat in Parliament and as his age increased and the number of his contemporaries diminished had gradually withdrawn himself from society so that when upon any particular occasion Edward mingled with accomplished and well educated young men of his own rank and expectations he felt an inferiority in their company not so much from deficiency of information as from the want of the skill to command and to arrange that which he possessed A deep and increasing sensibility added to this dislike of society The idea of having committed the slightest solecism in politeness whether real or imaginary was agony to him for perhaps even guilt itself does not impose upon some minds so keen a sense of shame and remorse as a modest sensitive and inexperienced youth feels from the consciousness of having neglected etiquette or excited ridicule Where we are not at ease we cannot be happy and therefore it is not surprising that Edward Waverley supposed that he disliked and was unfitted for society merely because he had not yet acquired the habit of living in it with ease and comfort and of reciprocally giving and receiving pleasure The hours he spent with his uncle and aunt were exhausted in listening to the oft repeated tale of narrative old age Yet even there his imagination the predominant faculty of his mind was frequently excited Family tradition and genealogical history upon which much of Sir Everard s discourse turned is the very reverse of amber which itself a valuable substance usually includes flies straws and other trifles whereas these studies being themselves very insignificant and trifling do nevertheless serve to perpetuate a great deal of what is rare and valuable in ancient manners and to record many curious and minute facts which could have been preserved and conveyed through no other medium If therefore Edward Waverley yawned at times over the dry deduction of his line of ancestors with their various intermarriages and inwardly deprecated the remorseless and protracted accuracy with which the worthy Sir Everard rehearsed the various degrees of propinquity between the house of Waverley Honour and the doughty barons knights and squires to whom they stood allied if notwithstanding his obligations to the three ermines passant he sometimes cursed in his heart the jargon of heraldry its griffins its moldwarps its wyverns and its dragons with all the bitterness of Hotspur himself there were moments when these communications interested his fancy and rewarded his attention The deeds of Wilibert of Waverley in the Holy Land his long absence and perilous adventures his supposed death and his return on the evening when the betrothed of his heart had wedded the hero who had protected her from insult and oppression during his absence the generosity with which the Crusader relinquished his claims and sought in a neighbouring cloister that peace which passeth not away Footnote See Note two to these and similar tales he would hearken till his heart glowed and his eye glistened Nor was he less affected when his aunt missus Rachel narrated the sufferings and fortitude of Lady Alice Waverley during the Great Civil War The benevolent features of the venerable spinster kindled into more majestic expression as she told how Charles had after the field of Worcester found a day s refuge at Waverley Honour and how when a troop of cavalry were approaching to search the mansion Lady Alice dismissed her youngest son with a handful of domestics charging them to make good with their lives an hour s diversion that the king might have that space for escape And God help her would missus Rachel continue fixing her eyes upon the heroine s portrait as she spoke full dearly did she purchase the safety of her prince with the life of her darling child They brought him here a prisoner mortally wounded and you may trace the drops of his blood from the great hall door along the little gallery and up to the saloon where they laid him down to die at his mother s feet But there was comfort exchanged between them for he knew from the glance of his mother s eye that the purpose of his desperate defence was attained Ah I remember she continued I remember well to have seen one that knew and loved him Miss Lucy Saint Aubin lived and died a maid for his sake though one of the most beautiful and wealthy matches in this country all the world ran after her but she wore widow s mourning all her life for poor William for they were betrothed though not married and died in I cannot think of the date but I remember in the November of that very year when she found herself sinking she desired to be brought to Waverley Honour once more and visited all the places where she had been with my grand uncle and caused the carpets to be raised that she might trace the impression of his blood and if tears could have washed it out it had not been there now for there was not a dry eye in the house You would have thought Edward that the very trees mourned for her for their leaves dropt around her without a gust of wind and indeed she looked like one that would never see them green again From such legends our hero would steal away to indulge the fancies they excited In the corner of the large and sombre library with no other light than was afforded by the decaying brands on its ponderous and ample hearth he would exercise for hours that internal sorcery by which past or imaginary events are presented in action as it were to the eye of the muser Then arose in long and fair array the splendour of the bridal feast at Waverley Castle the tall and emaciated form of its real lord as he stood in his pilgrim s weeds an unnoticed spectator of the festivities of his supposed heir and intended bride the electrical shock occasioned by the discovery the springing of the vassals to arms the astonishment of the bridegroom the terror and confusion of the bride the agony with which Wilibert observed that her heart as well as consent was in these nuptials the air of dignity yet of deep feeling with which he flung down the half drawn sword and turned away for ever from the house of his ancestors Then would he change the scene and fancy would at his wish represent Aunt Rachel s tragedy He saw the Lady Waverley seated in her bower her ear strained to every sound her heart throbbing with double agony now listening to the decaying echo of the hoofs of the king s horse and when that had died away hearing in every breeze that shook the trees of the park the noise of the remote skirmish A distant sound is heard like the rushing of a swoln stream it comes nearer and Edward can plainly distinguish the galloping of horses the cries and shouts of men with straggling pistol shots between rolling forwards to the Hall The lady starts up a terrified menial rushes in but why pursue such a description As living in this ideal world became daily more delectable to our hero interruption was disagreeable in proportion The extensive domain that surrounded the Hall which far exceeding the dimensions of a park was usually termed Waverley Chase had originally been forest ground and still though broken by extensive glades in which the young deer were sporting retained its pristine and savage character It was traversed by broad avenues in many places half grown up with brush wood where the beauties of former days used to take their stand to see the stag coursed with greyhounds or to gain an aim at him with the crossbow In one spot distinguished by a moss grown Gothic monument which retained the name of Queen s Standing Elizabeth herself was said to have pierced seven bucks with her own arrows This was a very favourite haunt of Waverley At other times with his gun and his spaniel which served as an apology to others and with a book in his pocket which perhaps served as an apology to himself he used to pursue one of these long avenues which after an ascending sweep of four miles gradually narrowed into a rude and contracted path through the cliffy and woody pass called Mirkwood Dingle and opened suddenly upon a deep dark and small lake named from the same cause Mirkwood Mere There stood in former times a solitary tower upon a rock almost surrounded by the water which had acquired the name of the Strength of Waverley because in perilous times it had often been the refuge of the family There in the wars of York and Lancaster the last adherents of the Red Rose who dared to maintain her cause carried on a harassing and predatory warfare till the stronghold was reduced by the celebrated Richard of Gloucester Here too a party of Cavaliers long maintained themselves under Nigel Waverley elder brother of that William whose fate Aunt Rachel commemorated Through these scenes it was that Edward loved to chew the cud of sweet and bitter fancy and like a child among his toys culled and arranged from the splendid yet useless imagery and emblems with which his imagination was stored visions as brilliant and as fading as those of an evening sky The effect of this indulgence upon his temper and character will appear in the next chapter CHAPTER V CHOICE OF A PROFESSION From the minuteness with which I have traced Waverley s pursuits and the bias which these unavoidably communicated to his imagination the reader may perhaps anticipate in the following tale an imitation of the romance of Cervantes But he will do my prudence injustice in the supposition My intention is not to follow the steps of that inimitable author in describing such total perversion of intellect as misconstrues the objects actually presented to the senses but that more common aberration from sound judgment which apprehends occurrences indeed in their reality but communicates to them a tincture of its own romantic tone and colouring So far was Edward Waverley from expecting general sympathy with his own feelings or concluding that the present state of things was calculated to exhibit the reality of those visions in which he loved to indulge that he dreaded nothing more than the detection of such sentiments as were dictated by his musings He neither had nor wished to have a confidant with whom to communicate his reveries and so sensible was he of the ridicule attached to them that had he been to choose between any punishment short of ignominy and the necessity of giving a cold and composed account of the ideal world in which he lived the better part of his days I think he would not have hesitated to prefer the former infliction This secrecy became doubly precious as he felt in advancing life the influence of the awakening passions Female forms of exquisite grace and beauty began to mingle in his mental adventures nor was he long without looking abroad to compare the creatures of his own imagination with the females of actual life The list of the beauties who displayed their hebdomadal finery at the parish church of Waverley was neither numerous nor select By far the most passable was Miss Sissly or as she rather chose to be called Miss Cecilia Stubbs daughter of Squire Stubbs at the Grange I know not whether it was by the merest accident in the world a phrase which from female lips does not always exclude malice prepense or whether it was from a conformity of taste that Miss Cecilia more than once crossed Edward in his favourite walks through Waverley Chase He had not as yet assumed courage to accost her on these occasions but the meeting was not without its effect A romantic lover is a strange idolater who sometimes cares not out of what log he frames the object of his adoration at least if nature has given that object any passable proportion of personal charms he can easily play the Jeweller and Dervise in the Oriental tale Footnote See Hoppner s tale of The Seven Lovers and supply her richly out of the stores of his own imagination with supernatural beauty and all the properties of intellectual wealth But ere the charms of Miss Cecilia Stubbs had erected her into a positive goddess or elevated her at least to a level with the saint her namesake missus Rachel Waverley gained some intimation which determined her to prevent the approaching apotheosis Even the most simple and unsuspicious of the female sex have God bless them an instinctive sharpness of perception in such matters which sometimes goes the length of observing partialities that never existed but rarely misses to detect such as pass actually under their observation missus Rachel applied herself with great prudence not to combat but to elude the approaching danger and suggested to her brother the necessity that the heir of his house should see something more of the world than was consistent with constant residence at Waverley Honour Sir Everard would not at first listen to a proposal which went to separate his nephew from him Edward was a little bookish he admitted but youth he had always heard was the season for learning and no doubt when his rage for letters was abated and his head fully stocked with knowledge his nephew would take to field sports and country business He had often he said himself regretted that he had not spent some time in study during his youth he would neither have shot nor hunted with less skill and he might have made the roof of Saint Stephen s echo to longer orations than were comprised in those zealous Noes with which when a member of the House during Godolphin s administration he encountered every measure of government Aunt Rachel s anxiety however lent her address to carry her point Every representative of their house had visited foreign parts or served his country in the army before he settled for life at Waverley Honour and she appealed for the truth of her assertion to the genealogical pedigree an authority which Sir Everard was never known to contradict In short a proposal was made to mister Richard Waverley that his son should travel under the direction of his present tutor mister Pembroke with a suitable allowance from the Baronet s liberality The father himself saw no objection to this overture but upon mentioning it casually at the table of the minister the great man looked grave The reason was explained in private The unhappy turn of Sir Everard s politics the minister observed was such as would render it highly improper that a young gentleman of such hopeful prospects should travel on the Continent with a tutor doubtless of his uncle s choosing and directing his course by his instructions What might mister Edward Waverley s society be at Paris what at Rome where all manner of snares were spread by the Pretender and his sons these were points for mister Waverley to consider This he could himself say that he knew his Majesty had such a just sense of mister Richard Waverley s merits that if his son adopted the army for a few years a troop he believed might be reckoned upon in one of the dragoon regiments lately returned from Flanders A hint thus conveyed and enforced was not to be neglected with impunity and Richard Waverley though with great dread of shocking his brother s prejudices deemed he could not avoid accepting the commission thus offered him for his son The truth is he calculated much and justly upon Sir Everard s fondness for Edward which made him unlikely to resent any step that he might take in due submission to parental authority Two letters announced this determination to the Baronet and his nephew The latter barely communicated the fact and pointed out the necessary preparations for joining his regiment To his brother Richard was more diffuse and circuitous He coincided with him in the most flattering manner in the propriety of his son s seeing a little more of the world and was even humble in expressions of gratitude for his proposed assistance was however deeply concerned that it was now unfortunately not in Edward s power exactly to comply with the plan which had been chalked out by his best friend and benefactor He himself had thought with pain on the boy s inactivity at an age when all his ancestors had borne arms even Royalty itself had deigned to inquire whether young Waverley was not now in Flanders at an age when his grandfather was already bleeding for his king in the Great Civil War This was accompanied by an offer of a troop of horse What could he do There was no time to consult his brother s inclinations even if he could have conceived there might be objections on his part to his nephew s following the glorious career of his predecessors And in short that Edward was now the intermediate steps of cornet and lieutenant being overleapt with great agility Captain Waverley of Gardiner s regiment of dragoons which he must join in their quarters at Dundee in Scotland in the course of a month Sir Everard Waverley received this intimation with a mixture of feelings At the period of the Hanoverian succession he had withdrawn from parliament and his conduct in the memorable year seventeen fifteen had not been altogether unsuspected There were reports of private musters of tenants and horses in Waverley Chase by moonlight and of cases of carbines and pistols purchased in Holland and addressed to the Baronet but intercepted by the vigilance of a riding officer of the excise who was afterwards tossed in a blanket on a moonless night by an association of stout yeomen for his officiousness Nay it was even said that at the arrest of Sir William Wyndham the leader of the Tory party a letter from Sir Everard was found in the pocket of his night gown But there was no overt act which an attainder could be founded on and government contented with suppressing the insurrection of seventeen fifteen felt it neither prudent nor safe to push their vengeance farther than against those unfortunate gentlemen who actually took up arms Nor did Sir Everard s apprehensions of personal consequences seem to correspond with the reports spread among his Whig neighbours It was well known that he had supplied with money several of the distressed Northumbrians and Scotchmen who after being made prisoners at Preston in Lancashire were imprisoned in Newgate and the Marshalsea and it was his solicitor and ordinary counsel who conducted the defence of some of these unfortunate gentlemen at their trial It was generally supposed however that had ministers possessed any real proof of Sir Everard s accession to the rebellion he either would not have ventured thus to brave the existing government or at least would not have done so with impunity The feelings which then dictated his proceedings were those of a young man and at an agitating period Since that time Sir Everard s Jacobitism had been gradually decaying like a fire which burns out for want of fuel His Tory and High Church principles were kept up by some occasional exercise at elections and quarter sessions but those respecting hereditary right were fallen into a sort of abeyance Yet it jarred severely upon his feelings that his nephew should go into the army under the Brunswick dynasty and the more so as independent of his high and conscientious ideas of paternal authority it was impossible or at least highly imprudent to interfere authoritatively to prevent it This suppressed vexation gave rise to many poohs and pshaws which were placed to the account of an incipient fit of gout until having sent for the Army List the worthy Baronet consoled himself with reckoning the descendants of the houses of genuine loyalty Mordaunts Granvilles and Stanleys whose names were to be found in that military record and calling up all his feelings of family grandeur and warlike glory he concluded with logic something like Falstaff s that when war was at hand although it were shame to be on any side but one it were worse shame to be idle than to be on the worst side though blacker than usurpation could make it As for Aunt Rachel her scheme had not exactly terminated according to her wishes but she was under the necessity of submitting to circumstances and her mortification was diverted by the employment she found in fitting out her nephew for the campaign and greatly consoled by the prospect of beholding him blaze in complete uniform Edward Waverley himself received with animated and undefined surprise this most unexpected intelligence It was as a fine old poem expresses it like a fire to heather set that covers a solitary hill with smoke and illumines it at the same time with dusky fire His tutor or I should say mister Pembroke for he scarce assumed the name of tutor picked up about Edward s room some fragments of irregular verse which he appeared to have composed under the influence of the agitating feelings occasioned by this sudden page being turned up to him in the book of life The doctor who was a believer in all poetry which was composed by his friends and written out in fair straight lines with a capital at the beginning of each communicated this treasure to Aunt Rachel who with her spectacles dimmed with tears transferred them to her commonplace book among choice receipts for cookery and medicine favourite texts and portions from High Church divines and a few songs amatory and Jacobitical which she had carolled in her younger days from whence her nephew s poetical tentamina were extracted when the volume itself with other authentic records of the Waverley family were exposed to the inspection of the unworthy editor of this memorable history If they afford the reader no higher amusement they will serve at least better than narrative of any kind to acquaint him with the wild and irregular spirit of our hero Late when the Autumn evening fell On Mirkwood Mere s romantic dell The lake return d in chasten d gleam The purple cloud the golden beam Reflected in the crystal pool Headland and bank lay fair and cool The weather tinted rock and tower Each drooping tree each fairy flower So true so soft the mirror gave As if there lay beneath the wave Secure from trouble toil and care A world than earthly world more fair But distant winds began to wake And roused the Genius of the Lake He heard the groaning of the oak And donn d at once his sable cloak As warrior at the battle cry Invests him with his panoply Then as the whirlwind nearer press d He gan to shake his foamy crest O er furrow d brow and blacken d cheek And bade his surge in thunder speak In wild and broken eddies whirl d Flitted that fond ideal world And to the shore in tumult tost The realms of fairy bliss were lost Yet with a stern delight and strange I saw the spirit stirring change As warr d the wind with wave and wood Upon the ruin d tower I stood And felt my heart more strongly bound Responsive to the lofty sound While joying in the mighty roar I mourn d that tranquil scene no more So on the idle dreams of youth Breaks the loud trumpet call of truth Bids each fair vision pass away Like landscape on the lake that lay As fair as flitting and as frail As that which fled the Autumn gale For ever dead to fancy s eye Be each gay form that glided by While dreams of love and lady s charms Give place to honour and to arms In sober prose as perhaps these verses intimate less decidedly the transient idea of Miss Cecilia Stubbs passed from Captain Waverley s heart amid the turmoil which his new destinies excited She appeared indeed in full splendour in her father s pew upon the Sunday when he attended service for the last time at the old parish church upon which occasion at the request of his uncle and Aunt Rachel he was induced nothing both if the truth must be told to present himself in full uniform There is no better antidote against entertaining too high an opinion of others than having an excellent one of ourselves at the very same time Miss Stubbs had indeed summoned up every assistance which art could afford to beauty but alas hoop patches frizzled locks and a new mantua of genuine French silk were lost upon a young officer of dragoons who wore for the first time his gold laced hat jack boots and broadsword I know not whether like the champion of an old ballad His heart was all on honour bent He could not stoop to love No lady in the land had power His frozen heart to move or whether the deep and flaming bars of embroidered gold which now fenced his breast defied the artillery of Cecilia s eyes but every arrow was launched at him in vain Yet did I mark where Cupid s shaft did light It lighted not on little western flower But on bold yeoman flower of all the west Hight Jonas Culbertfield the steward s son Craving pardon for my heroics which I am unable in certain cases to resist giving way to it is a melancholy fact that my history must here take leave of the fair Cecilia who like many a daughter of Eve after the departure of Edward and the dissipation of certain idle visions which she had adopted quietly contented herself with a pisaller and gave her hand at the distance of six months to the aforesaid Jonas son of the Baronet s steward and heir no unfertile prospect to a steward s fortune besides the snug probability of succeeding to his father s office All these advantages moved Squire Stubbs as much as the ruddy brown and manly form of the suitor influenced his daughter to abate somewhat in the article of their gentry and so the match was concluded None seemed more gratified than Aunt Rachel who had hitherto looked rather askance upon the presumptuous damsel as much so peradventure as her nature would permit but who on the first appearance of the new married pair at church honoured the bride with a smile and a profound curtsy in presence of the rector the curate the clerk and the whole congregation of the united parishes of Waverley cum Beverley I beg pardon once and for all of those readers who take up novels merely for amusement for plaguing them so long with old fashioned politics and Whig and Tory and Hanoverians and Jacobites The truth is I cannot promise them that this story shall be intelligible not to say probable without it My plan requires that I should explain the motives on which its action proceeded and these motives necessarily arose from the feelings prejudices and parties of the times I do not invite my fair readers whose sex and impatience give them the greatest right to complain of these circumstances into a flying chariot drawn by hippogriffs or moved by enchantment Mine is a humble English post chaise drawn upon four wheels and keeping his Majesty s highway Such as dislike the vehicle may leave it at the next halt and wait for the conveyance of Prince Hussein s tapestry or Malek the Weaver s flying sentrybox Those who are contented to remain with me will be occasionally exposed to the dulness inseparable from heavy roads steep hills sloughs and other terrestrial retardations but with tolerable horses and a civil driver as the advertisements have it I engage to get as soon as possible into a more picturesque and romantic country if my passengers incline to have some patience with me during my first stages Footnote These Introductory Chapters have been a good deal censured as tedious and unnecessary Yet there are circumstances recorded in them which the author has not been able to persuade himself to retrench or cancel CHAPTER VI THE ADIEUS OF WAVERLEY It was upon the evening of this memorable Sunday that Sir Everard entered the library where he narrowly missed surprising our young hero as he went through the guards of the broadsword with the ancient weapon of old Sir Hildebrand which being preserved as an heirloom usually hung over the chimney in the library beneath a picture of the knight and his horse where the features were almost entirely hidden by the knight s profusion of curled hair and the Bucephalus which he bestrode concealed by the voluminous robes of the Bath with which he was decorated Sir Everard entered and after a glance at the picture and another at his nephew began a little speech which however soon dropt into the natural simplicity of his common manner agitated upon the present occasion by no common feeling Nephew he said and then as mending his phrase My dear Edward it is God s will and also the will of your father whom under God it is your duty to obey that you should leave us to take up the profession of arms in which so many of your ancestors have been distinguished I have made such arrangements as will enable you to take the field as their descendant and as the probable heir of the house of Waverley and sir in the field of battle you will remember what name you bear And Edward my dear boy remember also that you are the last of that race and the only hope of its revival depends upon you therefore as far as duty and honour will permit avoid danger I mean unnecessary danger and keep no company with rakes gamblers and Whigs of whom it is to be feared there are but too many in the service into which you are going Your colonel as I am informed is an excellent man for a Presbyterian but you will remember your duty to God the Church of England and the this breach ought to have been supplied according to the rubric with the word KING but as unfortunately that word conveyed a double and embarrassing sense one meaning de facto and the other de jure the knight filled up the blank otherwise the Church of England and all constituted authorities Then not trusting himself with any further oratory he carried his nephew to his stables to see the horses destined for his campaign Two were black the regimental colour superb chargers both the other three were stout active hacks designed for the road or for his domestics of whom two were to attend him from the Hall an additional groom if necessary might be picked up in Scotland You will depart with but a small retinue quoth the Baronet compared to Sir Hildebrand when he mustered before the gate of the Hall a larger body of horse than your whole regiment consists of I could have wished that these twenty young fellows from my estate who have enlisted in your troop had been to march with you on your journey to Scotland It would have been something at least but I am told their attendance would be thought unusual in these days when every new and foolish fashion is introduced to break the natural dependence of the people upon their landlords Sir Everard had done his best to correct this unnatural disposition of the times for he had brightened the chain of attachment between the recruits and their young captain not only by a copious repast of beef and ale by way of parting feast but by such a pecuniary donation to each individual as tended rather to improve the conviviality than the discipline of their march After inspecting the cavalry Sir Everard again conducted his nephew to the library where he produced a letter carefully folded surrounded by a little stripe of flox silk according to ancient form and sealed with an accurate impression of the Waverley coat of arms It was addressed with great formality To Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine esquire of Bradwardine at his principal mansion of Tully Veolan in Perthshire North Britain These By the hands of Captain Edward Waverley nephew of Sir Everard Waverley of Waverley Honour Bart The gentleman to whom this enormous greeting was addressed of whom we shall have more to say in the sequel had been in arms for the exiled family of Stuart in the year seventeen fifteen and was made prisoner at Preston in Lancashire He was of a very ancient family and somewhat embarrassed fortune a scholar according to the scholarship of Scotchmen that is his learning was more diffuse than accurate and he was rather a reader than a grammarian Of his zeal for the classic authors he is said to have given an uncommon instance On the road between Preston and London he made his escape from his guards but being afterwards found loitering near the place where they had lodged the former night he was recognised and again arrested His companions and even his escort were surprised at his infatuation and could not help inquiring why being once at liberty he had not made the best of his way to a place of safety to which he replied that he had intended to do so but in good faith he had returned to seek his Titus Livius which he had forgot in the hurry of his escape Footnote See Note three The simplicity of this anecdote struck the gentleman who as we before observed had managed the defence of some of those unfortunate persons at the expense of Sir Everard and perhaps some others of the party He was besides himself a special admirer of the old Patavinian and though probably his own zeal might not have carried him such extravagant lengths even to recover the edition of Sweynheim and Pannartz supposed to be the princeps he did not the less estimate the devotion of the North Briton and in consequence exerted himself to so much purpose to remove and soften evidence detect legal flaws et cetera that he accomplished the final discharge and deliverance of Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine from certain very awkward consequences of a plea before our sovereign lord the king in Westminster The Baron of Bradwardine for he was generally so called in Scotland although his intimates from his place of residence used to denominate him Tully Veolan or more familiarly Tully no sooner stood rectus in curia than he posted down to pay his respects and make his acknowledgments at Waverley Honour A congenial passion for field sports and a general coincidence in political opinions cemented his friendship with Sir Everard notwithstanding the difference of their habits and studies in other particulars and having spent several weeks at Waverley Honour the Baron departed with many expressions of regard warmly pressing the Baronet to return his visit and partake of the diversion of grouse shooting upon his moors in Perthshire next season Shortly after mister Bradwardine remitted from Scotland a sum in reimbursement of expenses incurred in the King s High Court of Westminster which although not quite so formidable when reduced to the English denomination had in its original form of Scotch pounds shillings and pence such a formidable effect upon the frame of Duncan Macwheeble the laird s confidential factor baron bailie and man of resource that he had a fit of the cholic which lasted for five days occasioned he said solely and utterly by becoming the unhappy instrument of conveying such a serious sum of money out of his native country into the hands of the false English But patriotism as it is the fairest so it is often the most suspicious mask of other feelings and many who knew Bailie Macwheeble concluded that his professions of regret were not altogether disinterested and that he would have grudged the moneys paid to the LOONS at Westminster much less had they not come from Bradwardine estate a fund which he considered as more particularly his own But the Bailie protested he was absolutely disinterested Woe woe for Scotland not a whit for me The laird was only rejoiced that his worthy friend Sir Everard Waverley of Waverley Honour was reimbursed of the expenditure which he had outlaid on account of the house of Bradwardine It concerned he said the credit of his own family and of the kingdom of Scotland at large that these disbursements should be repaid forthwith and if delayed it would be a matter of national reproach Sir Everard accustomed to treat much larger sums with indifference received the remittance of Ltwo hundred ninety four thirteenS sixD without being aware that the payment was an international concern and indeed would probably have forgot the circumstance altogether if Bailie Macwheeble had thought of comforting his cholic by intercepting the subsidy A yearly intercourse took place of a short letter and a hamper or a cask or two between Waverley Honour and Tully Veolan the English exports consisting of mighty cheeses and mightier ale pheasants and venison and the Scottish returns being vested in grouse white hares pickled salmon and usquebaugh all which were meant sent and received as pledges of constant friendship and amity between two important houses It followed as a matter of course that the heir apparent of Waverley Honour could not with propriety visit Scotland without being furnished with credentials to the Baron of Bradwardine When this matter was explained and settled mister Pembroke expressed his wish to take a private and particular leave of his dear pupil The good man s ex hortations to Edward to preserve an unblemished life and morals to hold fast the principles of the Christian religion and to eschew the profane company of scoffers and latitudinarians too much abounding in the army were not unmingled with his political prejudices It had pleased Heaven he said to place Scotland doubtless for the sins of their ancestors in sixteen forty two in a more deplorable state of darkness than even this unhappy kingdom of England Here at least although the candlestick of the Church of England had been in some degree removed from its place it yet afforded a glimmering light there was a hierarchy though schismatical and fallen from the principles maintained by those great fathers of the church Sancroft and his brethren there was a liturgy though woefully perverted in some of the principal petitions But in Scotland it was utter darkness and excepting a sorrowful scattered and persecuted remnant the pulpits were abandoned to Presbyterians and he feared to sectaries of every description It should be his duty to fortify his dear pupil to resist such unhallowed and pernicious doctrines in church and state as must necessarily be forced at times upon his unwilling ears Here he produced two immense folded packets which appeared each to contain a whole ream of closely written manuscript They had been the labour of the worthy man s whole life and never were labour and zeal more absurdly wasted He had at one time gone to London with the intention of giving them to the world by the medium of a bookseller in Little Britain well known to deal in such commodities and to whom he was instructed to address himself in a particular phrase and with a certain sign which it seems passed at that time current among the initiated Jacobites The moment mister Pembroke had uttered the Shibboleth with the appropriate gesture the bibliopolist greeted him notwithstanding every disclamation by the title of Doctor and conveying him into his back shop after inspecting every possible and impossible place of concealment he commenced Eh Doctor Well all under the rose snug I keep no holes here even for a Hanoverian rat to hide in And what eh any good news from our friends over the water and how does the worthy King of France Or perhaps you are more lately from Rome it must be Rome will do it at last the church must light its candle at the old lamp Eh what cautious I like you the better but no fear Here mister Pembroke with some difficulty stopt a torrent of interrogations eked out with signs nods and winks and having at length convinced the bookseller that he did him too much honour in supposing him an emissary of exiled royalty he explained his actual business The man of books with a much more composed air proceeded to examine the manuscripts The title of the first was A Dissent from Dissenters or the Comprehension confuted showing the Impossibility of any Composition between the Church and Puritans Presbyterians or Sectaries of any Description illustrated from the Scriptures the Fathers of the Church and the soundest Controversial Divines To this work the bookseller positively demurred Well meant he said and learned doubtless but the time had gone by Printed on small pica it would run to eight hundred pages and could never pay Begged therefore to be excused Loved and honoured the true church from his soul and had it been a sermon on the martyrdom or any twelve penny touch why I would venture something for the honour of the cloth But come let s see the other Right Hereditary righted Ah there s some sense in this Hum hum hum pages so many paper so much letter press Ah I ll tell you though Doctor you must knock out some of the Latin and Greek heavy Doctor damn d heavy beg your pardon and if you throw in a few grains more pepper I am he that never preached my author I have published for Drake and Charlwood Lawton and poor Amhurst Footnote See Note four Ah Caleb Caleb Well it was a shame to let poor Caleb starve and so many fat rectors and squires among us I gave him a dinner once a week but Lord love you what s once a week when a man does not know where to go the other six days Well but I must show the manuscript to little Tom Alibi the solicitor who manages all my law affairs must keep on the windy side the mob were very uncivil the last time I mounted in Old Palace Yard all Whigs and Roundheads every man of them Williamites and Hanover rats The next day mister Pembroke again called on the publisher but found Tom Alibi s advice had determined him against undertaking the work Not but what I would go to what was I going to say to the Plantations for the church with pleasure but dear Doctor I have a wife and family but to show my zeal I ll recommend the job to my neighbour Trimmel he is a bachelor and leaving off business so a voyage in a western barge would not inconvenience him But mister Trimmel was also obdurate and mister Pembroke fortunately perchance for himself was compelled to return to Waverley Honour with his treatise in vindication of the real fundamental principles of church and state safely packed in his saddle bags As the public were thus likely to be deprived of the benefit arising from his lucubrations by the selfish cowardice of the trade mister Pembroke resolved to make two copies of these tremendous manuscripts for the use of his pupil He felt that he had been indolent as a tutor and besides his conscience checked him for complying with the request of mister Richard Waverley that he would impress no sentiments upon Edward s mind inconsistent with the present settlement in church and state But now thought he I may without breach of my word since he is no longer under my tuition afford the youth the means of judging for himself and have only to dread his reproaches for so long concealing the light which the perusal will flash upon his mind While he thus indulged the reveries of an author and a politician his darling proselyte seeing nothing very inviting in the title of the tracts and appalled by the bulk and compact lines of the manuscript quietly consigned them to a corner of his travelling trunk Aunt Rachel s farewell was brief and affectionate She only cautioned her dear Edward whom she probably deemed somewhat susceptible against the fascination of Scottish beauty She allowed that the northern part of the island contained some ancient families but they were all Whigs and Presbyterians except the Highlanders and respecting them she must needs say there could be no great delicacy among the ladies where the gentlemen s usual attire was as she had been assured to say the least very singular and not at all decorous She concluded her farewell with a kind and moving benediction and gave the young officer as a pledge of her regard a valuable diamond ring often worn by the male sex at that time and a purse of broad gold pieces which also were more common Sixty Years Since than they have been of late CHAPTER VII A HORSE QUARTER IN SCOTLAND The next morning amid varied feelings the chief of which was a predominant anxious and even solemn impression that he was now in a great measure abandoned to his own guidance and direction Edward Waverley departed from the Hall amid the blessings and tears of all the old domestics and the inhabitants of the village mingled with some sly petitions for sergeantcies and corporalships and so forth on the part of those who professed that they never thoft to ha seen Jacob and Giles and Jonathan go off for soldiers save to attend his honour as in duty bound Edward as in duty bound extricated himself from the supplicants with the pledge of fewer promises than might have been expected from a young man so little accustomed to the world After a short visit to London he proceeded on horseback then the general mode of travelling to Edinburgh and from thence to Dundee a seaport on the eastern coast of Angus shire where his regiment was then quartered He now entered upon a new world where for a time all was beautiful because all was new Colonel Gardiner the commanding officer of the regiment was himself a study for a romantic and at the same time an inquisitive youth In person he was tall handsome and active though somewhat advanced in life In his early years he had been what is called by manner of palliative a very gay young man and strange stories were circulated about his sudden conversion from doubt if not infidelity to a serious and even enthusiastic turn of mind It was whispered that a supernatural communication of a nature obvious even to the exterior senses had produced this wonderful change and though some mentioned the proselyte as an enthusiast none hinted at his being a hypocrite This singular and mystical circumstance gave Colonel Gardiner a peculiar and solemn interest in the eyes of the young soldier Footnote See Note five It may be easily imagined that the officers of a regiment commanded by so respectable a person composed a society more sedate and orderly than a military mess always exhibits and that Waverley escaped some temptations to which he might otherwise have been exposed Meanwhile his military education proceeded Already a good horseman he was now initiated into the arts of the manege which when carried to perfection almost realise the fable of the Centaur the guidance of the horse appearing to proceed from the rider s mere volition rather than from the use of any external and apparent signal of motion He received also instructions in his field duty but I must own that when his first ardour was past his progress fell short in the latter particular of what he wished and expected The duty of an officer the most imposing of all others to the inexperienced mind because accompanied with so much outward pomp and circumstance is in its essence a very dry and abstract task depending chiefly upon arithmetical combinations requiring much attention and a cool and reasoning head to bring them into action Our hero was liable to fits of absence in which his blunders excited some mirth and called down some reproof This circumstance impressed him with a painful sense of inferiority in those qualities which appeared most to deserve and obtain regard in his new profession He asked himself in vain why his eye could not judge of distance or space so well as those of his companions why his head was not always successful in disentangling the various partial movements necessary to execute a particular evolution and why his memory so alert upon most occasions did not correctly retain technical phrases and minute points of etiquette or field discipline Waverley was naturally modest and therefore did not fall into the egregious mistake of supposing such minuter rules of military duty beneath his notice or conceiting himself to be born a general because he made an indifferent subaltern The truth was that the vague and unsatisfactory course of reading which he had pursued working upon a temper naturally retired and abstracted had given him that wavering and unsettled habit of mind which is most averse to study and riveted attention Time in the mean while hung heavy on his hands The gentry of the neighbourhood were disaffected and showed little hospitality to the military guests and the people of the town chiefly engaged in mercantile pursuits were not such as Waverley chose to associate with The arrival of summer and a curiosity to know something more of Scotland than he could see in a ride from his quarters determined him to request leave of absence for a few weeks He resolved first to visit his uncle s ancient friend and correspondent with the purpose of extending or shortening the time of his residence according to circumstances He travelled of course on horse back and with a single attendant and passed his first night at a miserable inn where the landlady had neither shoes nor stockings and the landlord who called himself a gentleman was disposed to be rude to his guest because he had not bespoke the pleasure of his society to supper Footnote See Note six The next day traversing an open and uninclosed country Edward gradually approached the Highlands of Perthshire which at first had appeared a blue outline in the horizon but now swelled into huge gigantic masses which frowned defiance over the more level country that lay beneath them Near the bottom of this stupendous barrier but still in the Lowland country dwelt Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine of Bradwardine and if grey haired eld can be in aught believed there had dwelt his ancestors with all their heritage since the days of the gracious King Duncan CHAPTER VIII A SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE SIXTY YEARS SINCE It was about noon when Captain Waverley entered the straggling village or rather hamlet of Tully Veolan close to which was situated the mansion of the proprietor The houses seemed miserable in the extreme especially to an eye accustomed to the smiling neatness of English cottages They stood without any respect for regularity on each side of a straggling kind of unpaved street where children almost in a primitive state of nakedness lay sprawling as if to be crushed by the hoofs of the first passing horse Occasionally indeed when such a consummation seemed inevitable a watchful old grandam with her close cap distaff and spindle rushed like a sibyl in frenzy out of one of these miserable cells dashed into the middle of the path and snatching up her own charge from among the sunburnt loiterers saluted him with a sound cuff and transported him back to his dungeon the little white headed varlet screaming all the while from the very top of his lungs a shrilly treble to the growling remonstrances of the enraged matron Another part in this concert was sustained by the incessant yelping of a score of idle useless curs which followed snarling barking howling and snapping at the horses heels a nuisance at that time so common in Scotland that a French tourist who like other travellers longed to find a good and rational reason for everything he saw has recorded as one of the memorabilia of Caledonia that the state maintained in each village a relay of curs called collies whose duty it was to chase the chevaux de poste too starved and exhausted to move without such a stimulus from one hamlet to another till their annoying convoy drove them to the end of their stage The evil and remedy such as it is still exist But this is remote from our present purpose and is only thrown out for consideration of the collectors under mister Dent s Dog Bill As Waverley moved on here and there an old man bent as much by toil as years his eyes bleared with age and smoke tottered to the door of his hut to gaze on the dress of the stranger and the form and motions of the horses and then assembled with his neighbours in a little group at the smithy to discuss the probabilities of whence the stranger came and where he might be going Three or four village girls returning from the well or brook with pitchers and pails upon their heads formed more pleasing objects and with their thin short gowns and single petticoats bare arms legs and feet uncovered heads and braided hair somewhat resembled Italian forms of landscape Nor could a lover of the picturesque have challenged either the elegance of their costume or the symmetry of their shape although to say the truth a mere Englishman in search of the COMFORTABLE a word peculiar to his native tongue might have wished the clothes less scanty the feet and legs somewhat protected from the weather the head and complexion shrouded from the sun or perhaps might even have thought the whole person and dress considerably improved by a plentiful application of spring water with a quantum sufficit of soap The whole scene was depressing for it argued at the first glance at least a stagnation of industry and perhaps of intellect Even curiosity the busiest passion of the idle seemed of a listless cast in the village of Tully Veolan the curs aforesaid alone showed any part of its activity with the villagers it was passive They stood and gazed at the handsome young officer and his attendant but without any of those quick motions and eager looks that indicate the earnestness with which those who live in monotonous ease at home look out for amusement abroad Yet the physiognomy of the people when more closely examined was far from exhibiting the indifference of stupidity their features were rough but remarkably intelligent grave but the very reverse of stupid and from among the young women an artist might have chosen more than one model whose features and form resembled those of Minerva The children also whose skins were burnt black and whose hair was bleached white by the influence of the sun had a look and manner of life and interest It seemed upon the whole as if poverty and indolence its too frequent companion were combining to depress the natural genius and acquired information of a hardy intelligent and reflecting peasantry Some such thoughts crossed Waverley s mind as he paced his horse slowly through the rugged and flinty street of Tully Veolan interrupted only in his meditations by the occasional caprioles which his charger exhibited at the reiterated assaults of those canine Cossacks the collies before mentioned The village was more than half a mile long the cottages being irregularly divided from each other by gardens or yards as the inhabitants called them of different sizes where for it is Sixty Years Since the now universal potato was unknown but which were stored with gigantic plants of kale or colewort encircled with groves of nettles and exhibited here and there a huge hemlock or the national thistle overshadowing a quarter of the petty inclosure The broken ground on which the village was built had never been levelled so that these inclosures presented declivities of every degree here rising like terraces there sinking like tan pits The dry stone walls which fenced or seemed to fence for they were sorely breached these hanging gardens of Tully Veolan were intersected by a narrow lane leading to the common field where the joint labour of the villagers cultivated alternate ridges and patches of rye oats barley and pease each of such minute extent that at a little distance the unprofitable variety of the surface resembled a tailor s book of patterns In a few favoured instances there appeared behind the cottages a miserable wigwam compiled of earth loose stones and turf where the wealthy might perhaps shelter a starved cow or sorely galled horse But almost every hut was fenced in front by a huge black stack of turf on one side of the door while on the other the family dunghill ascended in noble emulation About a bowshot from the end of the village appeared the inclosures proudly denominated the Parks of Tully Veolan being certain square fields surrounded and divided by stone walls five feet in height In the centre of the exterior barrier was the upper gate of the avenue opening under an archway battlemented on the top and adorned with two large weather beaten mutilated masses of upright stone which if the tradition of the hamlet could be trusted had once represented at least had been once designed to represent two rampant Bears the supporters of the family of Bradwardine This avenue was straight and of moderate length running between a double row of very ancient horse chestnuts planted alternately with sycamores which rose to such huge height and nourished so luxuriantly that their boughs completely over arched the broad road beneath Beyond these venerable ranks and running parallel to them were two high walls of apparently the like antiquity overgrown with ivy honeysuckle and other climbing plants The avenue seemed very little trodden and chiefly by foot passengers so that being very broad and enjoying a constant shade it was clothed with grass of a deep and rich verdure excepting where a foot path worn by occasional passengers tracked with a natural sweep the way from the upper to the lower gate This nether portal like the former opened in front of a wall ornamented with some rude sculpture with battlements on the top over which were seen half hidden by the trees of the avenue the high steep roofs and narrow gables of the mansion with lines indented into steps and corners decorated with small turrets One of the folding leaves of the lower gate was open and as the sun shone full into the court behind a long line of brilliancy was flung upon the aperture up the dark and gloomy avenue It was one of those effects which a painter loves to represent and mingled well with the struggling light which found its way between the boughs of the shady arch that vaulted the broad green alley The solitude and repose of the whole scene seemed almost monastic and Waverley who had given his horse to his servant on entering the first gate walked slowly down the avenue enjoying the grateful and cooling shade and so much pleased with the placid ideas of rest and seclusion excited by this confined and quiet scene that he forgot the misery and dirt of the hamlet he had left behind him The opening into the paved court yard corresponded with the rest of the scene The house which seemed to consist of two or three high narrow and steep roofed buildings projecting from each other at right angles formed one side of the inclosure It had been built at a period when castles were no longer necessary and when the Scottish architects had not yet acquired the art of designing a domestic residence The windows were numberless but very small the roof had some nondescript kind of projections called bartizans and displayed at each frequent angle a small turret rather resembling a pepper box than a Gothic watchtower Neither did the front indicate absolute security from danger There were loop holes for musketry and iron stanchions on the lower windows probably to repel any roving band of gypsies or resist a predatory visit from the caterans of the neighbouring Highlands Stables and other offices occupied another side of the square The former were low vaults with narrow slits instead of windows resembling as Edward s groom observed rather a prison for murderers and larceners and such like as are tried at sizes than a place for any Christian cattle Above these dungeon looking stables were granaries called girnels and other offices to which there was access by outside stairs of heavy masonry Two battlemented walls one of which faced the avenue and the other divided the court from the garden completed the inclosure Nor was the court without its ornaments In one corner was a tun bellied pigeon house of great size and rotundity resembling in figure and proportion the curious edifice called Arthur s Oven which would have turned the brains of all the antiquaries in England had not the worthy proprietor pulled it down for the sake of mending a neighbouring dam dyke This dove cot or columbarium as the owner called it was no small resource to a Scottish laird of that period whose scanty rents were eked out by the contributions levied upon the farms by these light foragers and the conscriptions exacted from the latter for the benefit of the table Another corner of the court displayed a fountain where a huge bear carved in stone predominated over a large stone basin into which he disgorged the water This work of art was the wonder of the country ten miles round It must not be forgotten that all sorts of bears small and large demi or in full proportion were carved over the windows upon the ends of the gables terminated the spouts and supported the turrets with the ancient family motto Beware the Bear cut under each hyperborean form The court was spacious well paved and perfectly clean there being probably another entrance behind the stables for removing the litter Everything around appeared solitary and would have been silent but for the continued plashing of the fountain and the whole scene still maintained the monastic illusion which the fancy of Waverley had conjured up And here we beg permission to close a chapter of still life Footnote See Note seven CHAPTER IX MORE OF THE MANOR HOUSE AND ITS ENVIRONS After having satisfied his curiosity by gazing around him for a few minutes Waverley applied himself to the massive knocker of the hall door the architrave of which bore the date fifteen ninety four But no answer was returned though the peal resounded through a number of apartments and was echoed from the court yard walls without the house startling the pigeons from the venerable rotunda which they occupied and alarming anew even the distant village curs which had retired to sleep upon their respective dunghills Tired of the din which he created and the unprofitable responses which it excited Waverley began to think that he had reached the castle of Orgoglio as entered by the victorious Prince Arthur When gan he loudly through the house to call But no man cared to answer to his cry There reign d a solemn silence over all Nor voice was heard nor wight was seen in bower or hall Filled almost with expectation of beholding some old old man with beard as white as snow whom he might question concerning this deserted mansion our hero turned to a little oaken wicket door well clenched with iron nails which opened in the court yard wall at its angle with the house It was only latched notwithstanding its fortified appearance and when opened admitted him into the garden which presented a pleasant scene Footnote Footnote At Ravelston may be seen such a garden which the taste of the proprietor the author s friend and kinsman Sir Alexander Keith Knight Mareschal has judiciously preserved That as well as the house is however of smaller dimensions than the Baron of Bradwardine s mansion and garden are presumed to have been The southern side of the house clothed with fruit trees and having many evergreens trained upon its walls extended its irregular yet venerable front along a terrace partly paved partly gravelled partly bordered with flowers and choice shrubs This elevation descended by three several flights of steps placed in its centre and at the extremities into what might be called the garden proper and was fenced along the top by a stone parapet with a heavy balustrade ornamented from space to space with huge grotesque figures of animals seated upon their haunches among which the favourite bear was repeatedly introduced Placed in the middle of the terrace between a sashed door opening from the house and the central flight of steps a huge animal of the same species supported on his head and fore paws a sun dial of large circumference inscribed with more diagrams than Edward s mathematics enabled him to decipher The garden which seemed to be kept with great accuracy abounded in fruit trees and exhibited a profusion of flowers and evergreens cut into grotesque forms It was laid out in terraces which descended rank by rank from the western wall to a large brook which had a tranquil and smooth appearance where it served as a boundary to the garden but near the extremity leapt in tumult over a strong dam or wear head the cause of its temporary tranquillity and there forming a cascade was overlooked by an octangular summer house with a gilded bear on the top by way of vane After this feat the brook assuming its natural rapid and fierce character escaped from the eye down a deep and wooded dell from the copse of which arose a massive but ruinous tower the former habitation of the Barons of Bradwardine The margin of the brook opposite to the garden displayed a narrow meadow or haugh as it was called which formed a small washing green the bank which retired behind it was covered by ancient trees The scene though pleasing was not quite equal to the gardens of Alcina yet wanted not the due donzellette garrule of that enchanted paradise for upon the green aforesaid two bare legged damsels each standing in a spacious tub performed with their feet the office of a patent washing machine These did not however like the maidens of Armida remain to greet with their harmony the approaching guest but alarmed at the appearance of a handsome stranger on the opposite side dropped their garments I should say garment to be quite correct over their limbs which their occupation exposed somewhat too freely and with a shrill exclamation of Eh sirs uttered with an accent between modesty and coquetry sprung off like deer in different directions Waverley began to despair of gaining entrance into this solitary and seemingly enchanted mansion when a man advanced up one of the garden alleys where he still retained his station Trusting this might be a gardener or some domestic belonging to the house Edward descended the steps in order to meet him but as the figure approached and long before he could descry its features he was struck with the oddity of its appearance and gestures Sometimes this mister wight held his hands clasped over his head like an Indian Jogue in the attitude of penance sometimes he swung them perpendicularly like a pendulum on each side and anon he slapped them swiftly and repeatedly across his breast like the substitute used by a hackney coachman for his usual flogging exercise when his cattle are idle upon the stand in a clear frosty day His gait was as singular as his gestures for at times he hopped with great perseverance on the right foot then exchanged that supporter to advance in the same manner on the left and then putting his feet close together he hopped upon both at once His attire also was antiquated and extravagant It consisted in a sort of grey jerkin with scarlet cuffs and slashed sleeves showing a scarlet lining the other parts of the dress corresponded in colour not forgetting a pair of scarlet stockings and a scarlet bonnet proudly surmounted with a turkey s feather Edward whom he did not seem to observe now perceived confirmation in his features of what the mien and gestures had already announced It was apparently neither idiocy nor insanity which gave that wild unsettled irregular expression to a face which naturally was rather handsome but something that resembled a compound of both where the simplicity of the fool was mixed with the extravagance of a crazed imagination He sung with great earnestness and not without some taste a fragment of an old Scottish ditty False love and hast thou play d me this In summer among the flowers I will repay thee back again In winter among the showers Unless again again my love Unless you turn again As you with other maidens rove I ll smile on other men Footnote This is a genuine ancient fragment with some alteration in the two last lines Here lifting up his eyes which had hitherto been fixed in observing how his feet kept time to the tune he beheld Waverley and instantly doffed his cap with many grotesque signals of surprise respect and salutation Edward though with little hope of receiving an answer to any constant question requested to know whether mister Bradwardine were at home or where he could find any of the domestics The questioned party replied and like the witch of Thalaba still his speech was song The Knight s to the mountain His bugle to wind The Lady s to greenwood Her garland to bind The bower of Burd Ellen Has moss on the floor That the step of Lord William Be silent and sure This conveyed no information and Edward repeating his queries received a rapid answer in which from the haste and peculiarity of the dialect the word butler was alone intelligible Waverley then requested to see the butler upon which the fellow with a knowing look and nod of intelligence made a signal to Edward to follow and began to dance and caper down the alley up which he had made his approaches A strange guide this thought Edward and not much unlike one of Shakespeare s roynish clowns I am not over prudent to trust to his pilotage but wiser men have been led by fools By this time he reached the bottom of the alley where turning short on a little parterre of flowers shrouded from the east and north by a close yew hedge he found an old man at work without his coat whose appearance hovered between that of an upper servant and gardener his red nose and ruffled shirt belonging to the former profession his hale and sunburnt visage with his green apron appearing to indicate Old Adam s likeness set to dress this garden The major domo for such he was and indisputably the second officer of state in the barony nay as chief minister of the interior superior even to Bailie Macwheeble in his own department of the kitchen and cellar the major domo laid down his spade slipped on his coat in haste and with a wrathful look at Edward s guide probably excited by his having introduced a stranger while he was engaged in this laborious and as he might suppose it degrading office requested to know the gentleman s commands Being informed that he wished to pay his respects to his master that his name was Waverley and so forth the old man s countenance assumed a great deal of respectful importance He could take it upon his conscience to say his honour would have exceeding pleasure in seeing him Would not mister Waverley choose some refreshment after his journey His honour was with the folk who were getting doon the dark hag the twa gardener lads an emphasis on the word twa had been ordered to attend him and he had been just amusing himself in the mean time with dressing Miss Rose s flower bed that he might be near to receive his honour s orders if need were he was very fond of a garden but had little time for such divertisements He canna get it wrought in abune twa days in the week at no rate whatever said Edward s fantastic conductor A grim look from the butler chastised his interference and he commanded him by the name of Davie Gellatley in a tone which admitted no discussion to look for his honour at the dark hag and tell him there was a gentleman from the south had arrived at the Ha Can this poor fellow deliver a letter asked Edward With all fidelity sir to any one whom he respects I would hardly trust him with a long message by word of mouth though he is more knave than fool Waverley delivered his credentials to mister Gellatley who seemed to confirm the butler s last observation by twisting his features at him when he was looking another way into the resemblance of the grotesque face on the bole of a German tobacco pipe after which with an odd conge to Waverley he danced off to discharge his errand He is an innocent sir said the butler there is one such in almost every town in the country but ours is brought far ben Footnote See Note eight He used to work a day s turn weel enough but he helped Miss Rose when she was flemit with the Laird of Killancureit s new English bull and since that time we ca him Davie Do little indeed we might ca him Davie Do naething for since he got that gay clothing to please his honour and my young mistress great folks will have their fancies he has done naething but dance up and down about the toun without doing a single turn unless trimming the laird s fishing wand or busking his flies or may be catching a dish of trouts at an orra time But here comes Miss Rose who I take burden upon me for her will be especial glad to see one of the house of Waverley at her father s mansion of Tully Veolan But Rose Bradwardine deserves better of her unworthy historian than to be introduced at the end of a chapter In the mean while it may be noticed that Waverley learned two things from this colloquy that in Scotland a single house was called a TOWN and a natural fool an INNOCENT CHAPTER X ROSE BRADWARDINE AND HER FATHER Miss Bradwardine was but seventeen yet at the last races of the county town of upon her health being proposed among a round of beauties the Laird of Bumperquaigh permanent toast master and croupier of the Bautherwhillery Club not only said MORE to the pledge in a pint bumper of Bourdeaux but ere pouring forth the libation denominated the divinity to whom it was dedicated the Rose of Tully Veolan upon which festive occasion three cheers were given by all the sitting members of that respectable society whose throats the wine had left capable of such exertion Nay I am well assured that the sleeping partners of the company snorted applause and that although strong bumpers and weak brains had consigned two or three to the floor yet even these fallen as they were from their high estate and weltering I will carry the parody no farther uttered divers inarticulate sounds intimating their assent to the motion Such unanimous applause could not be extorted but by acknowledged merit and Rose Bradwardine not only deserved it but also the approbation of much more rational persons than the Bautherwhillery Club could have mustered even before discussion of the first magnum She was indeed a very pretty girl of the Scotch cast of beauty that is with a profusion of hair of paley gold and a skin like the snow of her own mountains in whiteness Yet she had not a pallid or pensive cast of countenance her features as well as her temper had a lively expression her complexion though not florid was so pure as to seem transparent and the slightest emotion sent her whole blood at once to her face and neck Her form though under the common size was remarkably elegant and her motions light easy and unembarrassed She came from another part of the garden to receive Captain Waverley with a manner that hovered between bashfulness and courtesy The first greetings past Edward learned from her that the dark hag which had somewhat puzzled him in the butler s account of his master s avocations had nothing to do either with a black cat or a broomstick but was simply a portion of oak copse which was to be felled that day She offered with diffident civility to show the stranger the way to the spot which it seems was not far distant but they were prevented by the appearance of the Baron of Bradwardine in person who summoned by David Gellatley now appeared on hospitable thoughts intent clearing the ground at a prodigious rate with swift and long strides which reminded Waverley of the seven league boots of the nursery fable He was a tall thin athletic figure old indeed and grey haired but with every muscle rendered as tough as whip cord by constant exercise He was dressed carelessly and more like a Frenchman than an Englishman of the period while from his hard features and perpendicular rigidity of stature he bore some resemblance to a Swiss officer of the guards who had resided some time at Paris and caught the costume but not the ease or manner of its inhabitants The truth was that his language and habits were as heterogeneous as his external appearance Owing to his natural disposition to study or perhaps to a very general Scottish fashion of giving young men of rank a legal education he had been bred with a view to the bar But the politics of his family precluding the hope of his rising in that profession mister Bradwardine travelled with high reputation for several years and made some campaigns in foreign service After his demele with the law of high treason in seventeen fifteen he had lived in retirement conversing almost entirely with those of his own principles in the vicinage The pedantry of the lawyer superinduced upon the military pride of the soldier might remind a modern of the days of the zealous volunteer service when the bar gown of our pleaders was often flung over a blazing uniform To this must be added the prejudices of ancient birth and Jacobite politics greatly strengthened by habits of solitary and secluded authority which though exercised only within the bounds of his half cultivated estate was there indisputable and undisputed For as he used to observe the lands of Bradwardine Tully Veolan and others had been erected into a free barony by a charter from David the First cum liberali potest habendi curias et justicias cum fossa et furca LIE pit and gallows et saka et soka et thol et theam et infang thief et outfang thief sive hand habend sive bak barand The peculiar meaning of all these cabalistical words few or none could explain but they implied upon the whole that the Baron of Bradwardine might in case of delinquency imprison try and execute his vassals at his pleasure Like James the First however the present possessor of this authority was more pleased in talking about prerogative than in exercising it and excepting that he imprisoned two poachers in the dungeon of the old tower of Tully Veolan where they were sorely frightened by ghosts and almost eaten by rats and that he set an old woman in the jougs or Scottish pillory for saying there were mair fules in the laird s ha house than Davie Gellatley I do not learn that he was accused of abusing his high powers Still however the conscious pride of possessing them gave additional importance to his language and deportment At his first address to Waverley it would seem that the hearty pleasure he felt to behold the nephew of his friend had somewhat discomposed the stiff and upright dignity of the Baron of Bradwardine s demeanour for the tears stood in the old gentleman s eyes when having first shaken Edward heartily by the hand in the English fashion he embraced him a la mode Francoise and kissed him on both sides of his face while the hardness of his gripe and the quantity of Scotch snuff which his accolade communicated called corresponding drops of moisture to the eyes of his guest Upon the honour of a gentleman he said but it makes me young again to see you here mister Waverley A worthy scion of the old stock of Waverley Honour spes altera as Maro hath it and you have the look of the old line Captain Waverley not so portly yet as my old friend Sir Everard mais cela viendra avec le tems as my Dutch acquaintance Baron Kikkitbroeck said of the sagesse of Madame son epouse And so ye have mounted the cockade Right right though I could have wished the colour different and so I would ha deemed might Sir Everard But no more of that I am old and times are changed And how does the worthy knight baronet and the fair missus Rachel Ah ye laugh young man In troth she was the fair missus Rachel in the year of grace seventeen hundred and sixteen but time passes et singula praedantur anni that is most certain But once again ye are most heartily welcome to my poor house of Tully Veolan Hie to the house Rose and see that Alexander Saunderson looks out the old Chateau Margaux which I sent from Bourdeaux to Dundee in the year seventeen thirteen Rose tripped off demurely enough till she turned the first corner and then ran with the speed of a fairy that she might gain leisure after discharging her father s commission to put her own dress in order and produce all her little finery an occupation for which the approaching dinner hour left but limited time We cannot rival the luxuries of your English table Captain Waverley or give you the epulae lautiores of Waverley Honour I say epulae rather than prandium because the latter phrase is popular epulae ad senatum prandium vero ad populum attinet says Suetonius Tranquillus But I trust ye will applaud my Bourdeaux c est des deux oreilles as Captain Vinsauf used to say vinum primae notae the principal of Saint Andrews denominated it And once more Captain Waverley right glad am I that ye are here to drink the best my cellar can make forthcoming This speech with the necessary interjectional answers continued from the lower alley where they met up to the door of the house where four or five servants in old fashioned liveries headed by Alexander Saunderson the butler who now bore no token of the sable stains of the garden received them in grand COSTUME In an old hall hung round with pikes and with bows With old bucklers and corslets that had borne many shrewd blows With much ceremony and still more real kindness the Baron without stopping in any intermediate apartment conducted his guest through several into the great dining parlour wainscotted with black oak and hung round with the pictures of his ancestry where a table was set forth in form for six persons and an old fashioned beaufet displayed all the ancient and massive plate of the Bradwardine family A bell was now heard at the head of the avenue for an old man who acted as porter upon gala days had caught the alarm given by Waverley s arrival and repairing to his post announced the arrival of other guests These as the Baron assured his young friend were very estimable persons There was the young Laird of Balmawhapple a Falconer by surname of the house of Glenfarquhar given right much to field sports gaudet equis et canibus but a very discreet young gentleman Then there was the Laird of Killancureit who had devoted his leisure UNTILL tillage and agriculture and boasted himself to be possessed of a bull of matchless merit brought from the county of Devon the Damnonia of the Romans if we can trust Robert of Cirencester He is as ye may well suppose from such a tendency but of yeoman extraction servabit odorem testa diu and I believe between ourselves his grandsire was from the wrong side of the Border one Bullsegg who came hither as a steward or bailiff or ground officer or something in that department to the last Girnigo of Killancureit who died of an atrophy After his master s death sir ye would hardly believe such a scandal but this Bullsegg being portly and comely of aspect intermarried with the lady dowager who was young and amorous and possessed himself of the estate which devolved on this unhappy woman by a settlement of her umwhile husband in direct contravention of an unrecorded taillie and to the prejudice of the disponer s own flesh and blood in the person of his natural heir and seventh cousin Girnigo of Tipperhewit whose family was so reduced by the ensuing law suit that his representative is now serving as a private gentleman sentinel in the Highland Black Watch But this gentleman mister Bullsegg of Killancureit that now is has good blood in his veins by the mother and grandmother who were both of the family of Pickletillim and he is well liked and looked upon and knows his own place And God forbid Captain Waverley that we of irreproachable lineage should exult over him when it may be that in the eighth ninth or tenth generation his progeny may rank in a manner with the old gentry of the country Rank and ancestry sir should be the last words in the mouths of us of unblemished race vix ea nostra voco as Naso saith There is besides a clergyman of the true though suffering Episcopal church of Scotland Footnote See Note nine He was a confessor in her cause after the year seventeen fifteen when a Whiggish mob destroyed his meeting house tore his surplice and plundered his dwelling house of four silver spoons intromitting also with his mart and his mealark and with two barrels one of single and one of double ale besides three bottles of brandy My baron bailie and doer mister Duncan Macwheeble is the fourth on our list There is a question owing to the incertitude of ancient orthography whether he belongs to the clan of Wheedle or of Quibble but both have produced persons eminent in the law As such he described them by person and name They enter d and dinner was served as they came CHAPTER XI THE BANQUET The entertainment was ample and handsome according to the Scotch ideas of the period and the guests did great honour to it The Baron eat like a famished soldier the Laird of Balmawhapple like a sportsman Bullsegg of Killancureit like a farmer Waverley himself like a traveller and Bailie Macwheeble like all four together though either out of more respect or in order to preserve that proper declination of person which showed a sense that he was in the presence of his patron he sat upon the edge of his chair placed at three feet distance from the table and achieved a communication with his plate by projecting his person towards it in a line which obliqued from the bottom of his spine so that the person who sat opposite to him could only see the foretop of his riding periwig This stooping position might have been inconvenient to another person but long habit made it whether seated or walking perfectly easy to the worthy Bailie In the latter posture it occasioned no doubt an unseemly projection of the person towards those who happened to walk behind but those being at all times his inferiors for mister Macwheeble was very scrupulous in giving place to all others he cared very little what inference of contempt or slight regard they might derive from the circumstance Hence when he waddled across the court to and from his old grey pony he somewhat resembled a turnspit walking upon its hind legs The nonjuring clergyman was a pensive and interesting old man with much of the air of a sufferer for conscience sake He was one of those Who undeprived their benefice forsook For this whim when the Baron was out of hearing the Bailie used sometimes gently to rally mister Rubrick upbraiding him with the nicety of his scruples Indeed it must be owned that he himself though at heart a keen partisan of the exiled family had kept pretty fair with all the different turns of state in his time so that Davie Gellatley once described him as a particularly good man who had a very quiet and peaceful conscience THAT NEVER DID HIM ANY HARM When the dinner was removed the Baron announced the health of the King politely leaving to the consciences of his guests to drink to the sovereign de facto or de jure as their politics inclined The conversation now became general and shortly afterwards Miss Bradwardine who had done the honours with natural grace and simplicity retired and was soon followed by the clergyman Among the rest of the party the wine which fully justified the encomiums of the landlord flowed freely round although Waverley with some difficulty obtained the privilege of sometimes neglecting the glass At length as the evening grew more late the Baron made a private signal to mister Saunders Saunderson or as he facetiously denominated him Alexander ab Alexandro who left the room with a nod and soon after returned his grave countenance mantling with a solemn and mysterious smile and placed before his master a small oaken casket mounted with brass ornaments of curious form The Baron drawing out a private key unlocked the casket raised the lid and produced a golden goblet of a singular and antique appearance moulded into the shape of a rampant bear which the owner regarded with a look of mingled reverence pride and delight that irresistibly reminded Waverley of Ben Jonson s Tom Otter with his Bull Horse and Dog as that wag wittily denominated his chief carousing cups But mister Bradwardine turning towards him with complacency requested him to observe this curious relic of the olden time It represents he said the chosen crest of our family a bear as ye observe and RAMPANT because a good herald will depict every animal in its noblest posture as a horse SALIENT a greyhound CURRANT and as may be inferred a ravenous animal in actu ferociori or in a voracious lacerating and devouring posture Now sir we hold this most honourable achievement by the wappen brief or concession of arms of Frederick Red beard Emperor of Germany to my predecessor Godmund Bradwardine it being the crest of a gigantic Dane whom he slew in the lists in the Holy Land on a quarrel touching the chastity of the emperor s spouse or daughter tradition saith not precisely which and thus as Virgilius hath it Mutemus clypeos Danaumque insignia nobis Aptemus Then for the cup Captain Waverley it was wrought by the command of Saint Duthac Abbot of Aberbrothock for behoof of another baron of the house of Bradwardine who had valiantly defended the patrimony of that monastery against certain encroaching nobles It is properly termed the Blessed Bear of Bradwardine though old Doctor Doubleit used jocosely to call it Ursa Major and was supposed in old and Catholic times to be invested with certain properties of a mystical and supernatural quality And though I give not in to such anilia it is certain it has always been esteemed a solemn standard cup and heirloom of our house nor is it ever used but upon seasons of high festival and such I hold to be the arrival of the heir of Sir Everard under my roof and I devote this draught to the health and prosperity of the ancient and highly to be honoured house of Waverley During this long harangue he carefully decanted a cob webbed bottle of claret into the goblet which held nearly an English pint and at the conclusion delivering the bottle to the butler to be held carefully in the same angle with the horizon he devoutly quaffed off the contents of the Blessed Bear of Bradwardine Edward with horror and alarm beheld the animal making his rounds and thought with great anxiety upon the appropriate motto Beware the Bear but at the same time plainly foresaw that as none of the guests scrupled to do him this extraordinary honour a refusal on his part to pledge their courtesy would be extremely ill received Resolving therefore to submit to this last piece of tyranny and then to quit the table if possible and confiding in the strength of his constitution he did justice to the company in the contents of the Blessed Bear and felt less inconvenience from the draught than he could possibly have expected The others whose time had been more actively employed began to show symptoms of innovation the good wine did its good office Footnote Southey s Madoc The frost of etiquette and pride of birth began to give way before the genial blessings of this benign constellation and the formal appellatives with which the three dignitaries had hitherto addressed each other were now familiarly abbreviated into Tully Bally and Killie When a few rounds had passed the two latter after whispering together craved permission a joyful hearing for Edward to ask the grace cup This after some delay was at length produced and Waverley concluded the orgies of Bacchus were terminated for the evening He was never more mistaken in his life As the guests had left their horses at the small inn or change house as it was called of the village the Baron could not in politeness avoid walking with them up the avenue and Waverley from the same motive and to enjoy after this feverish revel the cool summer evening attended the party But when they arrived at Luckie Macleary s the Lairds of Balmawhapple and Killancureit declared their determination to acknowledge their sense of the hospitality of Tully Veolan by partaking with their entertainer and his guest Captain Waverley what they technically called deoch an doruis a stirrup cup Footnote two See Note ten to the honour of the Baron s roof tree It must be noticed that the Bailie knowing by experience that the day s jovialty which had been hitherto sustained at the expense of his patron might terminate partly at his own had mounted his spavined grey pony and between gaiety of heart and alarm for being hooked into a reckoning spurred him into a hobbling canter a trot was out of the question and had already cleared the village The others entered the change house leading Edward in unresisting submission for his landlord whispered him that to demur to such an overture would be construed into a high misdemeanour against the leges conviviales or regulations of genial compotation Widow Macleary seemed to have expected this visit as well she might for it was the usual consummation of merry bouts not only at Tully Veolan but at most other gentlemen s houses in Scotland Sixty Years Since The guests thereby at once acquitted themselves of their burden of gratitude for their entertainer s kindness encouraged the trade of his change house did honour to the place which afforded harbour to their horses and indemnified themselves for the previous restraints imposed by private hospitality by spending what Falstaff calls the sweet of the night in the genial license of a tavern Accordingly in full expectation of these distinguished guests Luckie Macleary had swept her house for the first time this fortnight tempered her turf fire to such a heat as the season required in her damp hovel even at Midsummer set forth her deal table newly washed propped its lame foot with a fragment of turf arranged four or five stools of huge and clumsy form upon the sites which best suited the inequalities of her clay floor and having moreover put on her clean toy rokelay and scarlet plaid gravely awaited the arrival of the company in full hope of custom and profit When they were seated under the sooty rafters of Luckie Macleary s only apartment thickly tapestried with cobwebs their hostess who had already taken her cue from the Laird of Balmawhapple appeared with a huge pewter measuring pot containing at least three English quarts familiarly denominated a Tappit Hen and which in the language of the hostess reamed i e mantled with excellent claret just drawn from the cask It was soon plain that what crumbs of reason the Bear had not devoured were to be picked up by the Hen but the confusion which appeared to prevail favoured Edward s resolution to evade the gaily circling glass The others began to talk thick and at once each performing his own part in the conversation without the least respect to his neighbour The Baron of Bradwardine sung French chansons a boire and spouted pieces of Latin Killancureit talked in a steady unalterable dull key of top dressing and bottom dressing Footnote This has been censured as an anachronism and it must be confessed that agriculture of this kind was unknown to the Scotch Sixty Years Since and year olds and gimmers and dinmonts and stots and runts and kyloes and a proposed turnpike act while Balmawhapple in notes exalted above both extolled his horse his hawks and a greyhound called Whistler In the middle of this din the Baron repeatedly implored silence and when at length the instinct of polite discipline so far prevailed that for a moment he obtained it he hastened to beseech their attention unto a military ariette which was a particular favourite of the Marechal Duc de Berwick then imitating as well as he could the manner and tone of a French musquetaire he immediately commenced Mon coeur volage dit elle N est pas pour vous garcon Est pour un homme de guerre Qui a barbe au menton Lon Lon Laridon Qui port chapeau a plume Soulier a rouge talon Qui joue de la flute Aussi du violon Lon Lon Laridon Balmawhapple could hold no longer but broke in with what he called a d d good song composed by Gibby Gaethroughwi t the piper of Cupar and without wasting more time struck up It s up Glenbarchan s braes I gaed And o er the bent of Killiebraid And mony a weary cast I made To cuittle the moor fowl s tail Footnote Suum cuique This snatch of a ballad was composed by Andrew MacDonald the ingenious and unfortunate author of Vimonda The Baron whose voice was drowned in the louder and more obstreperous strains of Balmawhapple now dropped the competition but continued to hum Lon Lon Laridon and to regard the successful candidate for the attention of the company with an eye of disdain while Balmawhapple proceeded If up a bonny black cock should spring To whistle him down wi a slug in his wing And strap him on to my lunzie string Right seldom would I fail After an ineffectual attempt to recover the second verse he sung the first over again and in prosecution of his triumph declared there was more sense in that than in all the derry dongs of France and Fifeshire to the boot of it The Baron only answered with a long pinch of snuff and a glance of infinite contempt But those noble allies the Bear and the Hen had emancipated the young laird from the habitual reverence in which he held Bradwardine at other times He pronounced the claret shilpit and demanded brandy with great vociferation It was brought and now the Demon of Politics envied even the harmony arising from this Dutch concert merely because there was not a wrathful note in the strange compound of sounds which it produced Inspired by her the Laird of Balmawhapple now superior to the nods and winks with which the Baron of Bradwardine in delicacy to Edward had hitherto checked his entering upon political discussion demanded a bumper with the lungs of a Stentor to the little gentleman in black velvet who did such service in seventeen oh two and may the white horse break his neck over a mound of his making Edward was not at that moment clear headed enough to remember that King William s fall which occasioned his death was said to be owing to his horse stumbling at a mole hill yet felt inclined to take umbrage at a toast which seemed from the glance of Balmawhapple s eye to have a peculiar and uncivil reference to the Government which he served But ere he could interfere the Baron of Bradwardine had taken up the quarrel Sir he said whatever my sentiments tanquam privatus may be in such matters I shall not tamely endure your saying anything that may impinge upon the honourable feelings of a gentleman under my roof Sir if you have no respect for the laws of urbanity do ye not respect the military oath the sacramentum militare by which every officer is bound to the standards under which he is enrolled Look at Titus Livius what he says of those Roman soldiers who were so unhappy as exuere sacramentum to renounce their legionary oath but you are ignorant sir alike of ancient history and modern courtesy Not so ignorant as ye would pronounce me roared Balmawhapple I ken weel that you mean the Solemn League and Covenant but if a the Whigs in hell had taken the Here the Baron and Waverley both spoke at once the former calling out Be silent sir ye not only show your ignorance but disgrace your native country before a stranger and an Englishman and Waverley at the same moment entreating mister Bradwardine to permit him to reply to an affront which seemed levelled at him personally But the Baron was exalted by wine wrath and scorn above all sublunary considerations I crave you to be hushed Captain Waverley you are elsewhere peradventure sui juris foris familiated that is and entitled it may be to think and resent for yourself but in my domain in this poor Barony of Bradwardine and under this roof which is quasi mine being held by tacit relocation by a tenant at will I am in loco parentis to you and bound to see you scathless And for you mister Falconer of Balmawhapple I warn ye let me see no more aberrations from the paths of good manners And I tell you mister Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine of Bradwardine and Tully Veolan retorted the sportsman in huge disdain that I ll make a moor cock of the man that refuses my toast whether it be a crop eared English Whig wi a black ribband at his lug or ane wha deserts his ain friends to claw favour wi the rats of Hanover In an instant both rapiers were brandished and some desperate passes exchanged Balmawhapple was young stout and active but the Baron infinitely more master of his weapon would like Sir Toby Belch have tickled his opponent other gates than he did had he not been under the influence of Ursa Major Edward rushed forward to interfere between the combatants but the prostrate bulk of the Laird of Killancureit over which he stumbled intercepted his passage How Killancureit happened to be in this recumbent posture at so interesting a moment was never accurately known Some thought he was about to insconce himself under the table he himself alleged that he stumbled in the act of lifting a joint stool to prevent mischief by knocking down Balmawhapple Be that as it may if readier aid than either his or Waverley s had not interposed there would certainly have been bloodshed But the well known clash of swords which was no stranger to her dwelling aroused Luckie Macleary as she sat quietly beyond the hallan or earthen partition of the cottage with eyes employed on Boston s Crook the Lot while her ideas were engaged in summing up the reckoning She boldly rushed in with the shrill expostulation Wad their honours slay ane another there and bring discredit on an honest widow woman s house when there was a the lee land in the country to fight upon a remonstrance which she seconded by flinging her plaid with great dexterity over the weapons of the combatants The servants by this time rushed in and being by great chance tolerably sober separated the incensed opponents with the assistance of Edward and Killancureit The latter led off Balmawhapple cursing swearing and vowing revenge against every Whig Presbyterian and fanatic in England and Scotland from John o Groat s to the Land s End and with difficulty got him to horse Our hero with the assistance of Saunders Saunderson escorted the Baron of Bradwardine to his own dwelling but could not prevail upon him to retire to bed until he had made a long and learned apology for the events of the evening of which however there was not a word intelligible except something about the Centaurs and the Lapithae CHAPTER XII REPENTANCE AND A RECONCILIATION Waverley was unaccustomed to the use of wine excepting with great temperance He slept therefore soundly till late in the succeeding morning and then awakened to a painful recollection of the scene of the preceding evening He had received a personal affront he a gentleman a soldier and a Waverley True the person who offered it was not at the time it was given possessed of the moderate share of sense which nature had allotted him true also in resenting this insult he would break the laws of Heaven as well as of his country true in doing so he might take the life of a young man who perhaps respectably discharged the social duties and render his family miserable or he might lose his own no pleasant alternative even to the bravest when it is debated coolly and in private All this pressed on his mind yet the original statement recurred with the same irresistible force He had received a personal insult he was of the house of Waverley and he bore a commission There was no alternative and he descended to the breakfast parlour with the intention of taking leave of the family and writing to one of his brother officers to meet him at the inn midway between Tully Veolan and the town where they were quartered in order that he might convey such a message to the Laird of Balmawhapple as the circumstances seemed to demand He found Miss Bradwardine presiding over the tea and coffee the table loaded with warm bread both of flour oatmeal and barleymeal in the shape of loaves cakes biscuits and other varieties together with eggs reindeer ham mutton and beef ditto smoked salmon marmalade and all the other delicacies which induced even Johnson himself to extol the luxury of a Scotch breakfast above that of all other countries A mess of oatmeal porridge flanked by a silver jug which held an equal mixture of cream and butter milk was placed for the Baron s share of this repast but Rose observed he had walked out early in the morning after giving orders that his guest should not be disturbed Waverley sat down almost in silence and with an air of absence and abstraction which could not give Miss Bradwardine a favourable opinion of his talents for conversation He answered at random one or two observations which she ventured to make upon ordinary topics so that feeling herself almost repulsed in her efforts at entertaining him and secretly wondering that a scarlet coat should cover no better breeding she left him to his mental amusement of cursing Doctor Doubleit s favourite constellation of Ursa Major as the cause of all the mischief which had already happened and was likely to ensue At once he started and his colour heightened as looking toward the window he beheld the Baron and young Balmawhapple pass arm in arm apparently in deep conversation and he hastily asked Did mister Falconer sleep here last night Rose not much pleased with the abruptness of the first question which the young stranger had addressed to her answered drily in the negative and the conversation again sunk into silence At this moment mister Saunderson appeared with a message from his master requesting to speak with Captain Waverley in another apartment With a heart which beat a little quicker not indeed from fear but from uncertainty and anxiety Edward obeyed the summons He found the two gentlemen standing together an air of complacent dignity on the brow of the Baron while something like sullenness or shame or both blanked the bold visage of Balmawhapple The former slipped his arm through that of the latter and thus seeming to walk with him while in reality he led him advanced to meet Waverley and stopping in the midst of the apartment made in great state the following oration Captain Waverley my young and esteemed friend mister Falconer of Balmawhapple has craved of my age and experience as of one not wholly unskilled in the dependencies and punctilios of the duello or monomachia to be his interlocutor in expressing to you the regret with which he calls to remembrance certain passages of our symposion last night which could not but be highly displeasing to you as serving for the time under this present existing government He craves you sir to drown in oblivion the memory of such solecisms against the laws of politeness as being what his better reason disavows and to receive the hand which he offers you in amity and I must needs assure you that nothing less than a sense of being dans son tort as a gallant French chevalier Mons Le Bretailleur once said to me on such an occasion and an opinion also of your peculiar merit could have extorted such concessions for he and all his family are and have been time out of mind Mavortia pectora as Buchanan saith a bold and warlike sept or people Edward immediately and with natural politeness accepted the hand which Balmawhapple or rather the Baron in his character of mediator extended towards him It was impossible he said for him to remember what a gentleman expressed his wish he had not uttered and he willingly imputed what had passed to the exuberant festivity of the day That is very handsomely said answered the Baron for undoubtedly if a man be ebrius or intoxicated an incident which on solemn and festive occasions may and will take place in the life of a man of honour and if the same gentleman being fresh and sober recants the contumelies which he hath spoken in his liquor it must be held vinum locutum est the words cease to be his own Yet would I not find this exculpation relevant in the case of one who was ebriosus or an habitual drunkard because if such a person choose to pass the greater part of his time in the predicament of intoxication he hath no title to be exeemed from the obligations of the code of politeness but should learn to deport himself peaceably and courteously when under influence of the vinous stimulus And now let us proceed to breakfast and think no more of this daft business I must confess whatever inference may be drawn from the circumstance that Edward after so satisfactory an explanation did much greater honour to the delicacies of Miss Bradwardine s breakfast table than his commencement had promised Balmawhapple on the contrary seemed embarrassed and dejected and Waverley now for the first time observed that his arm was in a sling which seemed to account for the awkward and embarrassed manner with which he had presented his hand To a question from Miss Bradwardine he muttered in answer something about his horse having fallen and seeming desirous to escape both from the subject and the company he arose as soon as breakfast was over made his bow to the party and declining the Baron s invitation to tarry till after dinner mounted his horse and returned to his own home Waverley now announced his purpose of leaving Tully Veolan early enough after dinner to gain the stage at which he meant to sleep but the unaffected and deep mortification with which the good natured and affectionate old gentleman heard the proposal quite deprived him of courage to persist in it No sooner had he gained Waverley s consent to lengthen his visit for a few days than he laboured to remove the grounds upon which he conceived he had meditated a more early retreat I would not have you opine Captain Waverley that I am by practice or precept an advocate of ebriety though it may be that in our festivity of last night some of our friends if not perchance altogether ebrii or drunken were to say the least ebrioli by which the ancients designed those who were fuddled or as your English vernacular and metaphorical phrase goes half seas over Not that I would so insinuate respecting you Captain Waverley who like a prudent youth did rather abstain from potation nor can it be truly said of myself who having assisted at the tables of many great generals and marechals at their solemn carousals have the art to carry my wine discreetly and did not during the whole evening as ye must have doubtless observed exceed the bounds of a modest hilarity There was no refusing assent to a proposition so decidedly laid down by him who undoubtedly was the best judge although had Edward formed his opinion from his own recollections he would have pronounced that the Baron was not only ebriolus but verging to become ebrius or in plain English was incomparably the most drunk of the party except perhaps his antagonist the Laird of Balmawhapple However having received the expected or rather the required compliment on his sobriety the Baron proceeded No sir though I am myself of a strong temperament I abhor ebriety and detest those who swallow wine gulce causa for the oblectation of the gullet albeit I might deprecate the law of Pittacus of Mitylene who punished doubly a crime committed under the influence of Liber Pater nor would I utterly accede to the objurgation of the younger Plinius in the fourteenth book of his Historia Naturalis No sir I distinguish I discriminate and approve of wine so far only as it maketh glad the face or in the language of Flaccus recepto amico Thus terminated the apology which the Baron of Bradwardine thought it necessary to make for the superabundance of his hospitality and it may be easily believed that he was neither interrupted by dissent nor any expression of incredulity He then invited his guest to a morning ride and ordered that Davie Gellatley should meet them at the dern path with Ban and Buscar For until the shooting season commence I would willingly show you some sport and we may God willing meet with a roe The roe Captain Waverley may be hunted at all times alike for never being in what is called PRIDE OF GREASE he is also never out of season though it be a truth that his venison is not equal to that of either the red or fallow deer Footnote The learned in cookery dissent from the Baron of Bradwardine and hold the roe venison dry and indifferent food unless when dressed in soup and Scotch collops But he will serve to show how my dogs run and therefore they shall attend us with David Gellatley Waverley expressed his surprise that his friend Davie was capable of such trust but the Baron gave him to understand that this poor simpleton was neither fatuous nec naturaliter idiota as is expressed in the brieves of furiosity but simply a crack brained knave who could execute very well any commission which jumped with his own humour and made his folly a plea for avoiding every other He has made an interest with us continued the Baron by saving Rose from a great danger with his own proper peril and the roguish loon must therefore eat of our bread and drink of our cup and do what he can or what he will which if the suspicions of Saunderson and the Bailie are well founded may perchance in his case be commensurate terms Miss Bradwardine then gave Waverley to understand that this poor simpleton was dotingly fond of music deeply affected by that which was melancholy and transported into extravagant gaiety by light and lively airs He had in this respect a prodigious memory stored with miscellaneous snatches and fragments of all tunes and songs which he sometimes applied with considerable address as the vehicles of remonstrance explanation or satire Davie was much attached to the few who showed him kindness and both aware of any slight or ill usage which he happened to receive and sufficiently apt where he saw opportunity to revenge it The common people who often judge hardly of each other as well as of their betters although they had expressed great compassion for the poor innocent while suffered to wander in rags about the village no sooner beheld him decently clothed provided for and even a sort of favourite than they called up all the instances of sharpness and ingenuity in action and repartee which his annals afforded and charitably bottomed thereupon a hypothesis that David Gellatley was no farther fool than was necessary to avoid hard labour This opinion was not better founded than that of the Negroes who from the acute and mischievous pranks of the monkeys suppose that they have the gift of speech and only suppress their powers of elocution to escape being set to work But the hypothesis was entirely imaginary David Gellatley was in good earnest the half crazed simpleton which he appeared and was incapable of any constant and steady exertion He had just so much solidity as kept on the windy side of insanity so much wild wit as saved him from the imputation of idiocy some dexterity in field sports in which we have known as great fools excel great kindness and humanity in the treatment of animals entrusted to him warm affections a prodigious memory and an ear for music The stamping of horses was now heard in the court and Davie s voice singing to the two large deer greyhounds Hie away hie away Over bank and over brae Where the copsewood is the greenest Where the fountains glisten sheenest Where the lady fern grows strongest Where the morning dew lies longest Where the black cock sweetest sips it Where the fairy latest trips it Hie to haunts right seldom seen Lovely lonesome cool and green Over bank and over brae Hie away hie away Do the verses he sings asked Waverley belong to old Scottish poetry Miss Bradwardine I believe not she replied This poor creature had a brother and Heaven as if to compensate to the family Davie s deficiencies had given him what the hamlet thought uncommon talents An uncle contrived to educate him for the Scottish kirk but he could not get preferment because he came from our GROUND He returned from college hopeless and brokenhearted and fell into a decline My father supported him till his death which happened before he was nineteen He played beautifully on the flute and was supposed to have a great turn for poetry He was affectionate and compassionate to his brother who followed him like his shadow and we think that from him Davie gathered many fragments of songs and music unlike those of this country But if we ask him where he got such a fragment as he is now singing he either answers with wild and long fits of laughter or else breaks into tears of lamentation but was never heard to give any explanation or to mention his brother s name since his death Surely said Edward who was readily interested by a tale bordering on the romantic surely more might be learned by more particular inquiry Perhaps so answered Rose but my father will not permit any one to practise on his feelings on this subject By this time the Baron with the help of mister Saunderson had indued a pair of jack boots of large dimensions and now invited our hero to follow him as he stalked clattering down the ample stair case tapping each huge balustrade as he passed with the butt of his massive horse whip and humming with the air of a chasseur of Louis Quatorze Pour la chasse ordonnee il faut preparer tout Ho la ho Vite vite debout CHAPTER XIII A MORE RATIONAL DAY THAN THE LAST The Baron of Bradwardine mounted on an active and well managed horse and seated on a demi pique saddle with deep housings to agree with his livery was no bad representative of the old school His light coloured embroidered coat and superbly barred waistcoat his brigadier wig surmounted by a small gold laced cocked hat completed his personal costume but he was attended by two well mounted servants on horseback armed with holster pistols In this guise he ambled forth over hill and valley the admiration of every farm yard which they passed in their progress till low down in a grassy vale they found David Gellatley leading two very tall deer greyhounds and presiding over half a dozen curs and about as many bare legged and bare headed boys who to procure the chosen distinction of attending on the chase had not failed to tickle his ears with the dulcet appellation of Maister Gellatley though probably all and each had hooted him on former occasions in the character of daft Davie But this is no uncommon strain of flattery to persons in office nor altogether confined to the barelegged villagers of Tully Veolan it was in fashion Sixty Years Since is now and will be six hundred years hence if this admirable compound of folly and knavery called the world shall be then in existence These Gillie wet foots as they were called were destined to beat the bushes which they performed with so much success that after half an hour s search a roe was started coursed and killed the Baron following on his white horse like Earl Percy of yore and magnanimously flaying and embowelling the slain animal which he observed was called by the French chasseurs faire la curee with his own baronial couteau de chasse After this ceremony he conducted his guest homeward by a pleasant and circuitous route commanding an extensive prospect of different villages and houses to each of which mister Bradwardine attached some anecdote of history or genealogy told in language whimsical from prejudice and pedantry but often respectable for the good sense and honourable feelings which his narrative displayed and almost always curious if not valuable for the information they contained The truth is the ride seemed agreeable to both gentlemen because they found amusement in each other s conversation although their characters and habits of thinking were in many respects totally opposite Edward we have informed the reader was warm in his feelings wild and romantic in his ideas and in his taste of reading with a strong disposition towards poetry mister Bradwardine was the reverse of all this and piqued himself upon stalking through life with the same upright starched stoical gravity which distinguished his evening promenade upon the terrace of Tully Veolan where for hours together the very model of old Hardyknute Stately stepp d he east the wa And stately stepp d he west As for literature he read the classic poets to be sure and the Epithalamium of Georgius Buchanan and Arthur Johnston s Psalms of a Sunday and the Deliciae Poetarum Scotorum and Sir David Lindsay s Works and Barbour s Brace and Blind Harry s Wallace and The Gentle Shepherd and The Cherry and The Slae But though he thus far sacrificed his time to the Muses he would if the truth must be spoken have been much better pleased had the pious or sapient apothegms as well as the historical narratives which these various works contained been presented to him in the form of simple prose And he sometimes could not refrain from expressing contempt of the vain and unprofitable art of poem making in which he said the only one who had excelled in his time was Allan Ramsay the periwigmaker Footnote The Baron ought to have remembered that the joyous Allan literally drew his blood from the house of the noble earl whom he terms Dalhousie of an old descent My stoup my pride my ornament But although Edward and he differed TOTO COELO as the Baron would have said upon this subject yet they met upon history as on a neutral ground in which each claimed an interest The Baron indeed only cumbered his memory with matters of fact the cold dry hard outlines which history delineates Edward on the contrary loved to fill up and round the sketch with the colouring of a warm and vivid imagination which gives light and life to the actors and speakers in the drama of past ages Yet with tastes so opposite they contributed greatly to each other s amusement mister Bradwardine s minute narratives and powerful memory supplied to Waverley fresh subjects of the kind upon which his fancy loved to labour and opened to him a new mine of incident and of character And he repaid the pleasure thus communicated by an earnest attention valuable to all story tellers more especially to the Baron who felt his habits of self respect flattered by it and sometimes also by reciprocal communications which interested mister Bradwardine as confirming or illustrating his own favourite anecdotes Besides mister Bradwardine loved to talk of the scenes of his youth whichl had been spent in camps and foreign lands and had many interesting particulars to tell of the generals under whom he had served and the actions he had witnessed Both parties returned to Tully Veolan in great good humour with each other Waverley desirous of studying more attentively what he considered as a singular and interesting character gifted with a memory containing a curious register of ancient and modern anecdotes and Bradwardine disposed to regard Edward as puer or rather juvenis bonae spei et magnae indolis a youth devoid of that petulant volatility which is impatient of or vilipends the conversation and advice of his seniors from which he predicted great things of his future success and deportment in life There was no other guest except mister Rubrick whose information and discourse as a clergyman and a scholar harmonised very well with that of the Baron and his guest Shortly after dinner the Baron as if to show that his temperance was not entirely theoretical proposed a visit to Rose s apartment or as he termed it her troisieme etage Waverley was accordingly conducted through one or two of those long awkward passages with which ancient architects studied to puzzle the inhabitants of the houses which they planned at the end of which mister Bradwardine began to ascend by two steps at once a very steep narrow and winding stair leaving mister Rubrick and Waverley to follow at more leisure while he should announce their approach to his daughter After having climbed this perpendicular corkscrew until their brains were almost giddy they arrived in a little matted lobby which served as an anteroom to Rose s sanctum sanctorum and through which they entered her parlour It was a small but pleasant apartment opening to the south and hung with tapestry adorned besides with two pictures one of her mother in the dress of a shepherdess with a bell hoop the other of the Baron in his tenth year in a blue coat embroidered waistcoat laced hat and bag wig with a bow in his hand Edward could not help smiling at the costume and at the odd resemblance between the round smooth red cheeked staring visage in the portrait and the gaunt bearded hollow eyed swarthy features which travelling fatigues of war and advanced age had bestowed on the original The Baron joined in the laugh Truly he said that picture was a woman s fantasy of my good mother s a daughter of the Laird of Tulliellum Captain Waverley I indicated the house to you when we were on the top of the Shinnyheuch it was burnt by the Dutch auxiliaries brought in by the Government in seventeen fifteen I never sate for my pourtraicture but once since that was painted and it was at the special and reiterated request of the Marechal Duke of Berwick The good old gentleman did not mention what mister Rubrick afterwards told Edward that the Duke had done him this honour on account of his being the first to mount the breach of a fort in Savoy during the memorable campaign of seventeen oh nine and his having there defended himself with his half pike for nearly ten minutes before any support reached him To do the Baron justice although sufficiently prone to dwell upon and even to exaggerate his family dignity and consequence he was too much a man of real courage ever to allude to such personal acts of merit as he had himself manifested Miss Rose now appeared from the interior room of her apartment to welcome her father and his friends The little labours in which she had been employed obviously showed a natural taste which required only cultivation Her father had taught her French and Italian and a few of the ordinary authors in those languages ornamented her shelves He had endeavoured also to be her preceptor in music but as he began with the more abstruse doctrines of the science and was not perhaps master of them himself she had made no proficiency farther than to be able to accompany her voice with the harpsichord but even this was not very common in Scotland at that period To make amends she sung with great taste and feeling and with a respect to the sense of what she uttered that might be proposed in example to ladies of much superior musical talent Her natural good sense taught her that if as we are assured by high authority music be married to immortal verse they are very often divorced by the performer in a most shameful manner It was perhaps owing to this sensibility to poetry and power of combining its expression with those of the musical notes that her singing gave more pleasure to all the unlearned in music and even to many of the learned than could have been communicated by a much finer voice and more brilliant execution unguided by the same delicacy of feeling A bartizan or projecting gallery before the windows of her parlour served to illustrate another of Rose s pursuits for it was crowded with flowers of different kinds which she had taken under her special protection A projecting turret gave access to this Gothic balcony which commanded a most beautiful prospect The formal garden with its high bounding walls lay below contracted as it seemed to a mere parterre while the view extended beyond them down a wooded glen where the small river was sometimes visible sometimes hidden in copse The eye might be delayed by a desire to rest on the rocks which here and there rose from the dell with massive or spiry fronts or it might dwell on the noble though ruined tower which was here beheld in all its dignity frowning from a promontory over the river To the left were seen two or three cottages a part of the village the brow of the hill concealed the others The glen or dell was terminated by a sheet of water called Loch Veolan into which the brook discharged itself and which now glistened in the western sun The distant country seemed open and varied in surface though not wooded and there was nothing to interrupt the view until the scene was bounded by a ridge of distant and blue hills which formed the southern boundary of the strath or valley To this pleasant station Miss Bradwardine had ordered coffee The view of the old tower or fortalice introduced some family anecdotes and tales of Scottish chivalry which the Baron told with great enthusiasm The projecting peak of an impending crag which rose near it had acquired the name of Saint Swithin s Chair It was the scene of a peculiar superstition of which mister Rubrick mentioned some curious particulars which reminded Waverley of a rhyme quoted by Edgar in King Lear and Rose was called upon to sing a little legend in which they had been interwoven by some village poet Who noteless as the race from which he sprung Saved others names but left his own unsung The sweetness of her voice and the simple beauty of her music gave all the advantage which the minstrel could have desired and which his poetry so much wanted I almost doubt if it can be read with patience destitute of these advantages although I conjecture the following copy to have been somewhat corrected by Waverley to suit the taste of those who might not relish pure antiquity Saint Swithin s Chair On Hallow Mass Eve ere ye boune ye to rest Ever beware that your couch be bless d Sign it with cross and sain it with bead Sing the Ave and say the Creed For on Hallow Mass Eve the Night Hag will ride And all her nine fold sweeping on by her side Whether the wind sing lowly or loud Sailing through moonshine or swath d in the cloud The Lady she sat in Saint Swithin s Chair The dew of the night has damp d her hair Her cheek was pale but resolved and high Was the word of her lip and the glance of her eye She mutter d the spell of Swithin bold When his naked foot traced the midnight wold When he stopp d the Hag as she rode the night And bade her descend and her promise plight He that dare sit on Saint Swithin s Chair When the Night Hag wings the troubled air Questions three when he speaks the spell He may ask and she must tell The Baron has been with King Robert his liege These three long years in battle and siege News are there none of his weal or his woe And fain the Lady his fate would know She shudders and stops as the charm she speaks Is it the moody owl that shrieks Or is it that sound betwixt laughter and scream The voice of the Demon who haunts the stream The moan of the wind sunk silent and low And the roaring torrent had ceased to flow The calm was more dreadful than raging storm When the cold grey mist brought the ghastly Form I am sorry to disappoint the company especially Captain Waverley who listens with such laudable gravity it is but a fragment although I think there are other verses describing the return of the Baron from the wars and how the lady was found clay cold upon the grounsill ledge It is one of those figments observed mister Bradwardine with which the early history of distinguished families was deformed in the times of superstition as that of Rome and other ancient nations had their prodigies sir the which you may read in ancient histories or in the little work compiled by Julius Obsequens and inscribed by the learned Scheffer the editor to his patron Benedictus Skytte Baron of Dudershoff My father has a strange defiance of the marvellous Captain Waverley observed Rose and once stood firm when a whole synod of Presbyterian divines were put to the rout by a sudden apparition of the foul fiend Waverley looked as if desirous to hear more Must I tell my story as well as sing my song Well Once upon a time there lived an old woman called Janet Gellatley who was suspected to be a witch on the infallible grounds that she was very old very ugly very poor and had two sons one of whom was a poet and the other a fool which visitation all the neighbourhood agreed had come upon her for the sin of witchcraft And she was imprisoned for a week in the steeple of the parish church and sparely supplied with food and not permitted to sleep until she herself became as much persuaded of her being a witch as her accusers and in this lucid and happy state of mind was brought forth to make a clean breast that is to make open confession of her sorceries before all the Whig gentry and ministers in the vicinity who were no conjurors themselves My father went to see fair play between the witch and the clergy for the witch had been born on his estate And while the witch was confessing that the Enemy appeared and made his addresses to her as a handsome black man which if you could have seen poor old blear eyed Janet reflected little honour on Apollyon s taste and while the auditors listened with astonished ears and the clerk recorded with a trembling hand she all of a sudden changed the low mumbling tone with which she spoke into a shrill yell and exclaimed Look to yourselves look to yourselves I see the Evil One sitting in the midst of ye The surprise was general and terror and flight its immediate consequences Happy were those who were next the door and many were the disasters that befell hats bands cuffs and wigs before they could get out of the church where they left the obstinate prelatist to settle matters with the witch and her admirer at his own peril or pleasure Risu solvuntur tabulae said the Baron when they recovered their panic trepidation they were too much ashamed to bring any wakening of the process against Janet Gellatley Footnote See Note eleven This anecdote led to a long discussion of All those idle thoughts and fantasies Devices dreams opinions unsound Shows visions soothsays and prophecies And all that feigned is as leasings tales and lies With such conversation and the romantic legends which it introduced closed our hero s second evening in the house of Tully Veolan CHAPTER XIV A DISCOVERY WAVERLEY BECOMES DOMESTICATED AT TULLY VEOLAN The next day Edward arose betimes and in a morning walk around the house and its vicinity came suddenly upon a small court in front of the dog kennel where his friend Davie was employed about his four footed charge One quick glance of his eye recognised Waverley when instantly turning his back as if he had not observed him he began to sing part of an old ballad Young men will love thee more fair and more fast Heard ye so merry the little bird sing Old men s love the longest will last And the throstle cock s head is under his wing The young man s wrath is like light straw on fire Heard ye so merry the little bird sing But like red hot steel is the old man s ire And the throstle cock s head is under his wing The young man will brawl at the evening board Heard ye so merry the little bird sing But the old man will draw at the dawning the sword And the throstle cock s head is under his wing Waverley could not avoid observing that Davie laid something like a satirical emphasis on these lines He therefore approached and endeavoured by sundry queries to elicit from him what the innuendo might mean but Davie had no mind to explain and had wit enough to make his folly cloak his knavery Edward could collect nothing from him excepting that the Laird of Balmawhapple had gone home yesterday morning wi his boots fu o bluid In the garden however he met the old butler who no longer attempted to conceal that having been bred in the nursery line with Sumack and company of Newcastle he sometimes wrought a turn in the flower borders to oblige the Laird and Miss Rose By a series of queries Edward at length discovered with a painful feeling of surprise and shame that Balmawhapple s submission and apology had been the consequence of a rencontre with the Baron before his guest had quitted his pillow in which the younger combatant had been disarmed and wounded in the sword arm Greatly mortified at this information Edward sought out his friendly host and anxiously expostulated with him upon the injustice he had done him in anticipating his meeting with mister Falconer a circumstance which considering his youth and the profession of arms which he had just adopted was capable of being represented much to his prejudice The Baron justified himself at greater length than I choose to repeat He urged that the quarrel was common to them and that Balmawhapple could not by the code of honour evite giving satisfaction to both which he had done in his case by an honourable meeting and in that of Edward by such a palinode as rendered the use of the sword unnecessary and which being made and accepted must necessarily sopite the whole affair With this excuse or explanation Waverley was silenced if not satisfied but he could not help testifying some displeasure against the Blessed Bear which had given rise to the quarrel nor refrain from hinting that the sanctified epithet was hardly appropriate The Baron observed he could not deny that the Bear though allowed by heralds as a most honourable ordinary had nevertheless somewhat fierce churlish and morose in his disposition as might be read in Archibald Simson pastor of Dalkeith s Hieroglyphica Animalium and had thus been the type of many quarrels and dissensions which had occurred in the house of Bradwardine of which he continued I might commemorate mine own unfortunate dissension with my third cousin by the mother s side Sir Hew Halbert who was so unthinking as to deride my family name as if it had been QUASI BEAR WARDEN a most uncivil jest since it not only insinuated that the founder of our house occupied such a mean situation as to be a custodier of wild beasts a charge which ye must have observed is only entrusted to the very basest plebeians but moreover seemed to infer that our coat armour had not been achieved by honourable actions in war but bestowed by way of paranomasia or pun upon our family appellation a sort of bearing which the French call armoires parlantes the Latins arma cantantia and your English authorities canting heraldry Footnote See Note twelve being indeed a species of emblazoning more befitting canters gaberlunzies and such like mendicants whose gibberish is formed upon playing upon the word than the noble honourable and useful science of heraldry which assigns armorial bearings as the reward of noble and generous actions and not to tickle the ear with vain quodlibets such as are found in jestbooks Of his quarrel with Sir Hew he said nothing more than that it was settled in a fitting manner Having been so minute with respect to the diversions of Tully Veolan on the first days of Edward s arrival for the purpose of introducing its inmates to the reader s acquaintance it becomes less necessary to trace the progress of his intercourse with the same accuracy It is probable that a young man accustomed to more cheerful society would have tired of the conversation of so violent an assertor of the boast of heraldry as the Baron but Edward found an agreeable variety in that of Miss Bradwardine who listened with eagerness to his remarks upon literature and showed great justness of taste in her answers The sweetness of her disposition had made her submit with complacency and even pleasure to the course of reading prescribed by her father although it not only comprehended several heavy folios of history but certain gigantic tomes in high church polemics In heraldry he was fortunately contented to give her only such a slight tincture as might be acquired by perusal of the two folio volumes of Nisbet Rose was indeed the very apple of her father s eye Her constant liveliness her attention to all those little observances most gratifying to those who would never think of exacting them her beauty in which he recalled the features of his beloved wife her unfeigned piety and the noble generosity of her disposition would have justified the affection of the most doting father His anxiety on her behalf did not however seem to extend itself in that quarter where according to the general opinion it is most efficiently displayed in labouring namely to establish her in life either by a large dowry or a wealthy marriage By an old settlement almost all the landed estates of the Baron went after his death to a distant relation and it was supposed that Miss Bradwardine would remain but slenderly provided for as the good gentleman s cash matters had been too long under the exclusive charge of Bailie Macwheeble to admit of any great expectations from his personal succession It is true the said Bailie loved his patron and his patron s daughter next though at an incomparable distance to himself He thought it was possible to set aside the settlement on the male line and had actually procured an opinion to that effect and as he boasted without a fee from an eminent Scottish counsel under whose notice he contrived to bring the point while consulting him regularly on some other business But the Baron would not listen to such a proposal for an instant On the contrary he used to have a perverse pleasure in boasting that the barony of Bradwardine was a male fief the first charter having been given at that early period when women were not deemed capable to hold a feudal grant because according to Les coustusmes de Normandie c est l homme ki se bast et ki conseille or as is yet more ungallantly expressed by other authorities all of whose barbarous names he delighted to quote at full length because a woman could not serve the superior or feudal lord in war on account of the decorum of her sex nor assist him with advice because of her limited intellect nor keep his counsel owing to the infirmity of her disposition He would triumphantly ask how it would become a female and that female a Bradwardine to be seen employed in servitio exuendi seu detrahendi caligas regis post battaliam that is in pulling off the king s boots after an engagement which was the feudal service by which he held the barony of Bradwardine No he said beyond hesitation procul dubio many females as worthy as Rose had been excluded in order to make way for my own succession and Heaven forbid that I should do aught that might contravene the destination of my forefathers or impinge upon the right of my kinsman Malcolm Bradwardine of Inchgrabbit an honourable though decayed branch of my own family The Bailie as prime minister having received this decisive communication from his sovereign durst not press his own opinion any farther but contented himself with deploring on all suitable occasions to Saunderson the minister of the interior the laird s self willedness and with laying plans for uniting Rose with the young Laird of Balmawhapple who had a fine estate only moderately burdened and was a faultless young gentleman being as sober as a saint if you keep brandy from him and him from brandy and who in brief had no imperfection but that of keeping light company at a time such as Jinker the horse couper and Gibby Gaethroughwi t the piper o Cupar o whilk follies mister Saunderson he ll mend he ll mend pronounced the Bailie Like sour ale in simmer added Davie Gellatley who happened to be nearer the conclave than they were aware of Miss Bradwardine such as we have described her with all the simplicity and curiosity of a recluse attached herself to the opportunities of increasing her store of literature which Edward s visit afforded her He sent for some of his books from his quarters and they opened to her sources of delight of which she had hitherto had no idea The best English poets of every description and other works on belles lettres made a part of this precious cargo Her music even her flowers were neglected and Saunders not only mourned over but began to mutiny against the labour for which he now scarce received thanks These new pleasures became gradually enhanced by sharing them with one of a kindred taste Edward s readiness to comment to recite to explain difficult passages rendered his assistance invaluable and the wild romance of his spirit delighted a character too young and inexperienced to observe its deficiencies Upon subjects which interested him and when quite at ease he possessed that flow of natural and somewhat florid eloquence which has been supposed as powerful even as figure fashion fame or fortune in winning the female heart There was therefore an increasing danger in this constant intercourse to poor Rose s peace of mind which was the more imminent as her father was greatly too much abstracted in his studies and wrapped up in his own dignity to dream of his daughter s incurring it The daughters of the house of Bradwardine were in his opinion like those of the house of Bourbon or Austria placed high above the clouds of passion which might obfuscate the intellects of meaner females they moved in another sphere were governed by other feelings and amenable to other rules than those of idle and fantastic affection In short he shut his eyes so resolutely to the natural consequences of Edward s intimacy with Miss Bradwardine that the whole neighbourhood concluded that he had opened them to the advantages of a match between his daughter and the wealthy young Englishman and pronounced him much less a fool than he had generally shown himself in cases where his own interest was concerned If the Baron however had really meditated such an alliance the indifference of Waverley would have been an insuperable bar to his project Our hero since mixing more freely with the world had learned to think with great shame and confusion upon his mental legend of Saint Cecilia and the vexation of these reflections was likely for some time at least to counterbalance the natural susceptibility of his disposition Besides Rose Bradwardine beautiful and amiable as we have described her had not precisely the sort of beauty or merit which captivates a romantic imagination in early youth She was too frank too confiding too kind amiable qualities undoubtedly but destructive of the marvellous with which a youth of imagination delights to dress the empress of his affections Was it possible to bow to tremble and to adore before the timid yet playful little girl who now asked Edward to mend her pen now to construe a stanza in Tasso and now how to spell a very very long word in her version of it All these incidents have their fascination on the mind at a certain period of life but not when a youth is entering it and rather looking out for some object whose affection may dignify him in his own eyes than stooping to one who looks up to him for such distinction Hence though there can be no rule in so capricious a passion early love is frequently ambitious in choosing its object or which comes to the same selects her as in the case of Saint Cecilia aforesaid from a situation that gives fair scope for le beau ideal which the reality of intimate and familiar life rather tends to limit and impair I knew a very accomplished and sensible young man cured of a violent passion for a pretty woman whose talents were not equal to her face and figure by being permitted to bear her company for a whole afternoon Thus it is certain that had Edward enjoyed such an opportunity of conversing with Miss Stubbs Aunt Rachel s precaution would have been unnecessary for he would as soon have fallen in love with the dairy maid And although Miss Bradwardine was a very different character it seems probable that the very intimacy of their intercourse prevented his feeling for her other sentiments than those of a brother for an amiable and accomplished sister while the sentiments of poor Rose were gradually and without her being conscious assuming a shade of warmer affection I ought to have said that Edward when he sent to Dundee for the books before mentioned had applied for and received permission extending his leave of absence But the letter of his commanding officer contained a friendly recommendation to him not to spend his time exclusively with persons who estimable as they might be in a general sense could not be supposed well affected to a government which they declined to acknowledge by taking the oath of allegiance The letter further insinuated though with great delicacy that although some family connections might be supposed to render it necessary for Captain Waverley to communicate with gentlemen who were in this unpleasant state of suspicion yet his father s situation and wishes ought to prevent his prolonging those attentions into exclusive intimacy And it was intimated that while his political principles were endangered by communicating with laymen of this description he might also receive erroneous impressions in religion from the prelatic clergy who so perversely laboured to set up the royal prerogative in things sacred This last insinuation probably induced Waverley to set both down to the prejudices of his commanding officer He was sensible that mister Bradwardine had acted with the most scrupulous delicacy in never entering upon any discussion that had the most remote tendency to bias his mind in political opinions although he was himself not only a decided partisan of the exiled family but had been trusted at different times with important commissions for their service Sensible therefore that there was no risk of his being perverted from his allegiance Edward felt as if he should do his uncle s old friend injustice in removing from a house where he gave and received pleasure and amusement merely to gratify a prejudiced and ill judged suspicion He therefore wrote a very general answer assuring his commanding officer that his loyalty was not in the most distant danger of contamination and continued an honoured guest and inmate of the house of Tully Veolan CHAPTER XV A CREAGH AND ITS CONSEQUENCES When Edward had been a guest at Tully Veolan nearly six weeks he descried one morning as he took his usual walk before the breakfast hour signs of uncommon perturbation in the family Four bare legged dairy maids with each an empty milk pail in her hand ran about with frantic gestures and uttering loud exclamations of surprise grief and resentment From their appearance a pagan might have conceived them a detachment of the celebrated Belides just come from their baling penance As nothing was to be got from this distracted chorus excepting Lord guide us and Eh sirs ejaculations which threw no light upon the cause of their dismay Waverley repaired to the fore court as it was called where he beheld Bailie Macwheeble cantering his white pony down the avenue with all the speed it could muster He had arrived it would seem upon a hasty summons and was followed by half a score of peasants from the village who had no great difficulty in keeping pace with him The Bailie greatly too busy and too important to enter into explanations with Edward summoned forth mister Saunderson who appeared with a countenance in which dismay was mingled with solemnity and they immediately entered into close conference Davie Gellatley was also seen in the group idle as Diogenes at Sinope while his countrymen were preparing for a siege His spirits always rose with anything good or bad which occasioned tumult and he continued frisking hopping dancing and singing the burden of an old ballad Our gear s a gane until happening to pass too near the Bailie he received an admonitory hint from his horse whip which converted his songs into lamentation Passing from thence towards the garden Waverley beheld the Baron in person measuring and re measuring with swift and tremendous strides the length of the terrace his countenance clouded with offended pride and indignation and the whole of his demeanour such as seemed to indicate that any inquiry concerning the cause of his discomposure would give pain at least if not offence Waverley therefore glided into the house without addressing him and took his way to the breakfast parlour where he found his young friend Rose who though she neither exhibited the resentment of her father the turbid importance of Bailie Macwheeble nor the despair of the handmaidens seemed vexed and thoughtful A single word explained the mystery Your breakfast will be a disturbed one Captain Waverley A party of Caterans have come down upon us last night and have driven off all our milch cows A party of Caterans Yes robbers from the neighbouring Highlands We used to be quite free from them while we paid blackmail to Fergus Mac Ivor Vich Ian Vohr but my father thought it unworthy of his rank and birth to pay it any longer and so this disaster has happened It is not the value of the cattle Captain Waverley that vexes me but my father is so much hurt at the affront and is so bold and hot that I fear he will try to recover them by the strong hand and if he is not hurt himself he will hurt some of these wild people and then there will be no peace between them and us perhaps for our life time and we cannot defend ourselves as in old times for the government have taken all our arms and my dear father is so rash O what will become of us Here poor Rose lost heart altogether and burst into a flood of tears The Baron entered at this moment and rebuked her with more asperity than Waverley had ever heard him use to any one Was it not a shame he said that she should exhibit herself before any gentleman in such a light as if she shed tears for a drove of horned nolt and milch kine like the daughter of a Cheshire yeoman Captain Waverley I must request your favourable construction of her grief which may or ought to proceed solely from seeing her father s estate exposed to spulzie and depredation from common thieves and sorners while we are not allowed to keep half a score of muskets whether for defence or rescue Bailie Macwheeble entered immediately afterwards and by his report of arms and ammunition confirmed this statement informing the Baron in a melancholy voice that though the people would certainly obey his honour s orders yet there was no chance of their following the gear to ony guid purpose in respect there were only his honour s body servants who had swords and pistols and the depredators were twelve Highlanders completely armed after the manner of their country Having delivered this doleful annunciation he assumed a posture of silent dejection shaking his head slowly with the motion of a pendulum when it is ceasing to vibrate and then remained stationary his body stooping at a more acute angle than usual and the latter part of his person projecting in proportion The Baron meanwhile paced the room in silent indignation and at length fixing his eye upon an old portrait whose person was clad in armour and whose features glared grimly out of a huge bush of hair part of which descended from his head to his shoulders and part from his chin and upper lip to his breast plate That gentleman Captain Waverley my grandsire he said with two hundred horse whom he levied within his own bounds discomfited and put to the rout more than five hundred of these Highland reivers who have been ever lapis offensionis et petra scandali a stumbling block and a rock of offence to the Lowland vicinage he discomfited them I say when they had the temerity to descend to harry this country in the time of the civil dissensions in the year of grace sixteen hundred forty and two And now sir I his grandson am thus used at such unworthy hands Here there was an awful pause after which all the company as is usual in cases of difficulty began to give separate and inconsistent counsel Alexander ab Alexandro proposed they should send some one to compound with the Caterans who would readily he said give up their prey for a dollar a head The Bailie opined that this transaction would amount to theft boot or composition of felony and he recommended that some canny hand should be sent up to the glens to make the best bargain he could as it were for himself so that the Laird might not be seen in such a transaction Edward proposed to send off to the nearest garrison for a party of soldiers and a magistrate s warrant and Rose as far as she dared endeavoured to insinuate the course of paying the arrears of tribute money to Fergus Mac Ivor Vich Ian Vohr who they all knew could easily procure restoration of the cattle if he were properly propitiated None of these proposals met the Baron s approbation The idea of composition direct or implied was absolutely ignominious that of Waverley only showed that he did not understand the state of the country and of the political parties which divided it and standing matters as they did with Fergus Mac Ivor Vich Ian Vohr the Baron would make no concession to him were it he said to procure restitution in integrum of every stirk and stot that the chief his forefathers and his clan had stolen since the days of Malcolm Canmore In fact his voice was still for war and he proposed to send expresses to Balmawhapple Killancureit Tulliellum and other lairds who were exposed to similar depredations inviting them to join in the pursuit and then sir shall these nebulones nequissimi as Leslaeus calls them be brought to the fate of their predecessor Cacus Elisos oculos et siccum sanguine guttur The Bailie who by no means relished these warlike counsels here pulled forth an immense watch of the colour and nearly of the size of a pewter warming pan and observed it was now past noon and that the Caterans had been seen in the pass of Ballybrough soon after sunrise so that before the allied forces could assemble they and their prey would be far beyond the reach of the most active pursuit and sheltered in those pathless deserts where it was neither advisable to follow nor indeed possible to trace them This proposition was undeniable The council therefore broke up without coming to any conclusion as has occurred to councils of more importance only it was determined that the Bailie should send his own three milkcows down to the mains for the use of the Baron s family and brew small ale as a substitute for milk in his own To this arrangement which was suggested by Saunderson the Bailie readily assented both from habitual deference to the family and an internal consciousness that his courtesy would in some mode or other be repaid tenfold The Baron having also retired to give some necessary directions Waverley seized the opportunity to ask whether this Fergus with the unpronounceable name was the chief thief taker of the district Thief taker answered Rose laughing he is a gentleman of great honour and consequence the chieftain of an independent branch of a powerful Highland clan and is much respected both for his own power and that of his kith kin and allies And what has he to do with the thieves then Is he a magistrate or in the commission of the peace asked Waverley The commission of war rather if there be such a thing said Rose for he is a very unquiet neighbour to his unfriends and keeps a greater following on foot than many that have thrice his estate As to his connection with the thieves that I cannot well explain but the boldest of them will never steal a hoof from any one that pays black mail to Vich lan Vohr And what is black mail A sort of protection money that Low Country gentlemen and heritors lying near the Highlands pay to some Highland chief that he may neither do them harm himself nor suffer it to be done to them by others and then if your cattle are stolen you have only to send him word and he will recover them or it may be he will drive away cows from some distant place where he has a quarrel and give them to you to make up your loss Footnote See note thirteen And is this sort of Highland Jonathan Wild admitted into society and called a gentleman So much so said Rose that the quarrel between my father and Fergus Mac Ivor began at a county meeting where he wanted to take precedence of all the Lowland gentlemen then present only my father would not suffer it And then he upbraided my father that he was under his banner and paid him tribute and my father was in a towering passion for Bailie Macwheeble who manages such things his own way had contrived to keep this black mail a secret from him and passed it in his account for cess money And they would have fought but Fergus Mac Ivor said very gallantly he would never raise his hand against a grey head that was so much respected as my father s O I wish I wish they had continued friends And did you ever see this mister Mac Ivor if that be his name Miss Bradwardine No that is not his name and he would consider MASTER as a sort of affront only that you are an Englishman and know no better But the Lowlanders call him like other gentlemen by the name of his estate Glennaquoich and the Highlanders call him Vich Ian Vohr that is the son of John the Great and we upon the braes here call him by both names indifferently I am afraid I shall never bring my English tongue to call him by either one or other But he is a very polite handsome man continued Rose and his sister Flora is one of the most beautiful and accomplished young ladies in this country she was bred in a convent in France and was a great friend of mine before this unhappy dispute Dear Captain Waverley try your influence with my father to make matters up I am sure this is but the beginning of our troubles for Tully Veolan has never been a safe or quiet residence when we have been at feud with the Highlanders When I was a girl about ten there was a skirmish fought between a party of twenty of them and my father and his servants behind the mains and the bullets broke several panes in the north windows they were so near Three of the Highlanders were killed and they brought them in wrapped in their plaids and laid them on the stone floor of the hall and next morning their wives and daughters came clapping their hands and crying the coronach and shrieking and carried away the dead bodies with the pipes playing before them I could not sleep for six weeks without starting and thinking I heard these terrible cries and saw the bodies lying on the steps all stiff and swathed up in their bloody tartans But since that time there came a party from the garrison at Stirling with a warrant from the Lord Justice Clerk or some such great man and took away all our arms and now how are we to protect ourselves if they come down in any strength Waverley could not help starting at a story which bore so much resemblance to one of his own day dreams Here was a girl scarce seventeen the gentlest of her sex both in temper and appearance who had witnessed with her own eyes such a scene as he had used to conjure up in his imagination as only occurring in ancient times and spoke of it coolly as one very likely to recur He felt at once the impulse of curiosity and that slight sense of danger which only serves to heighten its interest He might have said with Malvolio I do not now fool myself to let imagination jade me I am actually in the land of military and romantic adventures and it only remains to be seen what will be my own share in them The whole circumstances now detailed concerning the state of the country seemed equally novel and extraordinary He had indeed often heard of Highland thieves but had no idea of the systematic mode in which their depredations were conducted and that the practice was connived at and even encouraged by many of the Highland chieftains who not only found the creaghs or forays useful for the purpose of training individuals of their clan to the practice of arms but also of maintaining a wholesome terror among their Lowland neighbours and levying as we have seen a tribute from them under colour of protection money Bailie Macwheeble who soon afterwards entered expatiated still more at length upon the same topic This honest gentleman s conversation was so formed upon his professional practice that Davie Gellatley once said his discourse was like a charge of horning He assured our hero that from the maist ancient times of record the lawless thieves limmers and broken men of the Highlands had been in fellowship together by reason of their surnames for the committing of divers thefts reifs and herships upon the honest men of the Low Country when they not only intromitted with their whole goods and gear corn cattle horse nolt sheep outsight and insight plenishing at their wicked pleasure but moreover made prisoners ransomed them or concussed them into giving borrows pledges to enter into captivity again all which was directly prohibited in divers parts of the Statute Book both by the act one thousand five hundred and sixty seven and various others the whilk statutes with all that had followed and might follow thereupon were shamefully broken and vilipended by the said sorners limmers and broken men associated into fellowships for the aforesaid purposes of theft stouthreef fire raising murther raptus mulierum or forcible abduction of women and such like as aforesaid It seemed like a dream to Waverley that these deeds of violence should be familiar to men s minds and currently talked of as falling within the common order of things and happening daily in the immediate vicinity without his having crossed the seas and while he was yet in the otherwise well ordered island of Great Britain CHAPTER XVI AN UNEXPECTED ALLY APPEARS The Baron returned at the dinner hour and had in a great measure recovered his composure and good humour He not only confirmed the stories which Edward had heard from Rose and Bailie Macwheeble but added many anecdotes from his own experience concerning the state of the Highlands and their inhabitants The chiefs he pronounced to be in general gentlemen of great honour and high pedigree whose word was accounted as a law by all those of their own sept or clan It did not indeed he said become them as had occurred in late instances to propone their prosapia a lineage which rested for the most part on the vain and fond rhymes of their seannachies or bhairds as aequiponderate with the evidence of ancient charters and royal grants of antiquity conferred upon distinguished houses in the Low Country by divers Scottish monarchs nevertheless such was their outrecuidance and presumption as to undervalue those who possessed such evidents as if they held their lands in a sheep s skin This by the way pretty well explained the cause of quarrel between the Baron and his Highland ally But he went on to state so many curious particulars concerning the manners customs and habits of this patriarchal race that Edward s curiosity became highly interested and he inquired whether it was possible to make with safety an excursion into the neighbouring Highlands whose dusky barrier of mountains had already excited his wish to penetrate beyond them The Baron assured his guest that nothing would be more easy providing this quarrel were first made up since he could himself give him letters to many of the distinguished chiefs who would receive him with the utmost courtesy and hospitality While they were on this topic the door suddenly opened and ushered by Saunders Saunderson a Highlander fully armed and equipped entered the apartment Had it not been that Saunders acted the part of master of the ceremonies to this martial apparition without appearing to deviate from his usual composure and that neither mister Bradwardine nor Rose exhibited any emotion Edward would certainly have thought the intrusion hostile As it was he started at the sight of what he had not yet happened to see a mountaineer in his full national costume The individual Gael was a stout dark young man of low stature the ample folds of whose plaid added to the appearance of strength which his person exhibited The short kilt or petticoat showed his sinewy and clean made limbs the goatskin purse flanked by the usual defences a dirk and steel wrought pistol hung before him his bonnet had a short feather which indicated his claim to be treated as a duinhe wassel or sort of gentleman a broadsword dangled by his side a target hung upon his shoulder and a long Spanish fowling piece occupied one of his hands With the other hand he pulled off his bonnet and the Baron who well knew their customs and the proper mode of addressing them immediately said with an air of dignity but without rising and much as Edward thought in the manner of a prince receiving an embassy Welcome Evan Dhu Maccombich what news from Fergus Mac Ivor Vich lan Vohr Fergus Mac Ivor Vich lan Vohr said the ambassador in good English greets you well Baron of Bradwardine and Tully Veolan and is sorry there has been a thick cloud interposed between you and him which has kept you from seeing and considering the friendship and alliances that have been between your houses and forebears of old and he prays you that the cloud may pass away and that things may be as they have been heretofore between the clan Ivor and the house of Bradwardine when there was an egg between them for a flint and a knife for a sword And he expects you will also say you are sorry for the cloud and no man shall hereafter ask whether it descended from the bill to the valley or rose from the valley to the hill for they never struck with the scabbard who did not receive with the sword and woe to him who would lose his friend for the stormy cloud of a spring morning To this the Baron of Bradwardine answered with suitable dignity that he knew the chief of Clan Ivor to be a well wisher to the King and he was sorry there should have been a cloud between him and any gentleman of such sound principles for when folks are banding together feeble is he who hath no brother This appearing perfectly satisfactory that the peace between these august persons might be duly solemnised the Baron ordered a stoup of usquebaugh and filling a glass drank to the health and prosperity of Mac Ivor of Glennaquoich upon which the Celtic ambassador to requite his politeness turned down a mighty bumper of the same generous liquor seasoned with his good wishes to the house of Bradwardine Having thus ratified the preliminaries of the general treaty of pacification the envoy retired to adjust with mister Macwheeble some subordinate articles with which it was not thought necessary to trouble the Baron These probably referred to the discontinuance of the subsidy and apparently the Bailie found means to satisfy their ally without suffering his master to suppose that his dignity was compromised At least it is certain that after the plenipotentiaries had drunk a bottle of brandy in single drams which seemed to have no more effect upon such seasoned vessels than if it had been poured upon the two bears at the top of the avenue Evan Dhu Maccombich having possessed himself of all the information which he could procure respecting the robbery of the preceding night declared his intention to set off immediately in pursuit of the cattle which he pronounced to be no that far off they have broken the bone he observed but they have had no time to suck the marrow Our hero who had attended Evan Dhu during his perquisitions was much struck with the ingenuity which he displayed in collecting information and the precise and pointed conclusions which he drew from it Evan Dhu on his part was obviously flattered with the attention of Waverley the interest he seemed to take in his inquiries and his curiosity about the customs and scenery of the Highlands Without much ceremony he invited Edward to accompany him on a short walk of ten or fifteen miles into the mountains and see the place where the cattle were conveyed to adding If it be as I suppose you never saw such a place in your life nor ever will unless you go with me or the like of me Our hero feeling his curiosity considerably excited by the idea of visiting the den of a Highland Cacus took however the precaution to inquire if his guide might be trusted He was assured that the invitation would on no account have been given had there been the least danger and that all he had to apprehend was a little fatigue and as Evan proposed he should pass a day at his Chieftain s house in returning where he would be sure of good accommodation and an excellent welcome there seemed nothing very formidable in the task he undertook Rose indeed turned pale when she heard of it but her father who loved the spirited curiosity of his young friend did not attempt to damp it by an alarm of danger which really did not exist and a knapsack with a few necessaries being bound on the shoulders of a sort of deputy gamekeeper our hero set forth with a fowling piece in his hand accompanied by his new friend Evan Dhu and followed by the gamekeeper aforesaid and by two wild Highlanders the attendants of Evan one of whom had upon his shoulder a hatchet at the end of a pole called a Lochaber axe Footnote See Note fourteen and the other a long ducking gun Evan upon Edward s inquiry gave him to understand that this martial escort was by no means necessary as a guard but merely as he said drawing up and adjusting his plaid with an air of dignity that he might appear decently at Tully Veolan and as Vich Ian Vohr s foster brother ought to do Ah said he if you Saxon duinhe wassel English gentleman saw but the Chief with his tail on With his tail on echoed Edward in some surprise Yes that is with all his usual followers when he visits those of the same rank There is he continued stopping and drawing himself proudly up while he counted upon his fingers the several officers of his chief s retinue there is his hanchman or right hand man then his bard or poet then his bladier or orator to make harangues to the great folks whom he visits then his gilly more or armour bearer to carry his sword and target and his gun then his gilly casfliuch who carries him on his back through the sikes and brooks then his gilly comstrian to lead his horse by the bridle in steep and difficult paths then his gilly trushharnish to carry his knapsack and the piper and the piper s man and it may be a dozen young lads beside that have no business but are just boys of the belt to follow the Laird and do his honour s bidding And does your Chief regularly maintain all these men demanded Waverley All these replied Evan ay and many a fair head beside that would not ken where to lay itself but for the mickle barn at Glennaquoich With similar tales of the grandeur of the Chief in peace and war Evan Dhu beguiled the way till they approached more closely those huge mountains which Edward had hitherto only seen at a distance It was towards evening as they entered one of the tremendous passes which afford communication between the high and low country the path which was extremely steep and rugged winded up a chasm between two tremendous rocks following the passage which a foaming stream that brawled far below appeared to have worn for itself in the course of ages A few slanting beams of the sun which was now setting reached the water in its darksome bed and showed it partially chafed by a hundred rocks and broken by a hundred falls The descent from the path to the stream was a mere precipice with here and there a projecting fragment of granite or a scathed tree which had warped its twisted roots into the fissures of the rock On the right hand the mountain rose above the path with almost equal inaccessibility but the hill on the opposite side displayed a shroud of copsewood with which some pines were intermingled This said Evan is the pass of Bally Brough which was kept in former times by ten of the clan Donnochie against a hundred of the Low Country carles The graves of the slain are still to be seen in that little corrie or bottom on the opposite side of the burn if your eyes are good you may see the green specks among the heather See there is an earn which you Southrons call an eagle You have no such birds as that in England He is going to fetch his supper from the Laird of Bradwardine s braes but I ll send a slug after him He fired his piece accordingly but missed the superb monarch of the feathered tribes who without noticing the attempt to annoy him continued his majestic flight to the southward A thousand birds of prey hawks kites carrion crows and ravens disturbed from the lodgings which they had just taken up for the evening rose at the report of the gun and mingled their hoarse and discordant notes with the echoes which replied to it and with the roar of the mountain cataracts Evan a little disconcerted at having missed his mark when he meant to have displayed peculiar dexterity covered his confusion by whistling part of a pibroch as he reloaded his piece and proceeded in silence up the pass It issued in a narrow glen between two mountains both very lofty and covered with heath The brook continued to be their companion and they advanced up its mazes crossing them now and then on which occasions Evan Dhu uniformly offered the assistance of his attendants to carry over Edward but our hero who had been always a tolerable pedestrian declined the accommodation and obviously rose in his guide s opinion by showing that he did not fear wetting his feet Indeed he was anxious so far as he could without affectation to remove the opinion which Evan seemed to entertain of the effeminacy of the Lowlanders and particularly of the English Through the gorge of this glen they found access to a black bog of tremendous extent full of large pit holes which they traversed with great difficulty and some danger by tracks which no one but a Highlander could have followed The path itself or rather the portion of more solid ground on which the travellers half walked half waded was rough broken and in many places quaggy and unsound Sometimes the ground was so completely unsafe that it was necessary to spring from one hillock to another the space between being incapable of bearing the human weight This was an easy matter to the Highlanders who wore thin soled brogues fit for the purpose and moved with a peculiar springing step but Edward began to find the exercise to which he was unaccustomed more fatiguing than he expected The lingering twilight served to show them through this Serbonian bog but deserted them almost totally at the bottom of a steep and very stony hill which it was the travellers next toilsome task to ascend The night however was pleasant and not dark and Waverley calling up mental energy to support personal fatigue held on his march gallantly though envying in his heart his Highland attendants who continued without a symptom of abated vigour the rapid and swinging pace or rather trot which according to his computation had already brought them fifteen miles upon their journey After crossing this mountain and descending on the other side towards a thick wood Evan Dhu held some conference with his Highland attendants in consequence of which Edward s baggage was shifted from the shoulders of the gamekeeper to those of one of the gillies and the former was sent off with the other mountaineer in a direction different from that of the three remaining travellers On asking the meaning of this separation Waverley was told that the Lowlander must go to a hamlet about three miles off for the night for unless it was some very particular friend Donald Bean Lean the worthy person whom they supposed to be possessed of the cattle did not much approve of strangers approaching his retreat This seemed reasonable and silenced a qualm of suspicion which came across Edward s mind when he saw himself at such a place and such an hour deprived of his only Lowland companion And Evan immediately afterwards added that indeed he himself had better get forward and announce their approach to Donald Bean Lean as the arrival of a sidier roy red soldier might otherwise be a disagreeable surprise And without waiting for an answer in jockey phrase he trotted out and putting himself to a very round pace was out of sight in an instant Waverley was now left to his own meditations for his attendant with the battle axe spoke very little English They were traversing a thick and as it seemed an endless wood of pines and consequently the path was altogether indiscernible in the murky darkness which surrounded them The Highlander however seemed to trace it by instinct without the hesitation of a moment and Edward followed his footsteps as close as he could After journeying a considerable time in silence he could not help asking Was it far to the end of their journey Ta cove was tree four mile but as duinhe wassel was a wee taiglit Donald could tat is might would should send ta curragh This conveyed no information The curragh which was promised might be a man a horse a cart or chaise and no more could be got from the man with the battle axe but a repetition of Aich ay ta curragh But in a short time Edward began to conceive his meaning when issuing from the wood he found himself on the banks of a large river or lake where his conductor gave him to understand they must sit down for a little while The moon which now began to rise showed obscurely the expanse of water which spread before them and the shapeless and indistinct forms of mountains with which it seemed to be surrounded The cool and yet mild air of the summer night refreshed Waverley after his rapid and toilsome walk and the perfume which it wafted from the birch trees Footnote It is not the weeping birch the most common species in the Highlands but the woolly leaved Lowland birch that is distinguished by this fragrance bathed in the evening dew was exquisitely fragrant He had now time to give himself up to the full romance of his situation Here he sate on the banks of an unknown lake under the guidance of a wild native whose language was unknown to him on a visit to the den of some renowned outlaw a second Robin Hood perhaps or Adam o Gordon and that at deep midnight through scenes of difficulty and toil separated from his attendant left by his guide What a variety of incidents for the exercise of a romantic imagination and all enhanced by the solemn feeling of uncertainty at least if not of danger The only circumstance which assorted ill with the rest was the cause of his journey the Baron s milk cows this degrading incident he kept in the background While wrapt in these dreams of imagination his companion gently touched him and pointing in a direction nearly straight across the lake said Yon s ta cove A small point of light was seen to twinkle in the direction in which he pointed and gradually increasing in size and lustre seemed to flicker like a meteor upon the verge of the horizon While Edward watched this phenomenon the distant dash of oars was heard The measured sound approached near and more near and presently a loud whistle was heard in the same direction His friend with the battle axe immediately whistled clear and shrill in reply to the signal and a boat manned with four or five Highlanders pushed for a little inlet near which Edward was sitting He advanced to meet them with his attendant was immediately assisted into the boat by the officious attention of two stout mountaineers and had no sooner seated himself than they resumed their oars and began to row across the lake with great rapidity CHAPTER XVII THE HOLD OF A HIGHLAND ROBBER The party preserved silence interrupted only by the monotonous and murmured chant of a Gaelic song sung in a kind of low recitative by the steersman and by the dash of the oars which the notes seemed to regulate as they dipped to them in cadence The light which they now approached more nearly assumed a broader redder and more irregular splendour It appeared plainly to be a large fire but whether kindled upon an island or the mainland Edward could not determine As he saw it the red glaring orb seemed to rest on the very surface of the lake itself and resembled the fiery vehicle in which the Evil Genius of an Oriental tale traverses land and sea They approached nearer and the light of the fire sufficed to show that it was kindled at the bottom of a huge dark crag or rock rising abruptly from the very edge of the water its front changed by the reflection to dusky red formed a strange and even awful contrast to the banks around which were from time to time faintly and partially illuminated by pallid moonlight The boat now neared the shore and Edward could discover that this large fire amply supplied with branches of pine wood by two figures who in the red reflection of its light appeared like demons was kindled in the jaws of a lofty cavern into which an inlet from the lake seemed to advance and he conjectured which was indeed true that the fire had been lighted as a beacon to the boatmen on their return They rowed right for the mouth of the cave and then shifting their oars permitted the boat to enter in obedience to the impulse which it had received The skiff passed the little point or platform of rock on which the fire was blazing and running about two boats lengths farther stopped where the cavern for it was already arched overhead ascended from the water by five or six broad ledges of rock so easy and regular that they might be termed natural steps At this moment a quantity of water was suddenly flung upon the fire which sunk with a hissing noise and with it disappeared the light it had hitherto afforded Four or five active arms lifted Waverley out of the boat placed him on his feet and almost carried him into the recesses of the cave He made a few paces in darkness guided in this manner and advancing towards a hum of voices which seemed to sound from the centre of the rock at an acute turn Donald Bean Lean and his whole establishment were before his eyes The interior of the cave which here rose very high was illuminated by torches made of pine tree which emitted a bright and bickering light attended by a strong though not unpleasant odour Their light was assisted by the red glare of a large charcoal fire round which were seated five or six armed Highlanders while others were indistinctly seen couched on their plaids in the more remote recesses of the cavern In one large aperture which the robber facetiously called his SPENCE or pantry there hung by the heels the carcasses of a sheep or ewe and two cows lately slaughtered The principal inhabitant of this singular mansion attended by Evan Dhu as master of the ceremonies came forward to meet his guest totally different in appearance and manner from what his imagination had anticipated The profession which he followed the wilderness in which he dwelt the wild warrior forms that surrounded him were all calculated to inspire terror From such accompaniments Waverley prepared himself to meet a stern gigantic ferocious figure such as Salvator would have chosen to be the central object of a group of banditti Footnote See Note fifteen Donald Bean Lean was the very reverse of all these He was thin in person and low in stature with light sandy coloured hair and small pale features from which he derived his agnomen of BEAN or white and although his form was light well proportioned and active he appeared on the whole rather a diminutive and insignificant figure He had served in some inferior capacity in the French army and in order to receive his English visitor in great form and probably meaning in his way to pay him a compliment he had laid aside the Highland dress for the time to put on an old blue and red uniform and a feathered hat in which he was far from showing to advantage and indeed looked so incongruous compared with all around him that Waverley would have been tempted to laugh had laughter been either civil or safe The robber received Captain Waverley with a profusion of French politeness and Scottish hospitality seemed perfectly to know his name and connections and to be particularly acquainted with his uncle s political principles On these he bestowed great applause to which Waverley judged it prudent to make a very general reply Being placed at a convenient distance from the charcoal fire the heat of which the season rendered oppressive a strapping Highland damsel placed before Waverley Evan and Donald Bean three cogues or wooden vessels composed of staves and hoops containing eanaruich Footnote This was the regale presented by Rob Roy to the Laird of Tullibody a sort of strong soup made out of a particular part of the inside of the beeves After this refreshment which though coarse fatigue and hunger rendered palatable steaks roasted on the coals were supplied in liberal abundance and disappeared before Evan Dhu and their host with a promptitude that seemed like magic and astonished Waverley who was much puzzled to reconcile their voracity with what he had heard of the abstemiousness of the Highlanders He was ignorant that this abstinence was with the lower ranks wholly compulsory and that like some animals of prey those who practise it were usually gifted with the power of indemnifying themselves to good purpose when chance threw plenty in their way The whisky came forth in abundance to crown the cheer The Highlanders drank it copiously and undiluted but Edward having mixed a little with water did not find it so palatable as to invite him to repeat the draught Their host bewailed himself exceedingly that he could offer him no wine Had he but known four and twenty hours before he would have had some had it been within the circle of forty miles round him But no gentleman could do more to show his sense of the honour of a visit from another than to offer him the best cheer his house afforded Where there are no bushes there can be no nuts and the way of those you live with is that you must follow He went on regretting to Evan Dhu the death of an aged man Donnacha an Amrigh or Duncan with the Cap a gifted seer who foretold through the second sight visitors of every description who haunted their dwelling whether as friends or foes Is not his son Malcolm taishatr a second sighted person asked Evan Nothing equal to his father replied Donald Bean He told us the other day we were to see a great gentleman riding on a horse and there came nobody that whole day but Shemus Beg the blind harper with his dog Another time he advertised us of a wedding and behold it proved a funeral and on the creagh when he foretold to us we should bring home a hundred head of horned cattle we gripped nothing but a fat bailie of Perth From this discourse he passed to the political and military state of the country and Waverley was astonished and even alarmed to find a person of this description so accurately acquainted with the strength of the various garrisons and regiments quartered north of the Tay He even mentioned the exact number of recruits who had joined Waverley s troop from his uncle s estate and observed they were PRETTY MEN meaning not handsome but stout warlike fellows He put Waverley in mind of one or two minute circumstances which had happened at a general review of the regiment which satisfied him that the robber had been an eye witness of it and Evan Dhu having by this time retired from the conversation and wrapped himself up in his plaid to take some repose Donald asked Edward in a very significant manner whether he had nothing particular to say to him Waverley surprised and somewhat startled at this question from such a character answered he had no motive in visiting him but curiosity to see his extraordinary place of residence Donald Bean Lean looked him steadily in the face for an instant and then said with a significant nod You might as well have confided in me I am as much worthy of trust as either the Baron of Bradwardine or Vich Ian Vohr But you are equally welcome to my house Waverley felt an involuntary shudder creep over him at the mysterious language held by this outlawed and lawless bandit which in despite of his attempts to master it deprived him of the power to ask the meaning of his insinuations A heath pallet with the flowers stuck uppermost had been prepared for him in a recess of the cave and here covered with such spare plaids as could be mustered he lay for some time watching the motions of the other inhabitants of the cavern Small parties of two or three entered or left the place without any other ceremony than a few words in Gaelic to the principal outlaw and when he fell asleep to a tall Highlander who acted as his lieutenant and seemed to keep watch during his repose Those who entered seemed to have returned from some excursion of which they reported the success and went without farther ceremony to the larder where cutting with their dirks their rations from the carcasses which were there suspended they proceeded to broil and eat them at their own pleasure and leisure The liquor was under strict regulation being served out either by Donald himself his lieutenant or the strapping Highland girl aforesaid who was the only female that appeared The allowance of whisky however would have appeared prodigal to any but Highlanders who living entirely in the open air and in a very moist climate can consume great quantities of ardent spirits without the usual baneful effects either upon the brain or constitution At length the fluctuating groups began to swim before the eyes of our hero as they gradually closed nor did he re open them till the morning sun was high on the lake without though there was but a faint and glimmering twilight in the recesses of Uaimh an Ri or the King s Cavern as the abode of Donald Bean Lean was proudly denominated CHAPTER XVIII WAVERLEY PROCEEDS ON HIS JOURNEY When Edward had collected his scattered recollection he was surprised to observe the cavern totally deserted Having arisen and put his dress in some order he looked more accurately round him but all was still solitary If it had not been for the decayed brands of the fire now sunk into grey ashes and the remnants of the festival consisting of bones half burnt and half gnawed and an empty keg or two there remained no traces of Donald and his band When Waverley sallied forth to the entrance of the cave he perceived that the point of rock on which remained the marks of last night s beacon was accessible by a small path either natural or roughly hewn in the rock along the little inlet of water which ran a few yards up into the cavern where as in a wetdock the skiff which brought him there the night before was still lying moored When he reached the small projecting platform on which the beacon had been established he would have believed his further progress by land impossible only that it was scarce probable but what the inhabitants of the cavern had some mode of issuing from it otherwise than by the lake Accordingly he soon observed three or four shelving steps or ledges of rock at the very extremity of the little platform and making use of them as a staircase he clambered by their means around the projecting shoulder of the crag on which the cavern opened and descending with some difficulty on the other side he gained the wild and precipitous shores of a Highland loch about four miles in length and a mile and a half across surrounded by heathy and savage mountains on the crests of which the morning mist was still sleeping Looking back to the place from which he came he could not help admiring the address which had adopted a retreat of such seclusion and secrecy The rock round the shoulder of which he had turned by a few imperceptible notches that barely afforded place for the foot seemed in looking back upon it a huge precipice which barred all further passage by the shores of the lake in that direction There could be no possibility the breadth of the lake considered of descrying the entrance of the narrow and low browed cave from the other side so that unless the retreat had been sought for with boats or disclosed by treachery it might be a safe and secret residence to its garrison as long as they were supplied with provisions Having satisfied his curiosity in these particulars Waverley looked around for Evan Dhu and his attendants who he rightly judged would be at no great distance whatever might have become of Donald Bean Lean and his party whose mode of life was of course liable to sudden migrations of abode Accordingly at the distance of about half a mile he beheld a Highlander Evan apparently angling in the lake with another attending him whom from the weapon which he shouldered he recognised for his friend with the battle axe Much nearer to the mouth of the cave he heard the notes of a lively Gaelic song guided by which in a sunny recess shaded by a glittering birch tree and carpeted with a bank of firm white sand he found the damsel of the cavern whose lay had already reached him busy to the best of her power in arranging to advantage a morning repast of milk eggs barley bread fresh butter and honey comb The poor girl had already made a circuit of four miles that morning in search of the eggs of the meal which baked her cakes and of the other materials of the breakfast being all delicacies which she had to beg or borrow from distant cottagers The followers of Donald Bean Lean used little food except the flesh of the animals which they drove away from the Lowlands bread itself was a delicacy seldom thought of because hard to be obtained and all the domestic accommodations of milk poultry butter et cetera were out of the question in this Scythian camp Yet it must not be omitted that although Alice had occupied a part of the morning in providing those accommodations for her guest which the cavern did not afford she had secured time also to arrange her own person in her best trim Her finery was very simple A short russet coloured jacket and a petticoat of scanty longitude was her whole dress but these were clean and neatly arranged A piece of scarlet embroidered cloth called the snood confined her hair which fell over it in a profusion of rich dark curls The scarlet plaid which formed part of her dress was laid aside that it might not impede her activity in attending the stranger I should forget Alice s proudest ornament were I to omit mentioning a pair of gold ear rings and a golden rosary which her father for she was the daughter of Donald Bean Lean had brought from France the plunder probably of some battle or storm Her form though rather large for her years was very well proportioned and her demeanour had a natural and rustic grace with nothing of the sheepishness of an ordinary peasant The smiles displaying a row of teeth of exquisite whiteness and the laughing eyes with which in dumb show she gave Waverley that morning greeting which she wanted English words to express might have been interpreted by a coxcomb or perhaps by a young soldier who without being such was conscious of a handsome person as meant to convey more than the courtesy of an hostess Nor do I take it upon me to say that the little wild mountaineer would have welcomed any staid old gentleman advanced in life the Baron of Bradwardine for example with the cheerful pains which she bestowed upon Edward s accommodation She seemed eager to place him by the meal which she had so sedulously arranged and to which she now added a few bunches of cranberries gathered in an adjacent morass Having had the satisfaction of seeing him seated at his breakfast she placed herself demurely upon a stone at a few yards distance and appeared to watch with great complacency for some opportunity of serving him Evan and his attendant now returned slowly along the beach the latter bearing a large salmon trout the produce of the morning s sport together with the angling rod while Evan strolled forward with an easy self satisfied and important gait towards the spot where Waverley was so agreeably employed at the breakfast table After morning greetings had passed on both sides and Evan looking at Waverley had said something in Gaelic to Alice which made her laugh yet colour up to her eyes through a complexion well en browned by sun and wind Evan intimated his commands that the fish should be prepared for breakfast A spark from the lock of his pistol produced a light and a few withered fir branches were quickly in flame and as speedily reduced to hot embers on which the trout was broiled in large slices To crown the repast Evan produced from the pocket of his short jerkin a large scallop shell and from under the folds of his plaid a ram s horn full of whisky Of this he took a copious dram observing he had already taken his MORNING with Donald Bean Lean before his departure he offered the same cordial to Alice and to Edward which they both declined With the bounteous air of a lord Evan then proffered the scallop to Dugald Mahony his attendant who without waiting to be asked a second time drank it off with great gusto Evan then prepared to move towards the boat inviting Waverley to attend him Meanwhile Alice had made up in a small basket what she thought worth removing and flinging her plaid around her she advanced up to Edward and with the utmost simplicity taking hold of his hand offered her cheek to his salute dropping at the same time her little curtsy Evan who was esteemed a wag among the mountain fair advanced as if to secure a similar favour but Alice snatching up her basket escaped up the rocky bank as fleetly as a roe and turning round and laughing called something out to him in Gaelic which he answered in the same tone and language then waving her hand to Edward she resumed her road and was soon lost among the thickets though they continued for some time to hear her lively carol as she proceeded gaily on her solitary journey They now again entered the gorge of the cavern and stepping into the boat the Highlander pushed off and taking advantage of the morning breeze hoisted a clumsy sort of sail while Evan assumed the helm directing their course as it appeared to Waverley rather higher up the lake than towards the place of his embarkation on the preceding night As they glided along the silver mirror Evan opened the conversation with a panegyric upon Alice who he said was both CANNY and FENDY and was to the boot of all that the best dancer of a strathspey in the whole strath Edward assented to her praises so far as he understood them yet could not help regretting that she was condemned to such a perilous and dismal life Oich for that said Evan there is nothing in Perthshire that she need want if she ask her father to fetch it unless it be too hot or too heavy But to be the daughter of a cattle stealer a common thief Common thief no such thing Donald Bean Lean never LIFTED less than a drove in his life Do you call him an uncommon thief then No he that steals a cow from a poor widow or a stirk from a cotter is a thief he that lifts a drove from a Sassenach laird is a gentleman drover And besides to take a tree from the forest a salmon from the river a deer from the hill or a cow from a Lowland strath is what no Highlander need ever think shame upon But what can this end in were he taken in such an appropriation To be sure he would DIE FOR THE LAW as many a pretty man has done before him Die for the law Ay that is with the law or by the law be strapped up on the KIND gallows of Crieff Footnote See Note sixteen where his father died and his goodsire died and where I hope he ll live to die himsell if he s not shot or slashed in a creagh You HOPE such a death for your friend Evan And that do I e en would you have me wish him to die on a bundle of wet straw in yon den of his like a mangy tyke But what becomes of Alice then Troth if such an accident were to happen as her father would not need her help ony langer I ken nought to hinder me to marry her mysell Gallantly resolved said Edward but in the meanwhile Evan what has your father in law that shall be if he have the good fortune to be hanged done with the Baron s cattle Oich answered Evan they were all trudging before your lad and Allan Kennedy before the sun blinked ower Ben Lawers this morning and they ll be in the pass of Bally Brough by this time in their way back to the parks of Tully Veolan all but two that were unhappily slaughtered before I got last night to Uaimh an Ri And where are we going Evan if I may be so bold as to ask said Waverley Where would you be ganging but to the Laird s ain house of Glennaquoich Ye would not think to be in his country without ganging to see him It would be as much as a man s life s worth And are we far from Glennaquoich But five bits of miles and Vich Ian Vohr will meet us In about half an hour they reached the upper end of the lake where after landing Waverley the two Highanders drew the boat into a little creek among thick flags and reeds where it lay perfectly concealed The oars they put in another place of concealment both for the use of Donald Bean Lean probably when his occasions should next bring him to that place The travellers followed for some time a delightful opening into the hills down which a little brook found its way to the lake When they had pursued their walk a short distance Waverley renewed his questions about their host of the cavern Does he always reside in that cave Out no it s past the skill of man to tell where he s to be found at a times there s not a dern nook or cove or corrie in the whole country that he s not acquainted with And do others beside your master shelter him My master MY master is in Heaven answered Evan haughtily and then immediately assuming his usual civility of manner but you mean my Chief no he does not shelter Donald Bean Lean nor any that are like him he only allows him with a smile wood and water No great boon I should think Evan when both seem to be very plenty Ah but ye dinna see through it When I say wood and water I mean the loch and the land and I fancy Donald would be put till t if the Laird were to look for him wi threescore men in the wood of Kailychat yonder and if our boats with a score or twa mair were to come down the loch to Uaimh an Ri headed by mysell or ony other pretty man But suppose a strong party came against him from the Low Country would not your Chief defend him Na he would not ware the spark of a flint for him if they came with the law And what must Donald do then He behoved to rid this country of himsell and fall back it may be over the mount upon Letter Scriven And if he were pursued to that place I se warrant he would go to his cousin s at Rannoch Well but if they followed him to Rannoch That quoth Evan is beyond all belief and indeed to tell you the truth there durst not a Lowlander in all Scotland follow the fray a gun shot beyond Bally Brough unless he had the help of the Sidier Dhu Whom do you call so The Sidier Dhu the black soldier that is what they call the independent companies that were raised to keep peace and law in the Highlands Vich Ian Vohr commanded one of them for five years and I was sergeant mysell I shall warrant ye They call them Sidier Dhu because they wear the tartans as they call your men King George s men Sidier Roy or red soldiers Well but when you were in King George s pay Evan you were surely King George s soldiers Troth and you must ask Vich Ian Vohr about that for we are for his king and care not much which o them it is At ony rate nobody can say we are King George s men now when we have not seen his pay this twelve month This last argument admitted of no reply nor did Edward attempt any he rather chose to bring back the discourse to Donald Bean Lean Does Donald confine himself to cattle or does he LIFT as you call it anything else that comes in his way Troth he s nae nice body and he ll just tak onything but most readily cattle horse or live Christians for sheep are slow of travel and inside plenishing is cumbrous to carry and not easy to put away for siller in this country But does he carry off men and women Out ay Did not ye hear him speak o the Perth bailie It cost that body five hundred merks ere he got to the south of Bally Brough And ance Donald played a pretty sport Footnote See Note seventeen There was to be a blythe bridal between the Lady Cramfeezer in the howe o the Mearns she was the auld laird s widow and no sae young as she had been hersell and young Gilliewhackit who had spent his heirship and movables like a gentleman at cock matches bull baitings horse races and the like Now Donald Bean Lean being aware that the bridegroom was in request and wanting to cleik the cunzie that is to hook the siller he cannily carried off Gilliewhackit ae night when he was riding dovering hame wi the malt rather abune the meal and with the help of his gillies he gat him into the hills with the speed of light and the first place he wakened in was the cove of Uaimh an Ri So there was old to do about ransoming the bridegroom for Donald would not lower a farthing of a thousand punds The devil Punds Scottish ye shall understand And the lady had not the siller if she had pawned her gown and they applied to the governor o Stirling castle and to the major o the Black Watch and the governor said it was ower far to the northward and out of his district and the major said his men were gane hame to the shearing and he would not call them out before the victual was got in for all the Cramfeezers in Christendom let alane the Mearns for that it would prejudice the country And in the meanwhile ye ll no hinder Gilliewhackit to take the small pox There was not the doctor in Perth or Stirling would look near the poor lad and I cannot blame them for Donald had been misguggled by ane of these doctors about Paris and he swore he would fling the first into the loch that he catched beyond the pass However some cailliachs that is old women that were about Donald s hand nursed Gilliewhackit sae weel that between the free open air in the cove and the fresh whey deil an he did not recover maybe as weel as if he had been closed in a glazed chamber and a bed with curtains and fed with red wine and white meat And Donald was sae vexed about it that when he was stout and weel he even sent him free home and said he would be pleased with onything they would like to gie him for the plague and trouble which he had about Gilliewhackit to an unkenn d degree And I cannot tell you precisely how they sorted but they agreed sae right that Donald was invited to dance at the wedding in his Highland trews and they said that there was never sae meikle siller clinked in his purse either before or since And to the boot of all that Gilliewhackit said that be the evidence what it liked if he had the luck to be on Donald s inquest he would bring him in guilty of nothing whatever unless it were wilful arson or murder under trust With such bald and disjointed chat Evan went on illustrating the existing state of the Highlands more perhaps to the amusement of Waverley than that of our readers At length after having marched over bank and brae moss and heather Edward though not unacquainted with the Scottish liberality in computing distance began to think that Evan s five miles were nearly doubled His observation on the large measure which the Scottish allowed of their land in comparison to the computation of their money was readily answered by Evan with the old jest The deil take them wha have the least pint stoup Footnote The Scotch are liberal in computing their land and liquor the Scottish pint corresponds to two English quarts As for their coin every one knows the couplet How can the rogues pretend to sense Their pound is only twenty pence And now the report of a gun was heard and a sportsman was seen with his dogs and attendant at the upper end of the glen Shough said Dugald Mahony tat s ta Chief It is not said Evan imperiously Do you think he would come to meet a Sassenach duinhe wassel in such a way as that But as they approached a little nearer he said with an appearance of mortification And it is even he sure enough and he has not his tail on after all there is no living creature with him but Callum Beg In fact Fergus Mac Ivor of whom a Frenchman might have said as truly as of any man in the Highlands Qu il connoit bien ses gens had no idea of raising himself in the eyes of an English young man of fortune by appearing with a retinue of idle Highlanders disproportioned to the occasion He was well aware that such an unnecessary attendance would seem to Edward rather ludicrous than respectable and while few men were more attached to ideas of chieftainship and feudal power he was for that very reason cautious of exhibiting external marks of dignity unless at the time and in the manner when they were most likely to produce an imposing effect Therefore although had he been to receive a brother chieftain he would probably have been attended by all that retinue which Evan described with so much unction he judged it more respectable to advance to meet Waverley with a single attendant a very handsome Highland boy who carried his master s shooting pouch and his broadsword without which he seldom went abroad When Fergus and Waverley met the latter was struck with the peculiar grace and dignity of the Chieftain s figure Above the middle size and finely proportioned the Highland dress which he wore in its simplest mode set off his person to great advantage He wore the trews or close trowsers made of tartan chequed scarlet and white in other particulars his dress strictly resembled Evan s excepting that he had no weapon save a dirk very richly mounted with silver His page as we have said carried his claymore and the fowling piece which he held in his hand seemed only designed for sport He had shot in the course of his walk some young wild ducks as though CLOSE TIME was then unknown the broods of grouse were yet too young for the sportsman His countenance was decidedly Scottish with all the peculiarities of the northern physiognomy but yet had so little of its harshness and exaggeration that it would have been pronounced in any country extremely handsome The martial air of the bonnet with a single eagle s feather as a distinction added much to the manly appearance of his head which was besides ornamented with a far more natural and graceful cluster of close black curls than ever were exposed to sale in Bond Street An air of openness and affability increased the favorable impression derived from this handsome and dignified exterior Yet a skilful physiognomist would have been less satisfied with the countenance on the second than on the first view The eyebrow and upper lip bespoke something of the habit of peremptory command and decisive superiority Even his courtesy though open frank and unconstrained seemed to indicate a sense of personal importance and upon any check or accidental excitation a sudden though transient lour of the eye showed a hasty haughty and vindictive temper not less to be dreaded because it seemed much under its owner s command In short the countenance of the Chieftain resembled a smiling summer s day in which notwithstanding we are made sensible by certain though slight signs that it may thunder and lighten before the close of evening It was not however upon their first meeting that Edward had an opportunity of making these less favourable remarks The Chief received him as a friend of the Baron of Bradwardine with the utmost expression of kindness and obligation for the visit upbraided him gently with choosing so rude an abode as he had done the night before and entered into a lively conversation with him about Donald Bean s housekeeping but without the least hint as to his predatory habits or the immediate occasion of Waverley s visit a topic which as the Chief did not introduce it our hero also avoided While they walked merrily on towards the house of Glennaquoich Evan who now fell respectfully into the rear followed with Callum Beg and Dugald Mahony We shall take the opportunity to introduce the reader to some particulars of Fergus Mac Ivor s character and history which were not completely known to Waverley till after a connection which though arising from a circumstance so casual had for a length of time the deepest influence upon his character actions and prospects But this being an important subject must form the commencement of a new chapter CHAPTER XIX THE CHIEF AND HIS MANSION The ingenious licentiate Francisco de Ubeda when he commenced his history of La Picara Justina Diez which by the way is one of the most rare books of Spanish literature complained of his pen having caught up a hair and forthwith begins with more eloquence than common sense an affectionate expostulation with that useful implement upbraiding it with being the quill of a goose a bird inconstant by nature as frequenting the three elements of water earth and air indifferently and being of course to one thing constant never Now I protest to thee gentle reader that I entirely dissent from Francisco de Ubeda in this matter and hold it the most useful quality of my pen that it can speedily change from grave to gay and from description and dialogue to narrative and character So that if my quill display no other properties of its mother goose than her mutability truly I shall be well pleased and I conceive that you my worthy friend will have no occasion for discontent From the jargon therefore of the Highland gillies I pass to the character of their Chief It is an important examination and therefore like Dogberry we must spare no wisdom The ancestor of Fergus Mac Ivor about three centuries before had set up a claim to be recognised as chief of the numerous and powerful clan to which he belonged the name of which it is unnecessary to mention Being defeated by an opponent who had more justice or at least more force on his side he moved southwards with those who adhered to him in quest of new settlements like a second AEneas The state of the Perthshire Highlands favoured his purpose A great baron in that country had lately become traitor to the crown Ian which was the name of our adventurer united himself with those who were commissioned by the king to chastise him and did such good service that he obtained a grant of the property upon which he and his posterity afterwards resided He followed the king also in war to the fertile regions of England where he employed his leisure hours so actively in raising subsidies among the boors of Northumberland and Durham that upon his return he was enabled to erect a stone tower or fortalice so much admired by his dependants and neighbours that he who had hitherto been called Ian Mac Ivor or John the son of Ivor was thereafter distinguished both in song and genealogy by the high title of Ian nan Chaistel or John of the Tower The descendants of this worthy were so proud of him that the reigning chief always bore the patronymic title of Vich Ian Vohr i e the son of John the Great while the clan at large to distinguish them from that from which they had seceded were denominated Sliochd nan Ivor the race of Ivor The father of Fergus the tenth in direct descent from John of the Tower engaged heart and hand in the insurrection of seventeen fifteen and was forced to fly to France after the attempt of that year in favour of the Stuarts had proved unsuccessful More fortunate than other fugitives he obtained employment in the French service and married a lady of rank in that kingdom by whom he had two children Fergus and his sister Flora The Scottish estate had been forfeited and exposed to sale but was repurchased for a small price in the name of the young proprietor who in consequence came to reside upon his native domains Footnote See Note eighteen It was soon perceived that he possessed a character of uncommon acuteness fire and ambition which as he became acquainted with the state of the country gradually assumed a mixed and peculiar tone that could only have been acquired Sixty Years Since Had Fergus Mac Ivor lived Sixty Years sooner than he did he would in all probability have wanted the polished manner and knowledge of the world which he now possessed and had he lived Sixty Years later his ambition and love of rule would have lacked the fuel which his situation now afforded He was indeed within his little circle as perfect a politician as Castruccio Castracani himself He applied himself with great earnestness to appease all the feuds and dissensions which often arose among other clans in his neighbourhood so that he became a frequent umpire in their quarrels His own patriarchal power he strengthened at every expense which his fortune would permit and indeed stretched his means to the uttermost to maintain the rude and plentiful hospitality which was the most valued attribute of a chieftain For the same reason he crowded his estate with a tenantry hardy indeed and fit for the purposes of war but greatly outnumbering what the soil was calculated to maintain These consisted chiefly of his own clan not one of whom he suffered to quit his lands if he could possibly prevent it But he maintained besides many adventurers from the mother sept who deserted a less warlike though more wealthy chief to do homage to Fergus Mac Ivor Other individuals too who had not even that apology were nevertheless received into his allegiance which indeed was refused to none who were like Poins proper men of their hands and were willing to assume the name of Mac Ivor He was enabled to discipline these forces from having obtained command of one of the independent companies raised by government to preserve the peace of the Highlands While in this capacity he acted with vigour and spirit and preserved great order in the country under his charge He caused his vassals to enter by rotation into his company and serve for a certain space of time which gave them all in turn a general notion of military discipline In his campaigns against the banditti it was observed that he assumed and exercised to the utmost the discretionary power which while the law had no free course in the Highlands was conceived to belong to the military parties who were called in to support it He acted for example with great and suspicious lenity to those freebooters who made restitution on his summons and offered personal submission to himself while he rigorously pursued apprehended and sacrificed to justice all such interlopers as dared to despise his admonitions or commands On the other hand if any officers of justice military parties or others presumed to pursue thieves or marauders through his territories and without applying for his consent and concurrence nothing was more certain than that they would meet with some notable foil or defeat upon which occasions Fergus Mac Ivor was the first to condole with them and after gently blaming their rashness never failed deeply to lament the lawless state of the country These lamentations did not exclude suspicion and matters were so represented to government that our Chieftain was deprived of his military command Footnote See Note nineteen Whatever Fergus Mac Ivor felt on this occasion he had the art of entirely suppressing every appearance of discontent but in a short time the neighbouring country began to feel bad effects from his disgrace Donald Bean Lean and others of his class whose depredations had hitherto been confined to other districts appeared from thenceforward to have made a settlement on this devoted border and their ravages were carried on with little opposition as the Lowland gentry were chiefly Jacobites and disarmed This forced many of the inhabitants into contracts of black mail with Fergus Mac Ivor which not only established him their protector and gave him great weight in all their consultations but moreover supplied funds for the waste of his feudal hospitality which the discontinuance of his pay might have otherwise essentially diminished In following this course of conduct Fergus had a further object than merely being the great man of his neighbourhood and ruling despotically over a small clan From his infancy upward he had devoted himself to the cause of the exiled family and had persuaded himself not only that their restoration to the crown of Britain would be speedy but that those who assisted them would be raised to honour and rank It was with this view that he laboured to reconcile the Highlanders among themselves and augmented his own force to the utmost to be prepared for the first favourable opportunity of rising With this purpose also he conciliated the favour of such Lowland gentlemen in the vicinity as were friends to the good cause and for the same reason having incautiously quarrelled with mister Bradwardine who notwithstanding his peculiarities was much respected in the country he took advantage of the foray of Donald Bean Lean to solder up the dispute in the manner we have mentioned Some indeed surmised that he caused the enterprise to be suggested to Donald on purpose to pave the way to a reconciliation which supposing that to be the case cost the Laird of Bradwardine two good milch cows This zeal in their behalf the House of Stuart repaid with a considerable share of their confidence an occasional supply of louis d or abundance of fair words and a parchment with a huge waxen seal appended purporting to be an earl s patent granted by no less a person than James the Third King of England and Eighth King of Scotland to his right feal trusty and well beloved Fergus Mac Ivor of Glennaquoich in the county of Perth and kingdom of Scotland With this future coronet glittering before his eyes Fergus plunged deeply into the correspondence and plots of that unhappy period and like all such active agents easily reconciled his conscience to going certain lengths in the service of his party from which honour and pride would have deterred him had his sole object been the direct advancement of his own personal interest With this insight into a bold ambitious and ardent yet artful and politic character we resume the broken thread of our narrative The chief and his guest had by this time reached the house of Glennaquoich which consisted of Ian nan Chaistel s mansion a high rude looking square tower with the addition of a lofted house that is a building of two stories constructed by Fergus s grandfather when he returned from that memorable expedition well remembered by the western shires under the name of the Highland Host Upon occasion of this crusade against the Ayrshire Whigs and Covenanters the Vich Ian Vohr of the time had probably been as successful as his predecessor was in harrying Northumberland and therefore left to his posterity a rival edifice as a monument of his magnificence Around the house which stood on an eminence in the midst of a narrow Highland valley there appeared none of that attention to convenience far less to ornament and decoration which usually surrounds a gentleman s habitation An inclosure or two divided by dry stone walls were the only part of the domain that was fenced as to the rest the narrow slips of level ground which lay by the side of the brook exhibited a scanty crop of barley liable to constant depredations from the herds of wild ponies and black cattle that grazed upon the adjacent hills These ever and anon made an incursion upon the arable ground which was repelled by the loud uncouth and dissonant shouts of half a dozen Highland swains all running as if they had been mad and every one hallooing a half starved dog to the rescue of the forage At a little distance up the glen was a small and stunted wood of birch the hills were high and heathy but without any variety of surface so that the whole view was wild and desolate rather than grand and solitary Yet such as it was no genuine descendant of Ian nan Chaistel would have changed the domain for Stow or Blenheim There was a sight however before the gate which perhaps would have afforded the first owner of Blenheim more pleasure than the finest view in the domain assigned to him by the gratitude of his country This consisted of about a hundred Highlanders in complete dress and arms at sight of whom the Chieftain apologised to Waverley in a sort of negligent manner He had forgot he said that he had ordered a few of his clan out for the purpose of seeing that they were in a fit condition to protect the country and prevent such accidents as he was sorry to learn had befallen the Baron of Bradwardine Before they were dismissed perhaps Captain Waverley might choose to see them go through a part of their exercise Edward assented and the men executed with agility and precision some of the ordinary military movements They then practised individually at a mark and showed extraordinary dexterity in the management of the pistol and firelock They took aim standing sitting leaning or lying prostrate as they were commanded and always with effect upon the target Next they paired off for the broadsword exercise and having manifested their individual skill and dexterity united in two bodies and exhibited a sort of mock encounter in which the charge the rally the flight the pursuit and all the current of a heady fight were exhibited to the sound of the great war bagpipe On a signal made by the Chief the skirmish was ended Matches were then made for running wrestling leaping pitching the bar and other sports in which this feudal militia displayed incredible swiftness strength and agility and accomplished the purpose which their Chieftain had at heart by impressing on Waverley no light sense of their merit as soldiers and of the power of him who commanded them by his nod Footnote See Note twenty And what number of such gallant fellows have the happiness to call you leader asked Waverley In a good cause and under a chieftain whom they loved the race of Ivor have seldom taken the field under five hundred claymores But you are aware Captain Waverley that the disarming act passed about twenty years ago prevents their being in the complete state of preparation as in former times and I keep no more of my clan under arms than may defend my own or my friends property when the country is troubled with such men as your last night s landlord and government which has removed other means of defence must connive at our protecting ourselves But with your force you might soon destroy or put down such gangs as that of Donald Bean Lean Yes doubtless and my reward would be a summons to deliver up to General Blakeney at Stirling the few broadswords they have left us there were little policy in that methinks But come captain the sound of the pipes informs me that dinner is prepared Let me have the honour to show you into my rude mansion CHAPTER XX A HIGHLAND FEAST Ere Waverley entered the banqueting hall he was offered the patriarchal refreshment of a bath for the feet which the sultry weather and the morasses he had traversed rendered highly acceptable He was not indeed so luxuriously attended upon this occasion as the heroic travellers in the Odyssey the task of ablution and abstersion being performed not by a beautiful damsel trained To chafe the limb and pour the fragrant oil but by a smoke dried skinny old Highland woman who did not seem to think herself much honoured by the duty imposed upon her but muttered between her teeth Our fathers herds did not feed so near together that I should do you this service A small donation however amply reconciled this ancient handmaiden to the supposed degradation and as Edward proceeded to the hall she gave him her blessing in the Gaelic proverb May the open hand be filled the fullest The hall in which the feast was prepared occupied all the first story of lan nan Chaistel s original erection and a huge oaken table extended through its whole length The apparatus for dinner was simple even to rudeness and the company numerous even to crowding At the head of the table was the Chief himself with Edward and two or three Highland visitors of neighbouring clans the elders of his own tribe wadsetters and tacksmen as they were called who occupied portions of his estate as mortgagers or lessees sat next in rank beneath them their sons and nephews and foster brethren then the officers of the Chief s household according to their order and lowest of all the tenants who actually cultivated the ground Even beyond this long perspective Edward might see upon the green to which a huge pair of folding doors opened a multitude of Highlanders of a yet inferior description who nevertheless were considered as guests and had their share both of the countenance of the entertainer and of the cheer of the day In the distance and fluctuating round this extreme verge of the banquet was a changeful group of women ragged boys and girls beggars young and old large greyhounds and terriers and pointers and curs of low degree all of whom took some interest more or less immediate in the main action of the piece This hospitality apparently unbounded had yet its line of economy Some pains had been bestowed in dressing the dishes of fish game et cetera which were at the upper end of the table and immediately under the eye of the English stranger Lower down stood immense clumsy joints of mutton and beef which but for the absence of pork Footnote See Note twenty one abhorred in the Highlands resembled the rude festivity of the banquet of Penelope s suitors But the central dish was a yearling lamb called a hog in har saint roasted whole It was set upon its legs with a bunch of parsley in its mouth and was probably exhibited in that form to gratify the pride of the cook who piqued himself more on the plenty than the elegance of his master s table The sides of this poor animal were fiercely attacked by the clansmen some with dirks others with the knives which were usually in the same sheath with the dagger so that it was soon rendered a mangled and rueful spectacle Lower down still the victuals seemed of yet coarser quality though sufficiently abundant Broth onions cheese and the fragments of the feast regaled the sons of Ivor who feasted in the open air The liquor was supplied in the same proportion and under similar regulations Excellent claret and champagne were liberally distributed among the Chief s immediate neighbours whisky plain or diluted and strong beer refreshed those who sat near the lower end Nor did this inequality of distribution appear to give the least offence Every one present understood that his taste was to be formed according to the rank which he held at table and consequently the tacksmen and their dependants always professed the wine was too cold for their stomachs and called apparently out of choice for the liquor which was assigned to them from economy Footnote See Note twenty two The bag pipers three in number screamed during the whole time of dinner a tremendous war tune and the echoing of the vaulted roof and clang of the Celtic tongue produced such a Babel of noises that Waverley dreaded his ears would never recover it Mac Ivor indeed apologised for the confusion occasioned by so large a party and pleaded the necessity of his situation on which unlimited hospitality was imposed as a paramount duty These stout idle kinsmen of mine he said account my estate as held in trust for their support and I must find them beef and ale while the rogues will do nothing for themselves but practise the broadsword or wander about the hills shooting fishing hunting drinking and making love to the lasses of the strath But what can I do Captain Waverley everything will keep after its kind whether it be a hawk or a Highlander Edward made the expected answer in a compliment upon his possessing so many bold and attached followers Why yes replied the Chief were I disposed like my father to put myself in the way of getting one blow on the head or two on the neck I believe the loons would stand by me But who thinks of that in the present day when the maxim is Better an old woman with a purse in her hand than three men with belted brands Then turning to the company he proposed the Health of Captain Waverley a worthy friend of his kind neighbour and ally the Baron of Bradwardine He is welcome hither said one of the elders if he come from Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine I say nay to that said an old man who apparently did not mean to pledge the toast I say nay to that While there is a green leaf in the forest there will be fraud in a Comyne There is nothing but honour in the Baron of Bradwardine answered another ancient and the guest that comes hither from him should be welcome though he came with blood on his hand unless it were blood of the race of Ivor The old man whose cup remained full replied There has been blood enough of the race of Ivor on the hand of Bradwardine Ah Ballenkeiroch replied the first you think rather of the flash of the carbine at the mains of Tully Veolan than the glance of the sword that fought for the cause at Preston And well I may answered Ballenkeiroch the flash of the gun cost me a fair haired son and the glance of the sword has done but little for King James The Chieftain in two words of French explained to Waverley that the Baron had shot this old man s son in a fray near Tully Veolan about seven years before and then hastened to remove Ballenkeiroch s prejudice by informing him that Waverley was an Englishman unconnected by birth or alliance with the family of Bradwardine upon which the old gentleman raised the hitherto untasted cup and courteously drank to his health This ceremony being requited in kind the Chieftain made a signal for the pipes to cease and said aloud Where is the song hidden my friends that Mac Murrough cannot find it Mac Murrough the family bhairdh an aged man immediately took the hint and began to chant with low and rapid utterance a profusion of Celtic verses which were received by the audience with all the applause of enthusiasm As he advanced in his declamation his ardour seemed to increase He had at first spoken with his eyes fixed on the ground he now cast them around as if beseeching and anon as if commanding attention and his tones rose into wild and impassioned notes accompanied with appropriate gestures He seemed to Edward who attended to him with much interest to recite many proper names to lament the dead to apostrophise the absent to exhort and entreat and animate those who were present Waverley thought he even discerned his own name and was convinced his conjecture was right from the eyes of the company being at that moment turned towards him simultaneously The ardour of the poet appeared to communicate itself to the audience Their wild and sun burnt countenances assumed a fiercer and more animated expression all bent forward towards the reciter many sprung up and waved their arms in ecstasy and some laid their hands on their swords When the song ceased there was a deep pause while the aroused feelings of the poet and of the hearers gradually subsided into their usual channel The Chieftain who during this scene had appeared rather to watch the emotions which were excited than to partake their high tone of enthusiasm filled with claret a small silver cup which stood by him Give this he said to an attendant to Mac Murrough nan Fonn i e of the songs and when he has drank the juice bid him keep for the sake of Vich Ian Vohr the shell of the gourd which contained it The gift was received by Mac Murrough with profound gratitude he drank the wine and kissing the cup shrouded it with reverence in the plaid which was folded on his bosom He then burst forth into what Edward justly supposed to be an extemporaneous effusion of thanks and praises of his Chief It was received with applause but did not produce the effect of his first poem It was obvious however that the clan regarded the generosity of their Chieftain with high approbation Many approved Gaelic toasts were then proposed of some of which the Chieftain gave his guest the following versions To him that will not turn his back on friend or foe To him that never forsook a comrade To him that never bought or sold justice Hospitality to the exile and broken bones to the tyrant The lads with the kilts Highlanders shoulder to shoulder with many other pithy sentiments of the like nature Edward was particularly solicitous to know the meaning of that song which appeared to produce such effect upon the passions of the company and hinted his curiosity to his host As I observe said the Chieftain that you have passed the bottle during the last three rounds I was about to propose to you to retire to my sister s tea table who can explain these things to you better than I can Although I cannot stint my clan in the usual current of their festivity yet I neither am addicted myself to exceed in its amount nor do I added he smiling keep a Bear to devour the intellects of such as can make good use of them Edward readily assented to this proposal and the Chieftain saying a few words to those around him left the table followed by Waverley As the door closed behind them Edward heard Vich Ian Vohr s health invoked with a wild and animated cheer that expressed the satisfaction of the guests and the depth of their devotion to his service CHAPTER XXI THE CHIEFTAIN S SISTER The drawing room of Flora Mac Ivor was furnished in the plainest and most simple manner for at Glennaquoich every other sort of expenditure was retrenched as much as possible 
5671-24628-0001	train-other-500	for the purpose of maintaining in its full dignity the hospitality of the Chieftain and retaining and multiplying the number of his dependants and adherents But there was no appearance of this parsimony in the dress of the lady herself
5671-24628-0002	train-other-500	which was in texture elegant and even rich and arranged in a manner which partook partly of the Parisian fashion and partly of the more simple dress of the Highlands blended together with great taste Her hair was not disfigured by the art of the friseur
5671-24628-0003	train-other-500	but fell in jetty ringlets on her neck confined only by a circlet richly set with diamonds This peculiarity she adopted in compliance with the Highland prejudices which could not endure that a woman s head should be covered before wedlock
5671-24628-0004	train-other-500	Flora Mac Ivor bore a most striking resemblance to her brother Fergus
none	none	 so much so that they might have played Viola and Sebastian with the same exquisite effect produced by the appearance of missus Henry Siddons 
5671-24628-0005	train-other-500	and her brother mister William Murray in these characters They had the same antique and regular correctness of profile the same dark eyes eye lashes and eye brows the same clearness of complexion
5671-24628-0006	train-other-500	excepting that Fergus s was embrowned by exercise and Flora s possessed the utmost feminine delicacy But the haughty and somewhat stern regularity of Fergus s features was beautifully softened in those of Flora Their voices were also similar in tone though differing in the key
none	none	 That of Fergus especially while issuing orders to his followers during their military exercise reminded Edward of a favourite passage in the description of Emetrius whose voice was heard around Loud as a trumpet with a silver sound That of Flora on the contrary was soft and sweet an excellent thing in woman yet in urging any favourite topic which she often pursued with natural eloquence it possessed as well the tones which impress awe and conviction as those of persuasive insinuation 
5671-24628-0008	train-other-500	The eager glance of the keen black eye
none	none	 which in the Chieftain seemed impatient even of the material obstacles it encountered 
5671-24628-0009	train-other-500	had in his sister acquired a gentle pensiveness His looks seemed to seek glory
none	none	 power all that could exalt him above others in the race of humanity while those of his sister as if she were already conscious of mental superiority seemed to pity rather than envy those who were struggling for any farther distinction Her sentiments corresponded with the expression of her countenance 
5671-24628-0010	train-other-500	Early education had impressed upon her mind as well as on that of the Chieftain the most devoted attachment to the exiled family of Stuart She believed it the duty of her brother of his clan of every man in Britain
5671-24628-0011	train-other-500	at whatever personal hazard to contribute to that restoration which the partisans of the Chevalier saint George had not ceased to hope for For this she was prepared to do all to suffer all to sacrifice all
none	none	 But her loyalty as it exceeded her brother s in fanaticism 
5671-24628-0012	train-other-500	excelled it also in purity Accustomed to petty intrigue and necessarily involved in a thousand paltry and selfish discussions ambitious also by nature his political faith was tinctured at least if not tainted
5671-24628-0013	train-other-500	by the views of interest and advancement so easily combined with it and at the moment he should unsheathe his claymore
none	none	 it might be difficult to say whether it would be most with the view of making James Stuart a king or Fergus Mac Ivor an earl 
5671-24628-0014	train-other-500	This indeed was a mixture of feeling which he did not avow even to himself but it existed nevertheless
none	none	 in a powerful degree 
5671-24628-0015	train-other-500	In Flora s bosom on the contrary the zeal of loyalty burnt pure and unmixed with any selfish feeling she would have as soon made religion the mask of ambitious and interested views as have shrouded them under the opinions
5671-24628-0016	train-other-500	which she had been taught to think patriotism Such instances of devotion were not uncommon among the followers of the unhappy race of Stuart of which many memorable proofs will recur to the minds of most of my readers
none	none	 But peculiar attention on the part of the Chevalier de saint George and his princess to the parents of Fergus and his sister 
5671-24628-0017	train-other-500	and to themselves when orphans had riveted their faith Fergus upon the death of his parents had been for some time a page of honour in the train of the Chevalier s lady and from his beauty and sprightly temper was uniformly treated
5671-24628-0018	train-other-500	by her with the utmost distinction This was also extended to Flora who was maintained for some time at a convent of the first order at the princess s expense and removed from thence into her own family where she spent nearly two years
5671-24628-0019	train-other-500	Both brother and sister retained the deepest and most grateful sense of her kindness Having thus touched upon the leading principle of Flora s character I may dismiss the rest more slightly She was highly accomplished and had acquired those elegant manners to be expected from one
5671-24628-0020	train-other-500	who in early youth had been the companion of a princess yet she had not learned to substitute the gloss of politeness for the reality of feeling When settled in the lonely regions of Glennaquoich she found that her resources in French English and Italian literature
none	none	 were likely to be few and interrupted and in order to fill up the vacant time she bestowed a part of it upon the music and poetical traditions of the Highlanders and began really to feel the pleasure in the pursuit which her brother 
5671-24628-0021	train-other-500	whose perceptions of literary merit were more blunt rather affected for the sake of popularity than actually experienced Her resolution was strengthened in these researches by the extreme delight which her inquiries seemed to afford those to whom she resorted for information
5671-24628-0022	train-other-500	Her love of her clan an attachment which was almost hereditary in her bosom was like her loyalty a more pure passion than that of her brother He was too thorough a politician
5671-24628-0023	train-other-500	regarded his patriarchal influence too much as the means of accomplishing his own aggrandisement that we should term him the model of a Highland Chieftain Flora felt the same anxiety for cherishing and extending their patriarchal sway
none	none	 but it was with the generous desire of vindicating from poverty or at least from want and foreign oppression those whom her brother was by birth according to the notions of the time and country entitled to govern 
5671-24628-0024	train-other-500	The savings of her income for she had a small pension from the Princess Sobieski were dedicated not to add to the comforts of the peasantry for that was a word which they neither knew nor apparently wished to know but to relieve their absolute necessities when in sickness or extreme old age
5671-24628-0025	train-other-500	At every other period they rather toiled to procure something which they might share with the Chief as a proof of their attachment than expected other assistance from him save what was afforded by the rude hospitality of his castle and the general division and subdivision of his estate among them
5671-24628-0026	train-other-500	Flora was so much beloved by them that when Mac Murrough composed a song in which he enumerated all the principal beauties of the district and intimated her superiority by concluding that the fairest apple hung on the highest bough
none	none	 he received in donatives from the individuals of the clan 
5671-24628-0027	train-other-500	more seed barley than would have sowed his Highland Parnassus the bard s croft as it was called ten times over From situation as well as choice Miss Mac Ivor s society was extremely limited Her most intimate friend had been Rose Bradwardine
5671-24628-0028	train-other-500	to whom she was much attached and when seen together they would have afforded an artist two admirable subjects for the gay and the melancholy muse Indeed Rose was so tenderly watched by her father and her circle of wishes was so limited
5671-24628-0029	train-other-500	that none arose but what he was willing to gratify and scarce any which did not come within the compass of his power With Flora it was otherwise While almost a girl she had undergone the most complete change of scene from gaiety and splendour to absolute solitude and comparative poverty
none	none	 and the ideas and wishes which she chiefly fostered respected great national events and changes not to be brought round without both hazard and bloodshed and therefore not to be thought of with levity Her manner consequently was grave though she readily contributed her talents to the amusement of society 
5671-24628-0030	train-other-500	and stood very high in the opinion of the old Baron who used to sing along with her such French duets of Lindor and Cloris et cetera
none	none	 as were in fashion about the end of the reign of old Louis le Grand 
5671-24628-0031	train-other-500	It was generally believed though no one durst have hinted it to the Baron of Bradwardine that Flora s entreaties had no small share in allaying the wrath of Fergus upon occasion of their quarrel She took her brother on the assailable side
none	none	 by dwelling first upon the Baron s age and then representing the injury which the cause might sustain and the damage which must arise to his own character in point of prudence so necessary to a political agent if he persisted in carrying it to extremity Otherwise it is probable it would have terminated in a duel 
5671-24628-0032	train-other-500	both because the Baron had on a former occasion shed blood of the clan though the matter had been timely accommodated and on account of his high reputation for address at his weapon which Fergus almost condescended to envy
5671-24628-0033	train-other-500	For the same reason she had urged their reconciliation which the Chieftain the more readily agreed to as it favoured some ulterior projects of his own
none	none	 To this young lady now presiding at the female empire of the tea table Fergus introduced Captain Waverley whom she received with the usual forms of politeness CHAPTER XXII HIGHLAND MINSTRELSY When the first salutations had passed Fergus said to his sister My dear Flora before I return to the barbarous ritual of our forefathers I must tell you that Captain Waverley is a worshipper of the Celtic muse not the less so perhaps that he does not understand a word of her language I have told him you are eminent as a translator of Highland poetry and that Mac Murrough admires your version of his songs upon the same principle that Captain Waverley admires the original because he does not comprehend them Will you have the goodness to read or recite to our guest in English the extraordinary string of names which Mac Murrough has tacked together in Gaelic My life to a moor fowl s feather you are provided with a version for I know you are in all the bard s councils and acquainted with his songs long before he rehearses them in the hall How can you say so Fergus You know how little these verses can possibly interest an English stranger even if I could translate them as you pretend Not less than they interest me lady fair To day your joint composition for I insist you had a share in it has cost me the last silver cup in the castle and I suppose will cost me something else next time I hold cour pleniere if the muse descends on Mac Murrough for you know our proverb When the hand of the chief ceases to bestow the breath of the bard is frozen in the utterance Well I would it were even so there are three things that are useless to a modern Highlander a sword which he must not draw a bard to sing of deeds which he dare not imitate and a large goat skin purse without a louis d or to put into it Well brother since you betray my secrets you cannot expect me to keep yours I assure you Captain Waverley that Fergus is too proud to exchange his broadsword for a marechal s baton that he esteems Mac Murrough a far greater poet than Homer and would not give up his goat skin purse for all the louis d or which it could contain Well pronounced Flora blow for blow as Conan Footnote See Note twenty three said to the devil Now do you two talk of bards and poetry if not of purses and claymores while I return to do the final honours to the senators of the tribe of Ivor So saying he left the room The conversation continued between Flora and Waverley for two well dressed young women whose character seemed to hover between that of companions and dependants took no share in it They were both pretty girls but served only as foils to the grace and beauty of their patroness The discourse followed the turn which the Chieftain had given it and Waverley was equally amused and surprised with the account which the lady gave him of Celtic poetry The recitation she said of poems recording the feats of heroes the complaints of lovers and the wars of contending tribes forms the chief amusement of a winter fire side in the Highlands Some of these are said to be very ancient and if they are ever translated into any of the languages of civilised Europe cannot fail to produce a deep and general sensation Others are more modern the composition of those family bards whom the chieftains of more distinguished name and power retain as the poets and historians of their tribes These of course possess various degrees of merit but much of it must evaporate in translation or be lost on those who do not sympathise with the feelings of the poet And your bard whose effusions seemed to produce such effect upon the company to day is he reckoned among the favourite poets of the mountains That is a trying question His reputation is high among his countrymen and you must not expect me to depreciate it Footnote The Highland poet almost always was an improvisatore Captain Burt met one of them at Lovat s table But the song Miss Mac Ivor seemed to awaken all those warriors both young and old The song is little more than a catalogue of names of the Highland clans under their distinctive peculiarities and an exhortation to them to remember and to emulate the actions of their forefathers And am I wrong in conjecturing however extraordinary the guess appears that there was some allusion to me in the verses which he recited You have a quick observation Captain Waverley which in this instance has not deceived you The Gaelic language being uncommonly vocalic is well adapted for sudden and extemporaneous poetry and a bard seldom fails to augment the effects of a premeditated song by throwing in any stanzas which may be suggested by the circumstances attending the recitation I would give my best horse to know what the Highland bard could find to say of such an unworthy Southron as myself It shall not even cost you a lock of his mane Una mavourneen She spoke a few words to one of the young girls in attendance who instantly curtsied and tripped out of the room I have sent Una to learn from the bard the expressions he used and you shall command my skill as dragoman Una returned in a few minutes and repeated to her mistress a few lines in Gaelic Flora seemed to think for a moment and then slightly colouring she turned to Waverley It is impossible to gratify your curiosity Captain Waverley without exposing my own presumption If you will give me a few moments for consideration I will endeavour to engraft the meaning of these lines upon a rude English translation which I have attempted of a part of the original The duties of the tea table seem to be concluded and as the evening is delightful Una will show you the way to one of my favourite haunts and Cathleen and I will join you there Una having received instructions in her native language conducted Waverley out by a passage different from that through which he had entered the apartment At a distance he heard the hall of the Chief still resounding with the clang of bagpipes and the high applause of his guests Having gained the open air by a postern door they walked a little way up the wild bleak and narrow valley in which the house was situated following the course of the stream that winded through it In a spot about a quarter of a mile from the castle two brooks which formed the little river had their junction The larger of the two came down the long bare valley which extended apparently without any change or elevation of character as far as the hills which formed its boundary permitted the eye to reach But the other stream which had its source among the mountains on the left hand of the strath seemed to issue from a very narrow and dark opening betwixt two large rocks These streams were different also in character The larger was placid and even sullen in its course wheeling in deep eddies or sleeping in dark blue pools but the motions of the lesser brook were rapid and furious issuing from between precipices like a maniac from his confinement all foam and uproar It was up the course of this last stream that Waverley like a knight of romance was conducted by the fair Highland damsel his silent guide A small path which had been rendered easy in many places for Flora s accommodation led him through scenery of a very different description from that which he had just quitted Around the castle all was cold bare and desolate yet tame even in desolation but this narrow glen at so short a distance seemed to open into the land of romance The rocks assumed a thousand peculiar and varied forms In one place a crag of huge size presented its gigantic bulk as if to forbid the passenger s farther progress and it was not until he approached its very base that Waverley discerned the sudden and acute turn by which the pathway wheeled its course around this formidable obstacle In another spot the projecting rocks from the opposite sides of the chasm had approached so near to each other that two pine trees laid across and covered with turf formed a rustic bridge at the height of at least one hundred and fifty feet It had no ledges and was barely three feet in breadth While gazing at this pass of peril which crossed like a single black line the small portion of blue sky not intercepted by the projecting rocks on either side it was with a sensation of horror that Waverley beheld Flora and her attendant appear like inhabitants of another region propped as it were in mid air upon this trembling structure She stopped upon observing him below and with an air of graceful ease which made him shudder waved her handkerchief to him by way of signal He was unable from the sense of dizziness which her situation conveyed to return the salute and was never more relieved than when the fair apparition passed on from the precarious eminence which she seemed to occupy with so much indifference and disappeared on the other side Advancing a few yards and passing under the bridge which he had viewed with so much terror the path ascended rapidly from the edge of the brook and the glen widened into a sylvan amphitheatre waving with birch young oaks and hazels with here and there a scattered yew tree The rocks now receded but still showed their grey and shaggy crests rising among the copse wood Still higher rose eminences and peaks some bare some clothed with wood some round and purple with heath and others splintered into rocks and crags At a short turning the path which had for some furlongs lost sight of the brook suddenly placed Waverley in front of a romantic waterfall It was not so remarkable either for great height or quantity of water as for the beautiful accompaniments which made the spot interesting After a broken cataract of about twenty feet the stream was received in a large natural basin filled to the brim with water which where the bubbles of the fall subsided was so exquisitely clear that although it was of great depth the eye could discern each pebble at the bottom Eddying round this reservoir the brook found its way as if over a broken part of the ledge and formed a second fall which seemed to seek the very abyss then wheeling out beneath from among the smooth dark rocks which it had polished for ages it wandered murmuring down the glen forming the stream up which Waverley had just ascended Footnote See Note twenty four The borders of this romantic reservoir corresponded in beauty but it was beauty of a stern and commanding cast as if in the act of expanding into grandeur Mossy banks of turf were broken and interrupted by huge fragments of rock and decorated with trees and shrubs some of which had been planted under the direction of Flora but so cautiously that they added to the grace without diminishing the romantic wildness of the scene Here like one of those lovely forms which decorate the landscapes of Poussin Waverley found Flora gazing on the waterfall Two paces further back stood Cathleen holding a small Scottish harp the use of which had been taught to Flora by Rory Dall one of the last harpers of the Western Highlands The sun now stooping in the west gave a rich and varied tinge to all the objects which surrounded Waverley and seemed to add more than human brilliancy to the full expressive darkness of Flora s eye exalted the richness and purity of her complexion and enhanced the dignity and grace of her beautiful form Edward thought he had never even in his wildest dreams imagined a figure of such exquisite and interesting loveliness The wild beauty of the retreat bursting upon him as if by magic augmented the mingled feeling of delight and awe with which he approached her like a fair enchantress of Boiardo or Ariosto by whose nod the scenery around seemed to have been created an Eden in the wilderness Flora like every beautiful woman was conscious of her own power and pleased with its effects which she could easily discern from the respectful yet confused address of the young soldier But as she possessed excellent sense she gave the romance of the scene and other accidental circumstances full weight in appreciating the feelings with which Waverley seemed obviously to be impressed and unacquainted with the fanciful and susceptible peculiarities of his character considered his homage as the passing tribute which a woman of even inferior charms might have expected in such a situation She therefore quietly led the way to a spot at such a distance from the cascade that its sound should rather accompany than interrupt that of her voice and instrument and sitting down upon a mossy fragment of rock she took the harp from Cathleen I have given you the trouble of walking to this spot Captain Waverley both because I thought the scenery would interest you and because a Highland song would suffer still more from my imperfect translation were I to introduce it without its own wild and appropriate accompaniments To speak in the poetical language of my country the seat of the Celtic Muse is in the mist of the secret and solitary hill and her voice in the murmur of the mountain stream He who woos her must love the barren rock more than the fertile valley and the solitude of the desert better than the festivity of the hall Few could have heard this lovely woman make this declaration with a voice where harmony was exalted by pathos without exclaiming that the muse whom she invoked could never find a more appropriate representative But Waverley though the thought rushed on his mind found no courage to utter it Indeed the wild feeling of romantic delight with which he heard the few first notes she drew from her instrument amounted almost to a sense of pain He would not for worlds have quitted his place by her side yet he almost longed for solitude that he might decipher and examine at leisure the complication of emotions which now agitated his bosom Flora had exchanged the measured and monotonous recitative of the bard for a lofty and uncommon Highland air which had been a battle song in former ages A few irregular strains introduced a prelude of a wild and peculiar tone which harmonised well with the distant waterfall and the soft sigh of the evening breeze in the rustling leaves of an aspen which overhung the seat of the fair harpress The following verses convey but little idea of the feelings with which so sung and accompanied they were heard by Waverley There is mist on the mountain and night on the vale But more dark is the sleep of the sons of the Gael A stranger commanded it sunk on the land It has frozen each heart and benumb d every hand The dirk and the target lie sordid with dust The bloodless claymore is but redden d with rust On the hill or the glen if a gun should appear It is only to war with the heath cock or deer The deeds of our sires if our bards should rehearse Let a blush or a blow be the meed of their verse Be mute every string and be hush d every tone That shall bid us remember the fame that is flown But the dark hours of night and of slumber are past The morn on our mountains is dawning at last Glenaladale s peaks are illumined with the rays And the streams of Glenfinnan leap bright in the blaze Footnote The young and daring adventurer Charles Edward landed at Glenaladale in Moidart and displayed his standard in the valley of Glenfinnan mustering around it the Mac Donalds the Camerons and other less numerous clans whom he had prevailed on to join him There is a monument erected on the spot with a Latin inscription by the late Doctor Gregory O high minded Moray the exiled the dear In the blush of the dawning the STANDARD uprear Wide wide on the winds of the north let it fly Like the sun s latest flash when the tempest is nigh Footnote The Marquis of Tullibardine s elder brother who long exiled returned to Scotland with Charles Edward in seventeen forty five Ye sons of the strong when that dawning shall break Need the harp of the aged remind you to wake That dawn never beam d on your forefathers eye But it roused each high chieftain to vanquish or die O sprung from the Kings who in Islay kept state Proud chiefs of Clan Ranald Glengarry and Sleat Combine like three streams from one mountain of snow And resistless in union rush down on the foe True son of Sir Evan undaunted Lochiel Place thy targe on thy shoulder and burnish thy steel Rough Keppoch give breath to thy bugle s bold swell Till far Coryarrick resound to the knell Stern son of Lord Kenneth high chief of Kintail Let the stag in thy standard bound wild in the gale May the race of Clan Gillean the fearless and free Remember Glenlivat Harlaw and Dundee Let the clan of grey Fingon whose offspring has given Such heroes to earth and such martyrs to heaven Unite with the race of renown d Rorri More To launch the long galley and stretch to the oar How Mac Shimei will joy when their chief shall display The yew crested bonnet o er tresses of grey How the race of wrong d Alpine and murder d Glencoe Shall shout for revenge when they pour on the foe Ye sons of brown Dermid who slew the wild boar Resume the pure faith of the great Callum More Mac Neil of the islands and Moy of the Lake For honour for freedom for vengeance awake Here a large greyhound bounding up the glen jumped upon Flora and interrupted her music by his importunate caresses At a distant whistle he turned and shot down the path again with the rapidity of an arrow That is Fergus s faithful attendant Captain Waverley and that was his signal He likes no poetry but what is humorous and comes in good time to interrupt my long catalogue of the tribes whom one of your saucy English poets calls Our bootless host of high born beggars Mac Leans Mac Kenzies and Mac Gregors Waverley expressed his regret at the interruption O you cannot guess how much you have lost The bard as in duty bound has addressed three long stanzas to Vich Ian Vohr of the Banners enumerating all his great properties and not forgetting his being a cheerer of the harper and bard a giver of bounteous gifts Besides you should have heard a practical admonition to the fair haired son of the stranger who lives in the land where the grass is always green the rider on the shining pampered steed whose hue is like the raven and whose neigh is like the scream of the eagle for battle This valiant horseman is affectionately conjured to remember that his ancestors were distinguished by their loyalty as well as by their courage All this you have lost but since your curiosity is not satisfied I judge from the distant sound of my brother s whistle I may have time to sing the concluding stanzas before he comes to laugh at my translation Awake on your hills on your islands awake Brave sons of the mountain the frith and the lake T is the bugle but not for the chase is the call T is the pibroch s shrill summons but not to the hall T is the summons of heroes for conquest or death When the banners are blazing on mountain and heath They call to the dirk the claymore and the targe To the march and the muster the line and the charge Be the brand of each chieftain like Fin s in his ire May the blood through his veins flow like currents of fire Burst the base foreign yoke as your sires did of yore Or die like your sires and endure it no more CHAPTER XXIII WAVEELEY CONTINUES AT GLENNAQUOICH As Flora concluded her song Fergus stood before them I knew I should find you here even without the assistance of my friend Bran A simple and unsublimed taste now like my own would prefer a jet d eau at Versailles to this cascade with all its accompaniments of rock and roar but this is Flora s Parnassus Captain Waverley and that fountain her Helicon It would be greatly for the benefit of my cellar if she could teach her coadjutor Mac Murrough the value of its influence he has just drunk a pint of usquebaugh to correct he said the coldness of the claret Let me try its virtues He sipped a little water in the hollow of his hand and immediately commenced with a theatrical air O Lady of the desert hail That lovest the harping of the Gael Through fair and fertile regions borne Where never yet grew grass or corn But English poetry will never succeed under the influence of a Highland Helicon Allons courage O vous qui buvez a tasse pleine A cette heureuse fontaine Ou on ne voit sur le rivage Que quelques vilains troupeaux Suivis de nymphes de village Qui les escortent sans sabots A truce dear Fergus spare us those most tedious and insipid persons of all Arcadia Do not for Heaven s sake bring down Coridon and Lindor upon us Nay if you cannot relish la houlette et le chalumeau have with you in heroic strains Dear Fergus you have certainly partaken of the inspiration of Mac Murrough s cup rather than of mine I disclaim it ma belle demoiselle although I protest it would be the more congenial of the two Which of your crack brained Italian romancers is it that says Io d Elicona niente Mi curo in fe de Dio che l bere d acque Bea chi ber ne vuol sempre mi spiacque Footnote Good sooth I reck nought of your Helicon Drink water whoso will in faith I will drink none But if you prefer the Gaelic Captain Waverley here is little Cathleen shall sing you Drimmindhu Come Cathleen astore i e my dear begin no apologies to the cean kinne Cathleen sung with much liveliness a little Gaelic song the burlesque elegy of a countryman on the loss of his cow the comic tones of which though he did not understand the language made Waverley laugh more than once Footnote This ancient Gaelic ditty is still well known both in the Highlands and in Ireland It was translated into English and published if I mistake not under the auspices of the facetious Tom D Urfey by the title of Colley my Cow Admirable Cathleen cried the Chieftain I must find you a handsome husband among the clansmen one of these days Cathleen laughed blushed and sheltered herself behind her companion In the progress of their return to the castle the Chieftain warmly pressed Waverley to remain for a week or two in order to see a grand hunting party in which he and some other Highland gentlemen proposed to join The charms of melody and beauty were too strongly impressed in Edward s breast to permit his declining an invitation so pleasing It was agreed therefore that he should write a note to the Baron of Bradwardine expressing his intention to stay a fortnight at Glennaquoich and requesting him to forward by the bearer a gilly of the Chieftain s any letters which might have arrived for him This turned the discourse upon the Baron whom Fergus highly extolled as a gentleman and soldier His character was touched with yet more discrimination by Flora who observed he was the very model of the old Scottish cavalier with all his excellencies and peculiarities It is a character Captain Waverley which is fast disappearing for its best point was a self respect which was never lost sight of till now But in the present time the gentlemen whose principles do not permit them to pay court to the existing government are neglected and degraded and many conduct themselves accordingly and like some of the persons you have seen at Tully Veolan adopt habits and companions inconsistent with their birth and breeding The ruthless proscription of party seems to degrade the victims whom it brands however unjustly But let us hope a brighter day is approaching when a Scottish country gentleman may be a scholar without the pedantry of our friend the Baron a sportsman without the low habits of mister Falconer and a judicious improver of his property without becoming a boorish two legged steer like Killancureit Thus did Flora prophesy a revolution which time indeed has produced but in a manner very different from what she had in her mind The amiable Rose was next mentioned with the warmest encomium on her person manners and mind That man said Flora will find an inestimable treasure in the affections of Rose Bradwardine who shall be so fortunate as to become their object Her very soul is in home and in the discharge of all those quiet virtues of which home is the centre Her husband will be to her what her father now is the object of all her care solicitude and affection She will see nothing and connect herself with nothing but by him and through him If he is a man of sense and virtue she will sympathise in his sorrows divert his fatigue and share his pleasures If she becomes the property of a churlish or negligent husband she will suit his taste also for she will not long survive his unkindness And alas how great is the chance that some such unworthy lot may be that of my poor friend O that I were a queen this moment and could command the most amiable and worthy youth of my kingdom to accept happiness with the hand of Rose Bradwardine I wish you would command her to accept mine en attendant said Fergus laughing I don t know by what caprice it was that this wish however jocularly expressed rather jarred on Edward s feelings notwithstanding his growing inclination to Flora and his indifference to Miss Bradwardine This is one of the inexplicabilities of human nature which we leave without comment Yours brother answered Flora regarding him steadily No you have another bride Honour and the dangers you must run in pursuit of her rival would break poor Rose s heart With this discourse they reached the castle and Waverley soon prepared his despatches for Tully Veolan As he knew the Baron was punctilious in such matters he was about to impress his billet with a seal on which his armorial bearings were engraved but he did not find it at his watch and thought he must have left it at Tully Veolan He mentioned his loss borrowing at the same time the family seal of the Chieftain Surely said Miss Mac Ivor Donald Bean Lean would not My life for him in such circumstances answered her brother besides he would never have left the watch behind After all Fergus said Flora and with every allowance I am surprised you can countenance that man I countenance him This kind sister of mine would persuade you Captain Waverley that I take what the people of old used to call a steakraid that is a collop of the foray or in plainer words a portion of the robber s booty paid by him to the Laird or Chief through whose grounds he drove his prey O it is certain that unless I can find some way to charm Flora s tongue General Blakeney will send a sergeant s party from Stirling this he said with haughty and emphatic irony to seize Vich lan Vohr as they nickname me in his own castle Now Fergus must not our guest be sensible that all this is folly and affectation You have men enough to serve you without enlisting banditti and your own honour is above taint Why don t you send this Donald Bean Lean whom I hate for his smoothness and duplicity even more than for his rapine out of your country at once No cause should induce me to tolerate such a character No cause Flora said the Chieftain significantly No cause Fergus not even that which is nearest to my heart Spare it the omen of such evil supporters O but sister rejoined the Chief gaily you don t consider my respect for la belle passion Evan Dhu Maccombich is in love with Donald s daughter Alice and you cannot expect me to disturb him in his amours Why the whole clan would cry shame on me You know it is one of their wise sayings that a kinsman is part of a man s body but a foster brother is a piece of his heart Well Fergus there is no disputing with you but I would all this may end well Devoutly prayed my dear and prophetic sister and the best way in the world to close a dubious argument But hear ye not the pipes Captain Waverley Perhaps you will like better to dance to them in the hall than to be deafened with their harmony without taking part in the exercise they invite us to Waverley took Flora s hand The dance song and merry making proceeded and closed the day s entertainment at the castle of Vich Ian Vohr Edward at length retired his mind agitated by a variety of new and conflicting feelings which detained him from rest for some time in that not unpleasing state of mind in which fancy takes the helm and the soul rather drifts passively along with the rapid and confused tide of reflections than exerts itself to encounter systematise or examine them At a late hour he fell asleep and dreamed of Flora Mac Ivor CHAPTER XXIV A STAG HUNT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES Shall this be a long or a short chapter This is a question in which you gentle reader have no vote however much you may be interested in the consequences just as you may like myself probably have nothing to do with the imposing a new tax excepting the trifling circumstance of being obliged to pay it More happy surely in the present case since though it lies within my arbitrary power to extend my materials as I think proper I cannot call you into Exchequer if you do not think proper to read my narrative Let me therefore consider It is true that the annals and documents in my hands say but little of this Highland chase but then I can find copious materials for description elsewhere There is old Lindsay of Pitscottie ready at my elbow with his Athole hunting and his lofted and joisted palace of green timber with all kind of drink to be had in burgh and land as ale beer wine muscadel malvaise hippocras and aquavitae with wheat bread main bread ginge bread beef mutton lamb veal venison goose grice capon coney crane swan partridge plover duck drake brisselcock pawnies black cock muir fowl and capercailzies not forgetting the costly bedding vaiselle and napry and least of all the excelling stewards cunning baxters excellent cooks and pottingars with confections and drugs for the desserts Besides the particulars which may be thence gleaned for this Highland feast the splendour of which induced the Pope s legate to dissent from an opinion which he had hitherto held that Scotland namely was the the the latter end of the world besides these might I not illuminate my pages with Taylor the Water Poet s hunting in the Braes of Mar where Through heather mosse mong frogs and bogs and fogs Mongst craggy cliffs and thunder batter d hills Hares hinds bucks roes are chased by men and dogs Where two hours hunting fourscore fat deer kills Lowland your sports are low as is your seat The Highland games and minds are high and great But without further tyranny over my readers or display of the extent of my own reading I shall content myself with borrowing a single incident from the memorable hunting at Lude commemorated in the ingenious mister Gunn s essay on the Caledonian Harp and so proceed in my story with all the brevity that my natural style of composition partaking of what scholars call the periphrastic and ambagitory and the vulgar the circumbendibus will permit me The solemn hunting was delayed from various causes for about three weeks The interval was spent by Waverley with great satisfaction at Glennaquoich for the impression which Flora had made on his mind at their first meeting grew daily stronger She was precisely the character to fascinate a youth of romantic imagination Her manners her language her talents for poetry and music gave additional and varied influence to her eminent personal charms Even in her hours of gaiety she was in his fancy exalted above the ordinary daughters of Eve and seemed only to stoop for an instant to those topics of amusement and gallantry which others appear to live for In the neighbourhood of this enchantress while sport consumed the morning and music and the dance led on the hours of evening Waverley became daily more delighted with his hospitable landlord and more enamoured of his bewitching sister At length the period fixed for the grand hunting arrived and Waverley and the Chieftain departed for the place of rendezvous which was a day s journey to the northward of Glennaquoich Fergus was attended on this occasion by about three hundred of his clan well armed and accoutred in their best fashion Waverley complied so far with the custom of the country as to adopt the trews he could not be reconciled to the kilt brogues and bonnet as the fittest dress for the exercise in which he was to be engaged and which least exposed him to be stared at as a stranger when they should reach the place of rendezvous They found on the spot appointed several powerful Chiefs to all of whom Waverley was formally presented and by all cordially received Their vassals and clansmen a part of whose feudal duty it was to attend on these parties appeared in such numbers as amounted to a small army These active assistants spread through the country far and near forming a circle technically called the tinchel which gradually closing drove the deer in herds together towards the glen where the Chiefs and principal sportsmen lay in wait for them In the meanwhile these distinguished personages bivouacked among the flowery heath wrapped up in their plaids a mode of passing a summer s night which Waverley found by no means unpleasant For many hours after sunrise the mountain ridges and passes retained their ordinary appearance of silence and solitude and the Chiefs with their followers amused themselves with various pastimes in which the joys of the shell as Ossian has it were not forgotten Others apart sate on a hill retired probably as deeply engaged in the discussion of politics and news as Milton s spirits in metaphysical disquisition At length signals of the approach of the game were descried and heard Distant shouts resounded from valley to valley as the various parties of Highlanders climbing rocks struggling through copses wading brooks and traversing thickets approached more and more near to each other and compelled the astonished deer with the other wild animals that fled before them into a narrower circuit Every now and then the report of muskets was heard repeated by a thousand echoes The baying of the dogs was soon added to the chorus which grew ever louder and more loud At length the advanced parties of the deer began to show themselves and as the stragglers came bounding down the pass by two or three at a time the Chiefs showed their skill by distinguishing the fattest deer and their dexterity in bringing them down with their guns Fergus exhibited remarkable address and Edward was also so fortunate as to attract the notice and applause of the sportsmen But now the main body of the deer appeared at the head of the glen compelled into a very narrow compass and presenting such a formidable phalanx that their antlers appeared at a distance over the ridge of the steep pass like a leafless grove Their number was very great and from a desperate stand which they made with the tallest of the red deer stags arranged in front in a sort of battle array gazing on the group which barred their passage down the glen the more experienced sportsmen began to augur danger The work of destruction however now commenced on all sides Dogs and hunters were at work and muskets and fusees resounded from every quarter The deer driven to desperation made at length a fearful charge right upon the spot where the more distinguished sportsmen had taken their stand The word was given in Gaelic to fling themselves upon their faces but Waverley on whose English ears the signal was lost had almost fallen a sacrifice to his ignorance of the ancient language in which it was communicated Fergus observing his danger sprung up and pulled him with violence to the ground just as the whole herd broke down upon them The tide being absolutely irresistible and wounds from a stag s horn highly dangerous the activity of the Chieftain may be considered on this occasion as having saved his guest s life He detained him with a firm grasp until the whole herd of deer had fairly run over them Waverley then attempted to rise but found that he had suffered several very severe contusions and upon a further examination discovered that he had sprained his ankle violently Footnote The thrust from the tynes or branches of the stag s horns was accounted far more dangerous than those of the boar s tusk If thou be hurt with horn of stag it brings thee to thy bier But barber s hand shall boar s hurt heal thereof have thou no fear This checked the mirth of the meeting although the Highlanders accustomed to such incidents and prepared for them had suffered no harm themselves A wigwam was erected almost in an instant where Edward was deposited on a couch of heather The surgeon or he who assumed the office appeared to unite the characters of a leech and a conjuror He was an old smoke dried Highlander wearing a venerable grey beard and having for his sole garment a tartan frock the skirts of which descended to the knee and being undivided in front made the vestment serve at once for doublet and breeches Footnote This garb which resembled the dress often put on children in Scotland called a polonie i e polonaise is a very ancient modification of the Highland garb It was in fact the hauberk or shirt of mail only composed of cloth instead of rings of armour He observed great ceremony in approaching Edward and though our hero was writhing with pain would not proceed to any operation which might assuage it until he had perambulated his couch three times moving from east to west according to the course of the sun This which was called making the deasil Footnote Old Highlanders will still make the deasil around those whom they wish well to To go round a person in the opposite direction or withershins German wider shins is unlucky and a sort of incantation both the leech and the assistants seemed to consider as a matter of the last importance to the accomplishment of a cure and Waverley whom pain rendered incapable of expostulation and who indeed saw no chance of its being attended to submitted in silence After this ceremony was duly performed the old Esculapius let his patient s blood with a cupping glass with great dexterity and proceeded muttering all the while to himself in Gaelic to boil on the fire certain herbs with which he compounded an embrocation He then fomented the parts which had sustained injury never failing to murmur prayers or spells which of the two Waverley could not distinguish as his ear only caught the words Gaspar Melchior Balthazar max prax fax and similar gibberish The fomentation had a speedy effect in alleviating the pain and swelling which our hero imputed to the virtue of the herbs or the effect of the chafing but which was by the bystanders unanimously ascribed to the spells with which the operation had been accompanied Edward was given to understand that not one of the ingredients had been gathered except during the full moon and that the herbalist had while collecting them uniformly recited a charm which in English ran thus Hail to thee thou holy herb That sprung on holy ground All in the Mount Olivet First wert thou found Thou art boot for many a bruise And healest many a wound In our Lady s blessed name I take thee from the ground Footnote This metrical spell or something very like it is preserved by Reginald Scott in his work on Witchcraft Edward observed with some surprise that even Fergus notwithstanding his knowledge and education seemed to fall in with the superstitious ideas of his countrymen either because he deemed it impolitic to affect scepticism on a matter of general belief or more probably because like most men who do not think deeply or accurately on such subjects he had in his mind a reserve of superstition which balanced the freedom of his expressions and practice upon other occasions Waverley made no commentary therefore on the manner of the treatment but rewarded the professor of medicine with a liberality beyond the utmost conception of his wildest hopes He uttered on the occasion so many incoherent blessings in Gaelic and English that Mac Ivor rather scandalised at the excess of his acknowledgments cut them short by exclaiming Ceud mile mhalloich ort i e A hundred thousand curses on you and so pushed the helper of men out of the cabin After Waverley was left alone the exhaustion of pain and fatigue for the whole day s exercise had been severe threw him into a profound but yet a feverish sleep which he chiefly owed to an opiate draught administered by the old Highlander from some decoction of herbs in his pharmacopoeia Early the next morning the purpose of their meeting being over and their sports damped by the untoward accident in which Fergus and all his friends expressed the greatest sympathy it became a question how to dispose of the disabled sportsman This was settled by Mac Ivor who had a litter prepared of birch and hazel grey FOOTNOTE On the morrow they made their biers Of birch and hazel grey Chevy Chase which was borne by his people with such caution and dexterity as renders it not improbable that they may have been the ancestors of some of those sturdy Gael who have now the happiness to transport the belles of Edinburgh in their sedan chairs to ten routs in one evening When Edward was elevated upon their shoulders he could not help being gratified with the romantic effect produced by the breaking up of this sylvan camp Footnote See Note twenty five The various tribes assembled each at the pibroch of their native clan and each headed by their patriarchal ruler Some who had already begun to retire were seen winding up the hills or descending the passes which led to the scene of action the sound of their bagpipes dying upon the ear Others made still a moving picture upon the narrow plain forming various changeful groups their feathers and loose plaids waving in the morning breeze and their arms glittering in the rising sun Most of the Chiefs came to take farewell of Waverley and to express their anxious hope they might again and speedily meet but the care of Fergus abridged the ceremony of taking leave At length his own men being completely assembled and mustered Mac Ivor commenced his march but not towards the quarter from which they had come He gave Edward to understand that the greater part of his followers now on the field were bound on a distant expedition and that when he had deposited him in the house of a gentleman who he was sure would pay him every attention he himself should be under the necessity of accompanying them the greater part of the way but would lose no time in rejoining his friend Waverley was rather surprised that Fergus had not mentioned this ulterior destination when they set out upon the hunting party but his situation did not admit of many interrogatories The greater part of the clansmen went forward under the guidance of old Ballenkeiroch and Evan Dhu Maccombich apparently in high spirits A few remained for the purpose of escorting the Chieftain who walked by the side of Edward s litter and attended him with the most affectionate assiduity About noon after a journey which the nature of the conveyance the pain of his bruises and the roughness of the way rendered inexpressibly painful Waverley was hospitably received into the house of a gentleman related to Fergus who had prepared for him every accommodation which the simple habits of living then universal in the Highlands put in his power In this person an old man about seventy Edward admired a relic of primitive simplicity He wore no dress but what his estate afforded the cloth was the fleece of his own sheep woven by his own servants and stained into tartan by the dyes produced from the herbs and lichens of the hills around him His linen was spun by his daughters and maidservants from his own flax nor did his table though plentiful and varied with game and fish offer an article but what was of native produce Claiming himself no rights of clanship or vassalage he was fortunate in the alliance and protection of Vich Ian Vohr and other bold and enterprising Chieftains who protected him in the quiet unambitious life he loved It is true the youth born on his grounds were often enticed to leave him for the service of his more active friends but a few old servants and tenants used to shake their grey locks when they heard their master censured for want of spirit and observed When the wind is still the shower falls soft This good old man whose charity and hospitality were unbounded would have received Waverley with kindness had he been the meanest Saxon peasant since his situation required assistance But his attention to a friend and guest of Vich Ian Vohr was anxious and unremitted Other embrocations were applied to the injured limb and new spells were put in practice At length after more solicitude than was perhaps for the advantage of his health Fergus took farewell of Edward for a few days when he said he would return to Tomanrait and hoped by that time Waverley would be able to ride one of the Highland ponies of his landlord and in that manner return to Glennaquoich The next day when his good old host appeared Edward learned that his friend had departed with the dawn leaving none of his followers except Callum Beg the sort of foot page who used to attend his person and who had now in charge to wait upon Waverley On asking his host if he knew where the Chieftain was gone the old man looked fixedly at him with something mysterious and sad in the smile which was his only reply Waverley repeated his question to which his host answered in a proverb What sent the messengers to hell Was asking what they knew full well Footnote Corresponding to the Lowland saying Mony ane speirs the gate they ken fu weel He was about to proceed but Callum Beg said rather pertly as Edward thought that Ta Tighearnach i e the Chief did not like ta Sassenagh duinhe wassel to be pingled wi mickle speaking as she was na tat weel From this Waverley concluded he should disoblige his friend by inquiring of a stranger the object of a journey which he himself had not communicated It is unnecessary to trace the progress of our hero s recovery The sixth morning had arrived and he was able to walk about with a staff when Fergus returned with about a score of his men He seemed in the highest spirits congratulated Waverley on his progress towards recovery and finding he was able to sit on horseback proposed their immediate return to Glennaquoich Waverley joyfully acceded for the form of its fair mistress had lived in his dreams during all the time of his confinement Now he has ridden o er moor and moss O er hill and many a glen Fergus all the while with his myrmidons striding stoutly by his side or diverging to get a shot at a roe or a heath cock Waverley s bosom beat thick when they approached the old tower of Ian nan Chaistel and could distinguish the fair form of its mistress advancing to meet them Fergus began immediately with his usual high spirits to exclaim Open your gates incomparable princess to the wounded Moor Abindarez whom Rodrigo de Narvez constable of Antiquera conveys to your castle or open them if you like it better to the renowned Marquis of Mantua the sad attendant of his half slain friend Baldovinos of the Mountain Ah long rest to thy soul Cervantes without quoting thy remnants how should I frame my language to befit romantic ears Flora now advanced and welcoming Waverley with much kindness expressed her regret for his accident of which she had already heard particulars and her surprise that her brother should not have taken better care to put a stranger on his guard against the perils of the sport in which he engaged him Edward easily exculpated the Chieftain who indeed at his own personal risk had probably saved his life This greeting over Fergus said three or four words to his sister in Gaelic The tears instantly sprung to her eyes but they seemed to be tears of devotion and joy for she looked up to heaven and folded her hands as in a solemn expression of prayer or gratitude After the pause of a minute she presented to Edward some letters which had been forwarded from Tully Veolan during his absence and at the same time delivered some to her brother To the latter she likewise gave three or four numbers of the Caledonian Mercury the only newspaper which was then published to the north of the Tweed Both gentlemen retired to examine their despatches and Edward speedily found that those which he had received contained matters of very deep interest CHAPTER XXV NEWS FROM ENGLAND The letters which Waverley had hitherto received from his relations in England were not such as required any particular notice in this narrative His father usually wrote to him with the pompous affectation of one who was too much oppressed by public affairs to find leisure to attend to those of his own family Now and then he mentioned persons of rank in Scotland to whom he wished his son should pay some attention but Waverley hitherto occupied by the amusements which he had found at Tully Veolan and Glennaquoich dispensed with paying any attention to hints so coldly thrown out especially as distance shortness of leave of absence and so forth furnished a ready apology But latterly the burden of mister Richard Waverley s paternal epistles consisted in certain mysterious hints of greatness and influence which he was speedily to attain and which would ensure his son s obtaining the most rapid promotion should he remain in the military service Sir Everard s letters were of a different tenor They were short for the good Baronet was none of your illimitable correspondents whose manuscript overflows the folds of their large post paper and leaves no room for the seal but they were kind and affectionate and seldom concluded without some allusion to our hero s stud some question about the state of his purse and a special inquiry after such of his recruits as had preceded him from Waverley Honour Aunt Rachel charged him to remember his principles of religion to take care of his health to beware of Scotch mists which she had heard would wet an Englishman through and through never to go out at night without his great coat and above all to wear flannel next to his skin mister Pembroke only wrote to our hero one letter but it was of the bulk of six epistles of these degenerate days containing in the moderate compass of ten folio pages closely written a precis of a supplementary quarto manuscript of addenda delenda et corrigenda in reference to the two tracts with which he had presented Waverley This he considered as a mere sop in the pan to stay the appetite of Edward s curiosity until he should find an opportunity of sending down the volume itself which was much too heavy for the post and which he proposed to accompany with certain interesting pamphlets lately published by his friend in Little Britain with whom he had kept up a sort of literary correspondence in virtue of which the library shelves of Waverley Honour were loaded with much trash and a good round bill seldom summed in fewer than three figures was yearly transmitted in which Sir Everard Waverley of Waverley Honour Bart was marked doctor to Jonathan Grubbet bookseller and stationer Little Britain Such had hitherto been the style of the letters which Edward had received from England but the packet delivered to him at Glennaquoich was of a different and more interesting complexion It would be impossible for the reader even were I to insert the letters at full length to comprehend the real cause of their being written without a glance into the interior of the British cabinet at the period in question The ministers of the day happened no very singular event to be divided into two parties the weakest of which making up by assiduity of intrigue their inferiority in real consequence had of late acquired some new proselytes and with them the hope of superseding their rivals in the favour of their sovereign and overpowering them in the House of Commons Amongst others they had thought it worth while to practise upon Richard Waverley This honest gentleman by a grave mysterious demeanour an attention to the etiquette of business rather more than to its essence a facility in making long dull speeches consisting of truisms and commonplaces hashed up with a technical jargon of office which prevented the inanity of his orations from being discovered had acquired a certain name and credit in public life and even established with many the character of a profound politician none of your shining orators indeed whose talents evaporate in tropes of rhetoric and flashes of wit but one possessed of steady parts for business which would wear well as the ladies say in choosing their silks and ought in all reason to be good for common and every day use since they were confessedly formed of no holiday texture This faith had become so general that the insurgent party in the cabinet of which we have made mention after sounding mister Richard Waverley were so satisfied with his sentiments and abilities as to propose that in case of a certain revolution in the ministry he should take an ostensible place in the new order of things not indeed of the very first rank but greatly higher in point both of emolument and influence than that which he now enjoyed There was no resisting so tempting a proposal notwithstanding that the Great Man under whose patronage he had enlisted and by whose banner he had hitherto stood firm was the principal object of the proposed attack by the new allies Unfortunately this fair scheme of ambition was blighted in the very bud by a premature movement All the official gentlemen concerned in it who hesitated to take the part of a voluntary resignation were informed that the king had no further occasion for their services and in Richard Waverley s case which the minister considered as aggravated by ingratitude dismissal was accompanied by something like personal contempt and contumely The public and even the party of whom he shared the fall sympathised little in the disappointment of this selfish and interested statesman and he retired to the country under the comfortable reflection that he had lost at the same time character credit and what he at least equally deplored emolument Richard Waverley s letter to his son upon this occasion was a masterpiece of its kind Aristides himself could not have made out a harder case An unjust monarch and an ungrateful country were the burden of each rounded paragraph He spoke of long services and unrequited sacrifices though the former had been overpaid by his salary and nobody could guess in what the latter consisted unless it were in his deserting not from conviction but for the lucre of gain the Tory principles of his family In the conclusion his resentment was wrought to such an excess by the force of his own oratory that he could not repress some threats of vengeance however vague and impotent and finally acquainted his son with his pleasure that he should testify his sense of the ill treatment he had sustained by throwing up his commission as soon as the letter reached him This he said was also his uncle s desire as he would himself intimate in due course Accordingly the next letter which Edward opened was from Sir Everard His brother s disgrace seemed to have removed from his well natured bosom all recollection of their differences and remote as he was from every means of learning that Richard s disgrace was in reality only the just as well as natural consequence of his own unsuccessful intrigues the good but credulous Baronet at once set it down as a new and enormous instance of the injustice of the existing government It was true he said and he must not disguise it even from Edward that his father could not have sustained such an insult as was now for the first time offered to one of his house unless he had subjected himself to it by accepting of an employment under the present system Sir Everard had no doubt that he now both saw and felt the magnitude of this error and it should be his Sir Everard s business to take care that the cause of his regret should not extend itself to pecuniary consequences It was enough for a Waverley to have sustained the public disgrace the patrimonial injury could easily be obviated by the head of their family But it was both the opinion of mister Richard Waverley and his own that Edward the representative of the family of Waverley Honour should not remain in a situation which subjected him also to such treatment as that with which his father had been stigmatised He requested his nephew therefore to take the fittest and at the same time the most speedy opportunity of transmitting his resignation to the War Office and hinted moreover that little ceremony was necessary where so little had been used to his father He sent multitudinous greetings to the Baron of Bradwardine A letter from Aunt Rachel spoke out even more plainly She considered the disgrace of brother Richard as the just reward of his forfeiting his allegiance to a lawful though exiled sovereign and taking the oaths to an alien a concession which her grandfather Sir Nigel Waverley refused to make either to the Roundhead Parliament or to Cromwell when his life and fortune stood in the utmost extremity She hoped her dear Edward would follow the footsteps of his ancestors and as speedily as possible get rid of the badge of servitude to the usurping family and regard the wrongs sustained by his father as an admonition from Heaven that every desertion of the line of loyalty becomes its own punishment She also concluded with her respects to mister Bradwardine and begged Waverley would inform her whether his daughter Miss Rose was old enough to wear a pair of very handsome ear rings which she proposed to send as a token of her affection The good lady also desired to be informed whether mister Bradwardine took as much Scotch snuff and danced as unweariedly as he did when he was at Waverley Honour about thirty years ago These letters as might have been expected highly excited Waverley s indignation From the desultory style of his studies he had not any fixed political opinion to place in opposition to the movements of indignation which he felt at his father s supposed wrongs Of the real cause of his disgrace Edward was totally ignorant nor had his habits at all led him to investigate the politics of the period in which he lived or remark the intrigues in which his father had been so actively engaged Indeed any impressions which he had accidentally adopted concerning the parties of the times were owing to the society in which he had lived at Waverley Honour of a nature rather unfavourable to the existing government and dynasty He entered therefore without hesitation into the resentful feeling of the relations who had the best title to dictate his conduct and not perhaps the less willingly when he remembered the tedium of his quarters and the inferior figure which he had made among the officers of his regiment If he could have had any doubt upon the subject it would have been decided by the following letter from his commanding officer which as it is very short shall be inserted verbatim SIR Having carried somewhat beyond the line of my duty an indulgence which even the lights of nature and much more those of Christianity direct towards errors which may arise from youth and inexperience and that altogether without effect I am reluctantly compelled at the present crisis to use the only remaining remedy which is in my power You are therefore hereby commanded to repair to the headquarters of the regiment within three days after the date of this letter If you shall fail to do so I must report you to the War Office as absent without leave and also take other steps which will be disagreeable to you as well as to Sir Your obedient Servant J GARDINER Lieut colonel Commanding the Regt Dragoons Edward s blood boiled within him as he read this letter He had been accustomed from his very infancy to possess in a great measure the disposal of his own time and thus acquired habits which rendered the rules of military discipline as unpleasing to him in this as they were in some other respects An idea that in his own case they would not be enforced in a very rigid manner had also obtained full possession of his mind and had hitherto been sanctioned by the indulgent conduct of his lieutenant colonel Neither had anything occurred to his knowledge that should have induced his commanding officer without any other warning than the hints we noticed at the end of the fourteenth chapter so suddenly to assume a harsh and as Edward deemed it so insolent a tone of dictatorial authority Connecting it with the letters he had just received from his family he could not but suppose that it was designed to make him feel in his present situation the same pressure of authority which had been exercised in his father s case and that the whole was a concerted scheme to depress and degrade every member of the Waverley family Without a pause therefore Edward wrote a few cold lines thanking his lieutenant colonel for past civilities and expressing regret that he should have chosen to efface the remembrance of them by assuming a different tone towards him The strain of his letter as well as what he Edward conceived to be his duty in the present crisis called upon him to lay down his commission and he therefore inclosed the formal resignation of a situation which subjected him to so unpleasant a correspondence and requested Colonel Gardiner would have the goodness to forward it to the proper authorities Having finished this magnanimous epistle he felt somewhat uncertain concerning the terms in which his resignation ought to be expressed upon which subject he resolved to consult Fergus Mac Ivor It may be observed in passing that the bold and prompt habits of thinking acting and speaking which distinguished this young Chieftain had given him a considerable ascendency over the mind of Waverley Endowed with at least equal powers of understanding and with much finer genius Edward yet stooped to the bold and decisive activity of an intellect which was sharpened by the habit of acting on a preconceived and regular system as well as by extensive knowledge of the world When Edward found his friend the latter had still in his hand the newspaper which he had perused and advanced to meet him with the embarrassment of one who has unpleasing news to communicate Do your letters Captain Waverley confirm the unpleasing information which I find in this paper He put the paper into his hand where his father s disgrace was registered in the most bitter terms transferred probably from some London journal At the end of the paragraph was this remarkable innuendo We understand that this same RICHARD who hath done all this is not the only example of the WAVERING HONOUR of W v r ly H n r See the Gazette of this day With hurried and feverish apprehension our hero turned to the place referred to and found therein recorded Edward Waverley captain in regiment dragoons superseded for absence without leave and in the list of military promotions referring to the same regiment he discovered this farther article Lieut Julius Butler to be captain VICE Edward Waverley superseded Our hero s bosom glowed with the resentment which undeserved and apparently premeditated insult was calculated to excite in the bosom of one who had aspired after honour and was thus wantonly held up to public scorn and disgrace Upon comparing the date of his colonel s letter with that of the article in the Gazette he perceived that his threat of making a report upon his absence had been literally fulfilled and without inquiry as it seemed whether Edward had either received his summons or was disposed to comply with it The whole therefore appeared a formed plan to degrade him in the eyes of the public and the idea of its having succeeded filled him with such bitter emotions that after various attempts to conceal them he at length threw himself into Mac Ivor s arms and gave vent to tears of shame and indignation It was none of this Chieftain s faults to be indifferent to the wrongs of his friends and for Edward independent of certain plans with which he was connected he felt a deep and sincere interest The proceeding appeared as extraordinary to him as it had done to Edward He indeed knew of more motives than Waverley was privy to for the peremptory order that he should join his regiment But that without further inquiry into the circumstances of a necessary delay the commanding officer in contradiction to his known and established character should have proceeded in so harsh and unusual a manner was a mystery which he could not penetrate He soothed our hero however to the best of his power and began to turn his thoughts on revenge for his insulted honour Edward eagerly grasped at the idea Will you carry a message for me to Colonel Gardiner my dear Fergus and oblige me for ever Fergus paused It is an act of friendship which you should command could it be useful or lead to the righting your honour but in the present case I doubt if your commanding officer would give you the meeting on account of his having taken measures which however harsh and exasperating were still within the strict bounds of his duty Besides Gardiner is a precise Huguenot and has adopted certain ideas about the sinfulness of such rencontres from which it would be impossible to make him depart especially as his courage is beyond all suspicion And besides I I to say the truth I dare not at this moment for some very weighty reasons go near any of the military quarters or garrisons belonging to this government And am I said Waverley to sit down quiet and contented under the injury I have received That will I never advise my friend replied Mac Ivor But I would have vengeance to fall on the head not on the hand on the tyrannical and oppressive government which designed and directed these premeditated and reiterated insults not on the tools of office which they employed in the execution of the injuries they aimed at you On the government said Waverley Yes replied the impetuous Highlander on the usurping House of Hanover whom your grandfather would no more have served than he would have taken wages of red hot gold from the great fiend of hell But since the time of my grandfather two generations of this dynasty have possessed the throne said Edward coolly True replied the Chieftain and because we have passively given them so long the means of showing their native character because both you and I myself have lived in quiet submission have even truckled to the times so far as to accept commissions under them and thus have given them an opportunity of disgracing us publicly by resuming them are we not on that account to resent injuries which our fathers only apprehended but which we have actually sustained Or is the cause of the unfortunate Stuart family become less just because their title has devolved upon an heir who is innocent of the charges of misgovernment brought against his father Do you remember the lines of your favourite poet Had Richard unconstrain d resign d the throne A king can give no more than is his own The title stood entail d had Richard had a son You see my dear Waverley I can quote poetry as well as Flora and you But come clear your moody brow and trust to me to show you an honourable road to a speedy and glorious revenge Let us seek Flora who perhaps has more news to tell us of what has occurred during our absence She will rejoice to hear that you are relieved of your servitude But first add a postscript to your letter marking the time when you received this calvinistical colonel s first summons and express your regret that the hastiness of his proceedings prevented your anticipating them by sending your resignation Then let him blush for his injustice The letter was sealed accordingly covering a formal resignation of the commission and Mac Ivor despatched it with some letters of his own by a special messenger with charge to put them into the nearest post office in the Lowlands CHAPTER XXVI AN ECLAIRCISSEMENT The hint which the Chieftain had thrown out respecting Flora was not unpremeditated 
5136-24633-0000	train-other-500	He had observed with great satisfaction the growing attachment of Waverley to his sister nor did he see any bar to their union excepting the situation which Waverley s father held in the ministry
none	none	 and Edward s own commission in the army of George II 
5136-24633-0001	train-other-500	These obstacles were now removed and in a manner which apparently paved the way for the son s becoming reconciled to another allegiance In every other respect the match would be most eligible
5136-24633-0002	train-other-500	The safety happiness and honourable provision of his sister whom he dearly loved
none	none	 appeared to be ensured by the proposed union and his heart swelled when he considered how his own interest would be exalted in the eyes of the ex monarch 
5136-24633-0003	train-other-500	to whom he had dedicated his service by an alliance with one of those ancient powerful and wealthy English families of the steady cavalier faith
none	none	 to awaken whose decayed attachment to the Stuart family 
5136-24633-0004	train-other-500	was now a matter of such vital importance to the Stuart cause Nor could Fergus perceive any obstacle to such a scheme
5136-24633-0005	train-other-500	Waverley s attachment was evident and as his person was handsome and his taste apparently coincided with her own he anticipated no opposition on the part of Flora Indeed between his ideas of patriarchal power
5136-24633-0006	train-other-500	and those which he had acquired in France respecting the disposal of females in marriage any opposition from his sister dear as she was to him would have been the last obstacle on which he would have calculated
none	none	 even had the union been less eligible 
5136-24633-0007	train-other-500	Influenced by these feelings
none	none	 the Chief now led Waverley in quest of Miss Mac Ivor 
5136-24633-0008	train-other-500	not without the hope that the present agitation of his guest s spirits might give him courage to cut short what Fergus termed the romance of the courtship
none	none	 They found Flora with her faithful attendants Una and Cathleen busied in preparing what appeared to Waverley to be white bridal favours Disguising as well as he could the agitation of his mind 
5136-24633-0009	train-other-500	Waverley asked for what joyful occasion Miss Mac Ivor made such ample preparation It is for Fergus s bridal she said smiling Indeed said Edward he has kept his secret well
5136-24633-0010	train-other-500	I hope he will allow me to be his bride s man That is a man s office but not yours as Beatrice says retorted Flora And who is the fair lady may I be permitted to ask Miss Mac Ivor
5136-24633-0011	train-other-500	Did not I tell you long since that Fergus wooed no bride but Honour answered Flora And am I then incapable of being his assistant and counsellor in the pursuit of honour said our hero colouring deeply
none	none	 Do I rank so low in your opinion 
5136-24633-0012	train-other-500	Far from it Captain Waverley I would to God you were of our determination and made use of the expression which displeased you solely Because you are not of our quality
5136-24633-0013	train-other-500	But stand against us as an enemy That time is past sister said Fergus and you may wish Edward Waverley no longer captain joy of being freed
none	none	 from the slavery to an usurper 
5136-24633-0014	train-other-500	implied in that sable and ill omened emblem Yes said Waverley undoing the cockade from his hat it has pleased the king who bestowed this badge upon me
5136-24633-0015	train-other-500	to resume it in a manner which leaves me little reason to regret his service Thank God for that cried the enthusiast
5136-24633-0016	train-other-500	and O that they may be blind enough to treat every man of honour who serves them with the same indignity that I may have less to sigh for when the struggle approaches And now sister said the Chieftain
none	none	 replace his cockade with one of a more lively colour I think it was the fashion of the ladies of yore to arm and send forth their knights to high achievement 
5136-24633-0017	train-other-500	Not replied the lady till the knight adventurer had well weighed the justice and the danger of the cause Fergus
5136-24633-0018	train-other-500	mister Waverley is just now too much agitated by feelings of recent emotion for me to press upon him a resolution of consequence
none	none	 Waverley felt half alarmed at the thought of adopting the badge of what was by the majority of the kingdom esteemed rebellion yet he could not disguise his chagrin at the coldness with which Flora parried her brother s hint 
5136-24633-0019	train-other-500	Miss Mac Ivor I perceive thinks the knight unworthy of her encouragement and favour said he somewhat bitterly
none	none	 Not so mister Waverley she replied with great sweetness 
5136-24633-0020	train-other-500	Why should I refuse my brother s valued friend a boon which I am distributing to his whole clan Most willingly would I enlist every man of honour in the cause to which my brother has devoted himself
5136-24633-0021	train-other-500	But Fergus has taken his measures with his eyes open His life has been devoted to this cause from his cradle with him its call is sacred were it even a summons to the tomb
5136-24633-0022	train-other-500	But how can I wish you mister Waverley so new to the world so far from every friend who might advise and ought to influence you in a moment too of sudden pique and indignation
5136-24633-0023	train-other-500	how can I wish you to plunge yourself at once into so desperate an enterprise Fergus who did not understand these delicacies strode through the apartment biting his lip and then with a constrained smile said
none	none	 Well sister I leave you to act your new character of mediator between the Elector of Hanover 
5136-24633-0024	train-other-500	and the subjects of your lawful sovereign and benefactor and left the room There was a painful pause which was at length broken by Miss Mac Ivor My brother is unjust she said
5136-24633-0025	train-other-500	because he can bear no interruption that seems to thwart his loyal zeal And do you not share his ardour asked Waverley Do I not answered Flora
5136-24633-0026	train-other-500	God knows mine exceeds his if that be possible But I am not like him rapt by the bustle of military preparation and the infinite detail necessary to the present undertaking
5136-24633-0027	train-other-500	beyond consideration of the grand principles of justice and truth on which our enterprise is grounded
none	none	 and these I am certain 
5136-24633-0028	train-other-500	can only be furthered by measures in themselves true and just To operate upon your present feelings my dear mister Waverley to induce you to an irretrievable step
none	none	 of which you have not considered either the justice or the danger 
5136-24633-0029	train-other-500	is in my poor judgment neither the one nor the other Incomparable Flora
none	none	 said Edward taking her hand how much do I need such a monitor 
5136-24633-0030	train-other-500	A better one by far said Flora gently withdrawing her hand mister Waverley will always find in his own bosom when he will give its small still voice
none	none	 leisure to be heard 
5136-24633-0031	train-other-500	No Miss Mac Ivor I dare not hope it a thousand circumstances of fatal self indulgence have made me the creature rather of imagination than reason Durst I but hope could I but think
none	none	 that you would deign to be to me that affectionate 
5136-24633-0032	train-other-500	that condescending friend who would strengthen me to redeem my errors my future life Hush my dear sir
5136-24633-0033	train-other-500	now you carry your joy at escaping the hands of a Jacobite recruiting officer to an unparalleled excess of gratitude Nay dear Flora trifle with me no longer
5136-24633-0034	train-other-500	you cannot mistake the meaning of those feelings which I have almost involuntarily expressed and since I have broken the barrier of silence
none	none	 let me profit by my audacity 
5136-24633-0035	train-other-500	Or may I with your permission mention to your brother Not for the world mister Waverley What am I to understand said Edward Is there any fatal bar has any prepossession
5136-24633-0036	train-other-500	None sir answered Flora I owe it to myself to say that I never yet saw the person on whom I thought with reference to the present subject The shortness of our acquaintance perhaps
5136-24633-0037	train-other-500	If Miss Mac Ivor will deign to give me time I have not even that excuse Captain Waverley s character is so open is in short
5136-24633-0038	train-other-500	of that nature that it cannot be misconstrued either in its strength or its weakness And for that weakness you despise me said Edward
5136-24633-0039	train-other-500	Forgive me mister Waverley and remember it is but within this half hour that there existed between us a barrier of a nature to me insurmountable since I never could think of an officer in the service of the Elector of Hanover
none	none	 in any other light than as a casual acquaintance 
5136-24633-0040	train-other-500	Permit me then to arrange my ideas upon so unexpected a topic and in less than an hour I will be ready to give you such reasons for the resolution I shall express
5136-24633-0041	train-other-500	as may be satisfactory at least if not pleasing to you So saying Flora withdrew leaving Waverley to meditate upon the manner in which she had received his addresses
none	none	 Ere he could make up his mind whether to believe his suit had been acceptable or no 
5136-24633-0042	train-other-500	Fergus re entered the apartment What a la mort Waverley he cried Come down with me to the court and you shall see a sight worth all the tirades of your romances
5136-24633-0043	train-other-500	An hundred firelocks my friend and as many broadswords just arrived from good friends
none	none	 and two or three hundred stout fellows almost fighting which shall first possess them But let 
5136-24633-0044	train-other-500	me look at you closer Why a true Highlander would say you had been blighted by an evil eye Or can it be this silly girl that has thus blanked your spirit
none	none	 Never mind her dear Edward 
5136-24633-0045	train-other-500	the wisest of her sex are fools in what regards the business of life Indeed my good friend answered Waverley all that I can charge against your sister is that she is too sensible too reasonable
none	none	 If that be all I ensure you 
5136-24633-0046	train-other-500	for a louis d or against the mood lasting four and twenty hours No woman was ever steadily sensible for that period
none	none	 and I will engage if that will please you Flora shall be as unreasonable to morrow as any of her sex You must learn my dear Edward to consider women en mousquetaire So saying he seized Waverley s arm and dragged him off to review his military preparations CHAPTER XXVII UPON THE SAME SUBJECT Fergus Mac Ivor had too much tact and delicacy to renew the subject which he had interrupted His head was or appeared to be so full of guns broadswords bonnets canteens and tartan hose that Waverley could not for some time draw his attention to any other topic Are you to take the field so soon Fergus he asked that you are making all these martial preparations When we have settled that you go with me you shall know all but otherwise the knowledge might rather be prejudicial to you But are you serious in your purpose with such inferior forces to rise against an established government It is mere frenzy Laissez faire a Don Antoine I shall take good care of myself We shall at least use the compliment of Conan who never got a stroke but he gave one I would not however continued the Chieftain have you think me mad enough to stir till a favourable opportunity I will not slip my dog before the game s afoot But once more will you join with us and you shall know all How can I said Waverley I who have so lately held that commission which is now posting back to those that gave it My accepting it implied a promise of fidelity and an acknowledgment of the legality of the government A rash promise answered Fergus is not a steel handcuff it may be shaken off especially when it was given under deception and has been repaid by insult But if you cannot immediately make up your mind to a glorious revenge go to England and ere you cross the Tweed you will hear tidings that will make the world ring and if Sir Everard be the gallant old cavalier I have heard him described by some of our HONEST gentlemen of the year one thousand seven hundred and fifteen he will find you a better horse troop and a better cause than you have lost But your sister Fergus Out hyperbolical fiend replied the Chief laughing how vexest thou this man Speak saint thou of nothing but of ladies Nay be serious my dear friend said Waverley I feel that the happiness of my future life must depend upon the answer which Miss Mac Ivor shall make to what I ventured to tell her this morning And is this your very sober earnest said Fergus more gravely or are we in the land of romance and fiction My earnest undoubtedly How could you suppose me jesting on such a subject Then in very sober earnest answered his friend I am very glad to hear it and so highly do I think of Flora that you are the only man in England for whom I would say so much But before you shake my hand so warmly there is more to be considered Your own family will they approve your connecting yourself with the sister of a high born Highland beggar My uncle s situation said Waverley his general opinions and his uniform indulgence entitle me to say that birth and personal qualities are all he would look to in such a connection And where can I find both united in such excellence as in your sister O nowhere cela va sans dire replied Fergus with a smile But your father will expect a father s prerogative in being consulted Surely but his late breach with the ruling powers removes all apprehension of objection on his part especially as I am convinced that my uncle will be warm in my cause Religion perhaps said Fergus may make obstacles though we are not bigotted Catholics My grandmother was of the Church of Rome and her religion was never objected to by my family Do not think of MY friends dear Fergus let me rather have your influence where it may be more necessary to remove obstacles I mean with your lovely sister My lovely sister replied Fergus like her loving brother is very apt to have a pretty decisive will of her own by which in this case you must be ruled but you shall not want my interest nor my counsel And in the first place I will give you one hint Loyalty is her ruling passion and since she could spell an English book she has been in love with the memory of the gallant Captain Wogan who renounced the service of the usurper Cromwell to join the standard of Charles II marched a handful of cavalry from London to the Highlands to join Middleton then in arms for the king and at length died gloriously in the royal cause Ask her to show you some verses she made on his history and fate they have been much admired I assure you The next point is I think I saw Flora go up towards the waterfall a short time since follow man follow don t allow the garrison time to strengthen its purposes of resistance Alerte a la muraille Seek Flora out and learn her decision as soon as you can and Cupid go with you while I go to look over belts and cartouch boxes Waverley ascended the glen with an anxious and throbbing heart Love with all its romantic train of hopes fears and wishes was mingled with other feelings of a nature less easily defined He could not but remember how much this morning had changed his fate and into what a complication of perplexity it was likely to plunge him Sunrise had seen him possessed of an esteemed rank in the honourable profession of arms his father to all appearance rapidly rising in the favour of his sovereign All this had passed away like a dream he himself was dishonoured his father disgraced and he had become involuntarily the confidant at least if not the accomplice of plans dark deep and dangerous which must infer either the subversion of the government he had so lately served or the destruction of all who had participated in them Should Flora even listen to his suit favourably what prospect was there of its being brought to a happy termination amid the tumult of an impending insurrection Or how could he make the selfish request that she should leave Fergus to whom she was so much attached and retiring with him to England wait as a distant spectator the success of her brother s undertaking or the ruin of all his hopes and fortunes Or on the other hand to engage himself with no other aid than his single arm in the dangerous and precipitate counsels of the Chieftain to be whirled along by him the partaker of all his desperate and impetuous motions renouncing almost the power of judging or deciding upon the rectitude or prudence of his actions this was no pleasing prospect for the secret pride of Waverley to stoop to And yet what other conclusion remained saving the rejection of his addresses by Flora an alternative not to be thought of in the present high wrought state of his feelings with anything short of mental agony Pondering the doubtful and dangerous prospect before him he at length arrived near the cascade where as Fergus had augured he found Flora seated She was quite alone and as soon as she observed his approach she rose and came to meet him Edward attempted to say something within the verge of ordinary compliment and conversation but found himself unequal to the task Flora seemed at first equally embarrassed but recovered herself more speedily and an unfavourable augury for Waverley s suit was the first to enter upon the subject of their last interview It is too important in every point of view mister Waverley to permit me to leave you in doubt on my sentiments Do not speak them speedily said Waverley much agitated unless they are such as I fear from your manner I must not dare to anticipate Let time let my future conduct let your brother s influence Forgive me mister Waverley said Flora her complexion a little heightened but her voice firm and composed I should incur my own heavy censure did I delay expressing my sincere conviction that I can never regard you otherwise than as a valued friend I should do you the highest injustice did I conceal my sentiments for a moment I see I distress you and I grieve for it but better now than later and O better a thousand times mister Waverley that you should feel a present momentary disappointment than the long and heart sickening griefs which attend a rash and ill assorted marriage Good God exclaimed Waverley why should you anticipate such consequences from a union where birth is equal where fortune is favourable where if I may venture to say so the tastes are similar where you allege no preference for another where you even express a favourable opinion of him whom you reject mister Waverley I HAVE that favourable opinion answered Flora and so strongly that though I would rather have been silent on the grounds of my resolution you shall command them if you exact such a mark of my esteem and confidence She sat down upon a fragment of rock and Waverley placing himself near her anxiously pressed for the explanation she offered I dare hardly she said tell you the situation of my feelings they are so different from those usually ascribed to young women at my period of life and I dare hardly touch upon what I conjecture to be the nature of yours lest I should give offence where I would willingly administer consolation For myself from my infancy till this day I have had but one wish the restoration of my royal benefactors to their rightful throne It is impossible to express to you the devotion of my feelings to this single subject and I will frankly confess that it has so occupied my mind as to exclude every thought respecting what is called my own settlement in life Let me but live to see the day of that happy restoration and a Highland cottage a French convent or an English palace will be alike indifferent to me But dearest Flora how is your enthusiastic zeal for the exiled family inconsistent with my happiness Because you seek or ought to seek in the object of your attachment a heart whose principal delight should be in augmenting your domestic felicity and returning your affection even to the height of romance To a man of less keen sensibility and less enthusiastic tenderness of disposition Flora Mac Ivor might give content if not happiness for were the irrevocable words spoken never would she be deficient in the duties which she vowed And why why Miss Mac Ivor should you think yourself a more valuable treasure to one who is less capable of loving of admiring you than to me Simply because the tone of our affections would be more in unison and because his more blunted sensibility would not require the return of enthusiasm which I have not to bestow But you mister Waverley would for ever refer to the idea of domestic happiness which your imagination is capable of painting and whatever fell short of that ideal representation would be construed into coolness and indifference while you might consider the enthusiasm with which I regarded the success of the royal family as defrauding your affection of its due return In other words Miss Mac Ivor you cannot love me said her suitor dejectedly I could esteem you mister Waverley as much perhaps more than any man I have ever seen but I cannot love you as you ought to be loved O do not for your own sake desire so hazardous an experiment The woman whom you marry ought to have affections and opinions moulded upon yours Her studies ought to be your studies her wishes her feelings her hopes her fears should all mingle with yours She should enhance your pleasures share your sorrows and cheer your melancholy And why will not you Miss Mac Ivor who can so well describe a happy union why will not you be yourself the person you describe Is it possible you do not yet comprehend me answered Flora Have I not told you that every keener sensation of my mind is bent exclusively towards an event upon which indeed I have no power but those of my earnest prayers And might not the granting the suit I solicit said Waverley too earnest on his purpose to consider what he was about to say even advance the interest to which you have devoted yourself My family is wealthy and powerful inclined in principles to the Stuart race and should a favourable opportunity A favourable opportunity said Flora somewhat scornfully Inclined in principles Can such lukewarm adherence be honourable to yourselves or gratifying to your lawful sovereign Think from my present feelings what I should suffer when I held the place of member in a family where the rights which I hold most sacred are subjected to cold discussion and only deemed worthy of support when they shall appear on the point of triumphing without it Your doubts quickly replied Waverley are unjust as far as concerns myself The cause that I shall assert I dare support through every danger as undauntedly as the boldest who draws sword in its behalf Of that answered Flora I cannot doubt for a moment But consult your own good sense and reason rather than a prepossession hastily adopted probably only because you have met a young woman possessed of the usual accomplishments in a sequestered and romantic situation Let your part in this great and perilous drama rest upon conviction and not on a hurried and probably a temporary feeling Waverley attempted to reply but his words failed him Every sentiment that Flora had uttered vindicated the strength of his attachment for even her loyalty although wildly enthusiastic was generous and noble and disdained to avail itself of any indirect means of supporting the cause to which she was devoted After walking a little way in silence down the path Flora thus resumed the conversation One word more mister Waverley ere we bid farewell to this topic for ever and forgive my boldness if that word have the air of advice My brother Fergus is anxious that you should join him in his present enterprise But do not consent to this you could not by your single exertions further his success and you would inevitably share his fall if it be God s pleasure that fall he must Your character would also suffer irretrievably Let me beg you will return to your own country and having publicly freed yourself from every tie to the usurping government I trust you will see cause and find opportunity to serve your injured sovereign with effect and stand forth as your loyal ancestors at the head of your natural followers and adherents a worthy representative of the house of Waverley And should I be so happy as thus to distinguish myself might I not hope Forgive my interruption said Flora The present time only is ours and I can but explain to you with candour the feelings which I now entertain how they might be altered by a train of events too favourable perhaps to be hoped for it were in vain even to conjecture Only be assured mister Waverley that after my brother s honour and happiness there is none which I shall more sincerely pray for than for yours With these words she parted from him for they were now arrived where two paths separated Waverley reached the castle amidst a medley of conflicting passions He avoided any private interview with Fergus as he did not find himself able either to encounter his raillery or reply to his solicitations The wild revelry of the feast for Mac Ivor kept open table for his clan served in some degree to stun reflection When their festivity was ended he began to consider how he should again meet Miss Mac Ivor after the painful and interesting explanation of the morning But Flora did not appear Fergus whose eyes flashed when he was told by Cathleen that her mistress designed to keep her apartment that evening went himself in quest of her but apparently his remonstrances were in vain for he returned with a heightened complexion and manifest symptoms of displeasure The rest of the evening passed on without any allusion on the part either of Fergus or Waverley to the subject which engrossed the reflections of the latter and perhaps of both When retired to his own apartment Edward endeavoured to sum up the business of the day That the repulse he had received from Flora would be persisted in for the present there was no doubt But could he hope for ultimate success in case circumstances permitted the renewal of his suit Would the enthusiastic loyalty which at this animating moment left no room for a softer passion survive at least in its engrossing force the success or the failure of the present political machinations And if so could he hope that the interest which she had acknowledged him to possess in her favour might be improved into a warmer attachment He taxed his memory to recall every word she had used with the appropriate looks and gestures which had enforced them and ended by finding himself in the same state of uncertainty It was very late before sleep brought relief to the tumult of his mind after the most painful and agitating day which he had ever passed CHAPTER XXVIII A LETTER FROM TULLY VEOLAN In the morning when Waverley s troubled reflections had for some time given way to repose there came music to his dreams but not the voice of Selma He imagined himself transported back to Tully Veolan and that he heard Davie Gellatley singing in the court those matins which used generally to be the first sounds that disturbed his repose while a guest of the Baron of Bradwardine The notes which suggested this vision continued and waxed louder until Edward awoke in earnest The illusion however did not seem entirely dispelled The apartment was in the fortress of lan nan Chaistel but it was still the voice of Davie Gellatley that made the following lines resound under the window My heart s in the Highlands my heart is not here My heart s in the Highlands a chasing the deer A chasing the wild deer and following the roe My heart s in the Highlands wherever I go Footnote These lines form the burden of an old song to which Burns wrote additional verses Curious to know what could have determined mister Gellatley on an excursion of such unwonted extent Edward began to dress himself in all haste during which operation the minstrelsy of Davie changed its tune more than once There s nought in the Highlands but syboes and leeks And lang leggit callants gaun wanting the breeks Wanting the breeks and without hose and shoon But we ll a win the breeks when King Jamie comes hame Footnote These lines are also ancient and I believe to the tune of We ll never hae peace till Jamie comes hame to which Burns likewise wrote some verses By the time Waverley was dressed and had issued forth David had associated himself with two or three of the numerous Highland loungers who always graced the gates of the castle with their presence and was capering and dancing full merrily in the doubles and full career of a Scotch foursome reel to the music of his own whistling In this double capacity of dancer and musician he continued until an idle piper who observed his zeal obeyed the unanimous call of seid suas i e blow up and relieved him from the latter part of his trouble Young and old then mingled in the dance as they could find partners The appearance of Waverley did not interrupt David s exercise though he contrived by grinning nodding and throwing one or two inclinations of the body into the graces with which he performed the Highland fling to convey to our hero symptoms of recognition Then while busily employed in setting whooping all the while and snapping his fingers over his head he of a sudden prolonged his side step until it brought him to the place where Edward was standing and still keeping time to the music like Harlequin in a pantomime he thrust a letter into our hero s hand and continued his saltation without pause or intermission Edward who perceived that the address was in Rose s hand writing retired to peruse it leaving the faithful bearer to continue his exercise until the piper or he should be tired out The contents of the letter greatly surprised him It had originally commenced with Dear Sir but these words had been carefully erased and the monosyllable Sir substituted in their place The rest of the contents shall be given in Rose s own language I fear I am using an improper freedom by intruding upon you yet I cannot trust to any one else to let you know some things which have happened here with which it seems necessary you should be acquainted Forgive me if I am wrong in what I am doing for alas mister Waverley I have no better advice than that of my own feelings my dear father is gone from this place and when he can return to my assistance and protection God alone knows You have probably heard that in consequence of some troublesome news from the Highlands warrants were sent out for apprehending several gentlemen in these parts and among others my dear father In spite of all my tears and entreaties that he would surrender himself to the government he joined with mister Falconer and some other gentlemen and they have all gone northwards with a body of about forty horsemen So I am not so anxious concerning his immediate safety as about what may follow afterwards for these troubles are only beginning But all this is nothing to you mister Waverley only I thought you would be glad to learn that my father has escaped in case you happen to have heard that he was in danger The day after my father went off there came a party of soldiers to Tully Veolan and behaved very rudely to Bailie Macwheeble but the officer was very civil to me only said his duty obliged him to search for arms and papers My father had provided against this by taking away all the arms except the old useless things which hung in the hall and he had put all his papers out of the way But O mister Waverley how shall I tell you that they made strict inquiry after you and asked when you had been at Tully Veolan and where you now were The officer is gone back with his party but a non commissioned officer and four men remain as a sort of garrison in the house They have hitherto behaved very well as we are forced to keep them in good humour But these soldiers have hinted as if on your falling into their hands you would be in great danger I cannot prevail on myself to write what wicked falsehoods they said for I am sure they are falsehoods but you will best judge what you ought to do The party that returned carried off your servant prisoner with your two horses and everything that you left at Tully Veolan I hope God will protect you and that you will get safe home to England where you used to tell me there was no military violence nor fighting among clans permitted but everything was done according to an equal law that protected all who were harmless and innocent I hope you will exert your indulgence as to my boldness in writing to you where it seems to me though perhaps erroneously that your safety and honour are concerned I am sure at least I think my father would approve of my writing for mister Rubrick is fled to his cousin s at the Duchran to to be out of danger from the soldiers and the Whigs and Bailie Macwheeble does not like to meddle he says in other men s concerns though I hope what may serve my father s friend at such a time as this cannot be termed improper interference Farewell Captain Waverley I shall probaby never see you more for it would be very improper to wish you to call at Tully Veolan just now even if these men were gone but I will always remember with gratitude your kindness in assisting so poor a scholar as myself and your attentions to my dear dear father I remain your obliged servant ROSE COMYNE BRADWARDINE P S I hope you will send me a line by David Gellatley just to say you have received this and that you will take care of yourself and forgive me if I entreat you for your own sake to join none of these unhappy cabals but escape as fast as possible to your own fortunate country My compliments to my dear Flora and to Glennaquoich Is she not as handsome and accomplished as I have described her Thus concluded the letter of Rose Bradwardine the contents of which both surprised and affected Waverley That the Baron should fall under the suspicions of government in consequence of the present stir among the partisans of the house of Stuart seemed only the natural consequence of his political predilections but how HE himself should have been involved in such suspicions conscious that until yesterday he had been free from harbouring a thought against the prosperity of the reigning family seemed inexplicable Both at Tully Veolan and Glennaquoich his hosts had respected his engagements with the existing government and though enough passed by accidental innuendo that might induce him to reckon the Baron and the Chief among those disaffected gentlemen who were still numerous in Scotland yet until his own connection with the army had been broken off by the resumption of his commission he had no reason to suppose that they nourished any immediate or hostile attempts against the present establishment Still he was aware that unless he meant at once to embrace the proposal of Fergus Mac Ivor it would deeply concern him to leave the suspicious neighbourhood without delay and repair where his conduct might undergo a satisfactory examination Upon this he the rather determined as Flora s advice favoured his doing so and because he felt inexpressible repugnance at the idea of being accessary to the plague of civil war Whatever were the original rights of the Stuarts calm reflection told him that omitting the question how far James the Second could forfeit those of his posterity he had according to the united voice of the whole nation justly forfeited his own Since that period four monarchs had reigned in peace and glory over Britain sustaining and exalting the character of the nation abroad and its liberties at home Reason asked was it worth while to disturb a government so long settled and established and to plunge a kingdom into all the miseries of civil war for the purpose of replacing upon the throne the descendants of a monarch by whom it had been wilfully forfeited If on the other hand his own final conviction of the goodness of their cause or the commands of his father or uncle should recommend to him allegiance to the Stuarts still it was necessary to clear his own character by showing that he had not as seemed to be falsely insinuated taken any step to this purpose during his holding the commission of the reigning monarch The affectionate simplicity of Rose and her anxiety for his safety his sense too of her unprotected state and of the terror and actual dangers to which she might be exposed made an impression upon his mind and he instantly wrote to thank her in the kindest terms for her solicitude on his account to express his earnest good wishes for her welfare and that of her father and to assure her of his own safety The feelings which this task excited were speedily lost in the necessity which he now saw of bidding farewell to Flora Mac Ivor perhaps for ever The pang attending this reflection was inexpressible for her high minded elevation of character her self devotion to the cause which she had embraced united to her scrupulous rectitude as to the means of serving it had vindicated to his judgment the choice adopted by his passions But time pressed calumny was busy with his fame and every hour s delay increased the power to injure it His departure must be instant With this determination he sought out Fergus and communicated to him the contents of Rose s letter with his own resolution instantly to go to Edinburgh and put into the hands of some one or other of those persons of influence to whom he had letters from his father his exculpation from any charge which might be preferred against him You run your head into the lion s mouth answered Mac Ivor You do not know the severity of a government harassed by just apprehensions and a consciousness of their own illegality and insecurity I shall have to deliver you from some dungeon in Stirling or Edinburgh Castle My innocence my rank my father s intimacy with Lord M General G et cetera will be a sufficient protection said Waverley You will find the contrary replied the Chieftain these gentlemen will have enough to do about their own matters Once more will you take the plaid and stay a little while with us among the mists and the crows in the bravest cause ever sword was drawn in Footnote A Highland rhyme on Glencairn s Expedition in sixteen fifty has these lines We ll bide a while amang ta crows We ll wiske ta sword and bend ta bows For many reasons my dear Fergus you must hold me excused Well then said Mac Ivor I shall certainly find you exerting your poetical talents in elegies upon a prison or your antiquarian researches in detecting the Oggam Footnote The Oggam is a species of the old Irish character The idea of the correspondence betwixt the Celtic and Punic founded on a scene in Plautus was not started till General Vallancey set up his theory long after the date of Fergus Mac Ivor character or some Punic hieroglyphic upon the keystones of a vault curiously arched Or what say you to un petit pendement bien joli against which awkward ceremony I don t warrant you should you meet a body of the armed West Country Whigs And why should they use me so said Waverley For a hundred good reasons answered Fergus First you are an Englishman secondly a gentleman thirdly a prelatist abjured and fourthly they have not had an opportunity to exercise their talents on such a subject this long while But don t be cast down beloved all will be done in the fear of the Lord Well I must run my hazard You are determined then I am Wilful will do t said Fergus But you cannot go on foot and I shall want no horse as I must march on foot at the head of the children of Ivor you shall have brown Dermid If you will sell him I shall certainly be much obliged If your proud English heart cannot be obliged by a gift or loan I will not refuse money at the entrance of a campaign his price is twenty guineas Remember reader it was Sixty Years Since And when do you propose to depart The sooner the better answered Waverley You are right since go you must or rather since go you will I will take Flora s pony and ride with you as far as Bally Brough Callum Beg see that our horses are ready with a pony for yourself to attend and carry mister Waverley s baggage as far as naming a small town where he can have a horse and guide to Edinburgh Put on a Lowland dress Callum and see you keep your tongue close if you would not have me cut it out mister Waverley rides Dermid Then turning to Edward You will take leave of my sister Surely that is if Miss Mac Ivor will honour me so far Cathleen let my sister know mister Waverley wishes to bid her farewell before he leaves us But Rose Bradwardine her situation must be thought of I wish she were here And why should she not There are but four red coats at Tully Veolan and their muskets would be very useful to us To these broken remarks Edward made no answer his ear indeed received them but his soul was intent upon the expected entrance of Flora The door opened It was but Cathleen with her lady s excuse and wishes for Captain Waverley s health and happiness CHAPTER XXIX WAVERLEY S RECEPTION IN THE LOWLANDS AFTER HIS HIGHLAND TOUR It was noon when the two friends stood at the top of the pass of Bally Brough I must go no farther said Fergus Mac Ivor who during the journey had in vain endeavoured to raise his friend s spirits If my cross grained sister has any share in your dejection trust me she thinks highly of you though her present anxiety about the public cause prevents her listening to any other subject Confide your interest to me I will not betray it providing you do not again assume that vile cockade No fear of that considering the manner in which it has been recalled Adieu Fergus do not permit your sister to forget me And adieu Waverley you may soon hear of her with a prouder title Get home write letters and make friends as many and as fast as you can there will speedily be unexpected guests on the coast of Suffolk or my news from France has deceived me Footnote The sanguine Jacobites during the eventful years seventeen forty five forty six kept up the spirits of their party by the rumour of descents from France on behalf of the Chevalier saint George Thus parted the friends Fergus returning back to his castle while Edward followed by Callum Beg the latter transformed from point to point into a Low Country groom proceeded to the little town of Edward paced on under the painful and yet not altogether embittered feelings which separation and uncertainty produce in the mind of a youthful lover I am not sure if the ladies understand the full value of the influence of absence nor do I think it wise to teach it them lest like the Clelias and Mandanes of yore they should resume the humour of sending their lovers into banishment Distance in truth produces in idea the same effect as in real perspective Objects are softened and rounded and rendered doubly graceful the harsher and more ordinary points of character are mellowed down and those by which it is remembered are the more striking outlines that mark sublimity grace or beauty There are mists too in the mental as well as the natural horizon to conceal what is less pleasing in distant objects and there are happy lights to stream in full glory upon those points which can profit by brilliant illumination Waverley forgot Flora Mac Ivor s prejudices in her magnanimity and almost pardoned her indifference towards his affection when he recollected the grand and decisive object which seemed to fill her whole soul She whose sense of duty so wholly engrossed her in the cause of a benefactor what would be her feelings in favour of the happy individual who should be so fortunate as to awaken them Then came the doubtful question whether he might not be that happy man a question which fancy endeavoured to answer in the affirmative by conjuring up all she had said in his praise with the addition of a comment much more flattering than the text warranted All that was commonplace all that belonged to the every day world was melted away and obliterated in those dreams of imagination which only remembered with advantage the points of grace and dignity that distinguished Flora from the generality of her sex not the particulars which she held in common with them Edward was in short in the fair way of creating a goddess out of a high spirited accomplished and beautiful young woman and the time was wasted in castle building until at the descent of a steep hill he saw beneath him the market town of The Highland politeness of Callum Beg there are few nations by the way who can boast of so much natural politeness as the Highlanders Footnote The Highlander in former times had always a high idea of his own gentility and was anxious to impress the same upon those with whom he conversed His language abounded in the phrases of courtesy and compliment and the habit of carrying arms and mixing with those who did so made it particularly desirable they should use cautious politeness in their intercourse with each other the Highland civility of his attendant had not permitted him to disturb the reveries of our hero But observing him rouse himself at the sight of the village Callum pressed closer to his side and hoped when they cam to the public his honour wad not say nothing about Vich Ian Vohr for ta people were bitter Whigs deil burst tem Waverley assured the prudent page that he would be cautious and as he now distinguished not indeed the ringing of bells but the tinkling of something like a hammer against the side of an old mossy green inverted porridge pot that hung in an open booth of the size and shape of a parrot s cage erected to grace the east end of a building resembling an old barn he asked Callum Beg if it were Sunday Could na say just preceesely Sunday seldom cam aboon the pass of Bally Brough On entering the town however and advancing towards the most apparent public house which presented itself the numbers of old women in tartan screens and red cloaks who streamed from the barn resembling building debating as they went the comparative merits of the blessed youth Jabesh Rentowel and that chosen vessel Maister Goukthrapple induced Callum to assure his temporary master that it was either ta muckle Sunday hersell or ta little government Sunday that they ca d ta fast On alighting at the sign of the Seven branched Golden Candlestick which for the further delectation of the guests was graced with a short Hebrew motto they were received by mine host a tall thin puritanical figure who seemed to debate with himself whether he ought to give shelter to those who travelled on such a day Reflecting however in all probability that he possessed the power of mulcting them for this irregularity a penalty which they might escape by passing into Gregor Duncanson s at the sign of the Highlander and the Hawick Gill mister Ebenezer Cruickshanks condescended to admit them into his dwelling To this sanctified person Waverley addressed his request that he would procure him a guide with a saddle horse to carry his portmanteau to Edinburgh And whar may ye be coming from demanded mine host of the Candlestick I have told you where I wish to go I do not conceive any further information necessary either for the guide or his saddle horse Hem Ahem returned he of the Candlestick somewhat disconcerted at this rebuff It s the general fast sir and I cannot enter into ony carnal transactions on sic a day when the people should be humbled and the backsliders should return as worthy mister Goukthrapple said and moreover when as the precious mister Jabesh Rentowel did weel observe the land was mourning for covenants burnt broken and buried My good friend said Waverley if you cannot let me have a horse and guide my servant shall seek them elsewhere Aweel Your servant and what for gangs he not forward wi you himsell Waverley had but very little of a captain of horse s spirit within him I mean of that sort of spirit which I have been obliged to when I happened in a mail coach or diligence to meet some military man who has kindly taken upon him the disciplining of the waiters and the taxing of reckonings Some of this useful talent our hero had however acquired during his military service and on this gross provocation it began seriously to arise Look ye sir I came here for my own accommodation and not to answer impertinent questions Either say you can or cannot get me what I want I shall pursue my course in either case mister Ebenezer Cruickshanks left the room with some indistinct mutterings but whether negative or acquiescent Edward could not well distinguish The hostess a civil quiet laborious drudge came to take his orders for dinner but declined to make answer on the subject of the horse and guide for the Salique law it seems extended to the stables of the Golden Candlestick From a window which overlooked the dark and narrow court in which Callum Beg rubbed down the horses after their journey Waverley heard the following dialogue betwixt the subtle foot page of Vich Ian Vohr and his landlord Ye ll be frae the north young man began the latter And ye may say that answered Callum And ye ll hae ridden a lang way the day it may weel be Sae lang that I could weel tak a dram Gudewife bring the gill stoup Here some compliments passed fitting the occasion when my host of the Golden Candlestick having as he thought opened his guest s heart by this hospitable propitiation resumed his scrutiny Ye ll no hae mickle better whisky than that aboon the Pass I am nae frae aboon the Pass Ye re a Highlandman by your tongue Na I am but just Aberdeen a way And did your master come frae Aberdeen wi you Ay that s when I left it mysell answered the cool and impenetrable Callum Beg And what kind of a gentleman is he I believe he is ane o King George s state officers at least he s aye for ganging on to the south and he has a hantle siller and never grudges onything till a poor body or in the way of a lawing He wants a guide and a horse frae hence to Edinburgh Ay and ye maun find it him forthwith Ahem It will be chargeable He cares na for that a bodle Aweel Duncan did ye say your name was Duncan or Donald Na man Jamie Jamie Steenson I telt ye before This last undaunted parry altogether foiled mister Cruickshanks who though not quite satisfied either with the reserve of the master or the extreme readiness of the man was contented to lay a tax on the reckoning and horse hire that might compound for his ungratified curiosity The circumstance of its being the fast day was not forgotten in the charge which on the whole did not however amount to much more than double what in fairness it should have been Callum Beg soon after announced in person the ratification of this treaty adding Ta auld deevil was ganging to ride wi ta duinhe wassel hersell That will not be very pleasant Callum nor altogether safe for our host seems a person of great curiosity but a traveller must submit to these inconveniences Meanwhile my good lad here is a trifle for you to drink Vich Ian Vohr s health The hawk s eye of Callum flashed delight upon a golden guinea with which these last words were accompanied He hastened not without a curse on the intricacies of a Saxon breeches pocket or spleuchan as he called it to deposit the treasure in his fob and then as if he conceived the benevolence called for some requital on his part he gathered close up to Edward with an expression of countenance peculiarly knowing and spoke in an undertone If his honour thought ta auld deevil Whig carle was a bit dangerous she could easily provide for him and teil ane ta wiser How and in what manner Her ain sell replied Callum could wait for him a wee bit frae the toun and kittle his quarters wi her skene occle Skene occle what s that Callum unbuttoned his coat raised his left arm and with an emphatic nod pointed to the hilt of a small dirk snugly deposited under it in the lining of his jacket Waverley thought he had misunderstood his meaning he gazed in his face and discovered in Callum s very handsome though embrowned features just the degree of roguish malice with which a lad of the same age in England would have brought forward a plan for robbing an orchard Good God Callum would you take the man s life Indeed answered the young desperado and I think he has had just a lang enough lease o t when he s for betraying honest folk that come to spend siller at his public Edward saw nothing was to be gained by argument and therefore contented himself with enjoining Callum to lay aside all practices against the person of mister Ebenezer Cruickshanks in which injunction the page seemed to acquiesce with an air of great indifference Ta duinhe wassel might please himsell ta auld rudas loon had never done Callum nae ill But here s a bit line frae ta Tighearna tat he bade me gie your honour ere I came back The letter from the Chief contained Flora s lines on the fate of Captain Wogan whose enterprising character is so well drawn by Clarendon He had originally engaged in the service of the Parliament but had abjured that party upon the execution of Charles I and upon hearing that the royal standard was set up by the Earl of Glencairn and General Middleton in the Highlands of Scotland took leave of Charles II who was then at Paris passed into England assembled a body of Cavaliers in the neighbourhood of London and traversed the kingdom which had been so long under domination of the usurper by marches conducted with such skill dexterity and spirit that he safely united his handful of horsemen with the body of Highlanders then in arms After several months of desultory warfare in which Wogan s skill and courage gained him the highest reputation he had the misfortune to be wounded in a dangerous manner and no surgical assistance being within reach he terminated his short but glorious career There were obvious reasons why the politic Chieftain was desirous to place the example of this young hero under the eye of Waverley with whose romantic disposition it coincided so peculiarly But his letter turned chiefly upon some trifling commissions which Waverley had promised to execute for him in England and it was only toward the conclusion that Edward found these words I owe Flora a grudge for refusing us her company yesterday and as I am giving you the trouble of reading these lines in order to keep in your memory your promise to procure me the fishing tackle and cross bow from London I will enclose her verses on the Grave of Wogan This I know will tease her for to tell you the truth I think her more in love with the memory of that dead hero than she is likely to be with any living one unless he shall tread a similar path But English squires of our day keep their oak trees to shelter their deer parks or repair the losses of an evening at White s and neither invoke them to wreathe their brows nor shelter their graves Let me hope for one brilliant exception in a dear friend to whom I would most gladly give a dearer title The verses were inscribed To an Oak Tree In the Church Yard of in the Highlands of Scotland said to mark the Grave of Captain Wogan killed in sixteen forty nine Emblem of England s ancient faith Full proudly may thy branches wave Where loyalty lies low in death And valour fills a timeless grave And thou brave tenant of the tomb Repine not if our clime deny Above thine honour d sod to bloom The flowerets of a milder sky These owe their birth to genial May Beneath a fiercer sun they pine Before the winter storm decay And can their worth be type of thine No for mid storms of Fate opposing Still higher swell d thy dauntless heart And while Despair the scene was closing Commenced thy brief but brilliant part T was then thou sought saint on Albyn s hill When England s sons the strife resign d A rugged race resisting still And unsubdued though unrefined Thy death s hour heard no kindred wail No holy knell thy requiem rung Thy mourners were the plaided Gael Thy dirge the clamourous pibroch sung Yet who in Fortune s summer shine To waste life s longest term away Would change that glorious dawn of thine Though darken d ere its noontide day Be thine the tree whose dauntless boughs Brave summer s drought and winter s gloom Rome bound with oak her patriots brows As Albyn shadows Wogan s tomb Whatever might be the real merit of Flora Mac Ivor s poetry the enthusiasm which it intimated was well calculated to make a corresponding impression upon her lover The lines were read read again then deposited in Waverley s bosom then again drawn out and read line by line in a low and smothered voice and with frequent pauses which prolonged the mental treat as an epicure protracts by sipping slowly the enjoyment of a delicious beverage The entrance of missus Cruickshanks with the sublunary articles of dinner and wine hardly interrupted this pantomime of affectionate enthusiasm At length the tall ungainly figure and ungracious visage of Ebenezer presented themselves The upper part of his form notwithstanding the season required no such defence was shrouded in a large great coat belted over his under habiliments and crested with a huge cowl of the same stuff which when drawn over the head and hat completely overshadowed both and being buttoned beneath the chin was called a trot cozy His hand grasped a huge jockey whip garnished with brassmounting His thin legs tenanted a pair of gambadoes fastened at the sides with rusty clasps Thus accoutred he stalked into the midst of the apartment and announced his errand in brief phrase Yer horses are ready You go with me yourself then landlord I do as far as Perth where ye may be supplied with a guide to Embro as your occasions shall require Thus saying he placed under Waverley s eye the bill which he held in his hand and at the same time self invited filled a glass of wine and drank devoutly to a blessing on their journey Waverley stared at the man s impudence but as their connection was to be short and promised to be convenient he made no observation upon it and having paid his reckoning expressed his intention to depart immediately He mounted Dermid accordingly and sallied forth from the Golden Candlestick followed by the puritanical figure we have described after he had at the expense of some time and difficulty and by the assistance of a louping on stane or structure of masonry erected for the traveller s convenience in front of the house elevated his person to the back of a long backed raw boned thin gutted phantom of a broken down blood horse on which Waverley s portmanteau was deposited Our hero though not in a very gay humour could hardly help laughing at the appearance of his new squire and at imagining the astonishment which his person and equipage would have excited at Waverley Honour Edward s tendency to mirth did not escape mine host of the Candlestick who conscious of the cause infused a double portion of souring into the pharisaical leaven of his countenance and resolved internally that in one way or other the young Englisher should pay dearly for the contempt with which he seemed to regard him Callum also stood at the gate and enjoyed with undissembled glee the ridiculous figure of mister Cruickshanks As Waverley passed him he pulled off his hat respectfully and approaching his stirrup bade him Tak heed the auld whig deevil played him nae cantrip Waverley once more thanked and bade him farewell and then rode briskly onward not sorry to be out of hearing of the shouts of the children as they beheld old Ebenezer rise and sink in his stirrups to avoid the concussions occasioned by a hard trot upon a half paved street The village of was soon several miles behind him CHAPTER XXX SHOWS THAT THE LOSS OF A HORSE S SHOE MAY BE A SERIOUS INCONVENIENCE The manner and air of Waverley but above all the glittering contents of his purse and the indifference with which he seemed to regard them somewhat overawed his companion and deterred him from making any attempts to enter upon conversation His own reflections were moreover agitated by various surmises and by plans of self interest with which these were intimately connected The travellers journeyed therefore in silence until it was interrupted by the annunciation on the part of the guide that his naig had lost a fore foot shoe which doubtless his honour would consider it was his part to replace This was what lawyers call a fishing question calculated to ascertain how far Waverley was disposed to submit to petty imposition My part to replace your horse s shoe you rascal said Waverley mistaking the purport of the intimation Indubitably answered mister Cruickshanks though there was no preceese clause to that effect it canna be expected that I am to pay for the casualties whilk may befall the puir naig while in your honour s service Nathless if your honour O you mean I am to pay the farrier but where shall we find one Rejoiced at discerning there would be no objection made on the part of his temporary master mister Cruickshanks assured him that Cairnvreckan a village which they were about to enter was happy in an excellent blacksmith but as he was a professor he would drive a nail for no man on the Sabbath or kirk fast unless it were in a case of absolute necessity for which he always charged sixpence each shoe The most important part of this communication in the opinion of the speaker made a very slight impression on the hearer who only internally wondered what college this veterinary professor belonged to not aware that the word was used to denote any person who pretended to uncommon sanctity of faith and manner As they entered the village of Cairnvreckan they speedily distinguished the smith s house Being also a public it was two stories high and proudly reared its crest covered with grey slate above the thatched hovels by which it was surrounded The adjoining smithy betokened none of the Sabbatical silence and repose which Ebenezer had augured from the sanctity of his friend On the contrary hammer clashed and anvil rang the bellows groaned and the whole apparatus of Vulcan appeared to be in full activity Nor was the labour of a rural and pacific nature The master smith benempt as his sign intimated John Mucklewrath with two assistants toiled busily in arranging repairing and furbishing old muskets pistols and swords which lay scattered around his workshop in military confusion The open shed containing the forge was crowded with persons who came and went as if receiving and communicating important news and a single glance at the aspect of the people who traversed the street in haste or stood assembled in groups with eyes elevated and hands uplifted announced that some extraordinary intelligence was agitating the public mind of the municipality of Cairnvreckan There is some news said mine host of the Candlestick pushing his lantern jawed visage and bare boned nag rudely forward into the crowd there is some news and if it please my Creator I will forthwith obtain speirings thereof Waverley with better regulated curiosity than his attendant s dismounted and gave his horse to a boy who stood idling near It arose perhaps from the shyness of his character in early youth that he felt dislike at applying to a stranger even for casual information without previously glancing at his physiognomy and appearance While he looked about in order to select the person with whom he would most willingly hold communication the buzz around saved him in some degree the trouble of interrogatories The names of Lochiel Clanronald Glengarry and other distinguished Highland Chiefs among whom Vich Ian Vohr was repeatedly mentioned were as familiar in men s mouths as household words and from the alarm generally expressed he easily conceived that their descent into the Lowlands at the head of their armed tribes had either already taken place or was instantly apprehended Ere Waverley could ask particulars a strong large boned hard featured woman about forty dressed as if her clothes had been flung on with a pitchfork her cheeks flushed with a scarlet red where they were not smutted with soot and lamp black jostled through the crowd and brandishing high a child of two years old which she danced in her arms without regard to its screams of terror sang forth with all her might Charlie is my darling my darling my darling Charlie is my darling The young Chevalier D ye hear what s come ower ye now continued the virago ye whingeing Whig carles D ye hear wha s coming to cow yer cracks Little wot ye wha s coming Little wot ye wha s coming A the wild Macraws are coming The Vulcan of Cairnvreckan who acknowledged his Venus in this exulting Bacchante regarded her with a grim and ire foreboding countenance while some of the senators of the village hastened to interpose Whisht gudewife is this a time or is this a day to be singing your ranting fule sangs in a time when the wine of wrath is poured out without mixture in the cup of indignation and a day when the land should give testimony against popery and prelacy and quakerism and independency and supremacy and erastianism and antinomianism and a the errors of the church And that s a your Whiggery reechoed the Jacobite heroine that s a your Whiggery and your presbytery ye cut lugged graning carles What d ye think the lads wi the kilts will care for yer synods and yer presbyteries and yer buttock mail and yer stool o repentance Vengeance on the black face o t mony an honester woman s been set upon it than streeks doon beside ony Whig in the country I mysell Here John Mucklewrath who dreaded her entering upon a detail of personal experience interposed his matrimonial authority Gae hame and be d that I should say sae and put on the sowens for supper And you ye doil d dotard replied his gentle helpmate her wrath which had hitherto wandered abroad over the whole assembly being at once and violently impelled into its natural channel YE stand there hammering dog heads for fules that will never snap them at a Highlandman instead of earning bread for your family and shoeing this winsome young gentleman s horse that s just come frae the north I se warrant him nane of your whingeing King George folk but a gallant Gordon at the least o him The eyes of the assembly were now turned upon Waverley who took the opportunity to beg the smith to shoe his guide s horse with all speed as he wished to proceed on his journey for he had heard enough to make him sensible that there would be danger in delaying long in this place The smith s eyes rested on him with a look of displeasure and suspicion not lessened by the eagerness with which his wife enforced Waverley s mandate D ye hear what the weel favoured young gentleman says ye drunken ne er do good And what may your name be sir quoth Mucklewrath It is of no consequence to you my friend provided I pay your labour But it may be of consequence to the state sir replied an old farmer smelling strongly of whisky and peat smoke and I doubt we maun delay your journey till you have seen the Laird You certainly said Waverley haughtily will find it both difficult and dangerous to detain me unless you can produce some proper authority There was a pause and a whisper among the crowd Secretary Murray Lord Lewis Gordon Maybe the Chevalier himsell Such were the surmises that passed hurriedly among them and there was obviously an increased disposition to resist Waverley s departure He attempted to argue mildly with them but his voluntary ally missus Mucklewrath broke in upon and drowned his expostulations taking his part with an abusive violence which was all set down to Edward s account by those on whom it was bestowed YE LL stop ony gentleman that s the Prince s freend for she too though with other feelings had adopted the general opinion respecting Waverley I daur ye to touch him spreading abroad her long and muscular fingers garnished with claws which a vulture might have envied I ll set my ten commandments in the face o the first loon that lays a finger on him Gae hame gudewife quoth the farmer aforesaid it wad better set you to be nursing the gudeman s bairns than to be deaving us here HIS bairns retorted the Amazon regarding her husband with a grin of ineffable contempt HIS bairns O gin ye were dead gudeman And a green turf on your head gudeman Then I wad ware my widowhood Upon a ranting Highlandman This canticle which excited a suppressed titter among the younger part of the audience totally overcame the patience of the taunted man of the anvil Deil be in me but I ll put this het gad down her throat cried he in an ecstasy of wrath snatching a bar from the forge and he might have executed his threat had he not been withheld by a part of the mob while the rest endeavoured to force the termagant out of his presence Waverley meditated a retreat in the confusion but his horse was nowhere to be seen At length he observed at some distance his faithful attendant Ebenezer who as soon as he had perceived the turn matters were likely to take had withdrawn both horses from the press and mounted on the one and holding the other answered the loud and repeated calls of Waverley for his horse Na na if ye are nae friend to kirk and the king and are detained as siccan a person ye maun answer to honest men of the country for breach of contract and I maun keep the naig and the walise for damage and expense in respect my horse and mysell will lose to morrow s day s wark besides the afternoon preaching Edward out of patience hemmed in and hustled by the rabble on every side and every moment expecting personal violence resolved to try measures of intimidation and at length drew a pocket pistol threatening on the one hand to shoot whomsoever dared to stop him and on the other menacing Ebenezer with a similar doom if he stirred a foot with the horses The sapient Partridge says that one man with a pistol is equal to a hundred unarmed because though he can shoot but one of the multitude yet no one knows but that he himself may be that luckless individual The levy en masse of Cairnvreckan would therefore probably have given way nor would Ebenezer whose natural paleness had waxed three shades more cadaverous have ventured to dispute a mandate so enforced had not the Vulcan of the village eager to discharge upon some more worthy object the fury which his helpmate had provoked and not ill satisfied to find such an object in Waverley rushed at him with the red hot bar of iron with such determination as made the discharge of his pistol an act of self defence The unfortunate man fell and while Edward thrilled with a natural horror at the incident neither had presence of mind to unsheathe his sword nor to draw his remaining pistol the populace threw themselves upon him disarmed him and were about to use him with great violence when the appearance of a venerable clergyman the pastor of the parish put a curb on their fury This worthy man none of the Goukthrapples or Rentowels maintained his character with the common people although he preached the practical fruits of Christian faith as well as its abstract tenets and was respected by the higher orders notwithstanding he declined soothing their speculative errors by converting the pulpit of the gospel into a school of heathen morality Perhaps it is owing to this mixture of faith and practice in his doctrine that although his memory has formed a sort of era in the annals of Cairnvreckan so that the parishioners to denote what befell Sixty Years Since still say it happened in good mister Morton s time I have never been able to discover which he belonged to the evangelical or the moderate party in the kirk Nor do I hold the circumstance of much moment since in my own remembrance the one was headed by an Erskine the other by a Robertson Footnote The Reverend John Erskine D D an eminent Scottish divine and a most excellent man headed the Evangelical party in the Church of Scotland at the time when the celebrated Doctor Robertson the historian was the leader of the Moderate party These two distinguished persons were colleagues in the Old Grey Friars Church Edinburgh and however much they differed in church politics preserved the most perfect harmony as private friends and as clergymen serving the same cure mister Morton had been alarmed by the discharge of the pistol and the increasing hubbub around the smithy His first attention after he had directed the bystanders to detain Waverley but to abstain from injuring him was turned to the body of Mucklewrath over which his wife in a revulsion of feeling was weeping howling and tearing her elf locks in a state little short of distraction On raising up the smith the first discovery was that he was alive and the next that he was likely to live as long as if he had never heard the report of a pistol in his life He had made a narrow escape however the bullet had grazed his head and stunned him for a moment or two which trance terror and confusion of spirit had prolonged somewhat longer He now arose to demand vengeance on the person of Waverley and with difficulty acquiesced in the proposal of mister Morton that he should be carried before the Laird as a justice of peace and placed at his disposal The rest of the assistants unanimously agreed to the measure recommended even missus Mucklewrath who had begun to recover from her hysterics whimpered forth She wadna say naething against what the minister proposed he was e en ower gude for his trade and she hoped to see him wi a dainty decent bishop s gown on his back a comelier sight than your Geneva cloaks and bands I wis All controversy being thus laid aside Waverley escorted by the whole inhabitants of the village who were not bed ridden was conducted to the house of Cairnvreckan which was about half a mile distant CHAPTER XXXI AN EXAMINATION Major Melville of Cairnvreckan an elderly gentleman who had spent his youth in the military service received mister Morton with great kindness and our hero with civility which the equivocal circumstances wherein Edward was placed rendered constrained and distant The nature of the smith s hurt was inquired into and as the actual injury was likely to prove trifling and the circumstances in which it was received rendered the infliction on Edward s part a natural act of self defence the Major conceived he might dismiss that matter on Waverley s depositing in his hands a small sum for the benefit of the wounded person I could wish sir continued the Major that my duty terminated here but it is necessary that we should have some further inquiry into the cause of your journey through the country at this unfortunate and distracted time mister Ebenezer Cruickshanks now stood forth and communicated to the magistrate all he knew or suspected from the reserve of Waverley and the evasions of Callum Beg The horse upon which Edward rode he said he knew to belong to Vich Ian Vohr though he dared not tax Edward s former attendant with the fact lest he should have his house and stables burnt over his head some night by that godless gang the Mac Ivors He concluded by exaggerating his own services to kirk and state as having been the means under God as he modestly qualified the assertion of attaching this suspicious and formidable delinquent He intimated hopes of future reward and of instant reimbursement for loss of time and even of character by travelling on the state business on the fast day To this Major Melville answered with great composure that so far from claiming any merit in this affair mister Cruickshanks ought to deprecate the imposition of a very heavy fine for neglecting to lodge in terms of the recent proclamation an account with the nearest magistrate of any stranger who came to his inn that as mister Cruickshanks boasted so much of religion and loyalty he should not impute this conduct to disaffection but only suppose that his zeal for kirk and state had been lulled asleep by the opportunity of charging a stranger with double horse hire that however feeling himself incompetent to decide singly upon the conduct of a person of such importance he should reserve it for consideration of the next quarter sessions Now our history for the present saith no more of him of the Candlestick who wended dolorous and malcontent back to his own dwelling Major Melville then commanded the villagers to return to their homes excepting two who officiated as constables and whom he directed to wait below The apartment was thus cleared of every person but mister Morton whom the Major invited to remain a sort of factor who acted as clerk and Waverley himself There ensued a painful and embarrassed pause till Major Melville looking upon Waverley with much compassion and often consulting a paper or memorandum which he held in his hand requested to know his name Edward Waverley I thought so late of the dragoons and nephew of Sir Everard Waverley of Waverley Honour The same Young gentleman I am extremely sorry that this painful duty has fallen to my lot Duty Major Melville renders apologies superfluous True sir permit me therefore to ask you how your time has been disposed of since you obtained leave of absence from your regiment several weeks ago until the present moment My reply said Waverley to so general a question must be guided by the nature of the charge which renders it necessary I request to know what that charge is and upon what authority I am forcibly detained to reply to it The charge mister Waverley I grieve to say is of a very high nature and affects your character both as a soldier and a subject In the former capacity you are charged with spreading mutiny and rebellion among the men you commanded and setting them the example of desertion by prolonging your own absence from the regiment contrary to the express orders of your commanding officer The civil crime of which you stand accused is that of high treason and levying war against the king the highest delinquency of which a subject can be guilty And by what authority am I detained to reply to such heinous calumnies By one which you must not dispute nor I disobey He handed to Waverley a warrant from the Supreme Criminal Court of Scotland in full form for apprehending and securing the person of Edward Waverley esquire suspected of treasonable practices and other high crimes and misdemeanours The astonishment which Waverley expressed at this communication was imputed by Major Melville to conscious guilt while mister Morton was rather disposed to construe it into the surprise of innocence unjustly suspected There was something true in both conjectures for although Edward s mind acquitted him of the crime with which he was charged yet a hasty review of his own conduct convinced him he might have great difficulty in establishing his innocence to the satisfaction of others It is a very painful part of this painful business said Major Melville after a pause that under so grave a charge I must necessarily request to see such papers as you have on your person You shall sir without reserve said Edward throwing his pocket book and memorandums upon the table there is but one with which I could wish you would dispense I am afraid mister Waverley I can indulge you with no reservation You shall see it then sir and as it can be of no service I beg it may be returned He took from his bosom the lines he had that morning received and presented them with the envelope The Major perused them in silence and directed his clerk to make a copy of them He then wrapped the copy in the envelope and placing it on the table before him returned the original to Waverley with an air of melancholy gravity After indulging the prisoner for such our hero must now be considered with what he thought a reasonable time for reflection Major Melville resumed his examination premising that as mister Waverley seemed to object to general questions his interrogatories should be as specific as his information permitted He then proceeded in his investigation dictating as he went on the import of the questions and answers to the amanuensis by whom it was written down Did mister Waverley know one Humphry Houghton a non commissioned officer in Gardiner s dragoons Certainly he was sergeant of my troop and son of a tenant of my uncle Exactly and had a considerable share of your confidence and an influence among his comrades I had never occasion to repose confidence in a person of his description answered Waverley I favoured Sergeant Houghton as a clever active young fellow and I believe his fellow soldiers respected him accordingly But you used through this man answered Major Melville to communicate with such of your troop as were recruited upon Waverley Honour Certainly the poor fellows finding themselves in a regiment chiefly composed of Scotch or Irish looked up to me in any of their little distresses and naturally made their countryman and sergeant their spokesman on such occasions Sergeant Houghton s influence continued the Major extended then particularly over those soldiers who followed you to the regiment from your uncle s estate Surely but what is that to the present purpose To that I am just coming and I beseech your candid reply Have you since leaving the regiment held any correspondence direct or indirect with this Sergeant Houghton I I hold correspondence with a man of his rank and situation How or for what purpose That you are to explain But did you not for example send to him for some books You remind me of a trifling commission said Waverley which I gave Sergeant Houghton because my servant could not read I do recollect I bade him by letter select some books of which I sent him a list and send them to me at Tully Veolan And of what description were those books They related almost entirely to elegant literature they were designed for a lady s perusal Were there not mister Waverley treasonable tracts and pamphlets among them There were some political treatises into which I hardly looked They had been sent to me by the officiousness of a kind friend whose heart is more to be esteemed than his prudence or political sagacity they seemed to be dull compositions That friend continued the persevering inquirer was a mister Pembroke a nonjuring clergyman the author of two treasonable works of which the manuscripts were found among your baggage But of which I give you my honour as a gentleman replied Waverley I never read six pages I am not your judge mister Waverley your examination will be transmitted elsewhere And now to proceed Do you know a person that passes by the name of Wily Will or Will Ruthven I never heard of such a name till this moment Did you never through such a person or any other person communicate with Sergeant Humphry Houghton instigating him to desert with as many of his comrades as he could seduce to join him and unite with the Highlanders and other rebels now in arms under the command of the Young Pretender I assure you I am not only entirely guiltless of the plot you have laid to my charge but I detest it from the very bottom of my soul nor would I be guilty of such treachery to gain a throne either for myself or any other man alive Yet when I consider this envelope in the handwriting of one of those misguided gentlemen who are now in arms against their country and the verses which it enclosed I cannot but find some analogy between the enterprise I have mentioned and the exploit of Wogan which the writer seems to expect you should imitate Waverley was struck with the coincidence but denied that the wishes or expectations of the letter writer were to be regarded as proofs of a charge otherwise chimerical But if I am rightly informed your time was spent during your absence from the regiment between the house of this Highland Chieftain and that of mister Bradwardine of Bradwardine also in arms for this unfortunate cause I do not mean to disguise it but I do deny most resolutely being privy to any of their designs against the government You do not however I presume intend to deny that you attended your host Glennaquoich to a rendezvous where under a pretence of a general hunting match most of the accomplices of his treason were assembled to concert measures for taking arms I acknowledge having been at such a meeting said Waverley but I neither heard nor saw anything which could give it the character you affix to it From thence you proceeded continued the magistrate with Glennaquoich and a part of his clan to join the army of the Young Pretender and returned after having paid your homage to him to discipline and arm the remainder and unite them to his bands on their way southward I never went with Glennaquoich on such an errand I never so much as heard that the person whom you mention was in the country He then detailed the history of his misfortune at the hunting match and added that on his return he found himself suddenly deprived of his commission and did not deny that he then for the first time observed symptoms which indicated a disposition in the Highlanders to take arms but added that having no inclination to join their cause and no longer any reason for remaining in Scotland he was now on his return to his native country to which he had been summoned by those who had a right to direct his motions as Major Melville would perceive from the letters on the table Major Melville accordingly perused the letters of Richard Waverley of Sir Everard and of Aunt Rachel but the inferences he drew from them were different from what Waverley expected They held the language of discontent with government threw out no obscure hints of revenge and that of poor Aunt Rachel which plainly asserted the justice of the Stuart cause was held to contain the open avowal of what the others only ventured to insinuate Permit me another question mister Waverley said Major Melville Did you not receive repeated letters from your commanding officer warning you and commanding you to return to your post and acquainting you with the use made of your name to spread discontent among your soldiers I never did Major Melville One letter indeed I received from him containing a civil intimation of his wish that I would employ my leave of absence otherwise than in constant residence at Bradwardine as to which I own I thought he was not called on to interfere and finally I received on the same day on which I observed myself superseded in the Gazette a second letter from Colonel Gardiner commanding me to join the regiment an order which owing to my absence already mentioned and accounted for I received too late to be obeyed If there were any intermediate letters and certainly from the Colonel s high character I think it probable that there were they have never reached me I have omitted mister Waverley continued Major Melville to inquire after a matter of less consequence but which has nevertheless been publicly talked of to your disadvantage It is said that a treasonable toast having been proposed in your hearing and presence you holding his Majesty s commission suffered the task of resenting it to devolve upon another gentleman of the company This sir cannot be charged against you in a court of justice but if as I am informed the officers of your regiment requested an explanation of such a rumour as a gentleman and soldier I cannot but be surprised that you did not afford it to them This was too much Beset and pressed on every hand by accusations in which gross falsehoods were blended with such circumstances of truth as could not fail to procure them credit alone unfriended and in a strange land Waverley almost gave up his life and honour for lost and leaning his head upon his hand resolutely refused to answer any further questions since the fair and candid statement he had already made had only served to furnish arms against him Without expressing either surprise or displeasure at the change in Waverley s manner Major Melville proceeded composedly to put several other queries to him What does it avail me to answer you said Edward sullenly You appear convinced of my guilt and wrest every reply I have made to support your own preconceived opinion Enjoy your supposed triumph then and torment me no further If I am capable of the cowardice and treachery your charge burdens me with I am not worthy to be believed in any reply I can make to you If I am not deserving of your suspicion and God and my own conscience bear evidence with me that it is so then I do not see why I should by my candour lend my accusers arms against my innocence There is no reason I should answer a word more and I am determined to abide by this resolution And again he resumed his posture of sullen and determined silence Allow me said the magistrate to remind you of one reason that may suggest the propriety of a candid and open confession The inexperience of youth mister Waverley lays it open to the plans of the more designing and artful and one of your friends at least I mean Mac Ivor of Glennaquoich ranks high in the latter class as from your apparent ingenuousness youth and unacquaintance with the manners of the Highlands I should be disposed to place you among the former In such a case a false step or error like yours which I shall be happy to consider as involuntary may be atoned for and I would willingly act as intercessor But as you must necessarily be acquainted with the strength of the individuals in this country who have assumed arms with their means and with their plans I must expect you will merit this mediation on my part by a frank and candid avowal of all that has come to your knowledge upon these heads in which case I think I can venture to promise that a very short personal restraint will be the only ill consequence that can arise from your accession to these unhappy intrigues Waverley listened with great composure until the end of this exhortation when springing from his seat with an energy he had not yet displayed he replied Major Melville since that is your name I have hitherto answered your questions with candour or declined them with temper because their import concerned myself alone but as you presume to esteem me mean enough to commence informer against others who received me whatever may be their public misconduct as a guest and friend I declare to you that I consider your questions as an insult infinitely more offensive than your calumnious suspicions and that since my hard fortune permits me no other mode of resenting them than by verbal defiance you should sooner have my heart out of my bosom than a single syllable of information on subjects which I could only become acquainted with in the full confidence of unsuspecting hospitality mister Morton and the Major looked at each other and the former who in the course of the examination had been repeatedly troubled with a sorry rheum had recourse to his snuff box and his handkerchief mister Waverley said the Major my present situation prohibits me alike from giving or receiving offence and I will not protract a discussion which approaches to either I am afraid I must sign a warrant for detaining you in custody but this house shall for the present be your prison I fear I cannot persuade you to accept a share of our supper Edward shook his head but I will order refreshments in your apartment Our hero bowed and withdrew under guard of the officers of justice to a small but handsome room where declining all offers of food or wine he flung himself on the bed and stupified by the harassing events and mental fatigue of this miserable day he sunk into a deep and heavy slumber This was more than he himself could have expected but it is mentioned of the North American Indians when at the stake of torture that on the least intermission of agony they will sleep until the fire is applied to awaken them CHAPTER XXXII A CONFERENCE AND THE CONSEQUENCE Major Melville had detained mister Morton during his examination of Waverley both because he thought he might derive assistance from his practical good sense and approved loyalty and also because it was agreeable to have a witness of unimpeached candour and veracity to proceedings which touched the honour and safety of a young Englishman of high rank and family and the expectant heir of a large fortune Every step he knew would be rigorously canvassed and it was his business to place the justice and integrity of his own conduct beyond the limits of question When Waverley retired the laird and clergyman of Cairnvreckan sat down in silence to their evening meal While the servants were in attendance neither chose to say anything on the circumstances which occupied their minds and neither felt it easy to speak upon any other The youth and apparent frankness of Waverley stood in strong contrast to the shades of suspicion which darkened around him and he had a sort of naivete and openness of demeanour that seemed to belong to one unhackneyed in the ways of intrigue and which pleaded highly in his favour Each mused over the particulars of the examination and each viewed it through the medium of his own feelings Both were men of ready and acute talent and both were equally competent to combine various parts of evidence and to deduce from them the necessary conclusions But the wide difference of their habits and education often occasioned a great discrepancy in their respective deductions from admitted premises Major Melville had been versed in camps and cities he was vigilant by profession and cautious from experience had met with much evil in the world and therefore though himself an upright magistrate and an honourable man his opinions of others were always strict and sometimes unjustly severe mister Morton on the contrary had passed from the literary pursuits of a college where he was beloved by his companions and respected by his teachers to the ease and simplicity of his present charge where his opportunities of witnessing evil were few and never dwelt upon but in order to encourage repentance and amendment and where the love and respect of his parishioners repaid his affectionate zeal in their behalf by endeavouring to disguise from him what they knew would give him the most acute pain namely their own occasional transgressions of the duties which it was the business of his life to recommend Thus it was a common saying in the neighbourhood though both were popular characters that the laird knew only the ill in the parish and the minister only the good A love of letters though kept in subordination to his clerical studies and duties also distinguished the pastor of Cairnvreckan and had tinged his mind in earlier days with a slight feeling of romance which no after incidents of real life had entirely dissipated The early loss of an amiable young woman whom he had married for love and who was quickly followed to the grave by an only child had also served even after the lapse of many years to soften a disposition naturally mild and contemplative His feelings on the present occasion were therefore likely to differ from those of the severe disciplinarian strict magistrate and distrustful man of the world When the servants had withdrawn the silence of both parties continued until Major Melville filling his glass and pushing the bottle to mister Morton commenced A distressing affair this mister Morton I fear this youngster has brought himself within the compass of a halter God forbid answered the clergyman Marry and amen said the temporal magistrate but I think even your merciful logic will hardly deny the conclusion Surely Major answered the clergyman I should hope it might be averted for aught we have heard tonight Indeed replied Melville But my good parson you are one of those who would communicate to every criminal the benefit of clergy Unquestionably I would Mercy and long suffering are the grounds of the doctrine I am called to teach True religiously speaking but mercy to a criminal may be gross injustice to the community I don t speak of this young fellow in particular who I heartily wish may be able to clear himself for I like both his modesty and his spirit But I fear he has rushed upon his fate And why Hundreds of misguided gentlemen are now in arms against the government many doubtless upon principles which education and early prejudice have gilded with the names of patriotism and heroism Justice when she selects her victims from such a multitude for surely all will not be destroyed must regard the moral motive He whom ambition or hope of personal advantage has led to disturb the peace of a well ordered government let him fall a victim to the laws but surely youth misled by the wild visions of chivalry and imaginary loyalty may plead for pardon If visionary chivalry and imaginary loyalty come within the predicament of high treason replied the magistrate I know no court in Christendom my dear mister Morton where they can sue out their Habeas Corpus But I cannot see that this youth s guilt is at all established to my satisfaction said the clergyman Because your good nature blinds your good sense replied Major Melville Observe now This young man descended of a family of hereditary Jacobites his uncle the leader of the Tory interest in the county of his father a disobliged and discontented courtier his tutor a nonjuror and the author of two treasonable volumes this youth I say enters into Gardiner s dragoons bringing with him a body of young fellows from his uncle s estate who have not stickled at avowing in their way the High Church principles they learned at Waverley Honour in their disputes with their comrades To these young men Waverley is unusually attentive they are supplied with money beyond a soldier s wants and inconsistent with his discipline and are under the management of a favourite sergeant through whom they hold an unusually close communication with their captain and affect to consider themselves as independent of the other officers and superior to their comrades All this my dear Major is the natural consequence of their attachment to their young landlord and of their finding themselves in a regiment levied chiefly in the north of Ireland and the west of Scotland and of course among comrades disposed to quarrel with them both as Englishmen and as members of the Church of England Well said parson replied the magistrate I would some of your synod heard you But let me go on This young man obtains leave of absence goes to Tully Veolan the principles of the Baron of Bradwardine are pretty well known not to mention that this lad s uncle brought him off in the year fifteen he engages there in a brawl in which he is said to have disgraced the commission he bore Colonel Gardiner writes to him first mildly then more sharply I think you will not doubt his having done so since he says so the mess invite him to explain the quarrel in which he is said to have been involved he neither replies to his commander nor his comrades In the meanwhile his soldiers become mutinous and disorderly and at length when the rumour of this unhappy rebellion becomes general his favourite Sergeant Houghton and another fellow are detected in correspondence with a French emissary accredited as he says by Captain Waverley who urges him according to the men s confession to desert with the troop and join their captain who was with Prince Charles In the meanwhile this trusty captain is by his own admission residing at Glennaquoich with the most active subtle and desperate Jacobite in Scotland he goes with him at least as far as their famous hunting rendezvous and I fear a little farther Meanwhile two other summonses are sent him one warning him of the disturbances in his troop another peremptorily ordering him to repair to the regiment which indeed common sense might have dictated when he observed rebellion thickening all round him He returns an absolute refusal and throws up his commission He had been already deprived of it said mister Morton But he regrets replied Melville that the measure had anticipated his resignation His baggage is seized at his quarters and at Tully Veolan and is found to contain a stock of pestilent Jacobitical pamphlets enough to poison a whole country besides the unprinted lucubrations of his worthy friend and tutor mister Pembroke He says he never read them answered the minister In an ordinary case I should believe him replied the magistrate for they are as stupid and pedantic in composition as mischievous in their tenets But can you suppose anything but value for the principles they maintain would induce a young man of his age to lug such trash about with him Then when news arrive of the approach of the rebels he sets out in a sort of disguise refusing to tell his name and if yon old fanatic tell truth attended by a very suspicious character and mounted on a horse known to have belonged to Glennaquoich and bearing on his person letters from his family expressing high rancour against the house of Brunswick and a copy of verses in praise of one Wogan who abjured the service of the Parliament to join the Highland insurgents when in arms to restore the house of Stuart with a body of English cavalry the very counterpart of his own plot and summed up with a Go thou and do likewise from that loyal subject and most safe and peaceable character Fergus Mac Ivor of Glennaquoich Vich Ian Vohr and so forth And lastly continued Major Melville warming in the detail of his arguments where do we find this second edition of Cavalier Wogan Why truly in the very track most proper for execution of his design and pistolling the first of the king s subjects who ventures to question his intentions mister Morton prudently abstained from argument which he perceived would only harden the magistrate in his opinion and merely asked how he intended to dispose of the prisoner It is a question of some difficulty considering the state of the country said Major Melville Could you not detain him being such a gentleman like young man here in your own house out of harm s way till this storm blow over My good friend said Major Melville neither your house nor mine will be long out of harm s way even were it legal to confine him here I have just learned that the commander in chief who marched into the Highlands to seek out and disperse the insurgents has declined giving them battle at Coryarrick and marched on northward with all the disposable force of government to Inverness John o Groat s House or the devil for what I know leaving the road to the Low Country open and undefended to the Highland army Good God said the clergyman Is the man a coward a traitor or an idiot None of the three I believe answered Melville Sir John has the commonplace courage of a common soldier is honest enough does what he is commanded and understands what is told him but is as fit to act for himself in circumstances of importance as I my dear parson to occupy your pulpit This important public intelligence naturally diverted the discourse from Waverley for some time at length however the subject was resumed I believe said Major Melville that I must give this young man in charge to some of the detached parties of armed volunteers who were lately sent out to overawe the disaffected districts They are now recalled towards Stirling and a small body comes this way to morrow or next day commanded by the westland man what s his name You saw him and said he was the very model of one of Cromwell s military saints Gilfillan the Cameronian answered mister Morton I wish the young gentleman may be safe with him Strange things are done in the heat and hurry of minds in so agitating a crisis and I fear Gilfillan is of a sect which has suffered persecution without learning mercy He has only to lodge mister Waverley in Stirling Castle said the Major I will give strict injunctions to treat him well I really cannot devise any better mode for securing him and I fancy you would hardly advise me to encounter the responsibility of setting him at liberty But you will have no objection to my seeing him tomorrow in private said the minister None certainly your loyalty and character are my warrant But with what view do you make the request Simply replied mister Morton to make the experiment whether he may not be brought to communicate to me some circumstances which may hereafter be useful to alleviate if not to exculpate his conduct The friends now parted and retired to rest each filled with the most anxious reflections on the state of the country CHAPTER XXXIII A CONFIDANT Waverley awoke in the morning from troubled dreams and unrefreshing slumbers to a full consciousness of the horrors of his situation How it might terminate he knew not He might be delivered up to military law which in the midst of civil war was not likely to be scrupulous in the choice of its victims or the quality of the evidence Nor did he feel much more comfortable at the thoughts of a trial before a Scottish court of justice where he knew the laws and forms differed in many respects from those of England and had been taught to believe however erroneously that the liberty and rights of the subject were less carefully protected A sentiment of bitterness rose in his mind against the government which he considered as the cause of his embarrassment and peril and he cursed internally his scrupulous rejection of Mac Ivor s invitation to accompany him to the field Why did not I he said to himself like other men of honour take the earliest opportunity to welcome to Britain the descendant of her ancient kings and lineal heir of her throne Why did not I Unthread the rude eye of rebellion And welcome home again discarded faith Seek out Prince Charles and fall before his feet All that has been recorded of excellence and worth in the house of Waverley has been founded upon their loyal faith to the house of Stuart From the interpretation which this Scotch magistrate has put upon the letters of my uncle and father it is plain that I ought to have understood them as marshalling me to the course of my ancestors and it has been my gross dulness joined to the obscurity of expression which they adopted for the sake of security that has confounded my judgment Had I yielded to the first generous impulse of indignation when I learned that my honour was practised upon how different had been my present situation I had then been free and in arms fighting like my forefathers for love for loyalty and for fame And now I am here netted and in the toils at the disposal of a suspicious stern and cold hearted man perhaps to be turned over to the solitude of a dungeon or the infamy of a public execution O Fergus how true has your prophecy proved and how speedy how very speedy has been its accomplishment While Edward was ruminating on these painful subjects of contemplation and very naturally though not quite so justly bestowing upon the reigning dynasty that blame which was due to chance or in part at least to his own unreflecting conduct mister Morton availed himself of Major Melville s permission to pay him an early visit Waverley s first impulse was to intimate a desire that he might not be disturbed with questions or conversation but he suppressed it upon observing the benevolent and reverend appearance of the clergyman who had rescued him from the immediate violence of the villagers I believe sir said the unfortunate young man that in any other circumstances I should have had as much gratitude to express to you as the safety of my life may be worth but such is the present tumult of my mind and such is my anticipation of what I am yet likely to endure that I can hardly offer you thanks for your interposition mister Morton replied that far from making any claim upon his good opinion his only wish and the sole purpose of his visit was to find out the means of deserving it My excellent friend Major Melville he continued has feelings and duties as a soldier and public functionary by which I am not fettered nor can I always coincide in opinions which he forms perhaps with too little allowance for the imperfections of human nature He paused and then proceeded I do not intrude myself on your confidence mister Waverley for the purpose of learning any circumstances the knowledge of which can be prejudicial either to yourself or to others but I own my earnest wish is that you would intrust me with any particulars which could lead to your exculpation I can solemnly assure you they will be deposited with a faithful and to the extent of his limited powers a zealous agent You are sir I presume a Presbyterian clergyman mister Morton bowed Were I to be guided by the prepossessions of education I might distrust your friendly professions in my case but I have observed that similar prejudices are nourished in this country against your professional brethren of the Episcopal persuasion and I am willing to believe them equally unfounded in both cases Evil to him that thinks otherwise said mister Morton or who holds church government and ceremonies as the exclusive gage of Christian faith or moral virtue But continued Waverley I cannot perceive why I should trouble you with a detail of particulars out of which after revolving them as carefully as possible in my recollection I find myself unable to explain much of what is charged against me I know indeed that I am innocent but I hardly see how I can hope to prove myself so It is for that very reason mister Waverley said the clergyman that I venture to solicit your confidence My knowledge of individuals in this country is pretty general and can upon occasion be extended Your situation will I fear preclude your taking those active steps for recovering intelligence or tracing imposture which I would willingly undertake in your behalf and if you are not benefited by my exertions at least they cannot be prejudicial to you Waverley after a few minutes reflection was convinced that his reposing confidence in mister Morton so far as he himself was concerned could hurt neither mister Bradwardine nor Fergus Mac Ivor both of whom had openly assumed arms against the government and that it might possibly if the professions of his new friend corresponded in sincerity with the earnestness of his expression be of some service to himself He therefore ran briefly over most of the events with which the reader is already acquainted suppressing his attachment to Flora and indeed neither mentioning her nor Rose Bradwardine in the course of his narrative mister Morton seemed particularly struck with the account of Waverley s visit to Donald Bean Lean I am glad he said you did not mention this circumstance to the Major It is capable of great misconstruction on the part of those who do not consider the power of curiosity and the influence of romance as motives of youthful conduct When I was a young man like you mister Waverley any such hair brained expedition I beg your pardon for the expression would have had inexpressible charms for me But there are men in the world who will not believe that danger and fatigue are often incurred without any very adequate cause and therefore who are sometimes led to assign motives of action entirely foreign to the truth This man Bean Lean is renowned through the country as a sort of Robin Hood and the stories which are told of his address and enterprise are the common tales of the winter fireside He certainly possesses talents beyond the rude sphere in which he moves and being neither destitute of ambition nor encumbered with scruples he will probably attempt by every means to distinguish himself during the period of these unhappy commotions mister Morton then made a careful memorandum of the various particulars of Waverley s interview with Donald Bean Lean and the other circumstances which he had communicated The interest which this good man seemed to take in his misfortunes above all the full confidence he appeared to repose in his innocence had the natural effect of softening Edward s heart whom the coldness of Major Melville had taught to believe that the world was leagued to oppress him He shook mister Morton warmly by the hand and assuring him that his kindness and sympathy had relieved his mind of a heavy load told him that whatever might be his own fate he belonged to a family who had both gratitude and the power of displaying it The earnestness of his thanks called drops to the eyes of the worthy clergyman who was doubly interested in the cause for which he had volunteered his services by observing the genuine and undissembled feelings of his young friend Edward now inquired if mister Morton knew what was likely to be his destination Stirling Castle replied his friend and so far I am well pleased for your sake for the governor is a man of honour and humanity But I am more doubtful of your treatment upon the road Major Melville is involuntarily obliged to intrust the custody of your person to another I am glad of it answered Waverley I detest that cold blooded calculating Scotch magistrate I hope he and I shall never meet more He had neither sympathy with my innocence nor with my wretchedness and the petrifying accuracy with which he attended to every form of civility while he tortured me by his questions his suspicions and his inferences was as tormenting as the racks of the Inquisition Do not vindicate him my dear sir for that I cannot bear with patience tell me rather who is to have the charge of so important a state prisoner as I am I believe a person called Gilfillan one of the sect who are termed Cameronians I never heard of them before They claim said the clergyman to represent the more strict and severe Presbyterians who in Charles Second s and James Second s days refused to profit by the Toleration or Indulgence as it was called which was extended to others of that religion They held conventicles in the open fields and being treated with great violence and cruelty by the Scottish government more than once took arms during those reigns They take their name from their leader Richard Cameron I recollect said Waverley but did not the triumph of Presbytery at the Revolution extinguish that sect By no means replied Morton that great event fell yet far short of what they proposed which was nothing less than the complete establishment of the Presbyterian Church upon the grounds of the old Solemn League and Covenant Indeed I believe they scarce knew what they wanted but being a numerous body of men and not unacquainted with the use of arms they kept themselves together as a separate party in the state and at the time of the Union had nearly formed a most unnatural league with their old enemies the Jacobites to oppose that important national measure Since that time their numbers have gradually diminished but a good many are still to be found in the western counties and several with a better temper than in seventeen oh seven have now taken arms for government This person whom they call Gifted Gilfillan has been long a leader among them and now heads a small party which will pass here to day or to morrow on their march towards Stirling under whose escort Major Melville proposes you shall travel I would willingly speak to Gilfillan in your behalf but having deeply imbibed all the prejudices of his sect and being of the same fierce disposition he would pay little regard to the remonstrances of an Erastian divine as he would politely term me And now farewell my young friend for the present I must not weary out the Major s indulgence that I may obtain his permission to visit you again in the course of the day CHAPTER XXXIV THINGS MEND A LITTLE About noon mister Morton returned and brought an invitation from Major Melville that mister Waverley would honour him with his company to dinner notwithstanding the unpleasant affair which detained him at Cairnvreckan from which he should heartily rejoice to see mister Waverley completely extricated The truth was that mister Morton s favourable report and opinion had somewhat staggered the preconceptions of the old soldier concerning Edward s supposed accession to the mutiny in the regiment and in the unfortunate state of the country the mere suspicion of disaffection or an inclination to join the insurgent Jacobites might infer criminality indeed but certainly not dishonour Besides a person whom the Major trusted had reported to him though as it proved inaccurately a contradiction of the agitating news of the preceding evening According to this second edition of the intelligence the Highlanders had withdrawn from the Lowland frontier with the purpose of following the army in their march to Inverness The Major was at a loss indeed to reconcile his information with the well known abilities of some of the gentlemen in the Highland army yet it was the course which was likely to be most agreeable to others He remembered the same policy had detained them in the north in the year seventeen fifteen and he anticipated a similar termination to the insurrection as upon that occasion This news put him in such good humour that he readily acquiesced in mister Morton s proposal to pay some hospitable attention to his unfortunate guest and voluntarily added he hoped the whole affair would prove a youthful escapade which might be easily atoned by a short confinement The kind mediator had some trouble to prevail on his young friend to accept the invitation He dared not urge to him the real motive which was a good natured wish to secure a favourable report of Waverley s case from Major Melville to Governor Blakeney He remarked from the flashes of our hero s spirit that touching upon this topic would be sure to defeat his purpose He therefore pleaded that the invitation argued the Major s disbelief of any part of the accusation which was inconsistent with Waverley s conduct as a soldier and a man of honour and that to decline his courtesy might be interpreted into a consciousness that it was unmerited In short he so far satisfied Edward that the manly and proper course was to meet the Major on easy terms that suppressing his strong dislike again to encounter his cold and punctilious civility Waverley agreed to be guided by his new friend The meeting at first was stiff and formal enough But Edward having accepted the invitation and his mind being really soothed and relieved by the kindness of Morton held himself bound to behave with ease though he could not affect cordiality The Major was somewhat of a bon vivant and his wine was excellent He told his old campaign stories and displayed much knowledge of men and manners mister Morton had an internal fund of placid and quiet gaiety which seldom failed to enliven any small party in which he found himself pleasantly seated Waverley whose life was a dream gave ready way to the predominating impulse and became the most lively of the party He had at all times remarkable natural powers of conversation though easily silenced by discouragement On the present occasion he piqued himself upon leaving on the minds of his companions a favourable impression of one who under such disastrous circumstances could sustain his misfortunes with ease and gaiety His spirits though not unyielding were abundantly elastic and soon seconded his efforts The trio were engaged in very lively discourse apparently delighted with each other and the kind host was pressing a third bottle of Burgundy when the sound of a drum was heard at some distance The Major who in the glee of an old soldier had forgot the duties of a magistrate cursed with a muttered military oath the circumstances which recalled him to his official functions He rose and went towards the window which commanded a very near view of the highroad and he was followed by his guests The drum advanced beating no measured martial tune but a kind of rub a dub dub like that with which the fire drum startles the slumbering artizans of a Scotch burgh It is the object of this history to do justice to all men I must therefore record in justice to the drummer that he protested he could beat any known march or point of war known in the British army and had accordingly commenced with Dumbarton s Drums when he was silenced by Gifted Gilfillan the commander of the party who refused to permit his followers to move to this profane and even as he said persecutive tune and commanded the drummer to beat the one hundred and nineteenth Psalm As this was beyond the capacity of the drubber of sheepskin he was fain to have recourse to the inoffensive row de dow as a harmless substitute for the sacred music which his instrument or skill were unable to achieve This may be held a trifling anecdote but the drummer in question was no less than town drummer of Anderton I remember his successor in office a member of that enlightened body the British Convention Be his memory therefore treated with due respect CHAPTER XXXV A VOLUNTEER SIXTY YEARS SINCE On hearing the unwelcome sound of the drum Major Melville hastily opened a sashed door and stepped out upon a sort of terrace which divided his house from the highroad from which the martial music proceeded Waverley and his new friend followed him though probably he would have dispensed with their attendance They soon recognised in solemn march first the performer upon the drum secondly a large flag of four compartments on which were inscribed the words COVENANT KIRK KING KINGDOMS The person who was honoured with this charge was followed by the commander of the party a thin dark rigid looking man about sixty years old The spiritual pride which in mine host of the Candlestick mantled in a sort of supercilious hypocrisy was in this man s face elevated and yet darkened by genuine and undoubting fanaticism It was impossible to behold him without imagination placing him in some strange crisis where religious zeal was the ruling principle A martyr at the stake a soldier in the field a lonely and banished wanderer consoled by the intensity and supposed purity of his faith under every earthly privation perhaps a persecuting inquisitor as terrific in power as unyielding in adversity any of these seemed congenial characters to this personage With these high traits of energy there was something in the affected precision and solemnity of his deportment and discourse that bordered upon the ludicrous so that according to the mood of the spectator s mind and the light under which mister Gilfillan presented himself one might have feared admired or laughed at him His dress was that of a West Country peasant of better materials indeed than that of the lower rank but in no respect affecting either the mode of the age or of the Scottish gentry at any period His arms were a broadsword and pistols which from the antiquity of their appearance might have seen the rout of Pentland or Bothwell Brigg As he came up a few steps to meet Major Melville and touched solemnly but slightly his huge and over brimmed blue bonnet in answer to the Major who had courteously raised a small triangular gold laced hat Waverley was irresistibly impressed with the idea that he beheld a leader of the Roundheads of yore in conference with one of Marlborough s captains The group of about thirty armed men who followed this gifted commander was of a motley description They were in ordinary Lowland dresses of different colours which contrasted with the arms they bore gave them an irregular and mobbish appearance so much is the eye accustomed to connect uniformity of dress with the military character In front were a few who apparently partook of their leader s enthusiasm men obviously to be feared in a combat where their natural courage was exalted by religious zeal Others puffed and strutted filled with the importance of carrying arms and all the novelty of their situation while the rest apparently fatigued with their march dragged their limbs listlessly along or straggled from their companions to procure such refreshments as the neighbouring cottages and alehouses afforded Six grenadiers of Ligonier s thought the Major to himself as his mind reverted to his own military experience would have sent all these fellows to the right about Greeting however mister Gilfillan civilly he requested to know if he had received the letter he had sent to him upon his march and could undertake the charge of the state prisoner whom he there mentioned as far as Stirling Castle Yea was the concise reply of the Cameronian leader in a voice which seemed to issue from the very penetralia of his person But your escort mister Gilfillan is not so strong as I expected said Major Melville Some of the people replied Gilfillan hungered and were athirst by the way and tarried until their poor souls were refreshed with the word I am sorry sir replied the Major you did not trust to your refreshing your men at Cairnvreckan whatever my house contains is at the command of persons employed in the service It was not of creature comforts I spake answered the Covenanter regarding Major Melville with something like a smile of contempt howbeit I thank you but the people remained waiting upon the precious mister Jabesh Rentowel for the out pouring of the afternoon exhortation And have you sir said the Major when the rebels are about to spread themselves through this country actually left a great part of your command at a fieldpreaching Gilfillan again smiled scornfully as he made this indirect answer Even thus are the children of this world wiser in their generation than the children of light However sir said the Major as you are to take charge of this gentleman to Stirling and deliver him with these papers into the hands of Governor Blakeney I beseech you to observe some rules of military discipline upon your march For example I would advise you to keep your men more closely together and that each in his march should cover his file leader instead of straggling like geese upon a common and for fear of surprise I further recommend to you to form a small advance party of your best men with a single vidette in front of the whole march so that when you approach a village or a wood here the Major interrupted himself But as I don t observe you listen to me mister Gilfillan I suppose I need not give myself the trouble to say more upon the subject You are a better judge unquestionably than I am of the measures to be pursued but one thing I would have you well aware of that you are to treat this gentleman your prisoner with no rigour nor incivility and are to subject him to no other restraint than is necessary for his security I have looked into my commission said mister Gilfillan subscribed by a worthy and professing nobleman William Earl of Glencairn nor do I find it therein set down that I am to receive any charges or commands anent my doings from Major William Melville of Cairnvreckan Major Melville reddened even to the well powdered ears which appeared beneath his neat military sidecurls the more so as he observed mister Morton smile at the same moment mister Gilfillan he answered with some asperity I beg ten thousand pardons for interfering with a person of your importance I thought however that as you have been bred a grazier if I mistake not there might be occasion to remind you of the difference between Highlanders and Highland cattle and if you should happen to meet with any gentleman who has seen service and is disposed to speak upon the subject I should still imagine that listening to him would do you no sort of harm But I have done and have only once more to recommend this gentleman to your civility as well as to your custody mister Waverley I am truly sorry we should part in this way but I trust when you are again in this country I may have an opportunity to render Cairnvreckan more agreeable than circumstances have permitted on this occasion So saying he shook our hero by the hand Morton also took an affectionate farewell and Waverley having mounted his horse with a musketeer leading it by the bridle and a file upon each side to prevent his escape set forward upon the march with Gilfillan and his party Through the little village they were accompanied with the shouts of the children who cried out Eh see to the Southland gentleman that s gaun to be hanged for shooting lang John Mucklewrath the smith APPENDICES TO THE GENERAL PREFACE NO I FRAGMENT Footnote It is not to be supposed that these fragments are given in possessing any intrinsic value of themselves but there may be some curiosity attached to them as to the first etchings of a plate which are accounted interesting by those who have in any degree been interested in the more finished works of the artist OF A ROMANCE WHICH WAS TO HAVE BEEN ENTITLED THOMAS THE RHYMER CHAPTER I THE sun was nearly set behind the distant mountains of Liddesdale when a few of the scattered and terrified inhabitants of the village of Hersildoune which had four days before been burned by a predatory band of English Borderers were now busied in repairing their ruined dwellings One high tower in the centre of the village alone exhibited no appearance of devastation It was surrounded with court walls and the outer gate was barred and bolted The bushes and brambles which grew around and had even insinuated their branches beneath the gate plainly showed that it must have been many years since it had been opened While the cottages around lay in smoking ruins this pile deserted and desolate as it seemed to be had suffered nothing from the violence of the invaders and the wretched beings who were endeavouring to repair their miserable huts against nightfall seemed to neglect the preferable shelter which it might have afforded them without the necessity of labour Before the day had quite gone down a knight richly armed and mounted upon an ambling hackney rode slowly into the village His attendants were a lady apparently young and beautiful who rode by his side upon a dappled palfrey his squire who carried his helmet and lance and led his battlehorse a noble steed richly caparisoned A page and four yeomen bearing bows and quivers short swords and targets of a span breadth completed his equipage which though small denoted him to be a man of high rank He stopped and addressed several of the inhabitants whom curiosity had withdrawn from their labour to gaze at him but at the sound of his voice and still more on perceiving the saint George s Cross in the caps of his followers they fled with a loud cry that the Southrons were returned The knight endeavoured to expostulate with the fugitives who were chiefly aged men women and children but their dread of the English name accelerated their flight and in a few minutes excepting the knight and his attendants the place was deserted by all He paced through the village to seek a shelter for the night and despairing to find one either in the inaccessible tower or the plundered huts of the peasantry he directed his course to the left hand where he spied a small decent habitation apparently the abode of a man considerably above the common rank After much knocking the proprietor at length showed himself at the window and speaking in the English dialect with great signs of apprehension demanded their business The warrior replied that his quality was an English knight and baron and that he was travelling to the court of the King of Scotland on affairs of consequence to both kingdoms Pardon my hesitation noble Sir Knight said the old man as he unbolted and unbarred his doors Pardon my hesitation but we are here exposed to too many intrusions to admit of our exercising unlimited and unsuspicious hospitality What I have is yours and God send your mission may bring back peace and the good days of our old Queen Margaret Amen worthy Franklin quoth the Knight Did you know her I came to this country in her train said the Franklin and the care of some of her jointure lands which she devolved on me occasioned my settling here And how do you being an Englishman said the Knight protect your life and property here when one of your nation cannot obtain a single night s lodging or a draught of water were he thirsty Marry noble sir answered the Franklin use as they say will make a man live in a lion s den and as I settled here in a quiet time and have never given cause of offence I am respected by my neighbours and even as you see by our FORAYERS from England I rejoice to hear it and accept your hospitality Isabella my love our worthy host will provide you a bed My daughter good Franklin is ill at ease We will occupy your house till the Scottish King shall return from his northern expedition meanwhile call me Lord Lacy of Chester The attendants of the Baron assisted by the Franklin were now busied in disposing of the horses and arranging the table for some refreshment for Lord Lacy and his fair companion While they sat down to it they were attended by their host and his daughter whom custom did not permit to eat in their presence and who afterwards withdrew to an outer chamber where the squire and page both young men of noble birth partook of supper and were accommodated with beds The yeomen after doing honour to the rustic cheer of Queen Margaret s bailiff withdrew to the stable and each beside his favourite horse snored away the fatigues of their journey Early on the following morning the travellers were roused by a thundering knocking at the door of the house accompanied with many demands for instant admission in the roughest tone The squire and page of Lord Lacy after buckling on their arms were about to sally out to chastise these intruders when the old host after looking out at a private casement contrived for reconnoitring his visitors entreated them with great signs of terror to be quiet if they did not mean that all in the house should be murdered He then hastened to the apartment of Lord Lacy whom he met dressed in a long furred gown and the knightly cap called a MORTIER irritated at the noise and demanding to know the cause which had disturbed the repose of the household Noble sir said the Franklin one of the most formidable and bloody of the Scottish Border riders is at hand he is never seen added he faltering with terror so far from the hills but with some bad purpose and the power of accomplishing it so hold yourself to your guard for A loud crash here announced that the door was broken down and the knight just descended the stair in time to prevent bloodshed betwixt his attendants and the intruders They were three in number their chief was tall bony and athletic his spare and muscular frame as well as the hardness of his features marked the course of his life to have been fatiguing and perilous The effect of his appearance was aggravated by his dress which consisted of a jack or jacket composed of thick buff leather on which small plates of iron of a lozenge form were stitched in such a manner as to overlap each other and form a coat of mail which swayed with every motion of the wearer s body This defensive armour covered a doublet of coarse grey cloth and the Borderer had a few half rusted plates of steel on his shoulders a two edged sword with a dagger hanging beside it in a buff belt a helmet with a few iron bars to cover the face instead of a visor and a lance of tremendous and uncommon length completed his appointments The looks of the man were as wild and rude as his attire his keen black eyes never rested one moment fixed upon a single object but constantly traversed all around as if they ever sought some danger to oppose some plunder to seize or some insult to revenge The latter seemed to be his present object for regardless of the dignified presence of Lord Lacy he uttered the most incoherent threats against the owner of the house and his guests We shall see ay marry shall we if an English hound is to harbour and reset the Southrons here Thank the Abbot of Melrose and the good Knight of Coldingnow that have so long kept me from your skirts But those days are gone by Saint Mary and you shall find it It is probable the enraged Borderer would not have long continued to vent his rage in empty menaces had not the entrance of the four yeomen with their bows bent convinced him that the force was not at this moment on his own side Lord Lacy now advanced towards him You intrude upon my privacy soldier withdraw yourself and your followers There is peace betwixt our nations or my servants should chastise thy presumption Such peace as ye give such shall ye have answered the moss trooper first pointing with his lance towards the burned village and then almost instantly levelling it against Lord Lacy The squire drew his sword and severed at one blow the steel head from the truncheon of the spear Arthur Fitzherbert said the Baron that stroke has deferred thy knighthood for one year never must that squire wear the spurs whose unbridled impetuosity can draw unbidden his sword in the presence of his master Go hence and think on what I have said The squire left the chamber abashed It were vain continued Lord Lacy to expect that courtesy from a mountain churl which even my own followers can forget Yet before thou drawest thy brand for the intruder laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword thou wilt do well to reflect that I came with a safe conduct from thy king and have no time to waste in brawls with such as thou From MY king from my king re echoed the mountaineer I care not that rotten truncheon striking the shattered spear furiously on the ground for the King of Fife and Lothian But Habby of Cessford will be here belive and we shall soon know if he will permit an English churl to occupy his hostelrie Having uttered these words accompanied with a lowering glance from under his shaggy black eyebrows he turned on his heel and left the house with his two followers They mounted their horses which they had tied to an outer fence and vanished in an instant Who is this discourteous ruffian said Lord Lacy to the Franklin who had stood in the most violent agitation during this whole scene His name noble lord is Adam Kerr of the Moat but he is commonly called by his companions the Black Rider of Cheviot I fear I fear he comes hither for no good but if the Lord of Cessford be near he will not dare offer any unprovoked outrage I have heard of that chief said the Baron Let me know when he approaches and do thou Rodulph to the eldest yeoman keep a strict watch Adelbert to the page attend to arm me The page bowed and the Baron withdrew to the chamber of the Lady Isabella to explain the cause of the disturbance No more of the proposed tale was ever written but the Author s purpose was that it should turn upon a fine legend of superstition which is current in the part of the Borders where he had his residence where in the reign of Alexander III of Scotland that renowned person Thomas of Hersildoune called the Rhymer actually flourished This personage the Merlin of Scotland and to whom some of the adventures which the British bards assigned to Merlin Caledonius or the Wild have been transferred by tradition was as is well known a magician as well as a poet and prophet He is alleged still to live in the land of Faery and is expected to return at some great convulsion of society in which he is to act a distinguished part a tradition common to all nations as the belief of the Mahomedans respecting their twelfth Imaum demonstrates Now it chanced many years since that there lived on the Borders a jolly rattling horse cowper who was remarkable for a reckless and fearless temper which made him much admired and a little dreaded amongst his neighbours One moonlight night as he rode over Bowden Moor on the west side of the Eildon Hills the scene of Thomas the Rhymer s prophecies and often mentioned in his story having a brace of horses along with him which he had not been able to dispose of he met a man of venerable appearance and singularly antique dress who to his great surprise asked the price of his horses and began to chaffer with him on the subject To Canobie Dick for so shall we call our Border dealer a chap was a chap and he would have sold a horse to the devil himself without minding his cloven hoof and would have probably cheated Old Nick into the bargain The stranger paid the price they agreed on and all that puzzled Dick in the transaction was that the gold which he received was in unicorns bonnet pieces and other ancient coins which would have been invaluable to collectors but were rather troublesome in modern currency It was gold however and therefore Dick contrived to get better value for the coin than he perhaps gave to his customer By the command of so good a merchant he brought horses to the same spot more than once the purchaser only stipulating that he should always come by night and alone I do not know whether it was from mere curiosity or whether some hope of gain mixed with it but after Dick had sold several horses in this way he began to complain that dry bargains were unlucky and to hint that since his chap must live in the neighbourhood he ought in the courtesy of dealing to treat him to half a mutchkin You may see my dwelling if you will said the stranger but if you lose courage at what you see there you will rue it all your life Dicken however laughed the warning to scorn and having alighted to secure his horse he followed the stranger up a narrow foot path which led them up the hills to the singular eminence stuck betwixt the most southern and the centre peaks and called from its resemblance to such an animal in its form the Lucken Hare At the foot of this eminence which is almost as famous for witch meetings as the neighbouring wind mill of Kippilaw Dick was somewhat startled to observe that his conductor entered the hillside by a passage or cavern of which he himself though well acquainted with the spot had never seen or heard You may still return said his guide looking ominously back upon him but Dick scorned to show the white feather and on they went They entered a very long range of stables in every stall stood a coal black horse by every horse lay a knight in coal black armour with a drawn sword in his hand but all were as silent hoof and limb as if they had been cut out of marble A great number of torches lent a gloomy lustre to the hall which like those of the Caliph Vathek was of large dimensions At the upper end however they at length arrived where a sword and horn lay on an antique table He that shall sound that horn and draw that sword said the stranger who now intimated that he was the famous Thomas of Hersildoune shall if his heart fail him not be king over all broad Britain So speaks the tongue that cannot lie But all depends on courage and much on your taking the sword or the horn first Dick was much disposed to take the sword but his bold spirit was quailed by the supernatural terrors of the hall and he thought to unsheath the sword first might be construed into defiance and give offence to the powers of the Mountain He took the bugle with a trembling hand and sounded a feeble note but loud enough to produce a terrible answer Thunder rolled in stunning peals through the immense hall horses and men started to life the steeds snorted stamped grinded their bits and tossed on high their heads the warriors sprung to their feet clashed their armour and brandished their swords Dick s terror was extreme at seeing the whole army which had been so lately silent as the grave in uproar and about to rush on him He dropped the horn and made a feeble attempt to seize the enchanted sword but at the same moment a voice pronounced aloud the mysterious words Woe to the coward that ever he was born Who did not draw the sword before he blew the horn At the same time a whirlwind of irresistible fury howled through the long hall bore the unfortunate horse jockey clear out of the mouth of the cavern and precipitated him over a steep bank of loose stones where the shepherds found him the next morning with just breath sufficient to tell his fearful tale after concluding which he expired This legend with several variations is found in many parts of Scotland and England the scene is sometimes laid in some favourite glen of the Highlands sometimes in the deep coal mines of Northumberland and Cumberland which run so far beneath the ocean It is also to be found in Reginald Scott s book on Witchcraft which was written in the sixteenth century It would be in vain to ask what was the original of the tradition The choice between the horn and sword may perhaps include as a moral that it is foolhardy to awaken danger before we have arms in our hands to resist it Although admitting of much poetical ornament it is clear that this legend would have formed but an unhappy foundation for a prose story and must have degenerated into a mere fairy tale Doctor John Leyden has beautifully introduced the tradition in his Scenes of Infancy Mysterious Rhymer doom d by fate s decree Still to revisit Eildon s fated tree Where oft the swain at dawn of Hallow day Hears thy fleet barb with wild impatience neigh Say who is he with summons long and high Shall bid the charmed sleep of ages fly Roll the long sound through Eildon s caverns vast While each dark warrior kindles at the blast The horn the falchion grasp with mighty hand And peal proud Arthur s march from Fairy land Scenes of Infancy Part I In the same cabinet with the preceding fragment the following occurred among other disjecta membra It seems to be an attempt at a tale of a different description from the last but was almost instantly abandoned The introduction points out the time of the composition to have been about the end of the eighteenth century THE LORD OF ENNERDALE A FRAGMENT OF A LETTER FROM JOHN B esquire OF THAT ILK TO WILLIAM G F R S E FILL a bumper said the Knight the ladies may spare us a little longer Fill a bumper to the Archduke Charles The company did due honour to the toast of their landlord The success of the Archduke said the muddy Vicar will tend to further our negotiation at Paris and if Pardon the interruption Doctor quoth a thin emaciated figure with somewhat of a foreign accent but why should you connect those events unless to hope that the bravery and victories of our allies may supersede the necessity of a degrading treaty We begin to feel Monsieur L Abbe answered the Vicar with some asperity that a Continental war entered into for the defence of an ally who was unwilling to defend himself and for the restoration of a royal family nobility and priesthood who tamely abandoned their own rights is a burden too much even for the resources of this country And was the war then on the part of Great Britain rejoined the Abbe a gratuitous exertion of generosity Was there no fear of the wide wasting spirit of innovation which had gone abroad Did not the laity tremble for their property the clergy for their religion and every loyal heart for the Constitution Was it not thought necessary to destroy the building which was on fire ere the conflagration spread around the vicinity Yet if upon trial said the Doctor the walls were found to resist our utmost efforts I see no great prudence in persevering in our labour amid the smouldering ruins What Doctor said the Baronet must I call to your recollection your own sermon on the late general fast Did you not encourage us to hope that the Lord of Hosts would go forth with our armies and that our enemies who blasphemed him should be put to shame It may please a kind father to chasten even his beloved children answered the Vicar I think said a gentleman near the foot of the table that the Covenanters made some apology of the same kind for the failure of their prophecies at the battle of Dunbar when their mutinous preachers compelled the prudent Lesley to go down against the Philistines in Gilgal The Vicar fixed a scrutinizing and not a very complacent eye upon this intruder He was a young man of mean stature and rather a reserved appearance Early and severe study had quenched in his features the gaiety peculiar to his age and impressed upon them a premature cast of thoughtfulness His eye had however retained its fire and his gesture its animation Had he remained silent he would have been long unnoticed but when he spoke there was something in his manner which arrested attention Who is this young man said the Vicar in a low voice to his neighbour A Scotchman called Maxwell on a visit to Sir Henry was the answer I thought so from his accent and his manners said the Vicar It may be here observed that the northern English retain rather more of the ancient hereditary aversion to their neighbours than their countrymen of the south The interference of other disputants each of whom urged his opinion with all the vehemence of wine and politics rendered the summons to the drawing room agreeable to the more sober part of the company The company dispersed by degrees and at length the Vicar and the young Scotchman alone remained besides the Baronet his lady daughters and myself The clergyman had not it would seem forgot the observation which ranked him with the false prophets of Dunbar for he addressed mister Maxwell upon the first opportunity Hem I think sir you mentioned something about the civil wars of last century You must be deeply skilled in them indeed if you can draw any parallel betwixt those and the present evil days days which I am ready to maintain are the most gloomy that ever darkened the prospects of Britain God forbid Doctor that I should draw a comparison between the present times and those you mention I am too sensible of the advantages we enjoy over our ancestors Faction and ambition have introduced division among us but we are still free from the guilt of civil bloodshed and from all the evils which flow from it Our foes sir are not those of our own household and while we continue united and firm from the attacks of a foreign enemy however artful or however inveterate we have I hope little to dread Have you found anything curious mister Maxwell among the dusty papers said Sir Henry who seemed to dread a revival of political discussion My investigation amongst them led to reflections at which I have just now hinted said Maxwell and I think they are pretty strongly exemplified by a story which I have been endeavouring to arrange from some of your family manuscripts You are welcome to make what use of them you please said Sir Henry they have been undisturbed for many a day and I have often wished for some person as well skilled as you in these old pot hooks to tell me their meaning Those I just mentioned answered Maxwell relate to a piece of private history savouring not a little of the marvellous and intimately connected with your family if it is agreeable I can read to you the anecdotes in the modern shape into which I have been endeavouring to throw them and you can then judge of the value of the originals There was something in this proposal agreeable to all parties Sir Henry had family pride which prepared him to take an interest in whatever related to his ancestors The ladies had dipped deeply into the fashionable reading of the present day Lady Ratcliff and her fair daughters had climbed every pass viewed every pine shrouded ruin heard every groan and lifted every trap door in company with the noted heroine of Udolpho They had been heard however to observe that the famous incident of the Black Veil singularly resembled the ancient apologue of the mountain in labour so that they were unquestionably critics as well as admirers Besides all this they had valorously mounted en croupe behind the ghostly horseman of Prague through all his seven translators and followed the footsteps of Moor through the forest of Bohemia Moreover it was even hinted but this was a greater mystery than all the rest that a certain performance called the Monk in three neat volumes had been seen by a prying eye in the right hand drawer of the Indian cabinet of Lady Ratcliff s dressing room Thus predisposed for wonders and signs Lady Ratcliff and her nymphs drew their chairs round a large blazing wood fire and arranged themselves to listen to the tale To that fire I also approached moved thereunto partly by the inclemency of the season and partly that my deafness which you know cousin I acquired during my campaign under Prince Charles Edward might be no obstacle to the gratification of my curiosity which was awakened by what had any reference to the fate of such faithful followers of royalty as you well know the house of Ratcliff have ever been To this wood fire the Vicar likewise drew near and reclined himself conveniently in his chair seemingly disposed to testify his disrespect for the narration and narrator by falling asleep as soon as he conveniently could By the side of Maxwell by the way I cannot learn that he is in the least related to the Nithsdale family was placed a small table and a couple of lights by the assistance of which he read as follows Journal of Jan Van Eulen On the sixth November sixteen forty five I Jan Van Eulen

have not formerly made you acquainted with the abilities of Frank Ratcliff There is not a battle fought between the troops of the Prince and of the Government during the years seventeen forty five forty six of which he is not able to give an account It is true I have taken particular pains to fix the events of this important period upon his memory by frequent repetition No my dear said Maxwell in answer to young Frank Ratcliff No my dear I cannot tell you the exact particulars of the engagement but its consequences appear from the following letter despatched by Garbonete Von Eulen daughter of our journalist to a relation in England from whom she implored assistance After some general account of the purpose of the voyage and of the engagement her narrative proceeds thus The noise of the cannon had hardly ceased before the sounds of a language to me but half known and the confusion on board our vessel informed me that the captors had boarded us and taken possession of our vessel I went on deck where the first spectacle that met my eyes was a young man mate of our vessel who though disfigured and covered with blood was loaded with irons and whom they were forcing over the side of the vessel into a boat The two principal persons among our enemies appeared to be a man of a tall thin figure with a high crowned hat and long neckband and short cropped head of hair accompanied by a bluff open looking elderly man in a naval uniform Yarely yarely pull away my hearts said the latter and the boat bearing the unlucky young man soon carried him on board the frigate Perhaps you will blame me for mentioning this circumstance but consider my dear cousin this man saved my life and his fate even when my own and my father s were in the balance could not but affect me nearly In the name of Him who is jealous even to slaying said the first CETERA DESUNT NO II CONCLUSION OF mister STRUTT S ROMANCE OF QUEENHOO HALL BY THE AUTHOR OF WAVERLEY CHAPTER IV A HUNTING PARTY AN ADVENTURE A DELIVERANCE THE next morning the bugles were sounded by daybreak in the court of Lord Boteler s mansion to call the inhabitants from their slumbers to assist in a splendid chase with which the Baron had resolved to entertain his neighbour Fitzallen and his noble visitor saint Clare Peter Lanaret the falconer was in attendance with falcons for the knights and teircelets for the ladies if they should choose to vary their sport from hunting to hawking Five stout yeomen keepers with their attendants called Ragged Robins all meetly arrayed in Kendal green with bugles and short hangers by their sides and quarter staffs in their hands led the slow hounds or brachets by which the deer were to be put up Ten brace of gallant greyhounds each of which was fit to pluck down singly the tallest red deer were led in leashes by as many of Lord Boteler s foresters The pages squires and other attendants of feudal splendour well attired in their best hunting gear upon horseback or foot according to their rank with their boar spears long bows and cross bows were in seemly waiting A numerous train of yeomen called in the language of the times retainers who yearly received a livery coat and a small pension for their attendance on such solemn occasions appeared in cassocks of blue bearing upon their arms the cognisance of the house of Boteler as a badge of their adherence They were the tallest men of their hands that the neighbouring villages could supply with every man his good buckler on his shoulder and a bright burnished broadsword dangling from his leathern belt On this occasion they acted as rangers for beating up the thickets and rousing the game These attendants filled up the court of the castle spacious as it was On the green without you might have seen the motley assemblage of peasantry convened by report of the splendid hunting including most of our old acquaintances from Tewin as well as the jolly partakers of good cheer at Hob Filcher s Gregory the jester it may well be guessed had no great mind to exhibit himself in public after his recent disaster but Oswald the steward a great formalist in whatever concerned the public exhibition of his master s household state had positively enjoined his attendance What quoth he shall the house of the brave Lord Boteler on such a brave day as this be without a fool Certes the good Lord Saint Clere and his fair lady sister might think our housekeeping as niggardly as that of their churlish kinsman at Gay Bowers who sent his father s jester to the hospital sold the poor sot s bells for hawk jesses and made a nightcap of his long eared bonnet And sirrah let me see thee fool handsomely speak squibs and crackers instead of that dry barren musty gibing which thou hast used of late or by the bones the porter shall have thee to his lodge and cob thee with thine own wooden sword till thy skin is as motley as thy doublet To this stern injunction Gregory made no reply any more than to the courteous offer of old Albert Drawslot the chief parkkeeper who proposed to blow vinegar in his nose to sharpen his wit as he had done that blessed morning to Bragger the old hound whose scent was failing There was indeed little time for reply for the bugles after a lively flourish were now silent and Peretto with his two attendant minstrels stepping beneath the windows of the strangers apartments joined in the following roundelay the deep voices of the rangers and falconers making up a chorus that caused the very battlements to ring again Waken lords and ladies gay On the mountain dawns the day All the jolly chase is here With hawk and horse and hunting spear Hounds are in their couples yelling Hawks are whistling horns are knelling Merrily merrily mingle they Waken lords and ladies gay Waken lords and ladies gay The mist has left the mountain grey Springlets in the dawn are streaming Diamonds on the brake are gleaming And foresters have busy been To track the buck in thicket green Now we come to chant our lay Waken lords and ladies gay Waken lords and ladies gay To the green wood haste away We can show you where he lies Fleet of foot and tall of size We can show the marks he made When gamst the oak his antlers frayed You shall see him brought to bay Waken lords and ladies gay Louder louder chant the lay Waken lords and ladies gay Tell them youth and mirth and glee Run a course as well as we Time stern huntsman who can baulk Stanch as hound and fleet as hawk Think of this and rise with day Gentle lords and ladies gay By the time this lay was finished Lord Boteler with his daughter and kinsman Fitzallen of Harden and other noble guests had mounted their palfreys and the hunt set forward in due order The huntsmen having carefully observed the traces of a large stag on the preceding evening were able without loss of time to conduct the company by the marks which they had made upon the trees to the side of the thicket in which by the report of Drawslot he had harboured all night The horsemen spreading themselves along the side of the cover waited until the keeper entered leading his ban dog a large blood hound tied in a learn or band from which he takes his name But it befell thus A hart of the second year which was in the same cover with the proper object of their pursuit chanced to be unharboured first and broke cover very near where the Lady Emma and her brother were stationed An inexperienced varlet who was nearer to them instantly unloosed two tall greyhounds who sprung after the fugitive with all the fleetness of the north wind Gregory restored a little to spirits by the enlivening scene around him followed encouraging the hounds with a loud layout for which he had the hearty curses of the huntsman as well as of the Baron who entered into the spirit of the chase with all the juvenile ardour of twenty May the foul fiend booted and spurred ride down his bawling throat with a scythe at his girdle quoth Albert Drawslot here have I been telling him that all the marks were those of a buck of the first head and he has hallooed the hounds upon a velvet headed knobbler By Saint Hubert if I break not his pate with my cross bow may I never cast off hound more But to it my lords and masters the noble beast is here yet and thank the saints we have enough of hounds The cover being now thoroughly beat by the attendants the stag was compelled to abandon it and trust to his speed for his safety Three greyhounds were slipped upon him whom he threw out after running a couple of miles by entering an extensive furzy brake which extended along the side of a hill The horsemen soon came up and casting off a sufficient number of slow hounds sent them with the prickers into the cover in order to drive the game from his strength This object being accomplished afforded another severe chase of several miles in a direction almost circular during which the poor animal tried every wile to get rid of his persecutors He crossed and traversed all such dusty paths as were likely to retain the least scent of his footsteps he laid himself close to the ground drawing his feet under his belly and clapping his nose close to the earth lest he should be betrayed to the hounds by his breath and hoofs When all was in vain and he found the hounds coming fast in upon him his own strength failing his mouth embossed with foam and the tears dropping from his eyes he turned in despair upon his pursuers who then stood at gaze making an hideous clamour and awaiting their two footed auxiliaries Of these it chanced that the Lady Eleanor taking more pleasure in the sport than Matilda and being a less burden to her palfrey than the Lord Boteler was the first who arrived at the spot and taking a cross bow from an attendant discharged a bolt at the stag When the infuriated animal felt himself wounded he pushed frantically towards her from whom he had received the shaft and Lady Eleanor might have had occasion to repent of her enterprise had not young Fitzallen who had kept near her during the whole day at that instant galloped briskly in and ere the stag could change his object of assault despatched him with his short hunting sword Albert Drawslot who had just come up in terror for the young lady s safety broke out into loud encomiums upon Fitzallen s strength and gallantry By r Lady said he taking off his cap and wiping his sun burnt face with his sleeve well struck and in good time But now boys doff your bonnets and sound the mort The sportsmen then sounded a treble mort and set up a general whoop which mingled with the yelping of the dogs made the welkin ring again The huntsman then offered his knife to Lord Boteler that he might take the say of the deer but the Baron courteously insisted upon Fitzallen going through that ceremony The Lady Matilda was now come up with most of the attendants and the interest of the chase being ended it excited some surprise that neither Saint Clere nor his sister made their appearance The Lord Boteler commanded the horns again to sound the recheat in hopes to call in the stragglers and said to Fitzallen Methinks Saint Clere so distinguished for service in war should have been more forward in the chase I trow said Peter Lanaret I know the reason of the noble lord s absence for when that mooncalf Gregory hallooed the dogs upon the knobbler and galloped like a green hilding as he is after them I saw the Lady Emma s palfrey follow apace after that varlet who should be thrashed for overrunning and I think her noble brother has followed her lest she should come to harm But here by the rood is Gregory to answer for himself At this moment Gregory entered the circle which had been formed round the deer out of breath and his face covered with blood He kept for some time uttering inarticulate cries of Harrow and Wellaway and other exclamations of distress and terror pointing all the while to a thicket at some distance from the spot where the deer had been killed By my honour said the Baron I would gladly know who has dared to array the poor knave thus and I trust he should dearly abye his outrecuidance were he the best save one in England Gregory who had now found more breath cried Help an ye be men Save Lady Emma and her brother whom they are murdering in Brokenhurst thicket This put all in motion Lord Boteler hastily commanded a small party of his men to abide for the defence of the ladies while he himself Fitzallen and the rest made what speed they could towards the thicket guided by Gregory who for that purpose was mounted behind Fabian Pushing through a narrow path the first object they encountered was a man of small stature lying on the ground mastered and almost strangled by two dogs which were instantly recognised to be those that had accompanied Gregory A little farther was an open space where lay three bodies of dead or wounded men beside these was Lady Emma apparently lifeless her brother and a young forester bending over and endeavouring to recover her By employing the usual remedies this was soon accomplished while Lord Boteler astonished at such a scene anxiously inquired at Saint Clere the meaning of what he saw and whether more danger was to be expected For the present I trust not said the young warrior who they now observed was slightly wounded but I pray you of your nobleness let the woods here be searched for we were assaulted by four of these base assassins and I see three only on the sward The attendants now brought forwaid the person whom they had rescued from the dogs and Henry with disgust shame and astonishment recognised his kinsman Gaston Saint Clere This discovery he communicated in a whisper to Lord Boteler who commanded the prisoner to be conveyed to Queenhoo Hall and closely guarded meanwhile he anxiously inquired of young Saint Clere about his wound A scratch a trifle cried Henry I am in less haste to bind it than to introduce to you one without whose aid that of the leech would have come too late Where is he where is my brave deliverer Here most noble lord said Gregory sliding from his palfrey and stepping forward ready to receive the guerdon which your bounty would heap on him Truly friend Gregory answered the young warrior thou shalt not be forgotten for thou didst run speedily and roar manfully for aid without which I think verily we had not received it But the brave forester who came to my rescue when these three ruffians had nigh overpowered me where is he Every one looked around but though all had seen him on entering the thicket he was not now to be found They could only conjecture that he had retired during the confusion occasioned by the detention of Gaston Seek not for him said the Lady Emma who had now in some degree recovered her composure he will not be found of mortal unless at his own season The Baron convinced from this answer that her terror had for the time somewhat disturbed her reason forbore to question her and Matilda and Eleanor to whom a message had been despatched with the result of this strange adventure arriving they took the Lady Emma between them and all in a body returned to the castle The distance was however considerable and before reaching it they had another alarm The prickers who rode foremost in the troop halted and announced to the Lord Boteler that they perceived advancing towards them a body of armed men The followers of the Baron were numerous but they were arrayed for the chase not for battle and it was with great pleasure that he discerned on the pennon of the advancing body of men at arms instead of the cognisance of Gaston as he had some reason to expect the friendly bearings of Fitzosborne of Diggswell the same young lord who was present at the May games with Fitzallen of Harden The knight himself advanced sheathed in armour and without raising his visor informed Lord Boteler that having heard of a base attempt made upon a part of his train by ruffianly assassins he had mounted and armed a small party of his retainers to escort them to Queenhoo Hall Having received and accepted an invitation to attend them thither they prosecuted their journey in confidence and security and arrived safe at home without any further accident CHAPTER V INVESTIGATION OF THE ADVENTURE OF THE HUNTING A DISCOVERY GREGORY S MANHOOD PATE OF GASTON SAINT CLERE CONCLUSION So soon as they arrived at the princely mansion of Boteler the Lady Emma craved permission to retire to her chamber that she might compose her spirits after the terror she had undergone Henry Saint Clere in a few words proceeded to explain the adventure to the curious audience I had no sooner seen my sister s palfrey in spite of her endeavours to the contrary entering with spirit into the chase set on foot by the worshipful Gregory than I rode after to give her assistance So long was the chase that when the greyhounds pulled down the knobbler we were out of hearing of your bugles and having rewarded and coupled the dogs I gave them to be led by the jester and we wandered in quest of our company whom it would seem the sport had led in a different direction At length passing through the thicket where you found us I was surprised by a cross bow bolt whizzing past mine head I drew my sword and rushed into the thicket but was instantly assailed by two ruffians while other two made towards my sister and Gregory The poor knave fled crying for help pursued by my false kinsman now your prisoner and the designs of the other on my poor Emma murderous no doubt were prevented by the sudden apparition of a brave woodsman who after a short encounter stretched the miscreant at his feet and came to my assistance I was already slightly wounded and nearly overlaid with odds The combat lasted some time for the caitiffs were both well armed strong and desperate at length however we had each mastered our antagonist when your retinue my Lord Boteler arrived to my relief So ends my story but by my knighthood I would give an earl s ransom for an opportunity of thanking the gallant forester by whose aid I live to tell it Fear not said Lord Boteler he shall be found if this or the four adjacent counties hold him And now Lord Fitzosborne will be pleased to doff the armour he has so kindly assumed for our sakes and we will all bowne ourselves for the banquet When the hour of dinner approached the Lady Matilda and her cousin visited the chamber of the fair Darcy They found her in a composed but melancholy postmire She turned the discourse upon the misfortunes of her life and hinted that having recovered her brother and seeing him look forward to the society of one who would amply repay to him the loss of hers she had thoughts of dedicating her remaining life to Heaven by whose providential interference it had been so often preserved Matilda coloured deeply at something in this speech and her cousin inveighed loudly against Emma s resolution Ah my dear lady Eleanor replied she I have to day witnessed what I cannot but judge a supernatural visitation and to what end can it call me but to give myself to the altar That peasant who guided me to Baddow through the Park of Danbury the same who appeared before me at different times and in different forms during that eventful journey that youth whose features are imprinted on my memory is the very individual forester who this day rescued us in the forest I cannot be mistaken and connecting these marvellous appearances with the spectre which I saw while at Gay Bowers I cannot resist the conviction that Heaven has permitted my guardian angel to assume mortal shape for my relief and protection The fair cousins after exchanging looks which implied a fear that her mind was wandering answered her in soothing terms and finally prevailed upon her to accompany them to the banqueting hall Here the first person they encountered was the Baron Fitzosborne of Diggswell now divested of his armour at the sight of whom the Lady Emma changed colour and exclaiming It is the same sunk senseless into the arms of Matilda She is bewildered by the terrors of the day said Eleanor and we have done ill in obliging her to descend And I said Fitzosborne have done madly in presenting before her one whose presence must recall moments the most alarming in her life While the ladies supported Emma from the hall Lord Boteler and Saint Clere requested an explanation from Fitzosborne of the words he had used Trust me gentle lords said the Baron of Diggswell ye shall have what ye demand when I learn that Lady Emma Darcy has not suffered from my imprudence At this moment Lady Matilda returning said that her fair friend on her recovery had calmly and deliberately insisted that she had seen Fitzosborne before in the most dangerous crisis of her life I dread said she her disordered mind connects all that her eye beholds with the terrible passages that she has witnessed Nay said Fitzosborne if noble Saint Clere can pardon the unauthorized interest which with the purest and most honourable intentions I have taken in his sister s fate it is easy for me to explain this mysterious impression He proceeded to say that happening to be in the hostelry called the Griffin near Baddow while upon a journey in that country he had met with the old nurse of the Lady Emma Darcy who being just expelled from Gay Bowers was in the height of her grief and indignation and made loud and public proclamation of Lady Emma s wrongs From the description she gave of the beauty of her foster child as well as from the spirit of chivalry Fitzosborne became interested in her fate This interest was deeply enhanced when by a bribe to old Gaunt the Reve he procured a view of the Lady Emma as she walked near the castle of Gay Bowers The aged churl refused to give him access to the castle yet dropped some hints as if he thought the lady in danger and wished she were well out of it His master he said had heard she had a brother in life and since that deprived him of all chance of gaining her domains by purchase he in short Gaunt wished they were safely separated If any injury quoth he should happen to the damsel here it were ill for us all I tried by an innocent stratagem to frighten her from the castle by introducing a figure through a trap door and warning her as if by a voice from the dead to retreat from thence but the giglet is wilful and is running upon her fate Finding Gaunt although covetous and communicative too faithful a servant to his wicked master to take any active steps against his commands Fitzosborne applied himself to old Ursely whom he found more tractable Through her he learned the dreadful plot Gaston had laid to rid himself of his kinswoman and resolved to effect her deliverance But aware of the delicacy of Emma s situation he charged Ursely to conceal from her the interest he took in her distress resolving to watch over her in disguise until he saw her in a place of safety Hence the appearance he made before her in various dresses during her journey in the course of which he was never far distant and he had always four stout yeomen within hearing of his bugle had assistance been necessary When she was placed in safety at the lodge it was Fitzosborne s intention to have prevailed upon his sisters to visit and take her under their protection but he found them absent from Diggswell having gone to attend an aged relation who lay dangerously ill in a distant county They did not return until the day before the May games and the other events followed too rapidly to permit Fitzosborne to lay any plan for introducing them to Lady Emma Darcy On the day of the chase he resolved to preserve his romantic disguise and attend the Lady Emma as a forester partly to have the pleasure of being near her and partly to judge whether according to an idle report in the country she favoured his friend and comrade Fitzallen of Marden This last motive it may easily be believed he did not declare to the company After the skirmish with the ruffians he waited till the Baron and the hunters arrived and then still doubting the farther designs of Gaston hastened to his castle to arm the band which had escorted them to Queenhoo Hall Fitzosborne s story being finished he received the thanks of all the company particularly of Saint Clere who felt deeply the respectful delicacy with which he had conducted himself towards his sister The lady was carefully informed of her obligations to him and it is left to the well judging reader whether even the raillery of Lady Eleanor made her regret that Heaven had only employed natural means for her security and that the guardian angel was converted into a handsome gallant and enamoured knight The joy of the company in the hall extended itself to the buttery where Gregory the jester narrated such feats of arms done by himself in the fray of the morning as might have shamed Bevis and Guy of Warwick He was according to his narrative singled out for destruction by the gigantic Baron himself while he abandoned to meaner hands the destruction of Saint Clere and Fitzosborne But certes said he the foul paynim met his match for ever as he foined at me with his brand I parried his blows with my bauble and closing with him upon the third veny threw him to the ground and made him cry recreant to an unarmed man Tush man said Drawslot thou forgettest thy best auxiliaries the good greyhounds Help and Holdfast I warrant thee that when the hump backed Baron caught thee by the cowl which he hath almost torn off thou hadst been in a fair plight had they not remembered an old friend and come in to the rescue Why man I found them fastened on him myself and there was odd staving and stickling to make them ware haunch Their mouths were full of the flex for I pulled a piece of the garment from their jaws I warrant thee that when they brought him to ground thou fledst like a frighted pricket And as for Gregory s gigantic paynim said Fabian why he lies yonder in the guard room the very size shape and colour of a spider in a yew hedge It is false said Gregory Colbrand the Dane was a dwarf to him It is as true returned Fabian as that the Tasker is to be married on Tuesday to pretty Margery Gregory thy sheet hath brought them between a pair of blankets I care no more for such a gillflirt said the jester than I do for thy leasings Marry thou hop o my thumb happy wouldst thou be could thy head reach the captive Baron s girdle By the mass said Peter Lanaret I will have one peep at this burly gallant and leaving the buttery he went to the guard room where Gaston Saint Clere was confined A man at arms who kept sentinel on the strong studded door of the apartment said he believed he slept for that after raging stamping and uttering the most horrid imprecations he had been of late perfectly still The falconer gently drew back a sliding board of a foot square towards the top of the door which covered a hole of the same size strongly latticed through which the warder without opening the door could look in upon his prisoner From this aperture he beheld the wretched Gaston suspended by the neck by his own girdle to an iron ring in the side of his prison He had clambered to it by means of the table on which his food had been placed and in the agonies of shame and disappointed malice had adopted this mode of ridding himself of a wretched life He was found yet warm but totally lifeless A proper account of the manner of his death was drawn up and certified He was buried that evening in the chapel of the castle out of respect to his high birth and the chaplain of Fitzallen of Marden who said the service upon the occasion preached the next Sunday an excellent sermon upon the text Radix malorum est cupiditas which we have here transcribed Here the manuscript from which we have painfully transcribed and frequently as it were translated this tale for the reader s edification is so indistinct and defaced that excepting certain howbeits nathlesses lo ye s et cetera we can pick out little that is intelligible saving that avarice is defined a likourishness of heart after earthly things A little farther there seems to have been a gay account of Margery s wedding with Ralph the Tasker the running at the quintain and other rural games practised on the occasion There are also fragments of a mock sermon preached by Gregory upon that occasion as for example My dear cursed caitiffs there was once a king and he wedded a young old queen and she had a child and this child was sent to Solomon the Sage praying he would give it the same blessing which he got from the witch of Endor when she bit him by the heel Hereof speaks the worthy Doctor Radigundus Potator why should not mass be said for all the roasted shoe souls served up in the king s dish on Saturday for true it is that Saint Peter asked Father Adam as they journeyed to Camelot an high great and doubtful question Adam Adam why eated saint thou the apple without paring Footnote This tirade of gibberish is literally taken or selected from a mock discourse pronounced by a professed jester which occurs in an ancient manuscript in the Advocates Library the same from which the late ingenious mister Weber published the curious comic romance of the Hunting of the Hare It was introduced in compliance with mister Strutt s plan of rendering his tale an illustration of ancient manners A similar burlesque sermon is pronounced by the fool in Sir David Lindesay s satire of the Three Estates The nonsense and vulgar burlesque of that composition illustrate the ground of Sir Andrew Aguecheek s eulogy on the exploits of the jester in Twelfth Night who reserving his sharper jests for Sir Toby had doubtless enough of the jargon of his calling to captivate the imbecility of his brother knight who is made to exclaim In sooth thou wast in very gracious fooling last night when thou spokest of Pigrogremitus and of the vapours passing the equinoctials of Quenbus t was very good i faith It is entertaining to find commentators seeking to discover some meaning in the professional jargon of such a passage as this With much goodly gibberish to the same effect which display of Gregory s ready wit not only threw the whole company into convulsions of laughter but made such an impression on Rose the Potter s daughter that it was thought it would be the Jester s own fault if Jack was long without his Jill Much pithy matter concerning the bringing the bride to bed the loosing the bridegroom s points the scramble which ensued for them and the casting of the stocking is also omitted from its obscurity The following song which has been since borrowed by the worshipful author of the famous History of Fryar Bacon has been with difficulty deciphered It seems to have been sung on occasion of carrying home the bride Bridal Song To the tune of I have been a Fiddler et cetera And did you not hear of a mirth befell The morrow after a wedding day And carrying a bride at home to dwell And away to Tewin away away The quintain was set and the garlands were made T is pity old customs should ever decay And woe be to him that was horsed on a jade For he carried no credit away away We met a consort of fiddle de dees We set them a cockhorse and made them play The winning of Bullen and Upsey frees And away to Tewin away away There was ne er a lad in all the parish That would go to the plough that day But on his fore horse his wench he carries And away to Tewin away away The butler was quick and the ale he did tap The maidens did make the chamber full gay The servants did give me a fuddling cup And I did carry t away away The smith of the town his liquor so took That he was persuaded that the ground look d blue And I dare boldly be sworn on a book Such smiths as he there s but a few A posset was made and the women did sip And simpering said they could eat no more Full many a maiden was laid on the lip I ll say no more but give o er give o er But what our fair readers will chiefly regret is the loss of three declarations of love the first by Saint Clere to Matilda which with the lady s answer occupies fifteen closely written pages of manuscript That of Fitzosborne to Emma is not much shorter but the amours of Fitzallen and Eleanor being of a less romantic cast are closed in three pages only The three noble couples were married in Queenhoo Hall upon the same day being the twentieth Sunday after Easter There is a prolix account of the marriage feast of which we can pick out the names of a few dishes such as peterel crane sturgeon swan et cetera et cetera with a profusion of wild fowl and venison We also see that a suitable song was produced by Peretto on the occasion and that the bishop who blessed the bridal beds which received the happy couples was no niggard of his holy water bestowing half a gallon upon each of the couches We regret we cannot give these curiosities to the reader in detail but we hope to expose the manuscript to abler antiquaries so soon as it shall be framed and glazed by the ingenious artist who rendered that service to mister Ireland s Shakspeare MSS And so being unable to lay aside the style to which our pen is habituated gentle reader we bid thee heartily farewell NO III ANECDOTE OF SCHOOL DAYS UPON WHICH mister THOMAS SCOTT PROPOSED TO FOUND A TALE OF FICTION It is well known in the South that there is little or no boxing at the Scottish schools About forty or fifty years ago however a far more dangerous mode of fighting in parties or factions was permitted in the streets of Edinburgh to the great disgrace of the police and danger of the parties concerned These parties were generally formed from the quarters of the town in which the combatants resided those of a particular square or district fighting against those of an adjoining one Hence it happened that the children of the higher classes were often pitted against those of the lower each taking their side according to the residence of their friends So far as I recollect however it was unmingled either with feelings of democracy or aristocracy or indeed with malice or ill will of any kind towards the opposite party In fact it was only a rough mode of play Such contests were however maintained with great vigour with stones and sticks and fisticuffs when one party dared to charge and the other stood their ground Of course mischief sometimes happened boys are said to have been killed at these bickers as they were called and serious accidents certainly took place as many contemporaries can bear witness The author s father residing in George Square in the southern side of Edinburgh the boys belonging to that family with others in the square were arranged into a sort of company to which a lady of distinction presented a handsome set of colours Now this company or regiment as a matter of course was engaged in weekly warfare with the boys inhabiting the Crosscauseway Bristo Street the Potterrow in short the neighbouring suburbs These last were chiefly of the lower rank but hardy loons who threw stones to a hair s breadth and were very rugged antagonists at close quarters The skirmish sometimes lasted for a whole evening until one party or the other was victorious when if ours were successful we drove the enemy to their quarters and were usually chased back by the reinforcement of bigger lads who came to their assistance If on the contrary we were pursued as was often the case into the precincts of our square we were in our turn supported by our elder brothers domestic servants and similar auxiliaries It followed from our frequent opposition to each other that though not knowing the names of our enemies we were yet well acquainted with their appearance and had nicknames for the most remarkable of them One very active and spirited boy might be considered as the principal leader in the cohort of the suburbs He was I suppose thirteen or fourteen years old finely made tall blue eyed with long fair hair the very picture of a youthful Goth This lad was always first in the charge and last in the retreat the Achilles at once and Ajax of the Crosscauseway He was too formidable to us not to have a cognomen and like that of a knight of old it was taken from the most remarkable part of his dress being a pair of old green livery breeches which was the principal part of his clothing for like Pentapolin according to Don Quixote s account Green Breeks as we called him always entered the battle with bare arms legs and feet It fell that once upon a time when the combat was at the thickest this plebeian champion headed a sudden charge so rapid and furious that all fled before him He was several paces before his comrades and had actually laid his hands on the patrician standard when one of our party whom some misjudging friend had entrusted with a couleau de chasse or hanger inspired with a zeal for the honour of the corps worthy of Major Sturgeon himself struck poor Green Breeks over the head with strength sufficient to cut him down When this was seen the casualty was so far beyond what had ever taken place before that both parties fled different ways leaving poor Green Breeks with his bright hair plentifully dabbled in blood to the care of the watchman who honest man took care not to know who had done the mischief The bloody hanger was flung into one of the Meadow ditches and solemn secrecy was sworn on all hands but the remorse and terror of the actor were beyond all bounds and his apprehensions of the most dreadful character The wounded hero was for a few days in the Infirmary the case being only a trifling one But though inquiry was strongly pressed on him no argument could make him indicate the person from whom he had received the wound though he must have been perfectly well known to him When he recovered and was dismissed the author and his brothers opened a communication with him through the medium of a popular ginger bread baker of whom both parties were customers in order to tender a subsidy in name of smart money The sum would excite ridicule were I to name it but sure I am that the pockets of the noted Green Breeks never held as much money of his own He declined the remittance saying that he would not sell his blood but at the same time reprobated the idea of being an informer which he said was clam i e base or mean With much urgency he accepted a pound of snuff for the use of some old woman aunt grandmother or the like with whom he lived We did not become friends for the bickers were more agreeable to both parties than any more pacific amusement but we conducted them ever after under mutual assurances of the highest consideration for each other Such was the hero whom mister Thomas Scott proposed to carry to Canada and involve in adventures with the natives and colonists of that country Perhaps the youthful generosity of the lad will not seem so great in the eyes of others as to those whom it was the means of screening from severe rebuke and punishment But it seemed to those concerned to argue a nobleness of sentiment far beyond the pitch of most minds and however obscurely the lad who showed such a frame of noble spirit may have lived or died I cannot help being of opinion that if fortune had placed him in circumstances calling for gallantry or generosity the man would have fulfilled the promise of the boy Long afterwards when the story was told to my father he censured us severely for not telling the truth at the time that he might have attempted to be of use to the young man in entering on life But our alarms for the consequences of the drawn sword and the wound inflicted with such a weapon were far too predominant at the time for such a pitch of generosity Perhaps I ought not to have inserted this schoolboy tale but besides the strong impression made by the incident at the time the whole accompaniments of the story are matters to me of solemn and sad recollection Of all the little band who were concerned in those juvenile sports or brawls I can scarce recollect a single survivor Some left the ranks of mimic war to die in the active service of their country Many sought distant lands to return no more Others dispersed in different paths of life my dim eyes now seek for in vain Of five brothers all healthy and promising in a degree far beyond one whose infancy was visited by personal infirmity and whose health after this period seemed long very precarious I am nevertheless the only survivor The best loved and the best deserving to be loved who had destined this incident to be the foundation of literary composition died before his day in a distant and foreign land and trifles assume an importance not their own when connected with those who have been loved and lost NOTES NOTE I LONG the oracle of the country gentlemen of the high Tory party The ancient News Letter was written in manuscript and copied by clerks who addressed the copies to the subscribers The politician by whom they were compiled picked up his intelligence at coffee houses and often pleaded for an additional gratuity in consideration of the extra expense attached to frequenting such places of fashionable resort NOTE two There is a family legend to this purpose belonging to the knightly family of Bradshaigh the proprietors of Haigh Hall in Lancashire where I have been told the event is recorded on a painted glass window The German ballad of the Noble Moringer turns upon a similar topic But undoubtedly many such incidents may have taken place where the distance being great and the intercourse infrequent false reports concerning the fate of the absent Crusaders must have been commonly circulated and sometimes perhaps rather hastily credited at home NOTE three The attachment to this classic was it is said actually displayed in the manner mentioned in the text by an unfortunate Jacobite in that unhappy period He escaped from the jail in which he was confined for a hasty trial and certain condemnation and was retaken as he hovered around the place in which he had been imprisoned for which he could give no better reason than the hope of recovering his favourite Titus Livius I am sorry to add that the simplicity of such a character was found to form no apology for his guilt as a rebel and that he was condemned and executed NOTE four Nicholas Amhurst a noted political writer who conducted for many years a paper called the Craftsman under the assumed name of Caleb D Anvers He was devoted to the Tory interest and seconded with much ability the attacks of Pulteney on Sir Robert Walpole He died in seventeen forty two neglected by his great patrons and in the most miserable circumstances Amhurst survived the downfall of Walpole s power and had reason to expect a reward for his labours If we excuse Bolingbroke who had only saved the shipwreck of his fortunes we shall be at a loss to justify Pulteney who could with ease have given this man a considerable income The utmost of his generosity to Amhurst that I ever heard of was a hogshead of claret He died it is supposed of a broken heart and was buried at the charge of his honest printer Richard Francklin Lord Chesterfield s Characters Reviewed p forty two NOTE five I have now given in the text the full name of this gallant and excellent man and proceed to copy the account of his remarkable conversion as related by Doctor Doddridge This memorable event says the pious writer happened towards the middle of July seventeen nineteen The major had spent the evening and if I mistake not it was the Sabbath in some gay company and had an unhappy assignation with a married woman whom he was to attend exactly at twelve The company broke up about eleven and not judging it convenient to anticipate the time appointed he went into his chamber to kill the tedious hour perhaps with some amusing book or some other way But it very accidentally happened that he took up a religious book which his good mother or aunt had without his knowledge slipped into his portmanteau It was called if I remember the title exactly The Christian Soldier or Heaven taken by Storm and it was written by mister Thomas Watson Guessing by the title of it that he would find some phrases of his own profession spiritualised in a manner which he thought might afford him some diversion he resolved to dip into it but he took no serious notice of anything it had in it and yet while this book was in his hand an impression was made upon his mind perhaps God only knows how which drew after it a train of the most important and happy consequences He thought he saw an unusual blaze of light fall upon the book which he was reading which he at first imagined might happen by some accident in the candle but lifting up his eyes he apprehended to his extreme amazement that there was before him as it were suspended in the air a visible representation of the Lord Jesus Christ upon the cross surrounded on all sides with a glory and was impressed as if a voice or something equivalent to a voice had come to him to this effect for he was not confident as to the words Oh sinner did I suffer this for thee and are these thy returns Struck with so amazing a phenomenon as this there remained hardly any life in him so that he sunk down in the arm chair in which he sat and continued he knew not how long insensible With regard to this vision says the ingenious doctor Hibbert the appearance of our Saviour on the cross and the awful words repeated can be considered in no other light than as so many recollected images of the mind which probably had their origin in the language of some urgent appeal to repentance that the colonel might have casually read or heard delivered From what cause however such ideas were rendered as vivid as actual impressions we have no information to be depended upon This vision was certainly attended with one of the most important of consequences connected with the Christian dispensation the conversion of a sinner And hence no single narrative has perhaps done more to confirm the superstitious opinion that apparitions of this awful kind cannot arise without a divine fiat Doctor Hibbert adds in a note A short time before the vision Colonel Gardiner had received a severe fall from his horse Did the brain receive some slight degree of injury from the accident so as to predispose him to this spiritual illusion Hibbert s Philosophy of Apparitions Edinburgh eighteen twenty four p one hundred ninety NOTE six The courtesy of an invitation to partake a traveller s meal or at least that of being invited to share whatever liquor the guest called for was expected by certain old landlords in Scotland even in the youth of the author In requital mine host was always furnished with the news of the country and was probably a little of a humorist to boot The devolution of the whole actual business and drudgery of the inn upon the poor gudewife was very common among the Scottish Bonifaces There was in ancient times in the city of Edinburgh a gentleman of good family who condescended in order to gain a livelihood to become the nominal keeper of a coffee house one of the first places of the kind which had been opened in the Scottish metropolis As usual it was entirely managed by the careful and industrious missus B while her husband amused himself with field sports without troubling his head about the matter Once upon a time the premises having taken fire the husband was met walking up the High Street loaded with his guns and fishing rods and replied calmly to someone who inquired after his wife that the poor woman was trying to save a parcel of crockery and some trumpery books the last being those which served her to conduct the business of the house There were many elderly gentlemen in the author s younger days who still held it part of the amusement of a journey to parley with mine host who often resembled in his quaint humour mine Host of the Garter in the Merry Wives of Windsor or Blague of the George in the Merry Devil of Edmonton Sometimes the landlady took her share of entertaining the company In either case the omitting to pay them due attention gave displeasure and perhaps brought down a smart jest as on the following occasion A jolly dame who not Sixty Years Since kept the principal caravansary at Greenlaw in Berwickshire had the honour to receive under her roof a very worthy clergyman with three sons of the same profession each having a cure of souls be it said in passing none of the reverend party were reckoned powerful in the pulpit After dinner was over the worthy senior in the pride of his heart asked missus Buchan whether she ever had had such a party in her house before Here sit I he said a placed minister of the Kirk of Scotland and here sit my three sons each a placed minister of the same kirk Confess Luckie Buchan you never had such a party in your house before The question was not premised by any invitation to sit down and take a glass of wine or the like so missus B answered drily Indeed sir I cannot just say that ever I had such a party in my house before except once in the forty five when I had a Highland piper here with his three sons all Highland pipers and deil a spring they could play amang them NOTE seven There is no particular mansion described under the name of Tully Veolan but the peculiarities of the description occur in various old Scottish seats The House of Warrender upon Bruntsfield Links and that of Old Ravelston belonging the former to Sir George Warrender the latter to Sir Alexander Keith have both contributed several hints to the description in the text The House of Dean near Edinburgh has also some points of resemblance with Tully Veolan The author has however been informed that the House of Grandtully resembles that of the Baron of Bradwardine still more than any of the above NOTE eight I am ignorant how long the ancient and established custom of keeping fools has been disused in England Swift writes an epitaph on the Earl of Suffolk s fool Whose name was Dickie Pearce In Scotland the custom subsisted till late in the last century at Glamis Castle is preserved the dress of one of the jesters very handsome and ornamented with many bells It is not above thirty years since such a character stood by the sideboard of a nobleman of the first rank in Scotland and occasionally mixed in the conversation till he carried the joke rather too far in making proposals to one of the young ladies of the family and publishing the bans betwixt her and himself in the public church NOTE nine After the Revolution of sixteen eighty eight and on some occasions when the spirit of the Presbyterians had been unusually animated against their opponents the Episcopal clergymen who were chiefly nonjurors were exposed to be mobbed as we should now say or rabbled as the phrase then went to expiate their political heresies But notwithstanding that the Presbyterians had the persecution in Charles II and his brother s time to exasperate them there was little mischief done beyond the kind of petty violence mentioned in the text NOTE ten I may here mention that the fashion of compotation described in the text was still occasionally practised in Scotland in the author s youth A company after having taken leave of their host often went to finish the evening at the clachan or village in womb of tavern Their entertainer always accompanied them to take the stirrup cup which often occasioned a long and late revel The poculum potatorium of the valiant Baron his blessed Bear has a prototype at the fine old Castle of Glamis so rich in memorials of ancient times it is a massive beaker of silver double gilt moulded into the shape of a lion and holding about an English pint of wine The form alludes to the family name of Strathmore which is Lyon and when exhibited the cup must necessarily be emptied to the Earl s health The author ought perhaps to be ashamed of recording that he has had the honour of swallowing the contents of the Lion and the recollection of the feat served to suggest the story of the Bear of Bradwardine In the family of Scott of Thirlestane not Thirlestane in the Forest but the place of the same name in Roxburghshire was long preserved a cup of the same kind in the form of a jack boot Each guest was obliged to empty this at his departure If the guest s name was Scott the necessity was doubly imperative When the landlord of an inn presented his guests with deoch an doruis that is the drink at the door or the stirrup cup the draught was not charged in the reckoning On this point a learned bailie of the town of Forfar pronounced a very sound judgment A an ale wife in Forfar had brewed her peck of malt and set the liquor out of doors to cool the cow of B a neighbour of A chanced to come by and seeing the good beverage was allured to taste it and finally to drink it up When A came to take in her liquor she found her tub empty and from the cow s staggering and staring so as to betray her intemperance she easily divined the mode in which her browst had disappeared To take vengeance on Crummie s ribs with a stick was her first effort The roaring of the cow brought B her master who remonstrated with his angry neighbour and received in reply a demand for the value of the ale which Crummie had drunk up B refused payment and was conveyed before C the bailie or sitting magistrate He heard the case patiently and then demanded of the plaintiff A whether the cow had sat down to her potation or taken it standing The plaintiff answered she had not seen the deed committed but she supposed the cow drank the ale while standing on her feet adding that had she been near she would have made her use them to some purpose The bailie on this admission solemnly adjudged the cow s drink to be deoch an doruis a stirrup cup for which no charge could be made without violating the ancient hospitality of Scotland NOTE eleven The story last told was said to have happened in the south of Scotland but cedant arma togae and let the gown have its dues It was an old clergyman who had wisdom and firmness enough to resist the panic which seized his brethren who was the means of rescuing a poor insane creature from the cruel fate which would otherwise have overtaken her The accounts of the trials for witchcraft form one of the most deplorable chapters in Scottish story NOTE twelve Although canting heraldry is generally reprobated it seems nevertheless to have been adopted in the arms and mottos of many honourable families Thus the motto of the Vernons Ver non semper viret is a perfect pun and so is that of the Onslows Festina lente The Periissem ni per iissem of the Anstruthers is liable to a similar objection One of that ancient race finding that an antagonist with whom he had fixed a friendly meeting was determined to take the opportunity of assassinating him prevented the hazard by dashing out his brains with a battle axe Two sturdy arms brandishing such a weapon form the usual crest of the family with the above motto Periissem ni per iissem I had died unless I had gone through with it NOTE thirteen Mac Donald of Barrisdale one of the very last Highland gentlemen who carried on the plundering system to any great extent was a scholar and a well bred gentleman He engraved on his broad swords the well known lines Hae tibi erunt artes pacisque imponere morem Parcere subjectis et debellare superbos Indeed the levying of black mail was before seventeen forty five practised by several chiefs of very high rank who in doing so contended that they were lending the laws the assistance of their arms and swords and affording a protection which could not be obtained from the magistracy in the disturbed state of the country The author has seen a Memoir of Mac Pherson of Cluny chief of that ancient clan from which it appears that he levied protection money to a very large amount which was willingly paid even by some of his most powerful neighbours A gentleman of this clan hearing a clergyman hold forth to his congregation on the crime of theft interrupted the preacher to assure him he might leave the enforcement of such doctrines to Cluny Mac Pherson whose broadsword would put a stop to theft sooner than all the sermons of all the ministers of the synod NOTE fourteen The Town guard of Edinburgh were till a late period armed with this weapon when on their police duty There was a hook at the back of the axe which the ancient Highlanders used to assist them to climb over walls fixing the hook upon it and raising themselves by the handle The axe which was also much used by the natives of Ireland is supposed to have been introduced into both countries from Scandinavia NOTE fifteen An adventure very similar to what is here stated actually befell the late mister Abercromby of Tullibody grandfather of the present Lord Abercromby and father of the celebrated Sir Ralph When this gentleman who lived to a very advanced period of life first settled in Stirlingshire his cattle were repeatedly driven off by the celebrated Rob Roy or some of his gang and at length he was obliged after obtaining a proper safe conduct to make the cateran such a visit as that of Waverley to Bean Lean in the text Rob received him with much courtesy and made many apologies for the accident which must have happened he said through some mistake mister Abercromby was regaled with collops from two of his own cattle which were hung up by the heels in the cavern and was dismissed in perfect safety after having agreed to pay in future a small sum of black mail in consideration of which Rob Roy not only undertook to forbear his herds in future but to replace any that should be stolen from him by other freebooters mister Abercromby said Rob Roy affected to consider him as a friend to the Jacobite interest and a sincere enemy to the Union Neither of these circumstances were true but the laird thought it quite unnecessary to undeceive his Highland host at the risk of bringing on a political dispute in such a situation This anecdote I received many years since about seventeen ninety two from the mouth of the venerable gentleman who was concerned in it NOTE sixteen This celebrated gibbet was in the memory of the last generation still standing at the western end of the town of Crieff in Perthshire Why it was called the kind gallows we are unable to inform the reader with certainty but it is alleged that the Highlanders used to touch their bonnets as they passed a place which had been fatal to many of their countrymen with the ejaculation God bless her nain sell and the Teil tamn you It may therefore have been called kind as being a sort of native or kindred place of doom to those who suffered there as in fulfilment of a natural destiny NOTE seventeen The story of the bridegroom carried off by caterans on his bridal day is taken from one which was told to the author by the late Laird of Mac Nab many years since To carry off persons from the Lowlands and to put them to ransom was a common practice with the wild Highlanders as it is said to be at the present day with the banditti in the south of Italy Upon the occasion alluded to a party of caterans carried off the bridegroom and secreted him in some cave near the mountain of Schiehallion The young man caught the small pox before his ransom could be agreed on and whether it was the fine cool air of the place or the want of medical attendance Mac Nab did not pretend to be positive but so it was that the prisoner recovered his ransom was paid and he was restored to his friends and bride but always considered the Highland robbers as having saved his life by their treatment of his malady NOTE eighteen This happened on many occasions Indeed it was not till after the total destruction of the clan influence after seventeen forty five that purchasers could be found who offered a fair price for the estates forfeited in seventeen fifteen which were then brought to sale by the creditors of the York Buildings Company who had purchased the whole or greater part from government at a very small price Even so late as the period first mentioned the prejudices of the public in favour of the heirs of the forfeited families threw various impediments in the way of intending purchasers of such property NOTE nineteen This sort of political game ascribed to Mac Ivor was in reality played by several Highland chiefs the celebrated Lord Lovat in particular who used that kind of finesse to the uttermost The Laird of Mac was also captain of an independent company but valued the sweets of present pay too well to incur the risk of losing them in the Jacobite cause His martial consort raised his clan and headed it in seventeen forty five But the chief himself would have nothing to do with king making declaring himself for that monarch and no other who gave the Laird of Mac half a guinea the day and half a guinea the morn NOTE twenty In explanation of the military exercise observed at the Castle of Glennaquoich the author begs to remark that the Highlanders were not only well practised in the use of the broadsword firelock and most of the manly sports and trials of strength common throughout Scotland but also used a peculiar sort of drill suited to their own dress and mode of warfare There were for instance different modes of disposing the plaid one when on a peaceful journey another when danger was apprehended one way of enveloping themselves in it when expecting undisturbed repose and another which enabled them to start up with sword and pistol in hand on the slightest alarm Previous to seventeen twenty or thereabouts the belted plaid was universally worn in which the portion which surrounded the middle of the wearer and that which was flung around his shoulders were all of the same piece of tartan In a desperate onset all was thrown away and the clan charged bare beneath the doublet save for an artificial arrangement of the shirt which like that of the Irish was always ample and for the sporran mollach or goat s skin purse The manner of handling the pistol and dirk was also part of the Highland manual exercise which the author has seen gone through by men who had learned it in their youth NOTE twenty one Pork or swine s flesh in any shape was till of late years much abominated by the Scotch nor is it yet a favourite food amongst them King Jamie carried this prejudice to England and is known to have abhorred pork almost as much as he did tobacco Ben Jonson has recorded this peculiarity where the gipsy in a masque examining the king s hand says You should by this line Love a horse and a hound but no part of a swine The Gipsies Metamorphosed James s own proposed banquet for the Devil was a loin of pork and a poll of ling with a pipe of tobacco for digestion NOTE twenty two In the number of persons of all ranks who assembled at the same table though by no means to discuss the same fare the Highland chiefs only retained a custom which had been formerly universally observed throughout Scotland I myself says the traveller Fynes Morrison in the end of Queen Elizabeth s reign the scene being the Lowlands of Scotland was at a knight s house who had many servants to attend him that brought in his meat with their heads covered with blue caps the table being more than half furnished with great platters of porridge each having a little piece of sodden meat And when the table was served the servants did sit down with us but the upper mess instead of porridge had a pullet with some prunes in the broth Travels p one hundred fifty five Till within this last century the farmers even of a respectable condition dined with their work people The difference betwixt those of high degree was ascertained by the place of the party above or below the salt or sometimes by a line drawn with chalk on the dining table Lord Lovat who knew well how to feed the vanity and restrain the appetites of his clansmen allowed each sturdy Fraser who had the slightest pretensions to be a Duinhewassel the full honour of the sitting but at the same time took care that his young kinsmen did not acquire at his table any taste for outlandish luxuries His lordship was always ready with some honourable apology why foreign wines and French brandy delicacies which he conceived might sap the hardy habits of his cousins should not circulate past an assigned point on the table NOTE twenty three In the Irish ballads relating to Fion the Fingal of Mac Pherson there occurs as in the primitive poetry of most nations a cycle of heroes each of whom has some distinguishing attribute upon these qualities and the adventures of those possessing them many proverbs are formed which are still current in the Highlands Among other characters Conan is distinguished as in some respects a kind of Thersites but brave and daring even to rashness He had made a vow that he would never take a blow without returning it and having like other heroes of antiquity descended to the infernal regions he received a cuff from the Arch fiend who presided there which he instantly returned using the expression in the text Sometimes the proverb is worded thus Claw for claw and the devil take the shortest nails as Conan said to the devil NOTE twenty four The description of the waterfall mentioned in this chapter is taken from that of Ledeard at the farm so called on the northern side of Lochard and near the head of the lake four or five miles from Aberfoyle It is upon a small scale but otherwise one of the most exquisite cascades it is possible to behold The appearance of Flora with the harp as described has been justly censured as too theatrical and affected for the lady like simplicity of her character But something may be allowed to her French education in which point and striking effect always make a considerable object NOTE twenty five The author has been sometimes accused of confounding fiction with reality He therefore thinks it necessary to state that the circumstance of the hunting described in the text as preparatory to the insurrection of seventeen forty five is so far as he knows entirely imaginary But it is well known such a great hunting was held in the Forest of Brae Mar under the auspices of the Earl of Mar as preparatory to the Rebellion of seventeen fifteen and most of the Highland chieftains who afterwards engaged in that civil commotion were present on this occasion GLOSSARY A all ABOON abune above ABY abye endure suffer ACCOLADE the salutation
