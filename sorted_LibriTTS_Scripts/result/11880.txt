uncertain Blast your Ronicky Doone he replied I got to have that hoss and if none of you ll take money for her rent I ll take her free and pay her rent when I come through this way tomorrow maybe S long While he spoke he had been undoing the cinches of his own horse Now he whipped the saddle and bridle off shouted to the hotel keeper brief instructions for the care of the weary animal and ran across the road with the saddle on his arm In the corral he had no difficulty with the mare She came straight to him in spite of all the flopping trappings With prickly ears and eyes lighted with kindly curiosity she looked the dusty fellow over He slipped the bridle over her head When he swung the saddle over her back she merely turned her head and carelessly watched it fall And when he drew up the cinches hard she only stamped in mock anger The moment he was in the saddle she tossed her head eagerly ready to be off He looked across the street to the veranda of the hotel as he passed through the gate of the corral The men were standing in a long and awe stricken line their eyes wide their mouths agape Whoever Ronicky Doone might be he was certainly a man who had won the respect of this town The men on the veranda looked at Bill Gregg as though he were already a ghost He waved his hand defiantly at them and the mare at a word from him sprang into a long striding gallop that whirled them rapidly down the street and out of the village The bay mare carried him with amazing speed over the ground They rounded the base of the big mountain and glancing up at the ragged canyons which chopped the face of the peak he was glad that he had not attempted that short cut If Ronicky Doone could make that trail he was a skillful horseman Bill Gregg swung up over the left shoulder of the mountain and found himself looking down on the wide plain which held Stillwater The air was crystal clear and dry the shoulder of the mountain was high above it Gregg saw a breathless stretch of the cattle country at one sweep of his eyes Stillwater was still a long way off and far away across the plain he saw a tiny moving dot that grew slowly It was the train heading for Stillwater and that train he must beat to the station For a moment his heart stood still then he saw that the train was distant indeed and by the slightest use of the mare s speed he would be able to reach the town two or three minutes ahead of it But just as he was beginning to exult in the victory after all the hard riding of the past three days the mare tossed up her head and shortened her stride The heart of Gregg stopped and he went cold It was not only the fear that his journey might be ruined but the fear that something had happened to this magnificent creature beneath him He swung to the side in the saddle and watched her gallop Certain she went laboring very much as though she were trying to run against a mighty pull on the reins He looked at her head It was thrown high with pricking ears Perhaps she was frightened by some foolish thing near the road He touched her with the spurs and she increased her pace to the old length and ease of stride but just as he had begun to be reassured her step shortened and fell to laboring again and this time she threw her head higher than before It was amazing to Bill Gregg and then it seemed to him that he heard a faint far whistling floating down from high above his head Again that thin long drawn sound and this time glancing over his right shoulder he saw a horseman plunging down the slope of the mountain He knew instantly that it was Ronicky Doone The man had come to recapture his horse and had taken the short cut across the mountain to come up with her Just by a fraction of a minute Doone would be too late for by the time he came down onto the trail the bay would be well ahead and certainly no horse lived in those mountains capable of overtaking her when she felt like running Gregg touched her again with the spurs but this time she reared straight up and whirling to the side faced steadily toward her onrushing master Chapter Two Friendly Enemies Again and again Gregg spurred the bay cruelly She winced from the pain and snorted but apparently having not the slightest knowledge of bucking she could only shake her head and send a ringing whinny of appeal up the slope of the mountain toward the approaching rider In spite of the approaching danger in spite of this delay which was ruining his chances of getting to Stillwater before the train Bill Gregg watched in marvel and delight the horsemanship of the stranger Ronicky Doone if this were he was certainly the prince of all wild riders Even as the mare stopped in answer to the signal of her owner Ronicky Doone sent his mount over the edge of a veritable cliff flung him back on his haunches and slid down the gravelly slope careening from side to side With a rush of pebbles about him and a dust cloud whirling after Ronicky Doone broke out into the road ahead of the mare and she whinnied softly again to greet him Bill Gregg found himself looking not into the savage face of such a gunfighter as he had been led to expect but a handsome fellow several years younger than he a high headed straight eyed buoyant type In his seat in the saddle in the poise of his head and the play of his hand on the reins Bill Gregg recognized a boundless nervous force There was nothing ponderous about Ronicky Doone Indeed he was not more than middle size but as he reined his horse in the middle of the road and looked with flashing eyes at Bill Gregg he appeared very large indeed Gregg was used to fighting or paying his way or doing both at the same time as occasion offered He decided that this was certainly an occasion for much money and few words You re Doone I guess he said and you know that I ve played a pretty bad trick on you taking your hoss this way But I wanted to pay for it Doone and I ll pay now I ve got to get to Stillwater before that train Look at her I haven t hurt her any Her wind isn t touched She s pretty wet but sweat never hurt nothing on four feet eh I dunno returned Ronicky Doone I d as soon run off with a man s wife as his hoss Partner said Bill Gregg desperately I have to get there Then get there on your own feet not the feet of another gent s hoss Gregg controlled his rising anger Beyond him the train was looming larger and larger in the plain and Stillwater seemed more and more distant He writhed in the saddle I tell you I ll pay I ll pay the whole value of the hoss if you want He was about to say more when he saw the eyes of Ronicky Doone widen and fix Look said the other suddenly you ve been cutting her up with the spurs Gregg glanced down to the flank of the bay to discover that he had used the spurs more recklessly than he thought A sharp rowel had picked through the skin and though it was probably only a slight wound indeed it had brought a smear of red to the surface Ronicky Doone trembled with anger Confound you he said furiously Any fool would have known that you didn t need a spur on that hoss What part d you come from where they teach you to kill a hoss when you ride it Can you tell me that I ll tell you after I get to Stillwater I ll see you hung before I see you in Stillwater You ve talked too much Doone Gregg said huskily I ve just begun said Doone Then take this and shut up exclaimed Bill Gregg Ordinarily he was the straightest and the squarest man in the world in a fight But a sudden anger had flared up in him He had an impulse to kill to get rid of this obstacle between him and everything he wanted most in life Without more warning than that he snatched out his revolver and fired point blank at Ronicky Doone Certainly all the approaches to a fight had been made and Doone might have been expecting the attack At any rate as the gun shot out of Gregg s holster the other swung himself sidewise in his own saddle and snapping out his revolver fired from the hip That swerve to the side saved him doubtless from the shot of Gregg his own bullet plowed cleanly through the thigh of the other rider The whole leg of Gregg went numb and he found himself slumping helplessly to one side He dropped his gun and he had to cling with both hands to lower himself out of the saddle Now he sat in the dust of the trail and stared stupidly not at his conqueror but at the train that was flashing into the little town of Stillwater just below them He hardly heeded Ronicky Doone as the latter started forward with an oath knelt beside him and examined the wound It s clean Doone said as he started ripping up his undershirt to make bandages I ll have you fixed so you can be gotten into Stillwater He began to work rapidly twisting the clothes around Gregg s thigh which he had first laid bare by some dexterous use of a hunting knife Then Gregg turned his eyes to those of Doone The train had pulled out of Stillwater The sound of the coughing of the engine as it started up came faintly to them after a moment Of all the darned fools said the two men in one voice And then they grinned at each other Certainly it was not the first fight or the first wound for either of them I m sorry they began again speaking together in chorus Matter of fact said Ronicky Doone that bay means a pile to me When I seen the red on her side Can t be more than a chance prick I know said Ronicky but I didn t stop to think And I should of give you fair warning before I went for the gat Look here said Ronicky you talk like a straight sort of a gent to me And you thought I was a cross between a hoss thief and a gunfighter I dunno what I thought except that I wanted the mare back Stranger I m no end sorry this has happened Maybe you d lemme know why you was in such a hurry to get to Stillwater If they s any trouble coming down the road behind you maybe I can help take care of it for you And he smiled coldly and significantly at Bill Gregg The latter eyed with some wonder the man who had just shot him down and was now offering to fight for his safety Nothing like that said Bill I was going to Stillwater to meet a girl As much of a rush as all that to see a girl On that train Ronicky Doone whistled softly And I messed it up But why didn t you tell me what you wanted I didn t have a chance Besides I could not waste time in talking and explaining to everybody along the road Sure you couldn t but the girl ll forgive you when she finds out what happened No she won t because she ll never find out Eh I don t know where she is Riding all that way just to see a girl It s a long story partner and this leg is beginning to act up Tell you the best thing would be for you to jump on your mare and jog into Stillwater for a buckboard and then come back and get me What d you say Twenty minutes after Ronicky Doone had swung into the saddle and raced down the road the buckboard arrived and the wounded man was helped on to a pile of blankets in the body of the wagon The shooting of course was explained by the inevitable gun accident Ronicky Doone happened to be passing along that way and saw Bill Gregg looking over his revolver as he rode along At that moment the gun exploded and The two men who had come out in the buckboard listened to the tale with expressionless faces As a matter of fact they had already heard in Stillwater that no less a person than Ronicky Doone was on his way toward that village in pursuit of a man who had ridden off on the famous bay mare Lou But they accepted Ronicky s bland version of the accident with perfect calm and with many expressions of sympathy They would have other things to say after they had deposited the wounded man in Stillwater The trip in was a painful one for Bill Gregg For one thing the exhaustion of the long three days trip was now causing a wave of weariness to sweep over him The numbness which had come through the leg immediately after the shooting was now replaced by a steady and continued aching And more than all he was unnerved by the sense of utter failure utter loss Never in his life had he fought so bitterly and steadily for a thing and yet he had lost at the very verge of success Chapter Three At Stillwater The true story was of course known almost at once but since Ronicky Doone swore that he would tackle the first man who accused him of having shot down Bill Gregg the talk was confined to whispers In the meantime Stillwater rejoiced in its possession of Ronicky Doone Beyond one limited section of the mountain desert he was not as yet known but he had one of those personalities which are called electric Whatever he did seemed greater because he Ronicky Doone had done it Not that he had done a great many things as yet But there was a peculiar feeling in the air that Ronicky Doone was capable of great and strange performances Men older than he were willing to accept him as their leader men younger than he idolized him Ronicky Doone then the admired of all beholders is leaning in the doorway of Stillwater s second and best hotel His bandanna today is a terrific yellow set off with crimson half moon and stars strewn liberally on it His shirt is merely white but it is given some significance by having nearly half of a red silk handkerchief falling out of the breast pocket His sombrero is one of those works of art which Mexican families pass from father to son only his was new and had not yet received that limp effect of age And like the gaudiest Mexican head piece the band of this sombrero was of purest gold beaten into the forms of various saints Ronicky Doone knew nothing at all about saints but he approved very much of the animation of the martyrdom scenes and felt reasonably sure that his hatband could not be improved upon in the entire length and breadth of Stillwater and the young men of the town agreed with him to say nothing of the girls They also admired his riding gloves which a strange affectation in a country of buckskin were always the softest and the smoothest and the most comfortable kid that could be obtained Truth to tell he did not handle a rope He could not tell the noose end of a lariat from the straight end hardly Neither did Ronicky Doone know the slightest thing about barbed wire except how to cut it when he wished to ride through Let us look closely at the hands themselves as Ronicky stands in the door of the hotel and stares at the people walking by For he has taken off his gloves and he now rolls a cigarette They are very long hands The fingers are extremely slender and tapering The wrists are round and almost as innocent of sinews as the wrists of a woman save when he grips something and then how they stand out But most remarkable of all the skin of the palms of those hands is amazingly soft It is truly as soft as the skin of the hand of a girl There were some who shook their heads when they saw those hands There were some who inferred that Ronicky Doone was little better than a scapegrace and that in reality he had never done a better or more useful thing than handle cards and swing a revolver In both of which arts it was admitted that he was incredibly dexterous As a matter of fact since there was no estate from which he drew an income and since he had never been known in the entire history of his young life to do a single stroke of productive work of any kind the bitter truth was that Ronicky Doone was no better and no worse than a common gambler Indeed if to play a game of chance is to commit a sin Ronicky Doone was a very great sinner Yet it should be remarked that he lacked the fine art of taking the money of other less clever fellows when they were intoxicated and he also lacked the fine hardness of mind which enables many gamblers to enjoy taking the last cent from an opponent Also though he knew the entire list of tricks in the repertoire of a crooked gambler he had never been known to employ tricking He trusted in a calm head a quick judgment an ability to read character And though he occasionally met with crooked professionals who were wolves in the guise of sheep no one had ever been known to play more than one crooked trick at cards when playing against Ronicky Doone So on the whole he made a very good living What he had he gave or threw away in wild spending or loaned to friends of whom he had a vast number All of which goes to explain the soft hands of Ronicky Doone and his nervous swift moving fingers as he stood at the door of the hotel For he who plays long with cards or dice begins to have a special sense developed in the tips of his fingers so that they seem to be independent intelligences He crossed his feet His boots were the finest leather bench made by the best of bootmakers and they fitted the high arched instep with the elastic smoothness of gloves The man of the mountain desert dresses the extremities and cares not at all for the mid sections The moment Doone was off his horse those boots had to be dressed and rubbed and polished to softness and brightness before this luxurious gambler would walk about town From the heels of the boots extended a long pair of spurs surely a very great vanity for never in her life had his beautiful mare Lou needed even the touch of a spur But Ronicky Doone could not give up this touch of luxury The spurs were plated heavily with gold and they swept up and out in a long exquisite curve the hub of the rowel set with diamonds In a word Ronicky Doone was a dandy but he had this peculiarity that he seemed to dress to please himself rather than the rest of the world His glances never roved about taking account of the admiration of others As he leaned there in the door of the hotel he was the type of the young happy genuine and carefree fellow whose mind is no heavier with a thousand dollars or a thousand cents in his pocket Suddenly he started from his lounging place caught his hat more firmly over his eyes threw away his unlighted cigarette and hurried across the veranda of the hotel Had he seen an enemy to chastise or an old friend to greet or a pretty girl No it was only old Jud Harding the blacksmith whose hand had lost its strength but who still worked iron as others mold putty simply because he had the genius for his craft He was staggering now under a load of boards which he had shouldered to carry to his shop In a moment that load was shifted to the shoulder of Ronicky Doone and they went on down the street laughing and talking together until the load was dropped on the floor of Harding s shop And how s the sick feller coming asked Harding Coming fine answered Ronicky Couple of days and I ll have him out for a little exercise Lucky thing it was a clean wound and didn t nick the bone Soon as it s healed over he ll never know he was plugged Harding considered his young friend with twinkling eyes Queer thing to me he said is how you and this gent Gregg have hit it off so well together Might almost say it was like you d shot Gregg and now was trying to make up for it But of course that ain t the truth Of course not said Ronicky gravely and met the eye of Harding without faltering Another queer thing went on the cunning old smith He was fooling with that gun while he was in the saddle which just means that the muzzle must of been pretty close to his skin But there wasn t any sign of a powder burn the doc says But his trousers was pretty bad burned I guess said Ronicky H m said the blacksmith that s the first time I ve heard about it He went on more seriously I got something to tell you Ronicky Ever hear the story about the gent that took pity on the snake that was stiff with cold and brought the snake in to warm him up beside the fire The minute the snake come to life he sunk his fangs in the gent that had saved him Meaning said Ronicky that because I ve done a good turn for Gregg I d better look out for him Meaning nothing said Harding except that the reason the snake bit the gent was because he d had a stone heaved at him by the same man one day and hadn t forgot it But Ronicky Doone merely laughed and turned back toward the hotel Chapter Four His Victim s Trouble Yet he could not help pondering on the words of old Harding Bill Gregg had been a strange patient He had never repeated his first offer to tell his story He remained sullen and silent with his brooding eyes fixed on the blank wall before him and nothing could permanently cheer him Some inward gloom seemed to possess the man The first day after the shooting he had insisted on scrawling a painfully written letter while Ronicky propped a writing board in front of him as he lay flat on his back in the bed but that was his only act Thereafter he remained silent and brooding Perhaps it was hatred for Ronicky that was growing in him as the sense of disappointment increased for Ronicky after all had kept him from reaching that girl when the train passed through Stillwater Perhaps for all Ronicky knew his bullet had ruined the happiness of two lives He shrugged that disagreeable thought away and reaching the hotel he went straight up to the room of the sick man Bill he said gently have you been spending all your time hating me Is that what keeps you thin and glum Is it because you sit here all day blaming me for all the things that have happened to you The dark flush and the uneasy flicker of Gregg s glance gave a sufficient answer Ronicky Doone sighed and shook his head but not in anger You don t have to talk he said I see that I m right And I don t blame you Bill because maybe I ve spoiled things pretty generally for you At first the silence of Bill Gregg admitted that he felt the same way about the matter yet he finally said aloud I don t blame you Maybe you thought I was a hoss thief But the thing is done Ronicky and it won t never be undone Gregg said Ronicky d you know what you re going to do now I dunno You re going to sit there and roll a cigarette and tell me the whole yarn You ain t through with this little chase Not if I have to drag you along with me But first just figure that I m your older brother or something like that and get rid of the whole yarn Got to have the ore specimens before you can assay em Besides it ll help you a pile to get the poison out of your system If you feel like cussing me hearty when the time comes go ahead and cuss but I got to hear that story Maybe it would help said Gregg but it s a fool story to tell Leave that to me to say whether it s a fool story or not You start the talking Gregg shifted himself to a more comfortable position as is the immemorial custom of story tellers and his glance misted a little with the flood of recollections Started along back about a year ago he said I was up to the Sullivan Mountains working a claim There wasn t much to it just enough to keep me going sort of comfortable I pegged away at it pretty steady leading a lonely life and hoping every day that I d cut my way down to a good lead Well the fine ore never showed up Meantime I got pretty weary of them same mountains staring me in the face all the time I didn t have even a dog with me for conversation so I got to thinking Thinking is a bad thing mostly don t you agree Ronicky It sure is replied Ronicky Doone instantly Not a bit of a doubt about it It starts you doubting things went on Gregg bitterly and pretty soon you re even doubting yourself Here he cast an envious glance at the smooth brow of his companion But I guess that never happened to you Ronicky You d be surprised if I told you said Ronicky Well went on Bill Gregg I got so darned tired of my own thoughts and of myself that I decided something had ought to be done something to give me new things to think about So I sat down and went over the whole deal I had to get new ideas Then I thought of what a gent had told me once He d got pretty interested in mining and figured he wanted to know all about how the fancy things was done So he sent off to some correspondence schools Well they re a great bunch They say Write us a lot of letters and ask us your questions Before you re through you ll know something you want to know See I see I didn t have anything special I wanted to learn except how to use myself for company when I got tired of solitaire So I sat down and wrote to this here correspondence school and says I want to do something interesting How d you figure that I had better begin And what d you think they answered back I dunno said Ronicky his interest steadily increasing Well sir the first thing they wrote back was We have your letter and think that in the first place you had better learn how to write That was a queer answer wasn t it It sure was Ronicky swallowed a smile Every time I looked at that letter it sure made me plumb mad And I looked at it a hundred times a day and come near tearing it up every time But I didn t continued Bill Why not Because it was a woman that wrote it I told by the hand after a while A woman Go on Bill This story sure sounds different from most It ain t even started to get different yet said Bill gloomily Well that letter made me so plumb mad that I sat down and wrote everything I could think of that a gent would say to a girl to let her know what I thought about her And what d you think happened She wrote you back the prettiest letter you ever seen suggested Ronicky saying as how she d never meant to make you mad and that if you Say broke in Bill Gregg did I show that letter to you Nope I just was guessing at what a lot of women would do You see No I don t I could never figure them as close as that Anyway that s the thing she done right enough She writes me a letter that was smooth as oil and suggests that I go on with a composition course to learn how to write Going to have you do books Bill I ain t a plumb fool Ronicky But I thought it wouldn t do me no harm to unlimber my pen and fire out a few words a day So I done it I started writing what they told me to write about the things that was around me with a lot of lessons about how you can t use the same word twice on one page and how terrible bad it is to use too many passive verbs What s a passive verb Bill I didn t never figure it out exactly However it seems like they re something that slows you up the way a muddy road slows up a hoss And then she begun talking about the mountains and then she begun asking About you suggested Ronicky with a grin Confound you said Bill Gregg How come you guessed that I dunno I just sort of scented what was coming Well anyways that s what she done And pretty soon she sent me a snapshot of herself Well Lemme see it said Ronicky Doone calmly I dunno just where it is maybe replied Bill Gregg Ill tell you It s right around your neck in that nugget locket you wear there For a moment Bill Gregg hated the other with his eyes and then he submitted with a sheepish grin took off the locket which was made of one big nugget rudely beaten into shape and opened it for the benefit of Ronicky Doone It showed the latter not a beautiful face but a pretty one with a touch of honesty and pride that made her charming Well as soon as I got that picture said Bill Gregg as he took back the locket I sure got excited Looked to me like that girl was made for me A lot finer than I could ever be you see but simple no fancy frills no raving beauty maybe but darned easy to look at First thing I done I went in and got a copy of my face made and rushed it right back at her and then He stopped dolefully What d you think Ronicky I dunno said Ronicky what happened then Nothing not a thing Not a word came back from her to answer that letter I d sent along Maybe you didn t look rich enough to suit her Bill I thought that and I thought it was my ugly face that might of made her change her mind I thought of pretty near everything else that was bad about me and that she might of read in my face Sure made me sick for a long time Somebody else was correcting my lessons and that made me sicker than ever So I sat down and wrote a letter to the head of the school and told him I d like to get the address of that first girl You see I didn t even know her name But I didn t get no answer Ronicky groaned It don t look like the best detective in the world could help you to find a girl when you don t know her name He added gently But maybe she don t want you to find her I thought that for a long time Then a while back I got a letter from San Francisco saying that she was coming on a train through these parts and could I be in Stillwater because the train stopped there a couple of minutes Most like she thought Stillwater was just sort of across the street from me Matter of fact I jumped on a hoss and it took me three days of breaking my neck to get near Stillwater and then He stopped and cast a gloomy look on his companion I know said Ronicky Then I come and spoiled the whole party Sure makes me sick to think about it And now she s plumb gone muttered Bill Gregg I thought maybe the reason I didn t have her correcting my lessons any more was because she d had to leave the schools and go West So right after I got this drilling through the leg you remember I wrote a letter Sure It was to her at the schools but I didn t get no answer I guess she didn t go back there after all She s plumb gone Ronicky The other was silent for a moment How much would you give to find her he asked suddenly Half my life said Bill Gregg solemnly Then said Ronicky we ll make a try at it I got an idea how we can start on the trail I m going to go with you partner I ve messed up considerable this little game of yours now I m going to do what I can to straighten it out Sometimes two are better than one Anyway I m going to stick with you till you ve found her or lost her for good You see Bill Gregg sighed You re pretty straight Ronicky he said but what good does it do for two gents to look for a needle in a haystack How could we start to hit the trail This way We know the train that she took Maybe we could find the Pullman conductor that was on it and he might remember her They got good memories some of those gents We ll start to find him which had ought to be pretty easy Ronicky I d never of thought of that in a million years It ain t thinking that we want now it s acting When can you start with me I ll be fit tomorrow Then tomorrow we start Chapter Five Macklin s Library Robert Macklin Pullman conductor had risen to that eminent position so early in life that the glamour of it had not yet passed away He was large enough to have passed for a champion wrestler or a burly pugilist and he was small enough to glory in the smallest details of his work Having at the age of thirty through a great deal of luck and a touch of accident secured his place he possessed at least sufficient dignity to fill it He was one of those rare men who carry their dignity with them past the doors of their homes Robert Macklin s home during the short intervals when he was off the trains was in a tiny apartment It was really one not overly large room with a little alcove adjoining but Robert Macklin had seized the opportunity to hang a curtain across the alcove and since it was large enough to contain a chair and a bookshelf he referred to it always as his library He was this morning seated in his library with his feet protruding through the curtains and resting on the foot of his bed when the doorbell rang He surveyed himself in his mirror before he answered it Having decided that in his long dressing gown he was imposing enough he advanced to the door and slowly opened it He saw before him two sun darkened men whose soft gray hats proclaimed that they were newly come out of the West The one was a fellow whose face had been made stern by hard work and few pleasures in life The other was one who apparently had never worked at all There was something about him that impressed Robert Macklin He might be a young Western millionaire for instance Aside from his hat he was dressed with elaborate care He wore gray spats and his clothes were obviously well tailored and his necktie was done in a bow On the whole he was a very cool comfortable looking chap The handkerchief which protruded from his breast pocket and showed an edging of red was a trifle noisy and the soft gray hat was hardly in keeping but on the whole he was a dashing looking chap The bagging trousers and the blunt toed shoes of his companion were to Robert Macklin a distinct shock He centered all of his attention instantly on the younger of his two visitors You re mister Macklin I guess said the handsome man I am said Macklin and stepping back from his door he invited them in with a sweeping gesture There were only two chairs but the younger of the strangers immediately made himself comfortable on the bed My name s Doone he said and this is mister William Gregg We think that you have some information which we can use Mind if we fire a few questions Certainly not said Robert Macklin At the same time he began to arm himself with caution One could never tell Matter of fact went on Ronicky smoothly lighting a tailor made cigarette while his companion rolled one of his own making we are looking for a lady who was on one of your trains We think you may possibly remember her Here s the picture And as he passed the snapshot to the Pullman conductor he went on with the details of the date and the number of the train Robert Macklin in the meantime studied the picture carefully He had a keen eye for faces but when it came to pretty faces his memory was a veritable lion He had talked a few moments with this very girl and she had smiled at him The memory made Robert Macklin s lips twitch just a trifle and Ronicky Doone saw it Presently the dignitary returned the picture and raised his head from thought It is vaguely behind my mind something about this lady he said But I m sorry to say gentlemen I really don t know you

none	none	don t you know us broke in Bill Gregg Ain t my partner here just introduced us Exactly said Robert Macklin And his opinion of the two sank a full hundred points Such grammar proclaimed a ruffian You don t get his drift Ronicky was explaining to his companion I introduced us but he doesn t know who I am We should have brought along a letter of introduction He turned to Macklin I am mighty sorry I didn t get one he said It came to Macklin for the fraction of a second that he was being mocked but he instantly dismissed the foolish thought Even the rough fellows must be able to recognize a man when they saw one The point is went on Ronicky gently that my friend is very eager for important reasons to see this lady to find her And he doesn t even know her name Here his careful grammar gave out with a crash You can t beat a deal like that eh Macklin If you can remember anything about her her name first then where she was bound who was with her how tall she is the color of her eyes we d be glad to know anything you know What can you do for us Macklin cleared his throat thoughtfully Gentlemen he said gravely if I knew the purpose for which you are seeking the lady I The purpose ain t to kidnap her if that s your drift said Ronicky We ain t going to treat her wrong partner Out in our part of the land they don t do it Just shake up your thoughts and see if something about that girl doesn t pop right into your head Robert Macklin smiled and carefully shook his head It seems to be impossible for me to remember a thing he asserted Not even the color of her eyes asked Ronicky as he grinned He went on more gravely I m pretty dead sure that you do remember something about her There was just the shade of a threat in the voice of this slender youngster and Robert Macklin had been an amateur pugilist of much brawn and a good deal of boxing skill He cast a wary eye on Ronicky one punch would settle that fellow The man Gregg might be a harder nut to crack but it would not take long to finish them both Robert Macklin thrust his shoulders forward Friends he said gruffly I don t have much time off This is my day for rest I have to say good by Ronicky Doone stood up with a yawn I thought so he said to his companion Mind the door Gregg and see that nobody steps in and busts up my little party What are you going to do Going to argue with this gent in a way he ll understand a pile better than the chatter we ve been making so far He stepped a long light pace forward Macklin you know what we want to find out Will you talk A cloud of red gathered before the eyes of Macklin It was impossible that he must believe his ears and yet the words still rang there Why curse your little rat face burst out Robert Macklin and stepping in he leaned forward with a perfect straight left Certainly his long vacation from boxing had not ruined his eye or stiffened his muscles With delight he felt all the big sinews about his shoulders come into play Straight and true the big fist drove into the face of the smaller man but Robert Macklin found that he had punched a hole in thin air It was as if the very wind of the blow had brushed the head of Ronicky Doone to one side and at the same time he seemed to sway and stagger forward A hard lean fist struck Robert Macklin s body As he gasped and doubled up clubbing his right fist to land the blow behind the ear of Ronicky Doone the latter bent back stepped in and rising on the toes of both feet whipped a perfect uppercut that in ring parlance rang the bell The result was that Robert Macklin his mouth agape and his eyes dull stood wobbling slowly from side to side Here called Ronicky to his companion at the door Grab him on one side and I ll take the other He s out on his feet Get him to that chair With Gregg s assistance he dragged the bulk of the man there Macklin was still stunned Presently the dull eyes cleared and filled immediately with horror Big Robert Macklin sank limply back in the chair I ve no money he said I swear I haven t a cent in the place It s in the bank but if a check will We don t want your money this trip said Ronicky We want talk Macklin A lot of talk and a lot of true talk Understand It s about that girl I saw you grin when you saw the picture you remember her well enough Now start talking and remember this if you lie I ll come back here and find out and use this on you The eyes of Robert Macklin started from his head as his gaze concentrated on the black muzzle of the gun He moistened his white lips and managed to gasp Everything I know of course Ill tell you everything word for word She she her name I mean You re doing fine said Ronicky Keep it up and you keep away Bill When you come at him with that hungry look he thinks you re going to eat him up Fire away Macklin What first What s she look like Soft brown hair blue eyes her mouth Is a little big That s all right You don t have to be polite and lie We want the truth How big is she About five feet and five inches must weigh around a hundred and thirty pounds You sure are an expert on the ladies Macklin and I ll bet you didn t miss her name Her name Don t tell me you missed out on that No It was Just a minute Take your time Caroline Take your time now Macklin you re doing fine Don t get confused Get the last name right It s the most important to us I have it I m sure The whole name is Caroline Smith There was a groan from Ronicky Doone and another from Bill Gregg That s a fine name to use for trailing a person Did she say anything more anything about where she expected to be living in New York I don t remember any more said Macklin sullenly for the spot where Ronicky s fist landed on his jaw was beginning to ache I didn t sit down and have any chats with her She just spoke to me once in a while when I did something for her I suppose you fellows have some crooked work on hand for her We re bringing her good news said Ronicky calmly Now see if you can t remember where she said she lived in New York And he gave added point to his question by pressing the muzzle of the revolver a little closer to the throat of the Pullman conductor The latter blinked and swallowed hard The only thing I remember her saying was that she could see the East River from her window I think And that s all you know
1867_154075_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes 
none	none	not a thing more about her to save my life Maybe what you know has saved it said Ronicky darkly His victim eyed him with sullen malevolence Maybe there ll be a new trick or two in this game before it s finished I ll never forget you Doone and you Gregg You haven t a thing in the world on us replied Ronicky I have the fact that you carry concealed weapons Only this time Always Fellows like you are as lonesome without a gun as they are without a skin Ronicky turned at the door and laughed back at the gloomy face and then they were gone down the steps and into the street Chapter Six The New York Trail On the train to New York that night they carefully summed up their prospects and what they had gained We started at pretty near nothing said Ronicky He was a professional optimist We had a picture of a girl and we knew she was on a certain train bound East three or four weeks ago That s all we knew Now we know her name is Caroline Smith and that she lives where she can see the East River out of her back window I guess that narrows it down pretty close doesn t it Bill Close asked Bill Close did you say Well we know the trail said Ronicky cheerily All we ve got to do is to locate the shack that stands beside that trail For old mountain men like us that ought to be nothing What sort of a stream is this East River though Bill Gregg looked at his companion in disgust He had become so used to regarding Doone as entirely infallible that it amazed and disheartened him to find that there was one topic so large about which Ronicky knew nothing Perhaps the whole base for the good cheer of Ronicky was his ignorance of everything except the mountain desert A river s a river went on Ronicky blandly And it s got a town beside it and in the town there s a house that looks over the water Why Bill she s as good as found New York runs about a dozen miles along the shore of that river groaned Bill Gregg A dozen miles gasped Ronicky He turned in his seat and stared at his companion Bill you sure are making a man sized joke There ain t that much city in the world A dozen miles of houses one right next to the other Yep and one on top of the other And that ain t all Start about the center of that town and swing a twenty mile line around it and the end of the line will be passing through houses most of the way Ronicky Doone glared at him in positive alarm Well he said that s different It sure is I guess we ve come on a wild goose chase Ronicky hunting for a girl named Smith that lives on the bank of the East River He laughed bitterly How come you know so much about New York asked Ronicky eager to turn the subject of conversation until he could think of something to cheer his friend Books said Bill Gregg After that there was a long lull in the conversation That night neither of them slept long for every rattle and sway of the train was telling them that they were rocking along toward an impossible task Even the cheer of Ronicky had broken down the next morning and though breakfast in the diner restored some of his confidence he was not the man of the day before Bill he confided on the way back to their seats from the diner there must be something wrong with me What is it I dunno said Bill Why People been looking at me Ain t they got a right to do that Sure they have in a way But when they don t seem to see you when you see them and when they begin looking at you out of the corner of their eyes the minute you turn away why then it seems to me that they re laughing at you Bill What they got to laugh about I d punch a gent in the face that laughed at me But Ronicky fell into a philosophical brooding It can t be done Bill You can punch a gent for cussing you or stepping on your foot or crowding you or sneering at you or talking behind your back or for a thousand things But back here in a crowd you can t fight a gent for laughing at you Laughing is outside the law most anywheres Bill It s the one thing you can t answer back except with more laughing Even a dog gets sort of sick inside when you laugh at him and a man is a pile worse He wants to kill the gent that s laughing and he wants to kill himself for being laughed at Well Bill that s a good deal stronger than the way they been laughing at me but they done enough to make me think a bit They been looking at three things these here spats the red rim of my handkerchief sticking out of my pocket and that soft gray hat when I got it on Derned if I see anything wrong with your outfit Didn t they tell you that that was the style back East to have spats like that on Sure said Ronicky but maybe they didn t know or maybe they go with some but not with me Maybe I m kind of too brown and outdoors looking to fit with spats and handkerchiefs like this Ronicky said Bill Gregg in admiration maybe you ain t read a pile but you figure things out just like a book Their conversation was cut short by the appearance of a drift of houses and then more and more From the elevated line on which they ran presently they could look down on block after block of roofs packed close together or big business structures as they reached the uptown business sections and finally Ronicky gasped as they plunged into utter darkness that roared past the window We go underground to the station Bill Gregg explained He was a little startled himself but his reading had fortified him to a certain extent But is there still some more of New York asked Ronicky humbly More We ain t seen a corner of it Bill s superior information made him swell like a frog in the sun This is kinder near One Hundredth Street where we dived down New York keeps right on to First Street and then it has a lot more streets below that But that s just the Island of Manhattan All around there s a lot more Manhattan is mostly where they work They live other places It was not very long before the train slowed down to make Grand Central Station On the long platform Ronicky surrendered his suit case to the first porter Bill Gregg was much alarmed What d you do that for he asked securing a stronger hold on his own valise and brushing aside two or three red caps He asked me for it explained Ronicky I wasn t none too set on giving it to him to carry but I hated to hurt his feelings Besides they re all done up in uniforms Maybe this is their job But suppose that feller got away out of sight what would you do Your brand new pair of Colts is lying away in it He won t get out of sight none Ronicky assured his friend grimly I got another Colt with me and no matter how fast he runs a forty five slug can run a pile faster But come on Bill The word in this town seems to be to keep right on moving They passed under an immense brightly lighted vault and then wriggled through the crowds in pursuit of the astonishingly agile porter So they came out of the big station to Forty second Street where they found themselves confronted by a taxi driver and the question Where I dunno said Ronicky to Bill Your reading tell you anything about the hotels in this here town Not a thing said Bill because I never figured that I d be fool enough to come this far away from my home diggings But here I am and we don t know nothing Listen partner said Ronicky to the driver Where s a fair to medium place to stop at The taxi driver swallowed a smile that left a twinkle about his eyes which nothing could remove What kind of a place Anywhere from fifty cents to fifty bucks a night Fifty dollars exclaimed Bill Gregg Can you lay over that Ronicky Our wad won t last a week Say pal said the taxi driver becoming suddenly friendly I can fix you up I know a neat little joint where you ll be as snug as you want They ll stick you about one fifty per but you can t beat that price in this town and keep clean Take us there said Bill Gregg and they climbed into the machine The taxi turned around shot down Park Avenue darted aside into the darker streets to the east of the district and came suddenly to a halt Did you foller that trail asked Bill Gregg in a chuckling whisper Sure Twice to the left then to the right and then to the left again I know the number of blocks too Ain t no reason for getting rattled just because a joint is strange to us New York may be tolerable big but it s got men in it just like we are and maybe a lot worse kinds As they got out of the little car they saw that the taxi driver had preceded them carrying their suit cases They followed up a steep pitch of stairs to the first floor of the hotel where the landing had been widened to form a little office Hello Bert said their driver I picked up these gentlemen at Grand Central They ain t wise to the town so I put em next to you Fix em up here Sure said Bert lifting a huge bulk of manhood from behind the desk He placed his fat hands on the top of it and observed his guests with a smile Ill make you right to home here friends Thank you Joe Joe grinned nodded and receiving his money from Bill Gregg departed down the stairs humming Their host in the meantime had picked up their suit cases and led the way down a hall dimly lighted by two flickering gas jets Finally he reached a door and led them into a room where the gas had to be lighted It showed them a cheerless apartment in spite of the red of wall paper and carpet Only three bucks said the proprietor with the air of one bestowing charity out of the fullness of his heart Bathroom only two doors down I guess you can t beat this layout gents Bill Gregg glanced once about him and nodded You come up from the South maybe asked the proprietor lingering at the door West said Bill Gregg curtly You don t say Then you boys must be used to your toddy at night eh It s a tolerable dry country out there said Ronicky without enthusiasm All the more reason you need some liquor to moisten it up Wait till I get you a bottle of rye I got handy And he disappeared in spite of their protests I ain t a drinking man said Gregg and I know you ain t but it s sure insulting to turn down a drink in these days Ronicky nodded and presently the host returned with two glasses rattling against a tall bottle on a tray Say when he said filling the glasses and keeping on in spite of their protests until each glass was full I guess it looks pretty good to you to see the stuff again he said stepping back and rubbing his hands like one warmed by the consciousness of a good deed It ain t very plentiful around here Well said Gregg swinging up his glass here s in your eye Ronicky and here s to you sir Wait replied Ronicky Doone Hold on a minute Bill Looks to me like you ain t drinking he said to the proprietor The fat man waved the suggestion aside Never touch it he assured them Used to indulge a little in light wines and beers when the country was wet but when it went dry the stuff didn t mean enough to me to make it worth while dodging the law I just manage to keep a little of it around for old friends and men out of a dry country But we got a funny habit out in our country We can t no ways drink unless the gent that s setting them out takes something himself It ain t done that way in our part of the land said Ronicky It ain t Never Come come That s a good joke But even if I can t be with you boys drink hearty Ronicky Doone shook his head No joke at all he said firmly Matter of politeness that a lot of gents are terrible hard set on out where we come from Why Ronicky protested Bill Gregg ain t you making it a little strong For my part I ve drunk twenty times without having the gent that set em up touch a thing I reckon I can do it again Here s how Wait declared Ronicky Doone And there was a little jarring ring in his voice that arrested the hand of Bill Gregg in the very act of raising the glass Ronicky crossed the room quickly took a glass from the washstand and returning to the center table poured a liberal drink of the whisky into it I dunno about my friend he went on almost sternly to the bewildered hotel keeper I dunno about him but some gents feel so strong about not drinking alone that they d sooner fight Well sir I m one of that kind So I say there s your liquor Get rid of it The fat man reached the center table and propped himself against it gasping His whole big body seemed to be wilting as though in a terrific heat I dunno he murmured I dunno what s got into you fellers I tell you I never drink You lie you fat fool retorted Ronicky Didn t I smell your breath Bill Gregg dropped his own glass on the table and hurriedly came to confront his host by the side of Ronicky Breath asked the fat man hurriedly still gasping more and more heavily for air I I may have taken a small tonic after dinner In fact think I did That s all Nothing more I assure you I I have to be a sober man in my work You got to make an exception this evening said Ronicky more fiercely than ever I ought to make you drink all three drinks for being so slow about drinking one Three drinks exclaimed the fat man trembling violently It it would kill me I think it would said Ronicky I swear I think it would And maybe even one will be a sort of a shock eh He commanded suddenly Drink Drink that glass and clean out the last drop of it or we ll tie you and pry your mouth open and pour the whole bottle down your throat You understand A feeble moan came from the throat of the hotel keeper He cast one frantic glance toward the door and a still more frantic appeal centered on Ronicky Doone but the face of the latter was as cold as stone Then take your own glasses boys he said striving to smile as he picked up his own drink You drink first and you drink alone declared Ronicky Now The movement of his hand was as ominous as if he had whipped out a revolver The fat man tossed off the glass of whisky and then stood with a pudgy hand pressed against his breast and the upward glance of one who awaits a calamity Under the astonished eyes of Bill Gregg he turned pale a sickly greenish pallor His eyes rolled and his hand on the table shook and the arm that supported him sagged Open the window he said The air there ain t no air I m choking and Get him some water cried Bill Gregg while I open the window Stay where you are Bill But he looks like he s dying Then he s killed himself Gents began the fat man feebly and made a short step toward them The step was uncompleted In the middle of it he wavered put out his arms and slumped upon his side on the floor Bill Gregg cried out softly in astonishment and horror but Ronicky Doone knelt calmly beside the fallen bulk and felt the beating of his heart He ain t dead he said quietly but he ll be tolerably sick for a while Now come along with me But what s all this mean asked Bill Gregg in a whisper as he picked up his suit case and hurried after Ronicky Doped booze said Ronicky curtly They hurried down the stairs and came out onto the dark street There Ronicky Doone dropped his suit case and dived into a dark nook beside the entrance There was a brief struggle He came out again pushing a skulking figure before him with the man s arm twisted behind his back Take off this gent s hat will you asked Ronicky Bill Gregg obeyed too dumb with astonishment to think It s the taxi driver he exclaimed I thought so muttered Ronicky The skunk came back here to wait till we were fixed right now What ll we do with him I begin to see what s come off said Bill Gregg frowning into the white scowling face of the taxi driver The man was like a rat but in spite of his fear he did not make a sound Over there said Bill Gregg nodding toward a flight of cellar steps They caught the man between them rushed him to the steps and flung him headlong down There was a crashing fall groans and then silence He ll have a broken bone or two maybe said Ronicky peering calmly into the darkness but he ll live to trap somebody else curse him And picking up their suit cases again they started to retrace their steps Chapter Seven The First Clue They did not refer to the incidents of that odd reception in New York until they had located a small hotel for themselves not three blocks away It was no cheaper but they found a pleasant room clean and with electric lights It was not until they had bathed and were propped up in their beds for a good night smoke which cow punchers love that Bill Gregg asked And what gave you the tip Ronicky I dunno In my business you got to learn to watch faces Bill Suppose you sit in at a five handed game of poker One gent says everything with his face while he s picking up his cards Another gent don t say a thing but he shows what he s got by the way he moves in his chair or the way he opens and shuts his hands When you said something about our wad I seen the taxi driver blink Right after that he got terrible friendly and said he could steer us to a friend of his that could put us up for the night pretty comfortable Well it wasn t hard to put two and two together Not that I figured anything out Just was walking on my toes ready to jump in any direction As for Bill Gregg he brooded for a time on what he had heard then he shook his head and sighed I d be a mighty helpless kid in this here town if I didn t have you along Ronicky he said Nope insisted Ronicky Long as you use another gent for a sort of guide you feel kind of helpless But when you step off for yourself everything is pretty easy You just were waiting for me to take the lead or you d have done just as much by yourself Again Bill Gregg sighed as he shook his head If this is what New York is like he said we re in for a pretty bad time And this is what they call a civilized town Great guns they need martial law and a thousand policemen to the block to keep a gent s life and pocketbook safe in this town First gent we meet tries to bump us off or get our wad Don t look like we re going to have much luck Ronicky We saved our hides I guess That s about all And we learned something Sure Then I figure it was a pretty good night Another thing Bill I got an idea from that taxi gent I figure that whole gang of taxi men are pretty sharp in the eye What I mean is that we can tramp up and down along this here East River and now and then we ll talk to some taxi men that do most of their work from stands in them parts of the town Maybe we can get on her trail that way Anyways it s an opening Maybe said Bill Gregg dubiously He reached under his pillow But I m sure going to sleep with a gun under my head in this town With this remark he settled himself for repose and presently was snoring loudly Ronicky presented a brave face to the morning and at once started with Bill Gregg to tour along the East River That first day Ronicky insisted that they simply walk over the whole ground so as to become fairly familiar with the scale of their task They managed to make the trip before night and returned to the hotel footsore from the hard hot pavements There was something unkindly and ungenerous in those pavements it seemed to Ronicky He was discovering to his great amazement that the loneliness of the mountain desert is nothing at all compared to the loneliness of the Manhattan crowd Two very gloomy and silent cow punchers ate their dinner that night and went to bed early But in the morning they began the actual work of their campaign It was an arduous labor It meant interviewing in every district one or two storekeepers and asking the mail carriers for Caroline Smith and showing the picture to taxi drivers These latter were the men insisted Ronicky who would eventually bring them to Caroline Smith Because if they ve ever drove a girl as pretty as that they ll remember for quite a while But half of these gents ain t going to talk to us even if they know Bill Gregg protested after he had been gruffly refused an answer a dozen times in the first morning Some of em won t talk admitted Ronicky but that s probably because they don t know Take em by and large most gents like to tell everything they know and then some As a matter of fact they met with rather more help than they wanted In spite of all their efforts to appear casual there was something too romantic in this search for a girl to remain entirely unnoticed People whom they asked became excited and offered them a thousand suggestions Everybody it seemed had somewhere somehow heard of a Caroline Smith living in his own block and every one remembered dimly having passed a girl on the street who looked exactly like Caroline Smith But they went resolutely on running down a thousand false clues and finding at the end of each something more ludicrous than what had gone before Maiden ladies with many teeth and big glasses they found and they discovered at the ends of the trails on which they were advised to go young women and old ugly girls and pretty ones but never any one who in the slightest degree resembled Caroline Smith In the meantime they were working back and forth in their progress along the East River from the slums to the better residence districts They bought newspapers at little stationery stores and worked up chance conversations with the clerks particularly girl clerks whenever they could find them Because women have the eye for faces Ronicky would say and if a girl like Caroline Smith came into the shop she d be remembered for a while But for ten days they labored without a ghost of a success Then they noticed the taxi stands along the East Side and worked them as carefully as they could and it was on the evening of the eleventh day of the search that they reached the first clue They had found a taxi drawn up before a saloon converted into an eating place and when they went inside they found the driver alone in the restaurant They worked up the conversation as they had done a hundred times before Gregg produced the picture and began showing it to Ronicky Maybe the lady s around here said Ronicky but I m new in this part of town He took the picture and turned to the taxi driver Maybe you ve been around this part of town and know the folks here Ever see this girl around And he passed the picture to the other The taxi driver bowed his head over it in a close scrutiny When he looked up his face was a blank I don t know Lemme see I think I seen a girl like her the other day waiting for the traffic to pass at Seventy second and Broadway Yep she sure was a ringer for this picture He passed the picture back and a moment later he finished his meal paid his check and went sauntering through the door Quick said Ronicky the moment the chauffeur had disappeared Pay the check and come along That fellow knows something Bill Gregg greatly excited obeyed and they hurried to the door of the place They were in time to see the taxicab lurch away from the curb and go humming down the street while the driver leaned out to the side and looked back He didn t see us said Ronicky confidently But what did he leave for He s gone to tell somebody somewhere that we re looking for Caroline Smith Come on He stepped out to the curb and stopped a passing taxi Follow that machine and keep a block away from it he ordered Bootlegger asked the taxi driver cheerily I don t know but just drift along behind him till he stops Can you do that Watch me And with Ronicky and Bill Gregg installed in his machine he started smoothly on the trail Straight down the cross street under the roaring elevated tracks of Second and Third Avenues they passed and on First Avenue they turned and darted sharply south for a round dozen blocks then went due east and came to a halt after a brief run He s stopped in Beekman Place said the driver jerking open the door If I run in there he ll see me Ronicky stepped from the machine paid him and dismissed him with a word of praise for his fine trailing Then he stepped around the corner What he saw was a little street closed at both ends and only two or three blocks long It had the serene detached air of a village a thousand miles from any great city with its grave rows of homely houses standing solemnly face to face Well to the left the Fifty ninth Street Bridge swung its great arch across the river and it led Ronicky knew to Long Island City beyond but here everything was cupped in the village quiet The machine which they had been pursuing was drawn up on the right hand side of the street looking south and even as Ronicky glanced around the corner he saw the driver leave his seat dart up a flight of steps and ring the bell Ronicky could not see who opened the door but after a moment of talk the chauffeur from the car they had pursued was allowed to enter And as he stepped across the threshold he drew off his cap with a touch of reverence which seemed totally out of keeping with his character as Ronicky had seen it Bill he said to Gregg we ve got something You seen him go up those steps to that house Sure Bill Gregg s eyes were flashing with the excitement That house has somebody in it who knows Caroline Smith and that somebody is excited because we re hunting for her said Bill Maybe it holds Caroline herself Who can tell that Let s go see Wait till that taxi driver goes If he d wanted us to know about Caroline he d of told us He doesn t want us to know and he d maybe take it pretty much to heart if he knew we d followed him What he thinks don t worry me none I can tend to three like him Maybe but you couldn t handle thirty and coyotes like him hunt in packs always The best fighting pair of coyotes that ever stepped wouldn t have no chance against a lofer wolf but no lofer wolf could stand off a dozen or so of the little devils So keep clear of these little rat faced gents Bill They hunt in crowds Presently they saw the chauffeur coming down the steps Even at that distance it could be seen that he was smiling broadly and that he was intensely pleased with himself and the rest of the world Starting up his machine he swung it around dexterously as only New York taxi drivers can and sped down the street by the way he had come passing Gregg and Ronicky who had flattened themselves against the fence to keep from being seen They observed that while he controlled the car with one hand with the other he was examining the contents of his wallet Money for him exclaimed Ronicky as soon as the car was out of sight around the corner This begins to look pretty thick Bill Because he goes and tells them that he s taken us off the trail they not only thank him but they pay him for it And by the face of him as he went by they pay him pretty high Bill it s easy to figure that they don t want any friend near Caroline Smith and most like they don t even want us near that house I only want to go near once said Bill Gregg I just want to find out if the girl is there Go break in on em Break in Ronicky that s burglary Sure it is Ill just ask for Caroline Smith at the door Try it The irony made Bill Gregg stop in the very act of leaving and glance back But he went on again resolutely and stamped up the steps to the front door of the house It was opened to him almost at once by a woman for Bill s hat come off For a moment he was explaining Then there was a pause in his gestures as she made the reply Finally he spoke again but was cut short by the loud banging of the door Bill Gregg drew himself up rigidly and slowly replaced the hat on his head If a man had turned that trick on him a forty five caliber slug would have gone crashing through the door in search of him to teach him a Westerner s opinion of such manners Ronicky Doone could not help smiling to himself as he saw Bill Gregg stump stiffly down the stairs limping a little on his wounded leg and come back with a grave dignity to the starting point He was still crimson to the roots of his hair Let s start he said If that happens again I ll be doing a couple of murders in this here little town and getting myself hung What happened An old hag jerked open the door after I rang the bell I asked her nice and polite if a lady named Caroline Smith was in the house No says she and if she was what s that to you I told her I d come a long ways to see Caroline Then go a long ways back without seeing Caroline says this withered old witch and she banged the door right in my face Man I m still seeing red Them words of the old woman were whips and every one of them sure took off the hide I used to think that old lady Moore in Martindale was a pretty nasty talker but this one laid over her a mile But we re beat Ronicky You couldn t get by that old woman with a thousand men Maybe not said Ronicky Doone but we re going to try Did you look across the street and see a sign a while ago Which side Side right opposite Caroline s house Sure Room To Rent I thought so Then that s our room Eh That s our room partner and right at the front window over the street one of us is going to keep watch day and night till we make sure that Caroline Smith don t live in that house 
1867_154075_000027_000005	train-clean-100	Is that right 
none	none	That s a great idea He started away from the fence Wait Ronicky caught him by the shoulder and held him back We ll wait till night and then go and get that room If Caroline is in the house yonder and they know we re looking for her it s easy that she won t be allowed to come out the front of the house so long as we re perched up at the window waiting to see her We ll come back tonight and start waiting Chapter Eight Two Apparitions They found that the room in the house on Beekman Place opposite that which they felt covered their quarry could be secured and they were shown to it by a quiet old gentlewoman found a big double room that ran across the whole length of the house 
1867_154071_000002_000001	train-clean-100	From the back it looked down on the lights glimmering on the black East River and across to the flare of Brooklyn to the left the whole arc of the Fifty ninth Street Bridge was exposed 
none	none	In front the windows overlooked Beekman Place and were directly opposite the front of the house to which the taxi driver had gone that afternoon 
1867_154071_000003_000000	train-clean-100	Here they took up the vigil 
none	none	For four hours one of the two sat with eyes never moving from the street and the windows of the house across the street and then he left the post and the other took it 
1867_154071_000004_000000	train-clean-100	It was vastly wearying work 
none	none	Very few vehicles came into the light of the street lamp beneath them and every person who dismounted from one of them had to be scrutinized with painful diligence Once a girl young and slender and sprightly stepped out of a taxi about ten o clock at night and ran lightly up the steps of the house Ronicky caught his friend by the shoulders and dragged him to the window
1867_154071_000005_000001	train-clean-100	 There she is now he exclaimed 
none	none	But the eye of the lover even though the girl was in a dim light could not he deceived The moment he caught her profile as she turned in opening the door Bill Gregg shook his head
1867_154071_000006_000002	train-clean-100	 That s not the one She s all different a pile different Ronicky 
1867_154071_000007_000000	train-clean-100	Ronicky sighed 
none	none	I thought we had her he said
1867_154071_000007_000002	train-clean-100	 Go on back to sleep I ll call you again if anything happens 
none	none	But nothing more happened that night though even in the dull ghost hours of the early morning they did not relax their vigil But all the next day there was still no sign of Caroline Smith in the house across the street no face like hers ever appeared at the windows Apparently the place was a harmless rooming house of fairly good quality 
1867_154071_000008_000003	train-clean-100	Not a sign of Caroline Smith appeared even during the second day 
none	none	By this time the nerves of the two watchers were shattered by the constant strain and the monotonous view from the front window was beginning to madden them
1867_154071_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 It s proof that she ain t yonder said Bill Gregg 
none	none	Here s two days gone and not a sign of her yet It sure means that she ain t in that house unless she s sick in bed And he grew pale at the thought Partner said Ronicky Doone if they are trying to keep her away from us they sure have the sense to keep her under cover for as long as two days 
1867_154071_000010_000001	train-clean-100	Ain t that right 
none	none	It looks pretty bad for us but I m staying here for one solid week anyway 
1867_154071_000010_000003	train-clean-100	It s just about our last chance Bill 
1867_154071_000010_000004	train-clean-100	We ve done our hunting pretty near as well as we could If we don t land her this trip I m about ready to give up 
none	none	Bill Gregg sadly agreed that this was their last chance and they must play it to the limit 
1867_154071_000011_000001	train-clean-100	One week was decided on as a fair test 
1867_154071_000011_000002	train-clean-100	If at the end of that time Caroline Smith did not come out of the house across the street they could conclude that she did not stay there 
none	none	And then there would be nothing for it but to take the first train back West The third day passed and the fourth dreary dreary days of unfaltering vigilance on the part of the two watchers And on the fifth morning even Ronicky Doone sat with his head in his hands at the window peering through the slit between the drawn curtains which sheltered him from being observed at his spying 
1867_154071_000012_000002	train-clean-100	When he called out softly the sound brought Gregg with one long leap out of the chair where he was sleeping to the window 
1867_154071_000012_000003	train-clean-100	There could be no shadow of a doubt about it 
none	none	There stood Caroline Smith in the door of the house 
1867_154071_000013_000000	train-clean-100	She closed the door behind her and walking to the top of the steps paused there and looked up and down the street 
1867_154071_000044_000000	train-clean-100	Bill Gregg groaned 
none	none	snatched his hat and plunged through the door and Ronicky heard the brief thunder of his feet down the first flight of stairs then the heavy thumps as he raced around the landing He was able to trace him down all the three flights of steps to the bottom 
1867_154071_000015_000000	train-clean-100	And so swift was that descent that when the girl idling down the steps across the street came onto the sidewalk Bill Gregg rushed out from the other side and ran toward her 
none	none	They made a strange picture as they came to a halt at the same instant the girl shrinking back in apparent fear of the man and Bill Gregg stopping by that same show of fear as though by a blow in the face There was such a contrast between the two figures that Ronicky Doone might have laughed had he not been shaking his head with sympathy for Bill Gregg For never had the miner seemed so clumsily big and gaunt never had his clothes seemed so unpressed and shapeless while his soft gray hat to which he still clung religiously appeared hopelessly out of place in contrast with the slim prettiness of the girl She wore a black straw hat turned back from her face with a single big red flower at the side of it her dress was a tailored gray tweed The same distinction between their clothes was in their faces the finely modeled prettiness of her features and the big careless chiseling of the features of Bill Gregg Ronicky Doone did not wonder that after her first fear her gesture was one of disdain and surprise Bill Gregg had dragged the hat from his head and the wind lifted his long black hair and made it wild He went a long slow step closer to her with both his hands outstretched A strange scene for a street and Ronicky Doone saw the girl flash a glance over her shoulder and back to the house from which she had just come Ronicky Doone followed that glance and he saw all hidden save the profile of the face a man standing at an opposite window and smiling scornfully down at that picture in the street 
1867_154071_000021_000000	train-clean-100	What a face it was 
none	none	Never in his life had Ronicky Doone seen a man who in one instant filled him with such fear and hatred such loathing and such dread such scorn and such terror 
1867_154071_000021_000002	train-clean-100	The nose was hooked like the nose of a bird of prey the eyes were long and slanting like those of an Oriental 
1867_154071_000021_000003	train-clean-100	The face was thin almost fleshless so that the bony jaw stood out like the jaw of a death s head 
none	none	As for the girl the sight of that onlooker seemed to fill her with a new terror She shrank back from Bill Gregg until her shoulders were almost pressed against the wall of the house And Ronicky saw her head shake as she denied Bill the right of advancing farther 
1867_154071_000022_000003	train-clean-100	Still he pleaded and still she ordered him away 
none	none	Finally Bill Gregg drew himself up and bowed to her and turned on his heel The girl hesitated a moment It seemed to Ronicky in spite of the fact that she had just driven Bill Gregg away as if she were on the verge of following him to bring him back For she made a slight outward gesture with one hand 
1867_154071_000024_000000	train-clean-100	If this were in her mind however it vanished instantly 
none	none	She turned with a shudder and hurried away down the street As for Bill Gregg he bore himself straight as a soldier and came back across the pavement but it was the erectness of a soldier who has met with a crushing defeat and only preserves an outward resolution while all the spirit within is crushed Ronicky Doone turned gloomily away from the window and listened to the progress of Gregg up the stairs What a contrast between the ascent and the descent He had literally flown down Now his heels clumped out a slow and regular death march as he came back to the room 
1867_154071_000027_000000	train-clean-100	When Gregg opened the door Ronicky Doone blinked and drew in a deep breath at the sight of the poor fellow s face 
none	none	Gregg had known before that he truly loved this girl whom he had never seen but he had never dreamed what the strength of that love was Now in the very moment of seeing his dream of the girl turned into flesh and blood he had lost her and there was something like death in the face of the big miner as he dropped his hat on the floor and sank into a chair After that he did not move so much as a finger from the position into which he had fallen limply His legs were twisted awkwardly sprawling across the floor in front of him one long arm dragged down toward the floor as if there was no strength in it to support the weight of the labor hardened hands his chin was fallen against his breast When Ronicky Doone crossed to him and laid a kind hand on his shoulder he did not look up
1867_154071_000029_000001	train-clean-100	 It s ended said Bill Gregg faintly 
none	none	Now we hit the back trail and forget all about this He added with a faint attempt at cynicism I ve just wasted a pile of good money making time from the mine that s all H m said Ronicky Doone
1867_154071_000030_000001	train-clean-100	 Bill look me in the eye and tell me man to man that you re a liar He added Can you ever be happy without her man 
none	none	The cruelty of that speech made Gregg flush and look up sharply This was exactly what Ronicky Doone wanted I guess they ain t any use talking about that part of it said Gregg huskily
1867_154071_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 Ain t there 
1867_154071_000033_000001	train-clean-100	That s where you and me don t agree 
1867_154071_000033_000002	train-clean-100	Why Bill look at the way things have gone 
none	none	You start out with a photograph of a girl Now you ve followed her found her name tracked her clear across the continent and know her street address and you ve given her a chance to see your own face 
1867_154071_000033_000004	train-clean-100	Ain t that something done 
1867_154071_000033_000005	train-clean-100	After you ve done all that are you going to give up now 
1867_154071_000033_000006	train-clean-100	Not you Bill 
1867_154071_000033_000007	train-clean-100	You re going to buck up and go ahead full steam 
none	none	Eh 
1867_154071_000034_000000	train-clean-100	Bill Gregg smiled sourly 
none	none	D you know what she said when I come rushing up and saying I m Bill Gregg D you know what she said Well Bill Gregg she says
1867_154071_000036_000001	train-clean-100	 I don t remember any such name 
1867_154071_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 That took the wind out of me 
1867_154071_000037_000001	train-clean-100	I only had enough left to say The gent that was writing those papers to the correspondence school to you from the West the one you sent your picture to and 
1867_154071_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 Sent my picture to she says and looks as if the ground had opened under her feet 
1867_154071_000038_000001	train-clean-100	 You re mad she says 
none	none	And then she looks back over her shoulder as much as to wish she was safe back in her house
1867_154071_000039_000000	train-clean-100	 D you know why she looked back over her shoulder 
1867_154071_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 Just for the reason I told you 
1867_154071_000041_000000	train-clean-100	 No Bill 
none	none	There was a gent standing up there at a window watching her and how she acted He s the gent that kept her from writing to you and signing her name 
1867_154071_000041_000003	train-clean-100	He s the one who s kept her in that house 
none	none	He s the one that knew we were here watching all the time that sent out the girl with exact orders how she should act if you was to come out and speak to her when you seen her 
1867_154071_000041_000005	train-clean-100	Bill what that girl told you didn t come out of her own head 
1867_154071_000041_000006	train-clean-100	It come out of the head of the gent across the way 
1867_154071_000041_000007	train-clean-100	When you turned your back on her she looked like she d run after you and try to explain 
none	none	But the fear of that fellow up in the window was too much for her and she didn t dare Bill to get at the girl you got to get that gent I seen grinning from the window
1867_154071_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 Grinning asked Bill Gregg grinding his teeth and starting from his chair 
1867_154071_000042_000001	train-clean-100	 Was the skunk laughing at me 
none	none	Sure 
1867_154071_000043_000001	train-clean-100	Every minute 
none	none	Bill Gregg groaned
1867_154071_000044_000001	train-clean-100	 I ll smash every bone in his ugly head 
1867_154071_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 Shake said Ronicky Doone 
none	none	That s the sort of talk I wanted to hear and I ll help Bill Unless I m away wrong it ll take the best that you and me can do working together to put that gent down Chapter Nine A Bold Venture But how to reach that man of the smile and the sneer how above all to make sure that he was really the power controlling Caroline Smith were problems which could not be solved in a moment Bill Gregg contributed one helpful idea We ve waited a week to see her now that we ve seen her let s keep on waiting he said and Ronicky agreed They resumed the vigil but it had already been prolonged for such a length of time that it was impossible to keep it as strictly as it had been observed before Bill Gregg outworn by the strain of the long watching and the shock of the disappointment of that day went completely to pieces and in the early evening fell asleep But Ronicky Doone went out for a light dinner and came back after dark refreshed and eager for action only to find that Bill Gregg was incapable of being roused He slept like a dead man Ronicky went to the window and sat alone Few of the roomers were home in the house opposite They were out for the evening or for dinner at least and the face of the building was dark and cold the light from the street lamp glinting unevenly on the windowpanes He had sat there staring at the old house so many hours in the past that it was beginning to be like a face to him to be studied as one might study a human being And the people it sheltered the old hag who kept the door the sneering man and Caroline Smith were to the house like the thoughts behind a man s face an inscrutable face But if one cannot pry behind the mask of the human at least it is possible to enter a house and find At this point in his thoughts Ronicky Doone rose with a quickening pulse Suppose he alone entered that house tonight by stealth like a burglar and found what he could find He brushed the idea away Instantly it returned to him The danger of the thing and danger there certainly would be in the vicinity of him of the sardonic profile appealed to him more and more keenly Moreover he must go alone The heavy footed Gregg would be a poor helpmate on such an errand of stealth Ronicky turned away from the window turned back to it and looked once more at the tall front of the building opposite then he started to get ready for the expedition The preparations were simple He put on a pair of low shoes very light and with rubber heels In them he could move with the softness and the speed of a cat Next he dressed in a dark gray suit knowing that this is the color hardest to see at night His old felt hat he had discarded long before in favor of the prevailing style of the average New Yorker For this night expedition he put on a cap which drew easily over his ears and had a long visor shadowing the upper part of his face Since it might be necessary to remain as invisible as possible he obscured the last bit of white that showed in his costume with a black neck scarf Then he looked in the glass A lean face looked back at him the eyes obscured under the cap a stern resolute face with a distinct threat about it He hardly recognized himself in the face in the glass He went to his suit case and brought out his favorite revolver It was a long and ponderous weapon to be hidden beneath his clothes but to Ronicky Doone that gun was a friend well tried in many an adventure His fingers went deftly over it It literally fell to pieces at his touch and he examined it cautiously and carefully in all its parts looking to the cartridges before he assembled the weapon again For if it became necessary to shoot this evening it would be necessary to shoot to kill He then strolled down the street passing the house opposite with a close scrutiny A narrow paved sidewalk ran between it and the house on its right and all the windows opening on this small court were dark Moreover the house which was his quarry was set back several feet from the street an indentation which would completely hide him from anyone who looked from the street Ronicky made up his mind at once He went to the end of the block crossed over and turning back on the far side of the street slipped into the opening between the houses Instantly he was in a dense darkness For five stories above him the two buildings towered shutting out the starlight Looking straight up he found only a faint reflection of the glow of the city lights in the sky At last he found a cellar window He tried it and found it locked but a little maneuvering with his knife enabled him to turn the catch at the top of the lower sash Then he raised it slowly and leaned into the blackness Something incredibly soft tenuous clinging pressed at once against his face He started back with a shudder and brushed away the remnants of a big spider web Then he leaned in again It was an intense blackness The moment his head was in the opening the sense of listening which is ever in a house came to him There were the strange musty underground odors which go with cellars and make men think of death However he must not stay here indefinitely To be seen leaning in at this window was as bad as to be seen in the house itself He slipped through the opening at once and beneath his feet there was a soft crunching of coal He had come directly into the bin Turning he closed the window for that would be a definite clue to any one who might pass down the alley As he stood surrounded by that hostile silence that evil darkness he grew somewhat accustomed to the dimness and he could make out not definite objects but ghostly outlines Presently he took out the small electric torch which he carried and examined his surroundings The bin had not yet received the supply of winter coal and was almost empty He stepped out of it into a part of the basement which had been used apparently for storing articles not worth keeping but too good to be thrown away an American habit of thrift Several decrepit chairs and rickety cabinets and old console tables were piled together in a tangled mass Ronicky looked at them with an unaccountable shudder as if he read in them the history of the ruin and fall and death of many an old inhabitant of this house It seemed to his excited imagination that the man with the sneer had been the cause of all the destruction and would be the cause of more He passed back through the basement quickly eager to be out of the musty odors and his gloomy thoughts He found the storerooms reached the kitchen stairs and ascended at once Halfway up the stairs the door above him suddenly opened and light poured down at him He saw the flying figure of a cat a broom behind it a woman behind the broom Whisht Out of here dirty beast The cat thudded against Ronicky s knee screeched and disappeared below the woman of the broom shaded her eyes and peered down the steps A queer cat she muttered then slammed the door It seemed certain to Ronicky that she must have seen him yet he knew that the blackness of the cellar had probably half blinded her Besides he had drawn as far as possible to one side of the steps and in this way she might easily have overlooked him In the meantime it seemed that this way of entering the house was definitely blocked He paused a moment to consider other plans but while he stayed there in thought he heard the rattle of pans It decided him to stay a while longer Apparently she was washing the cooking utensils and that meant that she was near the close of her work for the evening In fact the rim of light which showed between the door frame and the door suddenly snapped out and he heard her footsteps retreating Still he delayed a moment or two for fear she might return to take something which she had forgotten But the silence deepened above him and voices were faintly audible toward the front of the house That decided Ronicky He opened the door blessing the well oiled hinges which kept it from making any noise and let a shaft from his pocket lantern flicker across the kitchen floor The light glimmered on the newly scrubbed surface and showed him a door to his right opening into the main part of the house He passed through it at once and sighed with relief when his foot touched the carpet on the hall beyond He noted too that there was no sign of a creak from the boards beneath his tread However old that house might be he was a noble carpenter who laid the flooring Ronicky thought as he slipped through the semi gloom For there was a small hall light toward the front and it gave him an uncertain illumination even at the rear of the passage Now that he was definitely committed to the adventure he wondered more and more what he could possibly gain by it But still he went on and in spite of the danger it is doubtful if Ronicky would have willingly changed places with any man in the world at that moment At least there was not the slightest sense in remaining on the lower floor of the house He slipped down the shadow of the main stairs swiftly circled through the danger of the light of the lower hall lamp and started his ascent Still the carpet muffled every sound which he made in climbing and the solid construction of the house did not betray him with a single creaking noise He reached the first hall This beyond doubt was where he would find the room of the man who sneered the archenemy as Ronicky Doone was beginning to think of him A shiver passed through his lithe muscular body at the thought of that meeting He opened the first door to his left It was a small closet for brooms and dust cloths and such things Determining to be methodical he went to the extreme end of the hall and tried that door It was locked but while his hand was still on the knob turning it in disappointment a door higher up in the house opened and a hum of voices passed out to him They grew louder they turned to the staircase from the floor above and commenced to descend at a running pace Three or four men at least there must be by the sound and perhaps more Ronicky started for the head of the stairs to make his retreat but just as he reached there the party turned into the hall and confronted him Chapter Ten Mistaken Identity To flee down the stairs now would be rank folly If there happened to be among these fellows a man of the type of him who sneered a bullet would catch the fugitive long before he reached the bottom of the staircase And since he could not retreat Ronicky went slowly and steadily ahead for certainly if he stood still he would be spoken to He would have to rely now on the very dim light in this hall and the shadow of his cap obscuring his face If these were roomers perhaps he would be taken for some newcomer But he was hailed at once and a hand was laid on his shoulder Hello Pete What s the dope Ronicky shrugged the hand away and went on Won t talk curse him That s because the plant went fluey Maybe not Pete don t talk much except to the old man Lemme get at him said a third voice Beat it down to Rooney s I m going up with Pete and get what he knows And as Ronicky turned onto the next flight of the stairway he was overtaken by hurrying feet The other two had already scurried down toward the front door of the house I got some stuff in my room Pete said the friendly fellow who had overtaken him Come up and have a jolt and we can have a talk Lefty and Monahan think you went flop on the job but I know better eh The old man always picks you for these singles he never gives me a shot at em Then he added Here we are And opening a door in the first hall he stepped to the center of the room and fumbled at a chain that broke loose and tinkled against glass eventually he snapped on an electric light Ronicky Doone saw a powerfully built bull necked man with a soft hat pulled far down on his head Then the man turned It was much against the grain for Ronicky Doone to attack a man by surprise but necessity is a stern ruler And the necessity which made him strike made him hit with the speed of a snapping whiplash and the weight of a sledge hammer Before the other was fully turned that iron hard set of knuckles crashed against the base of his jaw He fell without a murmur without a struggle Ronicky catching him in his arms to break the weight of the fall It was a complete knock out The dull eyes which looked up from the floor saw nothing The square rather brutal face was relaxed as if in sleep but here was the type of man who would recuperate with great speed Ronicky set about the obvious task which lay before him as fast as he could In the man s coat pocket he found a handkerchief which hard knotted would serve as a gag The window curtain was drawn with a stout thick cord Ronicky slashed off a convenient length of it and secured the hands and feet of his victim before he turned the fellow on his face Next he went through the pockets of the unconscious man who was only now beginning to stir slightly as life returned after that stunning blow It was beginning to come to Ronicky that there was a strange relation between the men of this house Here were three who apparently started out to work at night and yet they were certainly not at all the type of night clerks or night shift engineers or mechanics He turned over the hand of the man he had struck down The palm was as soft as his own No certainly not a laborer But they were all employed by the old man Who was he And was there some relation between all of these and the man who sneered At least Ronicky determined to learn all that could be read in the pockets of his victim There was only one thing That was a stub nosed heavy automatic It was enough to make Ronicky Doone sigh with relief At least he had not struck some peaceful law abiding fellow Any man might carry a gun Ronicky himself would have been uncomfortable without some sort of weapon about him but there are guns and guns This big ugly automatic seemed specially designed to kill swiftly and surely He was considering these deductions when a tap came on the door Ronicky groaned Had they come already to find out what kept the senseless victim so long Morgan oh Harry Morgan called a girl s voice Ronicky Doone started Perhaps who could tell this might be Caroline Smith herself come to tap at the door when he was on the very verge of abandoning the adventure Suppose it were someone else If he ventured out expecting to find Gregg s lady and found instead quite another person well women screamed at the slightest provocation and if a woman screamed in this house it seemed exceedingly likely that she would rouse a number of men carrying just such short nosed ugly automatics as that which he had just taken from the pocket of Harry Morgan In the meantime he must answer something He could not pretend that the room was empty for the light must be showing around the door Harry called the voice of the girl again Do you hear me Come out The chief wants you And she rattled the door Fear that she might open it and stepping in see the senseless figure on the floor alarmed Ronicky He came close to the door Well he demanded keeping his voice deep like the voice of Harry Morgan as well as he could remember it Hurry The chief I tell you He snapped out the light and turned resolutely to the door He felt his faithful Colt and the feel of the butt was like the touch of a friendly hand before he opened the door She was dressed in white and made a glimmering figure in the darkness of the hall and her hair glimmered also almost as if it possessed a light and a life of its own Ronicky Doone saw that she was a very pretty girl indeed Yes it must be Caroline Smith The very perfume of young girlhood breathed from her and very sharply and suddenly he wondered why he should be here to fight the battle of Bill Gregg in this matter Bill Gregg who slept peacefully and stupidly in the room across the street She had turned away giving him only a side glance as he came out I don t know what s on something big The chief s going to give you your big chance with me Ronicky Doone grunted Don t do that exclaimed the girl impatiently I know you think Pete is the top of the world but that doesn t mean that you can make a good imitation of him Don t do it Harry You ll pass by yourself You don t need a make up and not Pete s on a bet They reached the head of the stairs and Ronicky Doone paused To go down was to face the mysterious chief whom he had no doubt was the old man to whom Harry Morgan had already referred In the meantime the conviction grew that this was indeed Caroline Smith Her free and easy way of talk was exactly that of a girl who might become interested in a man whom she had never seen merely by letters I want to talk to you said Ronicky muffling his voice I want to talk to you alone To me asked the girl turning toward him The light from the hall lamp below gave Ronicky the faintest hint of her profile Yes But the chief He can wait She hesitated apparently drawn by curiosity in one direction but stopped by another thought I suppose he can wait but if he gets stirred up about it oh we ll I ll talk to you but nothing foolish Harry Promise me that Yes Slip into my room for a minute She led the way a few steps down the hall and he followed her through the door working his mind frantically in an effort to find words with which to open his speech before she should see that he was not Harry Morgan and cry out to alarm the house What should he say Something about Bill Gregg at once of course That was the thing The electric light snapped on at the far side of the room He saw a dressing table an Empire bed covered with green figured silk a pleasant rug on the floor and just as he had gathered an impression of delightful femininity from these furnishings the girl turned from the lamp on the dressing table and he saw not Caroline Smith but a bronze haired beauty as different from Bill Gregg s lady as day is from night Chapter Eleven A Cross Examination He was conscious then only of green blue eyes very wide very bright and lips that parted on a word and froze there in silence The heart of Ronicky Doone leaped with joy he had passed the crisis in safety She had not cried out You re not he had said in the first moment I am not who asked the girl with amazing steadiness But he saw her hand go back to the dressing table and open with incredible deftness and speed the little top drawer behind her Don t do that said Ronicky softly but sharply Keep your hand off that table lady if you don t mind She hesitated a fraction of a second In that moment she seemed to see that he was in earnest and that it would be foolish to tamper with him Stand away from that table sit down yonder Again she obeyed without a word Her eyes to be sure flickered here and there about the room as though they sought some means of sending a warning to her friends or finding some escape for herself Then her glance returned to Ronicky Doone Well she said as she settled in the chair Well A world of meaning in those two small words a world of dread controlled He merely stared at her thoughtfully I hit the wrong trail lady he said quietly I was looking for somebody else She started You were after She stopped That s right I guess he admitted How many of you are there she asked curiously so curiously that she seemed to be forgetting the danger Poor Carry Smith with a mob She stopped suddenly again What did you do to Harry Morgan I left him safe and quiet said Ronicky Doone The girl s face hardened strangely What you are and what your game is I don t know she said But I ll tell you this I m letting you play as if you had all the cards in the deck But you haven t I ve got one ace that ll take all your trumps Suppose I call once what ll happen to you pal You don t dare call he said Don t dare me said the girl angrily I hate a dare worse than anything in the world almost For a moment her green blue eyes were pools of light flashing angrily at him Into the hand of Ronicky Doone with that magic speed and grace for which his fame was growing so great in the mountain desert came the long glimmering body of the revolver and holding it at the hip he threatened her She shrank back at that gasping For there was an utter surety about this man s handling of the weapon The heavy gun balanced and steadied in his slim fingers as if it were no more than a feather s weight I m talking straight lady said Ronicky Doone Sit down pronto In the very act of obedience she straightened again It s bluff she said I m going through that door Straight for the door she went and Ronicky Doone set his teeth Go back he commanded He glided to the door and blocked her way but the gun hung futile in his hand It s easy to pull a gun eh said the girl with something of a sneer But it takes nerve to use it Let me through this door Not in a thousand years said Ronicky She laid her hand on the door and drew it back it struck his shoulder and Ronicky gave way with a groan and stood with his head bowed Inwardly he cursed himself Doubtless she was used to men who bullied her as if she were another man of an inferior sort Doubtless she despised him for his weakness But though he gritted his teeth he could not make himself firm Those old lessons which sink into a man s soul in the West came back to him and held him In the helpless rage which possessed him he wanted battle above all things in the world If half a dozen men had poured through the doorway he would have rejoiced But this one girl was enough to make him helpless He looked up in amazement She had not gone in fact she had closed the door slowly and stood with her back against it staring at him in a speechless bewilderment What sort of a man are you asked the girl at last A fool said Ronicky slowly Go out and round up your friends I can t stop you No said the girl thoughtfully but that was a poor bluff at stopping me He nodded And she hesitated still watching his face closely Listen to me she said suddenly I have two minutes to talk to you and I ll give you those two minutes You can use them in getting out of the house I ll show you a way or you can use them to tell me just why you ve come In spite of himself Ronicky smiled Lady he said if a rat was in a trap d you think he d stop very long between a chance of getting clear and a chance to tell how he come to get into the place I have a perfectly good reason for asking she answered Even if you now get out of the house safely you ll try to come back later on Lady said Ronicky do I look as plumb foolish as that You re from the West she said in answer to his slang Yes She considered the straight looking honesty of his eyes Out West she said I know you men are different Not one of the men I know here would take another chance as risky as this once they were out of it But out there in the mountains you follow long trails trails that haven t anything but a hope to lead you along them Isn t that so Maybe admitted Ronicky It s the fever out of the gold days lady You start out chipping rocks to find the right color maybe you never find the right color maybe you never find a streak of pay stuff but you keep on trying You re always just sort of around the corner from making a big strike She nodded smiling again and the smiles changed her pleasantly it seemed to Ronicky Doone At first she had impressed him almost as a man with her cold steady eyes but now she was all woman indeed That s why I say that you ll come back You won t give up with one failure Am I right He shrugged his shoulders I dunno If the trail fever hits me again maybe I would come back You started to tell me It s because of Caroline Smith Yes You don t have to talk to me said the girl As a matter of fact I shouldn t be here listening to you But I don t know why I want to help you You you are in love with Caroline No said Ronicky Her expression grew grave and cold again Then why are you here hunting for her What do you want with her Lady said Ronicky I m going to show you the whole layout of the cards Maybe you ll take what I say right to headquarters the man that smiles and block my game You know him she asked sharply Apparently that phrase the man who smiles was enough to identify him I ve seen him I dunno what he is I dunno what you are lady but I figure that you and Caroline Smith and everybody else in this house is under the thumb of the gent that smiles Her eyes darkened with a shadow of alarm Go on she said curtly I m not going on to guess about what you all are All I know is what I m here trying to do I m not working for myself I m working for a partner She started That s the second man the one who stopped her on the street today You re pretty well posted replied Ronicky Yes that s the one He started after Caroline Smith not even knowing her name with just a picture of her We found out that she lived in sight of the East River and pretty soon we located her here And what are you hoping to do To find her and talk to her straight from the shoulder and tell her what a pile Bill has done to get to her and a lot of other things Can t he find her and tell her those things for himself He can t talk said Ronicky Not that I m a pile better but I could talk better for a friend than he could talk for himself I figure If things don t go right then I ll know that the trouble is with the gent with the smile And then asked the girl very excited and grave I ll find him said Ronicky Doone And Lady he replied obliquely because I couldn t use a gun on a girl ain t no sign that I can t use it on a gent I ve one thing to tell you she said breaking in swiftly on him Do what you want take all the chances you care to but if you value your life and the life of your friend keep away from the man who smiles I ll have a fighting chance I guess said Ronicky quietly You ll have no chance at all The moment he knows your hand is against him I don t care how brave or how clever you are you re doomed She spoke with such a passion of conviction that she flushed and a moment later she was shivering It might have been the draft from the window which made her gather the hazy green mantle closer about her and glance over her shoulder but a grim feeling came to Ronicky Doone that the reason why the girl trembled and her eyes grew wide was that the mention of the man who smiles had brought the thought of him into the room like a breath of cold wind Don t you see she went on gently that I like you It s the first and the last time that I m going to see you so I can talk I know you re honest and I know you re brave Why I can see your whole character in the way you ve stayed by your friend and if there s a possible way of helping you I ll do it But you must promise me first that you ll never cross the man with the sneer as you call him There s a sort of a fate in it said Ronicky slowly I don t think I could promise There s a chill in my bones that tells me I m going to meet up with him one of these days She gasped at that and stepping back from him she appeared to be searching her mind to discover something which would finally and completely convince him At length she found it Do I look to you like a coward she said Do I seem to be weak kneed He shook his head And what will a woman fight hardest for For the youngsters she s got said Ronicky after a moment s thought And outside of that I suppose a girl will fight the hardest to marry the gent she loves And to keep from marrying a man she doesn t love as she d try to keep from death Sure said Ronicky But these days a girl don t have to marry that way I am going to marry the man with the sneer she said simply enough and with dull patient eyes she watched the face of Ronicky wrinkle and grow pale as if a heavy fist had struck him You he asked You marry him Yes she whispered And you hate the thought of him I I don t know He s kind You hate him insisted Ronicky And he s to have you that cold eyed snake that devil of a man He moved a little and she turned toward him smiling faintly and allowing the light to come more clearly and fully on her face You re meant for a king o men lady you got the queen in you it s in the lift of your head When you find the gent you can love why lady he ll be pretty near the richest man in the world The ghost of a flush bloomed in her cheeks but her faint smile did not alter and she seemed to be hearing him from far away The man with the sneer she said at length will never talk to me like that and still I shall marry him Tell me your name said Ronicky Doone bluntly My name is Ruth Tolliver Listen to me Ruth Tolliver If you was to live a thousand years and the gent with the smile was to keep going for two thousand it d never come about that he could ever marry you She shook her head still watching him as from a distance If I ve crossed the country and followed a hard trail and come here tonight and stuck my head in a trap as you might say for the sake of a gent like Bill Gregg fine fellow though he is what d you think I would do to keep a girl like you from life long misery And he dwelt on the last word until the girl shivered It s what it means said Ronicky Doone life long misery for you And it won t happen it can t happen Are you mad are you quite mad asked the girl What on earth have I and my affairs got to do with you Who are you I dunno said Ronicky Doone I suppose you might say I m a champion of lost causes lady Why have I got something to do with you I ll tell you why Because when a girl gets past being just pretty and starts in being plumb beautiful she lays off being the business of any one gent her father or her brother she starts being the business of the whole world You see They come like that about one in ten million and I figure you re that one lady The far away smile went out She was looking at him now with a sort of sad wonder Do you know what I am she said gravely I dunno said Ronicky and I don t care What you do don t count It s the inside that matters and the inside of you is all right Lady so long as I can sling a gun and so long as my name is Ronicky Doone you ain t going to marry the gent with the smile If he expected an outbreak of protest from her he was mistaken For what she said was Ronicky Doone Is that the name Ronicky Doone Then she smiled up at him I m within one ace of being foolish and saying But I won t She made a gesture of brushing a mist away from her and then stepped back a little I m going down to see the man with the smile and I m going to tell him that Harry Morgan is not in his room that he didn t answer my knock and then that I looked around through the house and didn t find him After that I m coming back here Ronicky Doone and I m going to try to get an opportunity for you to talk to Caroline Smith I knew you d change your mind said Ronicky Doone I ll even tell you why she said It isn t for your friend who s asleep but it s to give you a chance to finish this business and come to the end of this trail and go back to your own country Because if you stay around here long there ll be trouble a lot of trouble Ronicky Doone Now stay here and wait for me If anyone taps at the door you d better slip into that closet in the corner Will you wait Yes And you ll trust me To the end of the trail lady She smiled at him again and was gone Now the house was perfectly hushed He went to the window and looked down to the quiet street with all its atmosphere of some old New England village and eternal peace It seemed impossible that in the house behind him there were He caught his breath Somewhere in the house the muffled sound of a struggle rose He ran to the door thinking of Ruth Tolliver at once and then he shrank back again for a door was slammed open and a voice shouted the voice of a man Help Harrison Lefty Jerry Other voices answered far away footfalls began to sound Ronicky Doone knew that Harry Morgan his victim had at last recovered and managed to work the cords off his feet or hands or both Ronicky stepped back close to the door of the closet and waited It would mean a search probably this discovery that Morgan had been struck down in his own room by an unknown intruder And a search certainly would be started at once First there was confusion and then a clear musical man s voice began to give orders Harrison take the cellar Lefty go up to the roof The rest of you take the rooms one by one The search was on Don t ask questions was the last instruction When you see someone you don t know shoot on sight and shoot to kill I ll do the explaining to the police you know that Now scatter and the man who brings him down I ll remember Quick There was a new scurry of footfalls Ronicky Doone heard them approach the door of the girl s room and he slipped into the closet At once a cloud of soft cool silks brushed about him and he worked back until his shoulders had touched the wall at the back of the closet Luckily the enclosure was deep and the clothes were hanging thickly from the racks It was sufficient to conceal him from any careless searcher but it would do no good if any one probed and certainly these men were not the ones to search carelessly In the meantime it was a position which made Ronicky grind his teeth To be found skulking among woman s clothes in a closet to be dragged out and stuck in the back no doubt like a rat and thrown into the river that was an end for Ronicky Doone indeed He was on the verge of slipping out and making a mad break for the door of the house and trying to escape by taking the men by surprise when he heard the door of the girl s room open Some ex pugilist he heard a man s voice saying and he recognized it at once as belonging to him who had given the orders He recognized also that it must be the man with the sneer You think he was an amateur robber and an expert prize fighter asked Ruth Tolliver It seemed to Ronicky Doone that her voice was perfectly controlled and calm Perhaps it was her face that betrayed emotion for after a moment of silence the man answered What s the matter You re as nervous as a child tonight Ruth Isn t there reason enough to make me nervous she demanded A robber Heaven knows what running at large in the house H m murmured the man Devilish queer that you should get so excited all at once No it s something else I ve trained you too well for you to go to pieces like this over nothing What is it Ruth There was no answer Then the voice began again silken smooth and gentle so gentle and kindly that Ronicky Doone started In the old days you used to keep nothing from me we were companions Ruth That was when you were a child Now that you are a woman when you feel more think more see more when our companionship should be like a running stream continually bringing new things into my life I find barriers between us Why is it my dear Still there was no answer The pulse of Ronicky Doone began to quicken as though the question had been asked him as though he himself were fumbling for the answer Let us talk more freely went on the man Try to open your mind to me There are things which you dislike in me I know it Just what those things are I cannot tell but we must break down these foolish little barriers which are appearing more and more every day Not that I mean to intrude myself on you every moment of your life You understand that of course Of course said the girl faintly And I understand perfectly that you have passed out of childhood into young womanhood and
1867_154075_000030_000001	train-clean-100	 that is 
none	none	a dreamy time for a girl Her body is formed at last but her mind is only half formed There is a pleasant mist over it Very well I don t wish to brush the mist away If I did that I would take half that charm away from you that elusive incompleteness which Fragonard and Watteau tried to imitate Heaven knows with how little success No I shall always let you live your own life All that I ask for my dear are certain meeting places Let us establish them before it is too late or you will find one day that you have married an old man and we shall have silent dinners There is nothing more wretched than that If it should come about then you will begin to look on me as a jailer And Don t Ah said he very tenderly I knew that I was feeling toward the truth You are shrinking from me Ruth because you feel that I am too old No no Here a hand pounded heavily on the door The idiots have found something said the man of the sneer And now they have come to talk about their cleverness like a rooster crowing over a grain of corn He raised his voice Come in And Ronicky Doone heard a panting voice a moment later exclaim We ve got him 
1867_154075_000004_000000	train-clean-100	Chapter Twelve
none	none	 The Strange Bargain Ronicky drew his gun and waited Good said the man of the sneer Go ahead
1867_154075_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 It was down in the cellar that we found the first tracks 
none	none	He came in through the side window and closed it after him
1867_154075_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 That dropped him into the coal bin 
1867_154075_000008_000001	train-clean-100	Did he get coal dust on his shoes 
1867_154075_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 Right and he didn t have sense enough to wipe it off 
1867_154075_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 An amateur a rank amateur 
1867_154075_000010_000001	train-clean-100	I told you said the man of the sneer with satisfaction 
1867_154075_000010_000002	train-clean-100	 You followed his trail 
1867_154075_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 Up the stairs to the kitchen and down the hall and up to Harry s room 
1867_154075_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 We already knew he d gone there 
1867_154075_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 But he left that room again and came down the hall 
none	none	Yes The coal dust was pretty well wiped off by that time but we held a light close to the carpet and got the signs of it
1867_154075_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 And where did it lead 
1867_154075_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 Right to this room 
none	none	Ronicky stepped from among the smooth silks and pressed close to the door of the closet his hand on the knob 
1867_154075_000017_000001	train-clean-100	The time had almost come for one desperate attempt to escape and he was ready to shoot to kill 
1867_154075_000018_000000	train-clean-100	A moment of pause had come a pause which in the imagination of Ronicky was filled with the approach of both the men toward the door of the closet 
none	none	Then the man of the sneer said That s a likely story
1867_154075_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 I can show you the tracks 
none	none	H m You fool they simply grew dim when they got to this door 
1867_154075_000021_000002	train-clean-100	I ve been here for some time 
1867_154075_000021_000003	train-clean-100	Go back and tell them to hunt some more 
1867_154075_000021_000004	train-clean-100	Go up to the attic and search there 
none	none	That s the place an amateur would most likely hide The man growled some retort and left closing the door heavily behind him while Ronicky Doone breathed freely again for the first time
1867_154075_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 Now said the man of the sneer tell me the whole of it Ruth 
1867_154075_000024_000000	train-clean-100	Ronicky set his teeth 
1867_154075_000024_000001	train-clean-100	Had the clever devil guessed at the truth so easily 
none	none	Had he sent his follower away merely to avoid having it known that a man had taken shelter in the room of the girl he loved
1867_154075_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 Go on the leader was repeating 
1867_154075_000025_000001	train-clean-100	 Let me hear the whole truth 
1867_154075_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 I I stammered the girl and she could say no more 
1867_154075_000027_000000	train-clean-100	The man of the sneer laughed unpleasantly 
1867_154075_000027_000001	train-clean-100	 Let me help you 
1867_154075_000027_000002	train-clean-100	It was somebody you met somewhere on the train perhaps and you couldn t help smiling at him eh 
1867_154075_000027_000003	train-clean-100	You smiled so much in fact that he followed you and found that you had come here 
1867_154075_000027_000004	train-clean-100	The only way he could get in was by stealth 
none	none	Is that right 
1867_154075_000027_000006	train-clean-100	So he came in exactly that way like a robber but really only to keep a tryst with his lady love 
1867_154075_000027_000007	train-clean-100	A pretty story a true romance 
none	none	I begin to see why you find me such a dull fellow my dear girl
1867_154075_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 John began Ruth Tolliver her voice shaking 
1867_154075_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 Tush he broke in as smoothly as ever 
none	none	Let me tell the story for you and spare your blushes When I sent you for Harry Morgan you found Lochinvar in the very act of slugging the poor fellow You helped him tie Morgan then you took him here to your room although you were glad to see him you warned him that it was dangerous to play with fire fire being me 
1867_154075_000029_000004	train-clean-100	Do I gather the drift of the story fairly well Finally you have him worked up to the right pitch 
none	none	He is convinced that a retreat would be advantageous if possible You show him that it is possible You point out the ledge under your window and the easy way of working to the ground Eh
1867_154075_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes said the girl unevenly 
none	none	That is
1867_154075_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 Ah murmured the man of the sneer 
none	none	You seem rather relieved that I have guessed he left the house 
1867_154075_000031_000002	train-clean-100	In that case 
none	none	Ronicky Doone had held the latch of the door turned back for some time 
1867_154075_000032_000001	train-clean-100	Now he pushed it open and stepped out 
none	none	He was only barely in time for the man of the sneer was turning quickly in his direction since there was only one hiding place in the room 
1867_154075_000033_000000	train-clean-100	He was brought up with a shock by the sight of Ronicky s big Colt held at the hip and covering him with absolute certainty 
1867_154075_000033_000001	train-clean-100	Ruth Tolliver did not cry out but every muscle in her face and body seemed to contract as if she were preparing herself for the explosion 
none	none	You don t have to put up your hands said Ronicky Doone wondering at the familiarity of the face of the man of the sneer He had brooded on it so often in the past few days that it was like the face of an old acquaintance 
1867_154075_000034_000002	train-clean-100	He knew every line in that sharp profile 
none	none	Thank you responded the leader and turning to the girl he said coldly I congratulate you on your good taste 
1867_154075_000035_000001	train-clean-100	A regular Apollo my dear Ruth 
1867_154075_000036_000000	train-clean-100	He turned back to Ronicky Doone 
none	none	And I suppose you have overhead our entire conversation
1867_154075_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 The whole lot of it said Ronicky though I wasn t playing my hand at eavesdropping 
1867_154075_000037_000001	train-clean-100	I couldn t help hearing you partner 
1867_154075_000038_000000	train-clean-100	The man of the sneer looked him over leisurely 
1867_154075_000038_000001	train-clean-100	 Western he said at last decidedly Western 
1867_154075_000039_000000	train-clean-100	 Are you staying long in the East my friend 
none	none	I dunno said Ronicky Doone smiling faintly at the coolness of the other
1867_154075_000040_000001	train-clean-100	 What do you think about it 
1867_154075_000041_000000	train-clean-100	 Meaning that I m liable to put an end to your stay 
none	none	Maybe
1867_154075_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 Tush tush 
1867_154075_000043_000001	train-clean-100	I suppose Ruth has filled your head with a lot of rot about what a terrible fellow I am 
1867_154075_000043_000002	train-clean-100	But I don t use poison and I don t kill with mysterious X rays 
1867_154075_000043_000003	train-clean-100	I am as you see a very quiet and ordinary sort 
1867_154075_000044_000000	train-clean-100	Ronicky Doone smiled again 
1867_154075_000044_000001	train-clean-100	 You just oblige me partner he replied in his own soft voice 
none	none	Just stay away from the walls of the room don t even sit down 
1867_154075_000044_000003	train-clean-100	Stand right where you are 
none	none	You d murder me if I took another step asked the man of the sneer and a contemptuous and sardonic expression flitted across his face for the first time I d sure blow you full of lead said Ronicky fervently
1867_154075_000046_000001	train-clean-100	 I d kill you like a snake stranger which I mostly think you are 
1867_154075_000046_000002	train-clean-100	So step light and step quick when I talk 
1867_154075_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 Certainly said the other bowing 
none	none	I am entirely at your service He turned a little to Ruth I see that you have a most determined cavalier I suppose he ll instantly abduct you and sweep you away from beneath my eyes 
1867_154075_000048_000000	train-clean-100	She made a vague gesture of denial 
1867_154075_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 Go ahead said the leader 
1867_154075_000049_000001	train-clean-100	 By the way my name is John Mark 
1867_154075_000050_000000	train-clean-100	 I m Doone some call me Ronicky Doone 
1867_154075_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 I m glad to know you Ronicky Doone 
1867_154075_000051_000001	train-clean-100	I imagine that name fits you Now tell me the story of why you came to this house of course it wasn t to see a girl 
1867_154075_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 You re wrong 
none	none	It was
1867_154075_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 Ah In spite of himself the face of John Mark wrinkled with pain and suspicious rage 
none	none	I came to see a girl and her name I figure is Caroline Smith 
1867_154075_000055_000000	train-clean-100	Relief wonder and even a gleam of outright happiness shot into the eyes of John Mark 
none	none	Caroline 
1867_154075_000055_000002	train-clean-100	You came for that Suddenly he laughed heartily but there was a tremor of emotion in that laughter 
none	none	The perfect torture which had been wringing the soul of the man of the sneer projected through the laughter
1867_154075_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 I ask your pardon my dear said John Mark to Ruth 
1867_154075_000056_000001	train-clean-100	 I should have guessed 
1867_154075_000056_000002	train-clean-100	You found him he confessed why he was here you took pity on him and He brushed a hand across his forehead and was instantly himself calm and cool 
none	none	Very well then 
1867_154075_000057_000001	train-clean-100	It seems I ve made an ass of myself but I ll try to make up for it 
1867_154075_000057_000002	train-clean-100	Now what about Caroline 
none	none	There seems to be a whole host of you Westerners annoying her
1867_154075_000058_000000	train-clean-100	 Only one I m acting as his agent 
1867_154075_000059_000000	train-clean-100	 And what do you expect 
none	none	I expect that you will send for her and tell her that she is free to go down with me leave this house and take a ride or a walk with me
1867_154075_000061_000000	train-clean-100	 As much as that 
1867_154075_000061_000001	train-clean-100	If you have to talk to her why not do the talking here 
none	none	I dunno replied Ronicky Doone
1867_154075_000062_000001	train-clean-100	 I figure she d think too much about you all the time 
1867_154075_000063_000000	train-clean-100	 The basilisk eh asked John Mark 
1867_154075_000063_000001	train-clean-100	 Well you are going to persuade her to go to Bill Gregg 
1867_154075_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 You know the name eh 
1867_154075_000065_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes I have a curious stock of useless information 
none	none	Well you re right I m going to try to get her back for Bill
1867_154075_000067_000000	train-clean-100	 But you can t expect me to assent to that 
none	none	I sure do And why 
1867_154075_000069_000001	train-clean-100	This Caroline Smith may be a person of great value to me 
1867_154075_000070_000000	train-clean-100	 I have no doubt she is but I got a good argument 
none	none	What is it
1867_154075_000072_000000	train-clean-100	 The gun partner 
1867_154075_000073_000000	train-clean-100	 And if you couldn t get the girl but see how absurd the whole thing is Ronicky Doone 
1867_154075_000073_000001	train-clean-100	I send for the girl I request her to go down with you to the street and take a walk because you wish to talk to her Heavens man I can t persuade her to go with a stranger at night Surely you see that 
none	none	I ll do that persuading said Ronicky Doone calmly
1867_154075_000075_000000	train-clean-100	 And when you re on the streets with the girl do you suppose I ll rest idle and let you walk away with her 
1867_154075_000076_000000	train-clean-100	 Once we re outside of the house Mark said Ronicky Doone I don t ask no favors 
1867_154075_000076_000001	train-clean-100	Let your men come on 
none	none	All I got to say is that I come from a county where every man wears a gun and has to learn how to use it I ain t terrible backward with the trigger finger John Mark Not that I figure on bragging but I want you to pick good men for my trail and tell em to step soft 
1867_154075_000076_000005	train-clean-100	Is that square 
none	none	Aside from certain idiosyncrasies such as your manner of paying a call by way of a cellar window I think you are the soul of honor Ronicky Doone Now may I sit down Suppose we shake hands to bind the bargain said Ronicky
1867_154075_000078_000001	train-clean-100	 You send for Caroline Smith I m to do the persuading to get her out of the house 
1867_154075_000078_000002	train-clean-100	We re safe to the doors of the house the minute we step into the street you re free to do anything you want to get either of us Will you shake on that 
1867_154075_000079_000000	train-clean-100	For a moment the leader hesitated then his fingers closed over the extended hand of Ronicky Doone and clamped down on them like so many steel wires contracting 
1867_154075_000079_000001	train-clean-100	At the same time a flush of excitement and fierceness passed over the face of John Mark 
1867_154075_000079_000002	train-clean-100	Ronicky Doone taken utterly by surprise was at a great disadvantage 
none	none	Then he put the whole power of his own hand into the grip and it was like iron meeting iron A great rage came in the eyes of John Mark a great wonder came in the eyes of the Westerner 
1867_154075_000079_000005	train-clean-100	Where did John Mark get his sudden strength 
1867_154075_000080_000000	train-clean-100	 Well said Ronicky we ve shaken hands and now you can do what you please 
none	none	Sit down leave the room anything He shoved his gun away in his clothes 
1867_154075_000080_000002	train-clean-100	That brought a start from John Mark and a flash of eagerness but he repressed the idea after a single glance at the girl 
1867_154075_000081_000000	train-clean-100	 We ve shaken hands he admitted slowly as though just realizing the full extent of the meaning of that act 
none	none	Very well Ronicky I ll send for Caroline Smith and more power to your tongue but you ll never get her away from this house without force Chapter Thirteen Doone Wins A servant answered the bell almost at once Tell Miss Smith that she s wanted in Miss Tolliver s room said Mark and when the servant disappeared he began pacing up and down the room Now and then he cast a sharp glance to the side and scrutinized the face of Ronicky Doone With Ruth s permission the latter had lighted a cigarette and was smoking it in bland enjoyment Again the leader paused directly before the girl and with his feet spread and his head bowed in an absurd Napoleonic posture he considered every feature of her face The uncertain smile which came trembling on her face elicited no response from Mark She dreaded him Ronicky saw as a slave dreads a cruel master Still she had a certain affection for him partly as the result of many benefactions no doubt and partly from long acquaintance and above all she respected his powers of mind intensely The play of emotion in her face fear anger suspicion as John Mark paced up and down before her was a study With a secret satisfaction Ronicky Doone saw that her glances continually sought him timidly curiously All vanity aside he had dropped a bomb under the feet of John Mark and some day the bomb might explode There was a tap at the door it opened and Caroline Smith entered in a dressing gown She smiled brightly at Ruth and wanly at John Mark then started at the sight of the stranger This said John Mark is Ronicky Doone The Westerner rose and bowed He has come said John Mark to try to persuade you to go out for a stroll with him so that he can talk to you about that curious fellow Bill Gregg He is going to try to soften your heart I believe by telling you all the inconveniences which Bill Gregg has endured to find you here But he will do his talking for himself Just why he has to take you out of the house at night before he can talk to you is I admit a mystery to me But let him do the persuading Ronicky Doone turned to his host a cold gleam in his eyes His case had been presented in such a way as to make his task of persuasion almost impossible Then he turned back and looked at the girl Her face was a little pale he thought but perfectly composed I don t know Bill Gregg she said simply Of course I m glad to talk to you mister Doone but why not here John Mark covered a smile of satisfaction and the girl looked at him apparently to see if she had spoken correctly It was obvious that the leader was pleased and she glanced back at Ronicky with a flush of pleasure I ll tell you why I can t talk to you in here said Ronicky gently Because while you re under the same roof with this gent with the sneer he turned and indicated Mark sneering himself as he did so you re not yourself You don t have a halfway chance to think for yourself You feel him around you and behind you and beside you every minute and you keep wondering not what you really feel about anything but what John Mark wants you to feel Ain t that the straight of it She glanced apprehensively at John Mark and seeing that he did not move to resent this assertion she looked again with wide eyed wonder at Ronicky Doone You see said the man of the sneer to Caroline Smith that our friend from the West has a child like faith in my powers of what shall I say hypnotism A faint smile of agreement flickered on her lips and went out Then she regarded Ronicky with an utter lack of emotion If I could talk like him said Ronicky Doone gravely I sure wouldn t care where I had to do the talking but I haven t any smooth lingo I ain t got a lot of words all ready and handy I m a pretty simple minded sort of a gent Miss Smith That s why I want to get you out of this house where I can talk to you alone She paused then shook her head As far as going out with me goes went on Ronicky well they s nothing I can say except to ask you to look at me close lady and then ask yourself if I m the sort of a gent a girl has got anything to be afraid about I won t keep you long five minutes is all I ask And we can walk up and down the street in plain view of the house if you want Is it a go At least he had broken through the surface crust of indifference She was looking at him now with a shade of interest and sympathy but she shook her head I m afraid she began Don t refuse right off without thinking said Ronicky I ve worked pretty hard to get a chance to meet you face to face I busted into this house tonight like a burglar Oh cried the girl you re the man Harry Morgan She stopped aghast He s the man who nearly killed Morgan said John Mark Is that against me asked Ronicky eagerly Is that all against me I was fighting for the chance to find you and talk to you Give me that chance now Obviously she could not make up her mind It had been curious that this handsome boyish fellow should come as an emissary from Bill Gregg It was more curious still that he should have had the daring and the strength to beat Harry Morgan What shall I do Ruth she asked suddenly Ruth Tolliver glanced apprehensively at John Mark and then flushed but she raised her head bravely If I were you Caroline she said steadily I d simply ask myself if I could trust Ronicky Doone Can you The girl faced Ronicky again her hands clasped in indecision and excitement Certainly if clean honesty was ever written in the face of a man it stood written in the clear cut features of Ronicky Doone Yes she said at last I ll go For five minutes only in the street in full view of the house There was a hard deep throated exclamation from John Mark He rose and glided across the room as if to go and vent his anger elsewhere But he checked and controlled himself at the door then turned You seem to have won Doone I congratulate you When he s talking to you Caroline I want you constantly to remember that Wait cut in Ronicky sharply She ll do her own thinking without your help John Mark bowed with a sardonic smile but his face was colorless Plainly he had been hard hit Later on he continued we ll see more of each other I expect a great deal more Doone It s something I ll sure wait for said Ronicky savagely I got more than one little thing to talk over with you Mark Maybe about some of them we ll have to do more than talking Good by Lady I ll be waiting for you down by the front door of the house Caroline Smith nodded flung one frightened and appealing glance to Ruth Tolliver for direction then hurried out to her room to dress Ronicky Doone turned back to Ruth In my part of the country he said simply they s some gents we know sort of casual and some gents we have for friends Once in a while you bump into somebody that s so straight and square shooting that you d like to have him for a partner If you were out West lady and if you were a man well I d pick you for a partner because you ve sure played straight and square with me tonight He turned hesitated and facing her again caught up her hand touched it to his lips then hurried past John Mark and through the doorway They could hear his rapid footfalls descending the stairs and John Mark was thoughtful indeed He was watching Ruth Tolliver as she stared down at her hand When she raised her head and met the glance of the leader she flushed slowly to the roots of her hair Yes muttered John Mark still thoughtfully and half to himself there s really true steel in him He s done more against me in one half hour than any other dozen men in ten years Chapter Fourteen Her Little Joke A brief ten minutes of waiting beside the front door of the house and then Ronicky Doone heard a swift pattering of feet on the stairs Presently the girl was moving very slowly toward him down the hall Plainly she was bitterly afraid when she came beside him under the dim hall light She wore that same black hat turned back from her white face and the red flower beside it was a dull uncertain blur Decidedly she was pretty enough to explain Bill Gregg s sorrow Ronicky gave her no chance to think twice She was in the very act of murmuring something about a change of mind when he opened the door and stepping out into the starlight invited her with a smile and a gesture to follow In a moment they were in the freshness of the night air He took her arm and they passed slowly down the steps At the bottom she turned and looked anxiously at the house Lady murmured Ronicky they s nothing to be afraid of We re going to walk right up and down this street and never get out of sight of the friends you got in this here house At the word friends she shivered slightly and he added Unless you want to go farther of your own free will No no she exclaimed as if frightened by the very prospect Then we won t It s all up to you You re the boss and I m the cow puncher lady But tell me quickly she urged I I have to go back I mustn t stay out too long Starting right in at the first Ronicky said I got to tell you that Bill has told me pretty much everything that ever went on between you two All about the correspondence school work and about the letters and about the pictures I don t understand murmured the girl faintly But Ronicky diplomatically raised his voice and went on as if he had not heard her You know what he s done with that picture of yours No she said faintly He got the biggest nugget that he s ever taken out of the dirt He got it beaten out into the right shape and then he made a locket out of it and put your picture in it and now he wears it around his neck even when he s working at the mine Her breath caught That silly cheap snapshot She stopped She had admitted everything already and she had intended to be a very sphinx with this strange Westerner It was only a joke she said I I didn t really mean to Do you know what that joke did asked Ronicky It made two men fight then cross the continent together and get on the trail of a girl whose name they didn t even know They found the girl and then she said she d forgotten but no I don t mean to blame you There s something queer behind it all But I want to explain one thing The reason that Bill didn t get to that train wasn t because he didn t try He did try He tried so hard that he got into a fight with a gent that tried to hold him up for a few words and Bill got shot off his hoss Shot asked the girl Shot Suddenly she was clutching his arm terrified at the thought She recovered herself at once and drew away eluding the hand of Ronicky He made no further attempt to detain her But he had lifted the mask and seen the real state of her mind and she too knew that the secret was discovered It angered her and threw her instantly on the aggressive I tell you what I guessed from the window said Ronicky You went down to the street all prepared to meet up with poor old Bill Prepared to meet him She started up at Ronicky How in the world could I ever guess She was looking up to him trying to drag his eyes down to hers but Ronicky diplomatically kept his attention straight ahead You couldn t guess he suggested but there was someone who could guess for you Someone who pretty well knew we were in town who wanted to keep you away from Bill because he was afraid Of what she demanded sharply Afraid of losing you This seemed to frighten her What do you know she asked I know this he answered that I think a girl like you all in all is too good for any man But if any man ought to have her it s the gent that is fondest of her And Bill is terrible fond of you lady he don t think of nothing else He s grown thin as a ghost longing for you So he sends another man to risk his life to find me and tell me about it she demanded between anger and sadness He didn t send me I just came But the reason I came was because I knew Bill would give up without a fight I hate a man who won t fight said the girl It s because he figures he s so much beneath you said Ronicky And besides he can t talk about himself He s no good at that at all But if it comes to fighting lady why he rode a couple of hosses to death and stole another and had a gunfight all for the sake of seeing you when a train passed through a town She was speechless So I thought I d come said Ronicky Doone and tell you the insides of things the way I knew Bill wouldn t and couldn t but I figure it don t mean nothing much to you She did not answer directly She only said Are men like this in the West Do they do so much for their friends For a gent like Bill Gregg that s simple and straight from the shoulder they ain t nothing too good to be done for him What I d do for him he d do mighty pronto for me and what he d do for me well don t you figure that he d do ten times as much for the girl he loves Be honest with me said Ronicky Doone Tell me if Bill means anymore to you than any stranger No yes Which means simply yes But how much more lady I hardly know him How can I say It s sure an easy thing to say You ve wrote to him You ve had letters from him You ve sent him your picture and he s sent you his and you ve seen him on the street Lady you sure know Bill Gregg and what do you think of him I think Is he a square sort of gent Y yes The kind you d trust Yes but Is he the kind that would stick to the girl he loved and take care of her through thick and thin You mustn t talk like this said Caroline Smith but her voice trembled and her eyes told him to go on I m going back and tell Bill Gregg that down in your heart you love him just about the same as he loves you Oh she asked would you say a thing like that It isn t a bit true I m afraid that s the way I see it When I tell him that you can lay to it that old Bill will let loose all holds and start for you and if they s ten brick walls and twenty gunmen in between it won t make no difference He ll find you or die trying Before he finished she was clinging to his arm If you tell him you ll be doing a murder Ronicky Doone What he ll face will be worse than twenty gunmen The gent that smiles eh Yes John Mark No no I didn t mean But you did and I knew it too It s John Mark that s between you and Bill I seen you in the street when you were talking to poor Bill look back over your shoulder at that devil standing in the window of this house Don t call him that D you know of one drop of kindness in his nature lady Are we quite alone Not a soul around Then he is a devil and being a devil no ordinary man has a chance against him not a chance Ronicky Doone I don t know what you did in the house but I think you must have outfaced him in some way Well for that you ll pay be sure And you ll pay with your life Ronicky Every minute now you re in danger of your life You ll keep on being in danger until he feels that he has squared his account with you Don t you see that if I let Bill Gregg come near me Then Bill will be in danger of this same wolf of a man eh And in spite of the fact that you like Bill Ah yes I do That you love him in fact Why shouldn t I tell you demanded the girl breaking down suddenly I do love him and I can never see him to tell him because I dread John Mark Rest easy said Ronicky you ll see Bill or else he ll die trying to get to you If you re his friend I d rather see him dead than living the rest of his life plumb unhappy She shook her head arguing and so they reached the corner of Beekman Place again and turned into it and went straight toward the house opposite that of John Mark Still the girl argued but it was in a whisper as if she feared that terrible John Mark might overhear In the home of John Mark that calm leader was still with Ruth Tolliver They had gone down to the lower floor of the house and at his request she sat at the piano while Mark sat comfortably beyond the sphere of the piano light and watched her You re thinking of something else he told her and playing abominably I m sorry You ought to be he said It s bad enough to play poorly for someone who doesn t know but it s torture to play like that for me He spoke without violence as always but she knew that he was intensely angry and that familiar chill passed through her body It never failed to come when she felt that she had aroused his anger Why doesn t Caroline come back she asked at length She s letting him talk himself out that s all Caroline s a clever youngster She knows how to let a man talk till his throat is dry and then she ll smile and tell him that it s impossible to agree with him Yes there are many possibilities in Caroline You think Ronicky Doone is a gambler she asked harking back to what he had said earlier I think so answered John Mark and again there was that tightening of the muscles around his mouth A gambler has a certain way of masking his own face and looking at yours as if he were dragging your thoughts out through your eyes also he s very cool he belongs at a table with the cards on it and the stakes high The door opened Here s young Rose He ll tell us the truth of the matter Has she come back Rose The young fellow kept far back in the shadow and when he spoke his voice was uncertain almost to the point of trembling No he managed to say she ain t come back chief Mark stared at him for a moment and then slowly opened a cigarette case and lighted a smoke Well he said and his words were far more violent than the smooth voice well idiot what did she do She done a fade away chief in the house across the street Went in with that other gent He took her by force asked John Mark Nope She slipped in quick enough and all by herself He went in last Damnation murmured Mark That s all Rose His follower vanished through the doorway and closed the door softly after him John Mark stood up and paced quietly up and down the room At length he turned abruptly on the girl Good night I have business that takes me out What is it she asked eagerly He paused as if in doubt as to how he should answer her if he answered at all In the old days he said at last when a man caught a poacher on his grounds do you know what he did No Shot him my dear without a thought and threw his body to the wolves John Mark Do you mean Your friend Ronicky of course Only because Caroline was foolish are you going to Caroline Tut tut Caroline is only a small part of it He has done more than that far more this poacher out of the West He turned and went swiftly through the door The moment it was closed the girl buried her face in her hands Chapter Fifteen The Girl Thief Before that death sentence had been passed on him Ronicky Doone stood before the door of his room with the trembling girl beside him Wait here he whispered to her Wait here while I go in and wake him up It s going to be the greatest moment in his life Poor Bill Gregg is going to turn into the richest man in New York City all in one moment But I don t dare go in It will mean It will mean everything but it s too late to turn back now Besides in your heart of hearts you don t want to turn back you know Quickly he passed into the room and hurried to the bed of Bill Gregg Under the biting grip of Doone s hand Bill Gregg writhed to a sitting posture with a groan Still he was in the throes of his dream and only half awakened I ve lost her he whispered You re wrong idiot said Ronicky softly you re wrong You ve won her She s at the door now waiting to come in Ronicky said Bill Gregg suddenly awake you ve been the finest friend a man ever had but if you make a joke out of her I ll wring your neck Sure you would But before you do that jump into your clothes and open the door Sleep was still thick enough in the brain of Bill Gregg to make him obey automatically He stumbled into his clothes and then shambled dizzily to the door and opened it As the light from the room struck down the hall Ronicky saw his friend stiffen to his full height and strike a hand across his face Stars and Stripes exclaimed Bill Gregg The days of the miracles ain t over Ronicky Doone turned his back and went to the window Across the street rose the forbidding face of the house of John Mark and it threatened Ronicky Doone like a clenched hand brandished against him The shadow under the upper gable was like the shadow under a frowning brow In that house worked the mind of John Mark Certainly Ronicky Doone had won the first stage of the battle between them but there was more to come much more of that battle and who would win in the end was an open question He made up his mind grimly that whatever happened he would first ship Bill Gregg and the girl out of the city then act as the rear guard to cover their retreat When he returned they had closed the door and were standing back from one another with such shining eyes that the heart of Ronicky Doone leaped If for a moment doubt of his work came to him it was banished as they glanced toward him I dunno how he did it Bill Gregg was stammering but here it is done Bless you Ronicky A minute ago said Ronicky it looked to me like the lady didn t know her own mind but that seems to be over I found my own mind the moment I saw him said the girl Ronicky studied her in wonder There was no embarrassment no shame to have confessed herself She had the clear brow of a child Suddenly it seemed to Ronicky that he had become an old man and these were two children under his protection He struck into the heart of the problem at once The main point he said is to get you two out of town as quick as we can Out West in Bill s country he can take care of you but back here this John Mark is a devil and has the strength to stop us How quick can you go Caroline I can never go she said as long as John Mark is alive Then he s as good as dead said Bill Gregg We both got guns and no matter how husky John Mark may be we ll get at him The girl shook her head All the joy had gone out of her face and left her wistful and misty eyed You don t understand and I can t tell you You can never harm John Mark Why not asked Bill Gregg Has he got a thousand men around him all the time Even if he has they s ways of getting at him Not a thousand men said the girl but you see he doesn t need help He s never failed That s what they say of him John Mark the man who has never lost Listen to me said Ronicky angrily Seems to me that everybody stands around and gapes at this gent with the sneer a terrible lot without a pile of good reasons behind em Never failed Why lady here s one night when he s failed and failed bad He s lost you No said Caroline Not lost you asked Bill Gregg Say you ain t figuring on going back to him I have to go back Why demanded Gregg It s because of you interpreted Ronicky Doone She knows that if she leaves you Mark will start on your trail Mark is the name of the gent with the sneer Bill He s got to die then Ronicky I been figuring on the same thing for a long time but he ll die hard Bill Don t you see asked the girl Both of you are strong men and brave but against John Mark I know that you re helpless It isn t the first time people have hated him Hated Who does anything but hate him But that doesn t make any difference He wins he always wins and that s why I ve come to you She turned to Bill Gregg but such a sad resignation held her eyes that Ronicky Doone bowed his head I ve come to tell you that I love you that I have always loved you since I first began writing to you All of yourself showed through your letters plain and strong and simple and true I ve come tonight to tell you that I love you but that we can never marry Not that I fear him for myself but for you Listen here said Bill Gregg ain t there police in this town What could they do In all of the things which he has done no one has been able to accuse him of a single illegal act at least no one has ever been able to prove a thing And yet he lives by crime Does that give you an idea of the sort of man he is A low hound said Bill Gregg bitterly that s what he shows to be Tell me straight said Ronicky what sort of a hold has he got over you Can you tell us I have to tell you said the girl gravely if you insist but won t you take my word for it and ask no more We have a right to know said Ronicky Bill has a right and me being Bill s friend I have a right too She nodded First off what s the way John Mark uses you She clenched her hands If I tell you that you will both despise me Try us said Ronicky And you can lay to this lady that when a gent out of the West says partner to a girl or a man he means it What you do may be bad what you are is all right We both know it The inside of you is right lady no matter what John Mark makes you do But tell us straight what is it He has made me said the girl her head falling a thief Ronicky saw Bill Gregg wince as if someone had struck him in the face And he himself waited curious to see what the big fellow would do He had not long to wait Gregg went straight to the girl and took her hands D you think that makes any difference he asked Not to me and not to my friend Ronicky There s something behind it Tell us that There is something behind it said the girl and I can t say how grateful I am to you both for still trusting me I have a brother He came to New York to work found it was easy to spend money and spent it Finally he began sending home for money We are not rich but we gave him what we could It went on like that for some time Then one day a stranger called at our house and it was John Mark He wanted to see me and when we talked together he told me that my brother had done a terrible thing what it was I can t tell even you I wouldn t believe at first though he showed me what looked like proofs At last I believed enough to agree to go to New York and see for myself I came here and saw my brother and made him confess What it was I can t tell you I can only say that his life is in the hand of John Mark John Mark has only to say ten words and my brother is dead He told me that He showed me the hold that Mark had over him and begged me to do what I could for him I didn t see how I could be of use to him but John Mark showed me He taught me to steal and I have stolen He taught me to lie and I have lied And he has me still in the hollow of his hand do you see And that s why I say that it s hopeless Even if you could fight against John Mark which no one can you couldn t help me The moment you strike him he strikes my brother Curse him exclaimed Ronicky Curse the hound Then he added They s just one thing to do first of all You got to go back to John Mark Tell him that you came over here Tell him that you seen Bill Gregg but you only came to say good by to him and to ask him to leave town and go West Then tomorrow we ll move out and he may think that we ve gone Meantime the thing you do is to give me the name of your brother and tell me where I can find him I ll hunt him up Maybe something can be done for him I dunno but that s where we ve got to try But she began Do what he says whispered Bill Gregg I ve doubted Ronicky before but look at all that he s done Do what he says Caroline It means putting him in your power she said at last just as he was put in the power of John Mark but I trust you Give me a slip of paper and I ll write on it what you want Chapter Sixteen Disarming Suspicion From the house across the street Caroline Smith slipped out upon the pavement and glanced warily about her The street was empty quieter and more villagelike than ever yet she knew perfectly well that John Mark had not allowed her to be gone so long without keeping watch over her Somewhere from the blank faces of those houses across the street his spies kept guard over her movements Here she glanced sharply over her shoulder and it seemed to her that a shadow flitted into the door of a basement farther up the street At that she fled and did not stop running until she was at the door of the house of Mark Since all was quiet up and down the street she paused again her hand upon the knob To enter meant to step back into the life which she hated There had been a time when she had almost loved the life to which John Mark introduced her there had been a time when she had rejoiced in the nimbleness of her fingers which had enabled her to become an adept as a thief And by so doing she had kept the life of her brother from danger she verily believed She was still saving him and so long as she worked for John Mark she knew that her brother was safe yet she hesitated long at the door It would be only the work of a moment to flee back to the man she loved tell him that she could not and dared not stay longer with the master criminal and beg him to take her West to a clean life Her hand fell from the knob but she raised it again immediately It would not do to flee so long as John Mark had power of life or death over her brother If Ronicky Doone as he promised was able to inspire her brother with the courage to flee from New York give up his sporting life and seek refuge in some far off place then indeed she would go with Bill Gregg to the ends of the earth and mock the cunning fiend who had controlled her life so long The important thing now was to disarm him of all suspicion make him feel that she had only visited Bill Gregg in order to say farewell to him With this in her mind she opened the front door and stepped into the hall always lighted with ominous dimness That gloom fell about her like the visible presence of John Mark A squat powerful figure glided out of the doorway to the right It was Harry Morgan and the side of his face was swathed in bandages so that he had to twist his mouth violently in order to speak The chief he said abruptly Beat it quick to his room He wants you Why asked Caroline hoping to extract some grain or two of information from the henchman Listen kid said the sullen criminal D you think I m a nut to blow what I know You beat it and he ll tell you what he wants The violence of this language however had given her clues enough to the workings of the chief s mind She had always been a favored member of the gang and the men had whistled attendance on her hardly less than upon Ruth Tolliver herself This sudden harshness in the language of Harry Morgan told her that too much was known or guessed A sudden weakness came over her I m going out she said turning to Harry Morgan who had sauntered over to the front door Are you he asked I m going to take one turn more up the block I m not sleepy yet she repeated and put her hand on the knob of the door Not so you could notice it you ain t retorted Morgan We ve taken lip enough from you kid Your day s over Go up and see what the chief has to say but you ain t going through this door unless you walk over me Those are orders she asked stepping back with her heart turning cold Think I m doing this on my own hook She turned slowly to the stairs With her hand on the balustrade she decided to try the effect of one personal appeal Nerving herself she whirled and ran to Harry Morgan Harry she whispered let me go out till I ve worked up my courage You know he s terrible to face when he s angry And I m afraid Harry I m terribly afraid Are you asked Morgan Well you ain t the first Go and take your medicine like the rest of us have done time and time running There was no help for it She went wearily up the stairs to the room of the master thief There she gave the accustomed rap with the proper intervals Instantly the cold soft voice which she knew and hated so called to her to enter She found him in the act of putting aside his book He was seated in a deep easy chair a dressing gown of silk and a pair of horn rimmed spectacles gave him a look of owlish wisdom with a touch of the owl s futility of expression likewise He rose as usual with all his courtesy She thought at first as he showed her to a chair that he was going to take his usual damnable tack of pretended ignorance in order to see how much she would confess However tonight this was not his plan of battle The moment she was seated he removed his spectacles drew a chair close to hers and sat down leaning far forward Now my dear foolish girl said the master thief smiling benevolently upon her what have you been doing tonight to make us all miserable She knew at once that he was aware of every move she had made from the first to the last It gave her firmness to tell the lie with suavity It s a queer yarn John she said I m used to queer yarns he answered But where have you been all this time It was only to take five minutes I thought She made herself laugh That s because you don t know Ronicky Doone John I m getting to know him however said the master And before I m done I hope to know him very well indeed Well he has a persuasive tongue I think I noticed that for myself And when he told me how poor Bill Gregg had come clear across the continent No wonder you were touched my dear New Yorkers won t travel so far will they Not for a girl I mean Hardly But Ronicky Doone made it such a sad affair that I promised I d go across and see Bill Gregg Not in his room I knew you wouldn t let him come to see me here Never presuppose what I ll do But go on I m interested very Just as much as if Ronicky Doone himself were telling me She eyed him shrewdly but if there were any deception in him he hid it well She could not find the double meaning that must have been behind his words I went there however she said because I was sorry for him John If you had seen you d have been sorry too or else you would have laughed I could hardly keep from it at first I suppose he took you in his arms at once I think he wanted to Then of course I told him at once why I had come Which was Simply that it was absurd for him to stay about and persecute me that the letters I wrote him were simply written for fun when I was doing some of my cousin s work at the correspondence schools that the best thing he could do would be to take my regrets and go back to the West Did you tell him all that asked John Mark in a rather changed voice Yes but not quite so bluntly Naturally not you re a gentle girl Caroline I suppose he took it very hard Very but in a silly way He s full of pride you see He drew himself up and gave me a lecture about deceiving men Well since you have lost interest in him it makes no difference But in a way she said faintly rising slowly from her chair I can t help feeling some interest Naturally not But you see I was worried so much about you and this foolish fellow that I gave orders for him to be put out of the way as soon as you left him Caroline Smith stood for a moment stunned and then ran to him No no she declared In the name of the dear mercy of Heaven John you haven t done that I m sorry Then call him back the one you sent Call him back John and I ll serve you the rest of my life without question I ll never fail you John but for your own sake and mine for the sake of everything fair in the world call him back He pushed away her hands but without violence I thought it would be this way he said coldly You told a very good lie Caroline I suppose clever Ronicky Doone rehearsed you in it but it needed only the oldest trick in the world to expose you She recoiled from him It was only a joke then You didn t mean it John Thank Heaven for that A savagery which though generally concealed was never far from the surface now broke out in him making the muscles of his face tense and his voice metallic Get to your room he said fiercely get to your room I ve wasted time enough on you and your brat of a brother and now a Western lout is to spoil what I ve done I ve a mind to wash my hands of all of you and sink you Get to your room and stay there while I make up my mind which of the two I shall do She went cringing like one beaten to the door and he followed her trembling with rage Or have you a choice he asked Brother or lover which shall it be She turned and stretched out her hands to him unable to speak but the man of the sneer struck down her arms and laughed in her face In mute terror she fled to her room Chapter Seventeen Old Scars In his room Bill Gregg was striding up and down throwing his hands toward the ceiling Now and then he paused to slap Ronicky Doone on the back It s fate Ronicky he said over and over again Thinking of waking up and finding the girl that you ve loved and lost standing waiting for you It s the dead come to life I m the happiest man in the world Ronicky old boy one of these days I ll be able He paused stopped by the solemnity of Doone s face What s wrong Ronicky I don t know said the other gloomily He rubbed his arms slowly as if to bring back the circulation to numbed limbs You act like you re sick Ronicky I m getting bad luck signs Bill That s the short of it How come The old scars are prickling Scars What scars Ain t you noticed em It was bedtime so Ronicky Doone took off his coat and shirt The rounded body alive with playing muscles was striped here and there with white streaks scars left by healed wounds At your age A kid like you with scars Bill Gregg had been asking and then he saw the exposed scars and gasped How come Ronicky he asked huskily in his astonishment that you got all those and ain t dead yet I dunno said the other I wonder a pile about that myself Fact is I m a lucky gent Bill Gregg They say back yonder in your country that you ain t never been beaten Ronicky They sure say a lot of foolish things just to hear themselves talk partner A gent gets pretty good with a gun then they say he s the best that ever breathed that he s never been beat But they forget things that happened just a year back No sir I sure took my lickings when I started But dog gone it Ronicky you ain t twenty four now Between sixteen and twenty two I spent a pile of time in bed Bill and you can lay to that And you kept practicing Sure when I found out that I had to I never liked shooting much Hated to think of having a gent s life right inside the crook of my trigger finger But when I seen that I had to get good why I just let go all holds and practiced day and night And I still got to practice I seen that said Bill Gregg Every day for an hour or two you work with your guns It s like being a musician said Ronicky without enthusiasm I heard about it once Suppose a gent works up to be a fine musician maybe at the piano You d think when he got to the top and knew everything he could lay off and take things easy the rest of his life But not him Nope he s got to work like a slave every day But how come you felt them scars pricking as a bad luck sign Ronicky he asked after a time Is there anything that s gone wrong far as you see I dunno said Ronicky gravely Maybe not and maybe so I ain t a prophet but I don t like having everything so smooth not when they s a gent like the man with the sneer on the other end of the wire It means he s holding back some cards on us and I d sure like to see the color of what he s got What I m going to work for is this Bill To get Caroline s brother Jerry Smith and rustle him out of town But how can you do that when John Mark has a hold on him That s a pile of bunk Bill I figure Mark is just bluffing He ain t going to turn anybody over to the police Less he has to do with the police the happier he ll be You can lay to that Matter of fact he s been loaning money to Caroline s brother You heard her say that Also he thinks that Mark is the finest and most generous gent that ever stepped Probably a selfish skunk of a spoiled kid this brother of hers Most like he puts Mark up as sort of an ideal Well the thing to do is to get hold of him and wake him up and pay off his debts to Mark which most like run to several thousand Several thousand Ronicky But where ll we get the money You forget that I can always get money It grows on the bushes for me He grinned at Bill Gregg Once we get Jerry Smith then the whole gang of us will head straight West as fast as we can step Now let s hit the hay Never had the mind of Ronicky Doone worked more quickly and surely to the point The case of Jerry Smith was exactly what he had surmised As for the crime of which John Mark knew and which he held like a club over Jerry Smith it had been purely and simply an act of self defense But to Caroline and her brother Mark had made it seem clear that the shadow of the electric chair was before the young fellow Mark had worked seriously to win Caroline She was remarkably dexterous she was the soul of courage and if he could once make her love her work she would make him rich In the meantime she did very well indeed and he strengthened his hold on her through her brother It was not hard to do If Jerry Smith was the soul of recklessness he was the soul of honor also in many ways John Mark had only to lead the boy toward a life of heavy expenditures and gaming lending him from time to time the wherewithal to keep it up In this way he anchored Jerry as a safeguard to windward in case of trouble But now that Ronicky Doone had entered the tangle everything was changed That clear eyed fellow might see through to the very bottom of Mark s tidewater plans He might step in and cut the Gordian knot by simply paying off Jerry s debts Telling the boy to laugh at the danger of exposure Doone could snatch him away to the West So Mark came to forestall Ronicky by sending Jerry out of town and out of reach for the time being He would not risk the effect of Ronicky s tongue Had not Caroline been persuaded under his very eyes by this strange Westerner Very early the next morning John Mark went straight to the apartment of his protege It was his own man Northup who answered the bell and opened the door to him He had supplied Northup to Jerry Smith immediately after Caroline accomplished the lifting of the Larrigan emeralds That clever piece of work had proved the worth of the girl and made it necessary to spare no expense on Jerry So he had given him the tried and proven Northup The moment he looked into the grinning face of Northup he knew that the master was not at home and both the chief and the servant relaxed They were friends of too long a term to stand on ceremony There s no one here asked Mark as a matter of form Not a soul the kid skipped not a soul in the house Suppose he were to come up behind the door and hear you talk about him like this Northup He s trim you down nicely eh Him asked Northup with an eloquent jerk of his hand He s a husky young brute but it ain t brute force that I work with He smiled significantly into the face of the other and John Mark smiled in return They understood one another perfectly When is he coming back Didn t leave any word chief Isn t this earlier than his usual time for starting the day It is by five hours The lazy pup don t usually crack an eye till one in the afternoon What happened this morning Something rare something it would have done your heart good to see Out with it Northup I was routed out of bed at eight by a jangling of the telephone The operator downstairs said a gentleman was calling on mister Smith I said of course that mister Smith couldn t be called on at that hour Then the operator said the gentleman would come up to the door and explain I told him to come ahead At the door of the apartment I met as fine looking a youngster as I ever laid eyes on brown as a berry with a quick straight look about the eyes that would have done you good to see No booze or dope in that face chief He said How tall was he asked the chief About my height Know him Maybe What name did he give Didn t give a name I ve come to surprise Jerry he says to me Anybody would surprise Jerry at this hour of the morning says I It s too early I take it says he About five hours says I Then this is going to be one of the exceptions says he If you knew Jerry better you wouldn t force yourself on him says I Son says this fresh kid Is this the way you talk to Smith broke in Mark No I can polish up my lingo with the best of em But this brown faced youngster was a card Son he says to me I ll do my own explaining Just lead me to his dugout I couldn t help laughing You ll get a hot reception says I I come from a hot country says he and I got no doubt that Jerry will try to make me at home and he grinned with a devil in each eye Come in then says I and in he steps And mind your fists says I if you wake him up sudden He fights sometimes because he has to but mostly because it s a pleasure to him Sure says he That s the way I like to have em come And he went in demanded John Mark What s wrong with that asked Northup anxiously Nothing Go ahead Well in he went to Jerry s room I listened at the door I heard him call Jerry and then Jerry groaned like he was half dead I don t know you says Jerry You will before I m through with you says the other Who the devil are you asks Jerry Doone is my name says he Then go to the devil till one o clock says Jerry And come back then if you want to Here s my time for a beauty sleep If it s that time says Doone you ll have to go ugly today I m here to talk I heard Jerry sit up in bed Now what the devil s the meaning of this he asked Are you awake says Doone Yes but be hung to you says Jerry Don t be hanging me says Doone You just mark this day down in red it s a lucky one for you son An how d you mean that says Jerry and I could hear by his voice that he was choking he was that crazy mad Because it s the day you met me says Doone that s why it s a lucky one for you Listen to me says Jerry of all the nervy cold blooded fakers that ever stepped you re the nerviest Thanks says Doone I think I am doing pretty well If I wanted to waste the time says Jerry I d get up and throw you out It s a wise man says Doone that does his talking from the other side of a rock Well says Jerry d you think I can t throw you out Anyway says Doone I m still here I heard the springs squeal as Jerry went bouncing out of bed For a minute they wrestled and I opened the door What I see was Jerry lying flat and Doone sitting on his chest as calm and smiling as you please I closed the door quick Jerry s too game a boy to mind being licked fair and square but of course he d rather fight till he died than have me or anybody else see him give up I dunno how you got there says Jerry but if I don t kill you for this later on I d like to shake hands with you It was a good trick The gent that taught me near busted me in two with the trick of it said Doone S pose I let you up Is it to be a handshaking or fighting My wind is gone for half an hour says Jerry and my head is pretty near jarred loose from my spinal column I guess it ll have to be hand shaking today But I warn you Doone he says someday I ll have it all out with you over again Any time you mention says Doone but if you d landed that left when you rushed in I would have been on the carpet instead of you And Jerry chuckles feeling a pile better to think how near he d come to winning the fight Wait till I jump under the shower says Jerry and I ll be with you again Have you had breakfast And what brought you to me And who the devil are you Doone Are you out of the West He piles all these questions thick and fast at Doone and then I seen right off that him and Doone had made up to be pretty thick with each other So I went away from the door and didn t listen any more and in about half an hour out they walk arm in arm like old pals It was perfectly clear to John Mark that Ronicky had come there purposely to break the link between him and young Jerry Smith It was perfectly plain why he wanted to do it How much does Jerry owe me he asked suddenly The other drew out a pad and calculated for a moment Seven thousand eight hundred and forty two he announced with a grin as he put back the pad That s what he s sold himself for up to this time Too much in a way and not enough in another way replied John Mark Listen if he comes back which I doubt keep him here Get him away from Ronicky dope him dope them both In any case if he comes back here don t let him get away You understand Nope but I don t need to understand I ll do it John Mark nodded and turned toward the door Chapter Eighteen The Spider s Web Only the select attended the meetings at Fernand s It was doubly hard to choose them They had to have enough money to afford high play and they also had to lose without a murmur It made it extremely difficult to build up a clientele but Fernand was equal to the task He seemed to smell out the character of a man or woman to know at once how much iron was in their souls And following the course of an evening s play Fernand knew the exact moment at which a man had had enough It was never twice the same for the same man A rich fellow who lost twenty thousand one day and laughed at it might groan and curse if he lost twenty hundred a week later It was Fernand s desire to keep those groans and curses from being heard in his gaming house He extracted wallets painlessly so to speak He was never crooked and yet he would not have a dealer in his employ unless the fellow knew every good trick of running up the deck The reason was that while Fernand never cheated in order to take money away from his customers he very very frequently had his men cheat in order to give money away This sounds like a mad procedure for the proprietor of a gaming house but there were profound reasons beneath it For one of the maxims of Fernand and like every gambler he had many of them was that the best way to make a man lose money is first of all to make him win it Such was Monsieur Frederic Fernand And if many compared him to Falstaff and many pitied the merry fat old man for having fallen into so hard a profession yet there were a few who called him a bloated spider holding his victims with invisible cords and bleeding them slowly to death To help him he had selected two men both young both shrewd both iron in will and nerve and courage both apparently equally expert with the cards and both just as equally capable of pleasing his clients One was a Scotchman McKeever the other was a Jew Simonds But in looks they were as much alike as two peas out of one pod They hated each other with silent smiling hatred because they knew that they were on trial for their fortunes Tonight the Jew Simonds was dealing at one of the tables and the Scotchman McKeever stood at the side of the master of the house ready to execute his commissions Now and again his dark eyes wandered toward the table where the Jew sat with the cards flashing through his fingers McKeever hungered to be there on the firing line How he wished he could feel that sifting of the polished cardboard under his finger tips They were playing Black Jack He noted the smooth skill with which Simonds buried a card And yet the trick was not perfectly done Had he McKeever been there At this point he was interrupted by the easy oily voice of M Fernand This is an infernal nuisance McKeever raised his eyebrows and waited for an explanation Two young men very young very straight had just come into the rooms One he knew to be Jerry Smith Another table and dealer wasted declared M Fernand Smith and by heavens he s brought some friend of his with him Shall I see if I can turn them away without playing asked McKeever No not yet Smith is a friend of John Mark Don t forget that Never forget McKeever that the friends of John Mark must be treated with gloves always Very good replied McKeever like a pupil memorizing in class I ll see how far I can go with them went on M Fernand He went straight to the telephone and rang John Mark How far should I go with them he asked after he had explained that Smith had just come in Is there someone with him asked John Mark eagerly A young chap about the same age very brown That s the man I want The man you want Fernand said Mark without explaining those youngsters have gone out there to make some money at your expense M Fernand growled I wish you d stop using me as a bank Mark he complained Besides it costs a good deal I pay you a tolerable interest I believe said John Mark coldly Of course of course Well this in a manner of great resignation how much shall I let them take away Bleed them both to death if you want Let them play on credit Go as far as you like Very well said Fernand but I may be out there later myself Good by The face of Frederic Fernand was dark when he went back to McKeever What do you think of the fellow with Jerry Smith he asked Of him asked McKeever fencing desperately for another moment as he stared at Ronicky Doone The latter was idling at a table close to the wall running his hands through a litter of magazines After a moment he raised his head suddenly and glanced across the room at McKeever The shock of meeting glances is almost a physical thing And the bold calm eyes of Ronicky Doone lingered on McKeever and seemed to judge him and file that judgment away McKeever threw himself upon the wings of his imagination There was something about this fellow or his opinion would not have been asked What was it Well asked Frederic Fernand peevishly What do you think of him I think said the other casually that he s probably a Western gunman with a record as long as my arm You think that asked the fat man Well I ve an idea that you think right There s something about him that suggests action The way he looks about so slowly that is the way a fearless man is apt to look you know Do you think you can sit at the table with Ronicky Doone as they call him and Jerry Smith and win from them this evening With any sort of luck Leave the luck out of it John Mark has made a special request Tonight McKeever it s going to be your work to make the luck come to you Do you think you can A faint smile began to dawn on the face of McKeever Never in his life had he heard news so sweet to his ear It meant in brief that he was to be trusted for the first time at real manipulation of the cards His trust in himself was complete This would be a crushing blow for Simonds Mind you the master of the house went on if you are caught at working Nonsense said McKeever happily They can t follow my hands This fellow Doone I don t know I ll take the chance If you re caught I turn you out You hear Are you willing to take the risk Yes said McKeever very pale but determined At the right moment McKeever approached Jerry and Ronicky dark handsome smoothly amiable He was clever enough to make no indirect effort to introduce his topic I see that you gentlemen are looking about he said Yonder is a clear table for us Do you agree mister Smith Jerry Smith nodded and having introduced Ronicky Doone the three started for the table which had been indicated It was in an alcove apart from the sweep of big rooms which were given over to the players It lay too conveniently in range of the beat of Frederic Fernand as he moved slowly back and forth over a limited territory and stopped here and there for a word here and there for a smile He was smoothing the way for dollars to slide out of wallets Now he deliberately stopped the party in their progress to the alcove I have to meet you he said to Ronicky You remind me of a friend of my father a young Westerner those many years ago Same brown skin same clear eye He was a card expert the man I m thinking about I hope you re not in the same class my friend Then he went on laughing thunderously at his own poor jest Particularly from the back as he retreated he seemed a harmless fat man very simple very naive But Ronicky Doone regarded him with an interest both cold and keen And with much the same regard after Fernand had passed out of view the Westerner regarded the table at which they were to sit In the alcove were three wall lights giving an ample illumination too ample to suit Ronicky Doone For McKeever had taken the chair with the back to the light He made no comment but taking the chair which was facing the lights the chair which had been pointed out to him by McKeever he drew it around on the far side and sat down next to the professional gambler Chapter Nineteen Stacked Cards The game opened slowly The first second and third hands were won by Jerry Smith He tucked away his chips with a smile of satisfaction as if the three hands were significant of the whole progress of the game But Ronicky Doone pocketed his losses without either smile or sneer He had played too often in games in the West which ran to huge prices Miners had come in with their belts loaded with dust eager to bet the entire sum of their winnings at once Ranchers fat with the profits of a good sale of cattle had wagered the whole amount of it in a single evening As far as large losses and large gains were concerned Ronicky Doone was ready to handle the bets of anyone other than millionaires without a smile or a wince The trouble with McKeever was that he was playing the game too closely Long before it had been a maxim with the chief that a good gambler should only lose by a small margin That maxim McKeever playing for the first time for what he felt were important stakes in the eyes of Fernand followed too closely Stacking the cards with the adeptness which years of practice had given to him he never raised the amount of his opponent s hand beyond its own order A pair was beaten by a pair three of a kind was simply beaten by three of a kind of a higher order and when a full house was permitted by his expert dealing to appear to excite the other gamblers he himself indulged in no more than a superior grade of three of a kind Half a dozen times these coincidences happened without calling for any distrust on the part of Ronicky Doone but eventually he began to think Steady training enabled his eyes to do what the eyes of the ordinary man could not achieve and while to Jerry Smith all that happened in the deals of McKeever was the height of correctness Ronicky Doone at the seventh deal awakened to the fact that something was wrong He hardly dared to allow himself to think of anything for a time but waited and watched hoping against hope that Jerry Smith himself would discover the fraud which was being perpetrated on them But Jerry Smith maintained a bland interest in the game He had won between two and three hundred and these winnings had been allowed by McKeever to accumulate in little runs here and there For nothing encourages a gambler toward reckless betting so much as a few series of high hands He then begins to believe that he can tell by some mysterious feeling inside that one good hand presages another Jerry Smith had not been brought to the point where he was willing to plunge but he was very close to it McKeever was gathering the youngster in the hollow of his hand and Ronicky Doone fully awake and aware of all that was happening felt a gathering rage accumulate in him There was something doubly horrible in this cheating in this place Ronicky set his teeth and watched Plainly he was the chosen victim The winnings of Jerry Smith were carefully balanced against the losses of Ronicky Doone Hatred for this smooth faced McKeever was waxing in him and hatred in Ronicky Doone meant battle An interruption came to him from the side It came in the form of a brief rustling of silk like the stir of wind and then Ruth Tolliver s coppery hair and green blue eyes were before him Ruth Tolliver in an evening gown and wonderful to look at Ronicky Doone indulged himself with staring eyes as he rose to greet her This then was her chosen work under the regime of John Mark It was as a gambler that she was great The uneasy fire was in her eyes the same fire that he had seen in Western gold camps in Western gaming houses And the delicate nervous fingers now took on a new meaning to him That she had won heavily this evening he saw at once The dangerous and impalpable flush of the gamester was on her face and behind it burned a glow and radiance She looked as if having defeated men by the coolness of her wits and the favor of luck she had begun to think that she could now outguess the world Two men trailed behind her stirring uneasily about when she paused at Ronicky s alcove table You ve found the place so soon she asked How is your luck Not nearly as good tonight as yours Oh I can t help winning Every card I touch turns into gold this evening I think I have the formula for it Tell me then said Ronicky quickly enough for there was just the shadow of a backward nod of her head Just step aside I ll spoil mister McKeever s game for him I m afraid Ronicky excused himself with a nod to the other two and followed the girl into the next room I have bad news she whispered instantly but keep smiling Laugh if you can The two men with me I don t know They may be his spies for all we can tell Ronicky Doone John Mark is out for you Why in Heaven s name are you interfering with Caroline Smith and her affairs It will be your death I promise you John Mark has arrived and has placed men around the house Ronicky Doone he means business Help yourself if you can I m unable to lift a hand for you If I were you I should leave and I should leave at once Laugh Ronicky Doone He obeyed laughing until the tears were glittering in his eyes until the girl laughed with him Good she whispered Good by Ronicky and good luck He watched her going saw the smiles of the two men as they greeted her again and closed in beside her and watched the light flash on her shoulders as she shrugged away some shadow from her mind perhaps the small care she had given about him But no matter how cold hearted she might be how thoroughly in tune with this hard bright world of New York she at least was generous and had courage Who could tell how much she risked by giving him that warning Ronicky went back to his place at the table still laughing in apparent enjoyment of the jest he had just heard He saw McKeever s ferretlike glance of interrogation and distrust a thief s distrust of an honest man but Ronicky s good nature did not falter in outward seeming for an instant He swept up his hand bet a hundred with apparently foolish recklessness on three sevens and then had to buy fresh chips from McKeever The coming of the girl seemed to have completely upset his equilibrium as a gambler certainly it made him bet with the recklessness of a madman And Frederic Fernand glancing in from time to time watched the demolition of Ronicky s pile of chips with growing complacence Ronicky Doone had allowed himself to take heed of the room about him and Frederic Fernand liked him for it His beautiful rooms were pearls cast before swine so far as most of his visitors were concerned A moment later Ronicky had risen went toward the wall and drew a dagger from its sheath It was a full twelve inches in length that blade and it came to a point drawn out thinner than the eye could follow The end was merely a long glint of light As for Ronicky Doone he cried out in surprise and then sat down balancing the weapon in his hand and looking down at it with the silent happiness of a child with a satisfying toy Frederic Fernand was observing him There was something remarkably likable in young Doone he decided No matter what John Mark had said no matter if John Mark was a genius in reading the characters of men every genius could make mistakes This no doubt was one of John Mark s mistakes There was the free and careless thoughtlessness of a boy about this young fellow And though he glanced down the glimmering blade of the weapon with a sort of sinister joy Frederic Fernand did not greatly care There was more to admire in the workmanship of the hilt than in a thousand such blades but a Westerner would have his eye on the useful part of a thing How much d you think that s worth asked McKeever Dunno said Ronicky That s good steel He tried the point then he snapped it under his thumb nail and a little shiver of a ringing sound reached as far as Frederic Fernand Then he saw Ronicky Doone suddenly lean a little across the table pointing toward the hand in which McKeever held the pack ready for the deal McKeever shook his head and gripped the pack more closely Do you suspect me of crooked work asked McKeever He pushed back his chair Fernand studying his lieutenant in this crisis approved of him thoroughly He himself was in a quandary Westerners fight and a fight would be most embarrassing Do you think began McKeever I think you ll keep that hand and that same pack of cards on the table till I ve had it looked over said Ronicky Doone I ve dropped a cold thousand to you and you re winning it with stacked decks McKeever There was a stifled oath from McKeever as he jerked his hand back Frederic Fernand was beginning to draw one breath of joy at the thought that McKeever would escape without having that pack of all packs examined when the long dagger flashed in the hand of Ronicky Doone He struck as a cat strikes when it hooks the fish out of the stream he struck as the snapper on the end of a whiplash doubles back And well and truly did that steel uphold its fame The dull chopping sound of the blow stood by itself for an instant Then McKeever looking down in horror at his hand screamed and fell back in his chair That was the instant when Frederic Fernand judged his lieutenant and found him wanting A man who fainted in such a crisis as this was beyond the pale Other people crowded past him Frightened desperate he pushed on At length his weight enabled him to squeeze through the rapidly gathering crowd of gamblers The only nonchalant man of the lot was he who had actually used the weapon For Ronicky Doone stood with his shoulders propped against the wall his hands clasped lightly behind him For all that it was plain that he was not unarmed A certain calm insolence about his expression told Frederic Fernand that the teeth of the dragon were not drawn Gents he was saying in his mild voice while his eyes ran restlessly from face to face I sure do hate to bust up a nice little party like this one has been but I figure them cards are stacked I got a pile of reasons for knowing and I want somebody to look over them cards somebody that knows stacked cards when he sees em Mostly it ain t hard to get onto the order of them being run up I ll leave it gents to the man that runs this dump And leaning across the table he pushed the pack straight to Frederic Fernand The latter set his teeth It was very cunningly done to trap him If he said the cards were straight they might be examined afterward and if he were discovered in a lie it would mean more than the loss of McKeever it would mean the ruin of everything Did he dare take the chance Must he give up McKeever The work of years of careful education had been squandered on McKeever Fernand looked up and his eyes rested on the calm face of Ronicky Doone Why had he never met a man like that before There was an assistant There was a fellow with steel cold nerve worth a thousand trained McKeevers Then he glanced at the wounded man cowering and bunched in his chair At that moment the gambler made up his mind to play the game in the big way and pocket his losses Ladies and gentlemen he said sadly placing the cards back on the edge of the table I am sorry to say that mister Doone is right The pack has been run up There it is for any of you to examine it I don t pretend to understand Most of you know that McKeever has been with me for years Needless to say he will be with me no more And turning on his heel the old fellow walked slowly away his hands clasped behind him his head bowed And the crowd poured after him to shake his hand and tell him of their unshakable confidence in his honesty McKeever was ruined but the house of Frederic Fernand was more firmly established than ever after the trial of the night Chapter Twenty Trapped Get the money said Ronicky to Jerry Smith There it is He pointed to the drawer where McKeever as banker had kept the money The wounded man in the meantime had disappeared How much is ours asked Jerry Smith All you find there answered Ronicky calmly But there s a big bunch large bills too McKeever was loaded for bear He loses the house loses it Out in my country Jerry that wouldn t be half of what the house would lose for a little trick like what s been played on us tonight Not the half of what the house would lose I tell you He had us trimmed Jerry and out West we d wreck this joint from head to heels The diffident Jerry fingered the money in the drawer of the table uncertainly Ronicky Doone swept it up and thrust it into his pocket We ll split straws later said Ronicky Main thing we need right about now is action This coin will start us In the hall as they took their hats they found big Frederic Fernand in the act of dissuading several of his clients from leaving The incident of the evening was regrettable most regrettable but such things would happen when wild men appeared Besides the fault had been that of McKeever He assured them that McKeever would never again be employed in his house And Fernand meant it He had discarded all care for the wounded man Ronicky Doone stepped to him and drew him aside mister Fernand he said I ve got to have a couple of words with you Come into my private room said Fernand eager to get the fighter out of view of the rest of the little crowd He drew Ronicky and Jerry Smith into a little apartment which opened off the hall It was furnished with an almost feminine delicacy of style with wide seated spindle legged Louis XV chairs and a couch covered with rich brocade The desk was a work of Boulle A small tapestry of the Gobelins made a ragged glow of color on the wall Frederic Fernand had recreated an atmosphere two hundred years old He seated them at once And now sir he said sternly to Ronicky Doone you are aware that I could have placed you in the hands of the police for what you ve done tonight Ronicky Doone made no answer His only retort was a gradually spreading smile Partner he said at length while Fernand was flushing with anger at this nonchalance on the part of the Westerner they might of grabbed me but they would have grabbed your house first That fact said Fernand hotly is the reason you have dared to act like a wild man in my place mister Doone this is your last visit It sure is said Ronicky heartily D you know what would have happened out in my neck of the woods if there had been a game like the one tonight I wouldn t have waited to be polite but just pulled a gat and started smashing things for luck The incident is closed Fernand said with gravity and he leaned forward as if to rise Not by a long sight said Ronicky Doone I got an idea partner that you worked the whole deal This is a square house Fernand Why was I picked out for the dirty work It required all of Fernand s long habits of self control to keep him from gasping He managed to look Ronicky Doone fairly in the eyes What did the youngster know What had he guessed Suppose I get down to cases and name names The gent that talked to you about me was John Mark Am I right asked Ronicky Sir said Fernand thinking that the world was tumbling about his ears what infernal I m right said Ronicky I can tell when I ve hurt a gent by the way his face wrinkles up I sure hurt you that time Fernand John Mark it was eh Fernand could merely stare He began to have vague fears that this young devil might have hypnotic powers or be in touch with he knew not what unearthly source of information Out with it said Ronicky leaving his chair Frederic Fernand bit his lip in thought He was by no means a coward and two alternatives presented themselves to him One was to say nothing and pretend absolute ignorance the other was to drop his hand into his coat pocket and fire the little automatic which nestled there Listen said Ronicky Doone suppose I was to go a little farther still in my guesses Suppose I said I figured out that John Mark and his men might be scattered around outside this house waiting for me and Smith to come out What would you say to that Nothing said Fernand but he blinked as he spoke For a feat of imagination as great as that I have only a silent admiration But if you have some insane idea that John Mark a gentleman I know and respect greatly is lurking like an assassin outside the doors of my house Or maybe inside em said Ronicky unabashed by this gravity If you think that went on the gambler heavily I can only keep silence But to ease your own mind I ll show you a simple way out of the house a perfectly safe way which even you cannot doubt will lead you out unharmed Does that bring you what you want It sure does said Ronicky Lead the way captain and you ll find us right at your heels He fell in beside Jerry Smith while the fat man led on as their guide What does he mean by a safe exit asked Jerry Smith You d think we were in a smuggler s cave Worse said Ronicky a pile worse son And they ll sure have to have some tunnels or something for get aways This ain t a lawful house Jerry As they talked they were being led down toward the cellar They paused at last in a cool big room paved with cement and the unmistakable scent of the underground was in the air Here we are said the fat man and so saying he turned a switch which illumined the room completely and then drew aside a curtain which opened into a black cavity Ronicky Doone approached and peered into it How does it look to you Jerry he asked Dark but good enough for me if you re all set on leaving by some funny way I don t care how it looks said Ronicky thoughtfully By the looks you can t make out nothing most of the time nothing important But they s ways of smelling things and the smell of this here tunnel ain t too good to me Look again and try to pry down that tunnel with your flash light Jerry Accordingly Jerry raised his little pocket electric torch and held it above his head They saw a tunnel opening with raw dirt walls and floor and a rude framing of heavy timbers to support the roof But it turned an angle and went out of view in a very few paces Go down there with your lantern and look for the exit said Ronicky Doone I ll stay back here and see that we get our farewell all fixed up The damp cellar air seemed to affect the throat of the fat man He coughed heavily Say Ronicky said Jerry Smith looks to me that you re carrying this pretty far Let s take a chance on what we ve got ahead of us The fat man was chuckling You show a touching trust in me mister Doone Ronicky turned on him with an ugly sneer I don t like you Fernand he said They s nothing about you that looks good to me If I knew half as much as I guess about you I d blow your head off and go on without ever thinking about you again But I don t know Here you ve got me up against it We re going to go down that tunnel but if it s blind Fernand and you trap us from this end it will be the worst day of your life Take this passage Doone or turn around and come back with me and I ll show some other ways of getting out ways that lie under the open sky Doone Would you like that better Do you want starlight and John Mark or a little stretch of darkness all by yourself asked Fernand Ronicky Doone studied the face of Fernand almost wistfully The more he knew about the fellow the more thoroughly convinced he was that Fernand was bad in all possible ways He might be telling the truth now however again he might be simply tempting him on to a danger There was only one way to decide Ronicky a gambler himself mentally flipped a coin and nodded to Jerry We ll go in he said but man man how my old scars are pricking They walked into the moldy damp air of the tunnel reached the corner and there the passage turned and ended in a blank wall of raw dirt with a little apron of fallen debris at the bottom of it Ronicky Doone walked first and when he saw the passage obstructed in this manner he whirled like a flash and fired at the mouth of the tunnel A snarl and a curse told him that he had at least come close to his target but he was too late A great door was sliding rapidly across the width of the tunnel and before he could fire a second time the tunnel was closed Jerry Smith went temporarily mad He ran at the door which had just closed and struck the whole weight of his body against it There was not so much as a quiver The face of it was smooth steel and there was probably a dense thickness of stonework on the other side to match the cellar walls of the house It was my fool fault exclaimed Jerry turning to his friend My fault Ronicky Oh what a fool I am I should have known by the feel of the scars said Ronicky Put out that flash light Jerry We may need that after a while and the batteries won t last forever He sat down as he spoke cross legged and the last thing Jerry saw as he snapped out the light was the lean intense face and the blazing eyes of Ronicky Doone Decidedly this was not a fellow to trifle with If he trembled for himself and Ronicky he could also spare a shudder for what would happen to Frederic Fernand if Ronicky got away In the meantime the light was out and the darkness sat heavily beside and about them with that faint succession of inaudible breathing sounds which are sensed rather than actually heard Is there anything that we can do asked Jerry suddenly It s all right to sit down and argue and worry but isn t it foolish Ronicky How come I mean it in this way Sometimes when you can t solve a problem it s very easy to prove that it can t be solved by anyone That s what I can prove now but why waste time Have we got anything special to do with our time asked Ronicky dryly Well my proof is easy Here we are in hard pan dirt without any sort of a tool for digging So we sure can t tunnel out from the sides can we Looks most like we can t said Ronicky sadly And the only ways that are left are the ends That s right But one end is the unfinished part of the tunnel and if you think we can do anything to the steel door Hush up said Ronicky Besides there ain t any use in you talking in a whisper either No it sure don t look like we could do much to that door Besides even if we could I don t think I d go I d rather take a chance against starvation than another trip to fat Fernand s place If I ever enter it again son you lay to it that he ll get me bumped off mighty pronto Jerry Smith after a groan returned to his argument But that ties us up Ronicky The door won t work and it s worse than solid rock And we can t tunnel out the side without so much as a pin to help us dig can we I think that just about settles things Ronicky we can t get out Suppose we had some dynamite said Ronicky cheerily Sure but we haven t Suppose we find some Jerry Smith groaned Are you trying to make a joke out of this Besides could we send off a blast of dynamite in a closed tunnel like this We could try said Ronicky Way I m figuring is to show you it s bad medicine to sit down and figure out how you re beat Even if you owe a pile of money they s some satisfaction in sitting back and adding up the figures so that you come out about a million dollars on top in your dreams Before we can get out of here we got to begin to feel powerful sure But you take it straight friend Fernand ain t going to leave us in here Nope he s going to find a way to get us out That s easy to figure out But the way he ll get us out will be as dead ones and then he can dump us when he feels like it in the river Ain t that the simplest way of working it out The teeth of Jerry Smith came together with a snap Then the thing for us to do is to get set and wait for them to make an attack No use waiting When they attack it ll be in a way that ll give us no chance Then you figure the same as me we re lost Unless we can get out before they make the attack In other words Jerry there may be something behind the dirt wall at the end of the tunnel Nonsense Ronicky There s got to be said Ronicky very soberly because if there ain t you and me are dead ones Jerry Come along and help me look anyway Jerry rose obediently and flashed on his precious pocket torch and they went down to pass the turn and come again to the ragged wall of earth which terminated the passage Jerry held the torch and passed it close to the dirt All was solid There was no sign of anything wrong The very pick marks were clearly defined Hold on whispered Ronicky Doone Hold on Jerry I seen something He snatched the electric torch and together they peered at the patch from which the dried earth had fallen Queer for hardpan to break up like that muttered Ronicky cutting into the surface beneath the patch with the point of his hunting knife Instantly there was the sharp gritting of steel against steel The shout of Ronicky was an indrawn breath The shout of Jerry Smith was a moan of relief Ronicky continued his observations The thing was very clear They had dug the tunnel to this point and excavated a place which they had guarded with a steel door but in order to conceal the hiding place or whatever it might be they cunningly worked the false wall of dirt against the face of it using clay and a thin coating of plaster as a base It s a place they don t use very often maybe said Ronicky and that s why they can afford to put up this fake wall of plaster and mud after every time they want to come down here Pretty clever to leave that little pile of dirt on the floor just like it had been worked off by the picks eh But we ve found em Jerry and now all we got to do is to get to the door and into whatever lies beyond We d better hurry then cried Jerry How come Take a breath Ronicky obeyed the air was beginning to fill with the pungent and unmistakable odor of burning wood Chapter Twenty one The Miracle No great intelligence was needed to understand the meaning of it Fernand having trapped his game was now about to kill it He could suffocate the two with smoke blown into the tunnel and make them rush blindly out The moment they appeared dazed and uncertain the revolvers of half a dozen gunmen would be emptied into them It s like taking a trap full of rats said Ronicky bitterly and shaking them into a pail of water Let s go back and see what we can They had only to turn the corner of the tunnel to be sure Fernand had had the door of the tunnel slid noiselessly open then into the tunnel itself smoking slowly burning pungent pieces of pine wood had been thrown having been first soaked in oil perhaps The tunnel was rapidly filling with smoke and through the white drifts of it they looked into the lighted cellar beyond They would run out at last gasping for breath and blinded by the smoke to be shot down in a perfect light So much was clear Now back to the wall and try to find that door said Ronicky Jerry had already turned In a moment they were back and tearing with their fingers at the sham wall kicking loose fragments with their feet All the time while they cleared a larger and larger space they searched feverishly with the electric torch for some sign of a knob which would indicate a door or some button or spring which might be used to open it But there was nothing and in the meantime the smoke was drifting back in more and more unendurable clouds I can t stand much more declared Jerry at length Keep low The best air is there answered Ronicky A voice called from the mouth of the tunnel and they could recognize the smooth tongue of Frederic Fernand Doone I think I have you now But trust yourselves to me and all may still be well with you Throw out your weapons and then walk out yourselves with your arms above your heads and you may have a second chance I don t promise I simply offer you a hope in the place of no hope at all Is that a good bargain I ll see you hung first answered Ronicky and turned again to his work at the wall But it seemed a quite hopeless task The surface of the steel was still covered after they had cleared it as much as they could with a thin clinging coat of plaster which might well conceal the button or device for opening the door Every moment the task became infinitely harder Finally Jerry his lungs nearly empty of oxygen cast himself down on the floor and gasped A horrible gagging sound betrayed his efforts for breath Ronicky knelt beside him His own lungs were burning and his head was thick and dizzy One more try then we ll turn and rush them and die fighting Jerry The other nodded and started to his feet Together they made that last effort fumbling with their hands across the rough surface and suddenly had they touched the spring indeed a section of the surface before them swayed slowly in Ronicky caught the half senseless body of Jerry Smith and thrust him inside He himself staggered after and before him stood Ruth Tolliver While he lay panting on the floor she closed the door through which they had come and then stood and silently watched them Presently Smith sat up and Ronicky Doone staggered to his feet his head clearing rapidly He found himself in a small room not more than eight feet square with a ceiling so low that he could barely stand erect As for the furnishings and the arrangement it was more like the inside of a safe than anything else There were to be sure three little stools but nothing else that one would expect to find in an apartment For the rest there was nothing but a series of steel drawers and strong chests lining the walls of the room and leaving in the center very little room in which one might move about He had only a moment to see all of this Ruth Tolliver hooded in an evening cloak but with the light gleaming in her coppery hair was shaking him by the arm and leaning a white face close to him Hurry she was saying There isn t a minute to lose You must start now at once They will find out they will guess and then John Mark he asked Yes she exclaimed realizing that she had said too much and she pressed her hand over her mouth looking at Ronicky Doone in a sort of horror Jerry Smith had come to his feet at last but he remained in the background staring with a befuddled mind at the lovely vision of the girl Fear and excitement and pleasure had transformed her face but she seemed trembling in an agony of desire to be gone She seemed invincibly drawn to remain there longer still Ronicky Doone stared at her with a strange blending of pity and admiration He knew that the danger was not over by any means but he began to forget that This way called the girl and led toward an opposite door very low in the wall Lady said Ronicky gently will you hold on one minute They won t start to go through the smoke for a while They ll think they ve choked us when we don t come out on the rush shooting But they ll wait quite a time to make sure They don t like my style so well that they ll hurry me He smiled sourly at the thought And we got time to learn a lot of things that we ll never find out unless we know right now pronto He stepped before the girl as he spoke How come you knew we were in there How come you to get down here How come you to risk everything you got to let us out through the treasure room of Mark s gang He had guessed as shrewdly as he could and he saw by her immediate wincing that the shot had told You strange mad wild Westerner she exclaimed Do you mean to tell me you want to stay here and talk Even if you have a moment to spare you must use it If you knew the men with whom you are dealing you would never dream of In her pause he said smiling Lady it s tolerable clear that you don t know me But the way I figure it is this a gent may die any time but when he finds a minute for good living he d better make the most of it He knew by her eyes that she half guessed his meaning but she wished to be certain What do you intend by that she asked It s tolerable simple said Ronicky I ve seen square things done in my life but I ve never yet seen a girl throw up all she had to do a good turn for a gent she s seen only once You follow me lady I pretty near guess the trouble you re running into You guess what she asked I guess that you re one of John Mark s best cards You re his chief gambler lady and he uses you on the big game She had drawn back one hand pressed against her breast her mouth tight with the pain You have guessed all that about me she asked faintly That means you despise me What folks do don t matter so much said Ronicky It s the reasons they have for doing a thing that matters I figure and the way they do it I dunno how John Mark hypnotized you and made a tool out of you but I do know that you ain t changed by what you ve done Ronicky Doone stepped to her quickly and took both her hands He was not ordinarily particularly forward with girls Now he acted as gracefully as if he had been the father of Ruth Tolliver Lady he said you ve saved two lives tonight That s a tolerable lot to have piled up to anybody s credit Besides inside you re snow white We ve got to go but I m coming back Will you let me come back Never never declared Ruth Tolliver You must never see me you must never see Caroline Smith again Any step you take in that direction is under peril of your life Leave New York Ronicky Doone Leave it as quickly as you may and never come back Only pray that his arm isn t long enough to follow you Leave Caroline he asked I ll tell you what you re going to do Ruth When you get back home you re going to tell Caroline that Jerry here has seen the light about Mark and that he has money enough to pay back what he owes But I haven t broke in Jerry I have it said Ronicky and that s the same thing I ll take no charity declared Jerry Smith You ll do what I tell you said Ronicky Doone You been bothering enough son Go tell Caroline what I ve said he went on to the girl Let her know that they s no chain on anybody and if she wants to find Bill Gregg all she s got to do is go across the street You understand But even if I were to tell her how could she go Ronicky Doone when she s watched If she can t make a start and get to a man that loves her and is waiting for her right across the street she ain t worth worrying about said Ronicky sternly Do we go this way She hurried before them You ve waited too long you ve waited too long she kept whispering in her terror as she led them through the door paused to turn out the light behind her and then conducted them down a passage like that on the other side of the treasure chamber It was all deadly black and deadly silent but the rustling of the girl s dress as she hurried before them was their guide And always her whisper came back Hurry Hurry I fear it is too late Suddenly they were climbing up a narrow flight of steps They stood under the starlight in a back yard with houses about them on all sides Go down that alley and you will be on the street said the girl Down that alley and then hurry run find the first taxi Will you do that We ll sure go and we ll wait for Caroline Smith and you too Don t talk madness Why will you stay You risk everything for yourselves and for me Jerry Smith was already tugging at Ronicky s arm to draw him away but the Westerner was stubbornly pressing back to the girl He had her hand and would not leave it If you don t show up lady he said I ll come to find you You hear No no I swear Bless you but never venture near again But oh Ronicky Doone I wish ten other men in the whole world could be half so generous and wild as you Suddenly her hand was slipped from his and she was gone into the shadows Down the alley went Jerry Smith but he returned in an agony of dread to find that Ronicky Doone was still running here and there in a blind confusion probing the shadowy corners of the yard in search of the girl Come off you wild man said Jerry They ll be on our heels any minute they may be waiting for us now down the alley come off idiot quick If I thought they was a chance of finding her I d stay declared Ronicky shaking his head bitterly Whether you and me live don t count beside a girl like that Getting soot on one tip of her finger might mean more n whether you or me die Maybe maybe said the other but answer that tomorrow right now let s start to make sure of ourselves and we can come back to find her later Ronicky Doone submitting partly to the force and partly to the persuasion of his friend turned reluctantly and followed him down the alley Chapter Twenty two Mark Makes a Move Passing hurriedly out of the cloakroom a little later Ruth met Simonds the lieutenant of Frederic Fernand in the passage He was a ratfaced little man with a furtive smile Not an unpleasant smile but it was continually coming and going as if he wished earnestly to win the favor of the men before him but greatly doubted his ability to do so Ruth Tolliver knowing his genius for the cards knowing his cold and unscrupulous soul detested him heartily When she saw his eyes flicker up and down the hall she hesitated Obviously he wished to speak with her and obviously he did not wish to be seen in the act As she paused he stepped to her his face suddenly set with determination Watch John Mark he whispered Don t trust him He suspects everything What Everything about what she asked Simonds gazed at her for a moment with a singular expression There were conjoined cynicism admiration doubt and fear in his glance But instead of speaking again he bowed and slipped away into the open hall She heard him call and she heard Fernand s oily voice make answer And at that she shivered What had Simonds guessed How under heaven did he know where she had gone when she left the gaming house Or did he know Had he not merely guessed Perhaps he had been set on by Fernand or Mark to entangle and confuse her There remained out of all this confusion of guesswork a grim feeling that Simonds did indeed know and that for the first time in his life perhaps he was doing an unbought a purely generous thing She remembered now how often Simonds had followed her with his eyes how often his face had lighted when she spoke even casually to him Yes there might be a reason for Simonds generosity But that implied that he knew fairly well what John Mark himself half guessed The thought that she was under the suspicion of Mark himself was terrible to her She drew a long breath and advanced courageously into the gaming rooms The first thing she saw was Fernand hurrying a late comer toward the tables laughing and chatting as he went She shuddered at the sight of him It was strange that he who had a moment before in the very cellar of that house been working to bring about the death of two men should now be immaculate self possessed A step farther and she saw John Mark sitting at a console table with his back to the room and a cup of tea before him That was in fact his favorite drink at all hours of the day or night To see Fernand was bad enough but to see the master mind of all the evil that passed around her was too much The girl inwardly thanked Heaven that his back was turned and started to pass him as softly as possible Just a minute Ruth he called as she was almost at the door of the room For a moment there was a frantic impulse in her to bolt like a foolish child afraid of the dark In the next apartment were light and warmth and eager faces and smiles and laughter and here behind her was the very spirit of darkness calling her back After an imperceptible hesitation she turned Mark had not turned in his chair but it was easy to discover how he had known of her passing A small oval mirror fixed against the wall before him had shown her image How much had it betrayed she wondered of her guiltily stealthy pace She went to him and found that he was leisurely and openly examining her in the glass as she approached his chin resting on one hand his thin face perfectly calm his eyes hazy with content It was a habit of his to regard her like a picture but she had never become used to it she was always disconcerted by it as she was at this moment He rose of course when she was beside him and asked her to sit down But I ve hardly touched a card she said This isn t very professional you know wasting a whole evening She was astonished to see him flush to the roots of his hair His voice shook Sit down please She obeyed positively inert with surprise Do you think I keep you at this detestable business because I want the money he asked Dear Heaven Ruth is that what you think of me Fortunately before she could answer he went on No no no I have wanted to make you a free and independent being my dear and that is why I have put you through the most dangerous and exacting school in the world You understand I think I do she replied falteringly But not entirely Let me pour you some tea No He sighed as he blew forth the smoke of a cigarette But you don t understand entirely he continued and you must Go back to the old days when you knew nothing of the world but me Can you remember Yes yes Then you certainly recall a time when if I had simply given directions you would have been mine Ruth I could have married you the moment you became a woman Is that true Yes she whispered that is perfectly true The coldness that passed over her taught her for the first time how truly she dreaded that marriage which had been postponed but which inevitably hung over her head But I didn t want such a wife continued John Mark You would have been an undeveloped child really you would never have grown up No matter what they say something about a woman is cut off at the root when she marries Certainly if she had not been free before she is a slave if she marries a man with a strong will And I have a strong will Ruth very strong Very strong John she whispered again He smiled faintly as if there were less of what he wanted in that second use of the name He went on So you see I faced a problem I must and would marry you There was never any other woman born who was meant for me So much so good But if I married you before you were wise enough to know me you would have become a slave shrinking from me yielding to me incapable of loving me No I wanted a free and independent creature as my wife I wanted a partnership you see Put you into the world then and let you see men and women No I could not do that in the ordinary way I have had to show you the hard and bad side of life because I am in many ways a hard and bad man myself He said it almost literally through his teeth His face was fierce defying her his eyes were wistful entreating her not to agree with him Such a sudden rush of pity for the man swept over her that she put out her hand and pressed his He looked down at her hand for a moment and she felt his fingers trembling under that gentle pressure I understand more now she said slowly than I have ever understood before But I ll never understand entirely A thing that s understood entirely is despised he said with a careless sweep of his hand A thing that is understood is not feared I wish to be feared not to make people cower but to make them know when I come and when I go Even love is nothing without a seasoning of fear For instance he flushed as the torrent of his speech swept him into a committal of himself I am afraid of you dear girl Do you know what I have done with the money you ve won Tell me she said curiously and at the same time she glanced in wonder as a servant passed softly across the little room Was it not stranger than words could tell that such a man as John Mark should be sitting in this almost public place and pouring his soul out into the ear of a girl I shall tell you said Mark his voice softening I have contributed half of it to charity Her lips compressed with doubt parted in wonder Charity she exclaimed And the other half he went on I deposited in a bank to the credit of a fictitious personality That fictitious personality is in flesh and blood Ruth Tolliver with a new name You understand I have only to hand you the bank book with the list of deposits and you can step out of this Tolliver personality and appear in a new part of the world as another being Do you see what it means If at the last you find you cannot marry me my dear you are provided for Not out of my charity which would be bitter to you but out of your own earnings And lest you should be horrified at the thought of living on your earnings at the gaming table I have thrown bread on the waters dear Ruth For every dollar you have in the bank you have given another to charity and both I hope have borne interest for you His smile faded a little as she murmured with her glance going past him Then I am free Free John Whenever you wish Not that I ever shall wish but to know that I am not chained that is the wonderful thing She looked directly at him again I never dreamed there was so much fineness in you John Mark I never dreamed it but I should have Now I have been winning Caroline to the game he went on and she is beginning to love it In another year or six months trust me to have completely filled her with the fever But now enters the mischief maker in the piece a stranger an ignorant outsider This incredible man arrives and in a few days having miraculously run Caroline to earth goes on and brings Caroline face to face with her lover teaches Jerry Smith that I am his worst enemy gets enough money to pay off his debt to me and convinces him that I can never use my knowledge of his crime to jail him because I don t dare bring the police too close to my own rather explosive record I saw them both here said the girl She wondered how much he guessed and she saw his keen eyes probe her with a glance But her ingenuousness if it did not disarm him at least dulled the edge of his suspicions He was here and the trap was laid here and he slipped through it Got away through a certain room which Fernand would give a million to keep secret At any rate the fellow has shown that he is slippery and has a sting too He sent a bullet a fraction of an inch past Fernand s head at one point in the little story In short the price is too high What I want is to secure Caroline Smith from the inside I want you to go to her to persuade her to go away with you on a trip Take her to the Bermudas or to Havana any place you please The moment the Westerner thinks his lady is running away from him of her own volition he ll throw up his hands and curse his luck and go home They have that sort of pride on the other side of the Rockies Will you go back tonight right now and persuade Caroline to go with you She bowed her head under the shock of it Ronicky Doone had begged her to send Caroline Smith to meet her lover Now the counterattack followed Do you think she d listen Yes tell her that the one thing that will save the head of Bill Gregg is for her to go away otherwise I ll wipe the fool off the map Better still tell her that Gregg of his own free will has left New York and given up the chase Tell her you want to console her with a trip She ll be sad and glad and flattered all in the same moment and go along with you without a word Will you try Ruth I suppose you would have Bill Gregg removed if he continued a nuisance Not a shadow of a doubt Will you do your best She rose Yes said the girl Then she managed to smile at him Of course I ll do my best I ll go back right now He took her arm to the door of the room Thank Heaven he said that I have one person in whom I can trust without question one who needs no bribing or rewards but works to please me Good by my dear He watched her down the hall and then turned and went through room after room to the rear of the house There he rapped on a door in a peculiar manner It was opened at once and Harry Morgan appeared before him A rush job Harry he said A little shadowing Harry jerked his cap lower over his eyes Gimme the smell of the trail I m ready he said Ruth Tolliver has just left the house Follow her She ll probably go home She ll probably talk with Caroline Smith Find a way of listening If you hear anything that seems wrong to you anything about Caroline leaving the house alone for instance telephone to me at once Now go and work as you never worked for me before Chapter Twenty three Caroline takes Command Ruth left the gaming house of Frederic Fernand entirely convinced that she must do as John Mark had told her work for him as she had never worked before The determination made her go home to Beekman Place as fast as a taxicab would whirl her along It was not until she had climbed to Caroline Smith s room and opened the door that her determination faltered For there she saw the girl lying on her bed weeping And it seemed to the poor bewildered brain of Ruth Tolliver as if the form of Ronicky Doone passionate and eager as before stood at her side and begged her again to send Caroline Smith across the street to a lifelong happiness and she could do it Though Mark had ordered the girl to be confined to her room until further commands were given on the subject no one in the house would think of questioning Ruth Tolliver if she took the girl downstairs to the street and told her to go on her way She closed the door softly and going to the bed touched the shoulder of Caroline The poor girl sat up slowly and turned a stained and swollen face to Ruth If there was much to be pitied there was something to be laughed at also Ruth could not forbear smiling But Caroline was clutching at her hands He s changed his mind she asked eagerly He s sent you to tell me that he s changed his mind Ruth Oh you ve persuaded him to it like an angel I know you have Ruth Tolliver freed herself from the reaching hands moistened the end of a towel in the bathroom and began to remove the traces of tears from the face of Caroline Smith That face was no longer flushed but growing pale with excitement and hope It s true she kept asking It is true Ruth Do you love him as much as that More than I can tell you so much more Try to tell me then dear Talking of her love affair began to brighten the other girl and now she managed a wan smile His letters were very bad But between the lines I could read so much real manhood such simple honesty such a heart such a will to trust Ruth are you laughing at me No no far from that It s a thrilling thing to hear my dear For she was remembering that in another man there might be found these same qualities Not so much simplicity perhaps but to make up for it a great fire of will and driving energy But I didn t actually know that I was in love Even when I made the trip West and wrote to him to meet the train on my return even then I was only guessing When he didn t appear at the station I went cold and made up my mind that I would never think of him again But when you saw him in the street here John Mark had prepared me and hardened me against that meeting and I was afraid even to think for myself But when Ronicky Doone bless him talked to me in your room I knew what Bill Gregg must be since he had a friend who would venture as much for him as Ronicky Doone did It all came over me in a flash I did love him I did indeed Yes yes whispered Ruth Tolliver nodding and smiling faintly I remember how he stood there and talked to you He was like a man on fire No wonder that a spark caught in you Caroline He he s a very fine looking fellow don t you think Caroline Bill Gregg Yes indeed I mean Ronicky Of course Very handsome There was something in the voice of Caroline that made Ruth look down sharply to her face but the girl was clever enough to mask her excitement and delight Afterward when you think over what he has said it isn t a great deal but at the moment he seems to know a great deal about what s going on inside one don t you think Caroline These continual appeals for advice appeals from the infallible Ruth Tolliver set the heart of Caroline beating There was most certainly something in the wind I think he does agreed Caroline masking her eyes He has a way when he looks at you of making you feel that he isn t thinking of anything else in the world but you Does he have that same effect on every one asked Ruth She added after a moment of thought Yes I suppose it s just a habit of his I wish I knew Why queried Caroline unable to refrain from the stinging little question Oh for no good reason just that he s an odd character In my work you know one has to study character Ronicky Doone is a different sort of man don t you think Very different dear Then a great inspiration came to Caroline Ruth was a key which she knew could unlock nearly any door in the house of John Mark Do you know what we are going to do she asked gravely rising Well We re going to open that door together and we re going down the stairs together Together But we Don t you know John Mark has given orders That I m not to leave the room What difference does that make They won t dare stop us if you are with me leading the way Caroline are you mad When I come back You re not coming back Not coming back No you re going on with me She took Ruth by the arms and turned her until the light struck into her eyes Ruth Tolliver aghast at this sudden strength in one who had always been a meek follower obeyed without resistance But where she demanded Where I m going What To Ronicky Doone my dear Don t you see The insistence bewildered Ruth Tolliver She felt herself driven irresistibly forward with or without her own will Caroline she protested trying feebly to free herself from the commanding hands and eyes of her companion are you quite mad Go to him Why should I How can I Not as I m going to Bill Gregg with my heart in my hands but to ask Ronicky Doone bless him to take you away somewhere so that you can begin a new life Isn t that simple Ask charity of a stranger You know he isn t a stranger and you know it isn t charity He ll be happy He s the kind that s happy when he s being of use to others Yes answered Ruth Tolliver of course he is And you d trust him To the end of the world But to leave Ruth you ve kept cobwebs before your eyes so long that you don t see what s happening around you John Mark hypnotizes you He makes you think that the whole world is bad that we are simply making capital out of our crimes As a matter of fact the cold truth is that he has made me a thief Ruth and he has made you something almost as bad a gambler The follower had become the leader and she was urging Ruth Tolliver slowly to the door Ruth was protesting she could not throw herself on the kindness of Ronicky Doone it could not be done It would be literally throwing herself at his head But here the door opened and she allowed herself to be led out into the hall They had not made more than half a dozen steps down its dim length when the guard hurried toward them Talk to him whispered Caroline Smith He s come to stop me and you re the only person who can make him let me pass on The guard hurriedly came up to them Sorry he said Got an idea you re going downstairs Miss Smith Yes she said faintly The fellow grinned Not yet You ll stay up here till the chief gives the word And I got to ask you to step back into your room and step quick His voice grew harsh and he came closer He told me straight you re not to come out Caroline had shrunk back and she was on the verge of turning when the arm of Ruth was passed strongly around her shoulders and stayed her She s going with me she told John Mark s bulldog Does that make a difference to you He ducked his head and grinned feebly in his anxiety Sure it makes a difference You go where you want any time you want but this I say she s going with me and I m responsible for her She urged Caroline forward and the latter made a step only to find that she was directly confronted by the guard I got my orders he said desperately to Ruth Do you know who I am she asked hotly I know who you are he answered and believe me I would not start bothering you none but I got to keep this lady back I got the orders They re old orders insisted Ruth Tolliver and they have been changed Not to my knowing replied the other less certain in his manner Ruth seized the critical moment to say Walk on Caroline If he blocks your way She did not need to finish the sentence for as Caroline started on the guard slunk sullenly to one side of the corridor It ain t my doings he said But they got two bosses in this joint and one of them is a girl How can a gent have any idea which way he ought to step in a pinch Go on Miss Smith but you ll be answered for They hardly heard the last of these words as they turned down the stairway hurrying but not fast enough to excite the suspicion of the man behind them Oh Ruth whispered Caroline Smith Oh Ruth It was close said Ruth Tolliver but we re through And now that I m about to leave it I realize how I ve hated this life all these years I ll never stop thanking you for waking me up to it Caroline They reached the floor of the lower hall and a strange thought came to Ruth She had hurried home to execute the bidding of John Mark She had left it obeying the bidding of Ronicky Doone They scurried to the front door As they opened it the sharp gust of night air blew in on them and they heard the sound of a man running up the steps In a moment the dim hall light showed on the slender form and the pale face of John Mark standing before them Caroline felt the start of Ruth Tolliver For her part she was on the verge of collapse but a strong pressure from the hand of her companion told her that she had an ally in the time of need Tut tut Mark was saying what s this How did Caroline get out of her room and with you Ruth It s idiotic to keep her locked up there all day and all night in weather like this said Ruth with a perfect calm that restored Caroline s courage almost to the normal When I talked to her this evening I made up my mind that I d take her out for a walk Well replied John Mark that might not be so bad Let s step inside and talk it over for a moment They retreated and he entered and clicked the door behind him The main question is where do you intend to walk Just in the street below the house Which might not lead you across to the house on the other side Certainly not I shall be with her But suppose both of you go into that house and I lose two birds instead of one What of that my clever Ruth She knew at once by something in his voice rather than his words that he had managed to learn the tenor of the talk in Caroline s room She asked bluntly What are you guessing at Nothing I only speak of what I know No single pair of ears is enough for a busy man I have to hire help and I get it Very effective help too don t you agree Eavesdropping exclaimed Ruth bitterly Well it s true John Mark You sent me to steal her from her lover and I ve tried to steal her for him in the end Do you know why Because she was able to show me what a happy love might mean to a woman She showed me that and she showed me how much courage love had given her So I began to guess a good many things and among the rest I came to the conclusion that I could never truly love you John Mark I ve spoken quickly she went on at last It isn t that I have feared you all the time I haven t been playing a part John on my word Only tonight I learned something new Do you see Heaven be praised said John Mark that we all have the power of learning new things now and again I congratulate you Am I to suppose that Caroline was your teacher He turned from her and faced Caroline Smith and though he smiled on her there was a quality in the smile that shriveled her very soul with fear No matter what he might say or do this evening to establish himself in the better graces of the girl he was losing his malice was not dead That she knew She was my teacher answered Ruth steadily because she showed me John what a marvelous thing it is to be free You understand that all the years I have been with you I have never been free Not free he asked the first touch of emotion showing in his voice Not free my dear Was there ever the least wish of yours since you were a child that I did not gratify Not one Ruth not one surely of which I am conscious Because I had no wishes she answered slowly that were not suggested by something that you liked or disliked You were the starting point of all that I desired I was almost afraid to think until I became sure that you approved of my thinking That was long ago he said gravely Since those old days I see you have changed greatly Because of the education you gave me she answered Yes yes that was the great mistake I begin to see Heaven one might say gave you to me I felt that I must improve on the gift of Heaven before I accepted you There was my fault For that I must pay the great penalty Kismet And now what is it you wish To leave at once A little harsh but necessary if you will it There is the door free to you The change of identity of which I spoke to you is easily arranged I have only to take you to the bank and that is settled Is there anything else Only one thing and that is not much Very good You have given so much she ran on eagerly that you will give one thing more out of the goodness of that really big heart of yours John dear He winced under that pleasantly tender word And she said I want to take Caroline with me to freedom and the man she loves That is really all The lean fingers of John Mark drummed on the back of the chair while he smiled down on her an inexplicable expression on his face Only that he asked My dear how strange you women really are After all these years of study I should have thought that you would at least have partially comprehended me I see that is not to be But try to understand that I divide with a nice distinction the affairs of sentiment and the affairs of business There is only one element in my world of sentiment that is you Therefore ask what you want and take it for yourself but for Caroline that is an entirely different matter No Ruth you may take what you will for yourself but for her for any other living soul not a penny not a cent will I give Can you comprehend it Is it clear As for giving her freedom nothing under Heaven could persuade me to it Chapter Twenty four The Ultimate Sacrifice She stared at him as the blow fell and then her glance turned slowly to Caroline who had uttered a sharp cry and sunk into a chair Help me Ruth she implored pitifully No other person in the world can help me but you Do you see that asked Ruth quietly of John Mark and still it doesn t move you Not a hairbreadth my dear But isn t it absurd Suppose I have my freedom and I tell the police that in this house a girl against her will Tush my dear You really do not know me at all Do you think they can reach me She may be a hundred miles away before you have spoken ten words to the authorities But I warn you that all your holds on her are broken She knows that you have no holds over her brother She knows that Ronicky Doone has broken them all that Jerry is free of you Ronicky Doone said Mark his face turning gray is a talented man No doubt of it his is a very peculiar and incisive talent I admit But though he has broken all the old holds there are ways of finding new ones If you leave now I can even promise you my dear that before the next day dawns the very soul of Caroline will be a pawn in my hands Do you doubt it Such an exquisitely tender such a delicate soul as Caroline can you doubt that I can form invisible bonds which will hold her even when she is a thousand miles away from me Tush my dear think again and you will think better of my ability Suppose Ruth said I were to offer to stay He bowed You tempt me with such overwhelming generosity to become even more generous myself and set her free at once But alas I am essentially a practical man If you will stay with me Ruth if you marry me at once why then indeed this girl is as free as the wind Otherwise I should be a fool You see my dear I love you so that I must have you by fair means or foul but I cannot put any chain upon you except your own word I confess it you see even before this poor girl if she is capable of understanding which I doubt But speak again do you make the offer She hesitated and he went on Be careful I have had you once and I have lost you it seems If I have you again there is no power in you no power between earth and heaven to take you from me a second time Give yourself to me with a word and I shall make you mine forever Then Caroline shall go free free as the wind to her lover my dear who is waiting He made no step toward her and he kept his voice smooth and clear Had he done otherwise he knew that she would have shrunk She looked to him she looked to Caroline Smith The latter had suddenly raised her head and thrown out her hands with an unutterable appeal in her eyes At that mute appeal Ruth Tolliver surrendered It s enough she said I think there would be no place for me after all What could I do in the world except what you ve taught me to do No let Caroline go freely and I give my Stop He checked her with his raised hand and his eyes blazed and glittered in the dead whiteness of his face Don t give me your word my dear I don t want that chain to bind you There might come a time when some power arose strong enough to threaten to take you from me Then I want to show you that I don t need your promise I can hold you for myself Only come to me and tell me simply that you will be mine if you can Will you do that She crossed the room slowly and stood before him I will do that she said faintly half closing her eyes She had come so close that if he willed he could have taken her in his arms She nerved herself against it then she felt her hand taken raised and touched lightly against trembling lips When she stepped back she knew that the decisive moment of her life had been passed You are free to go said John Mark to Caroline Therefore don t wait Go at once Ruth whispered the girl Ruth Tolliver turned away and the movement brought Caroline beside her with a cry of pain Is it what I think she asked Are you making the sacrifice all for me You don t really care for him Ruth and Caroline broke in John Mark She turned at the command of that familiar voice as if she had been struck with a whip He had raised the curtain of the front window beside the door and was pointing up and across the street I see the window of Gregg s room he said A light has just appeared in it I suppose he is waiting But if you wish to go your time is short very short An infinite threat was behind the calmness of the voice She could only say to Ruth I ll never forget Then she fled down the hall and through the door and the two within heard the sharp patter of her heels as she ran down to the street It was freedom for Caroline and Ruth lifting her eyes looked into the face of the man she was to marry She could have held out she felt had it not been for the sound of those departing footsteps running so blithely toward a lifetime of happiness Even as it was she made herself hold out Then a vague astonishment came to clear her mind There was no joy in the face of John Mark only a deep and settled pain You see he said with a smile of anguish I have done it I have bought the thing I love and that you know is the last and deepest damnation If another man had told me that I was capable of such a thing I d have killed him on the spot But now I have done it I think I ll go up to my room she answered her eyes on the floor She made herself raise them to his Unless you wish to talk to me longer She saw him shudder If you can help it he said don t make me see the brand I have put on you Don t for Heaven s sake cringe to me if you can help it Very well she said He struck his clenched hand against his face It s the price he declared through his teeth and I accept it He spoke more to himself than to her and then directly Will you let me walk up with you Yes He took her passive arm They went slowly slowly up the stairs for at each landing it seemed her strength gave out and she had to pause for a brief rest when she paused he spoke with difficulty but with his heart in every word You remember the old Greek fable Ruth The story about all the pains and torments which flew out of Pandora s box and how Hope came out last that blessed Hope and healed the wounds Here a moment after the blow has fallen I am hoping again like a fool I am hoping that I shall teach you to forget or if I cannot teach you to forget than I shall even make you glad of what you have done tonight The door closed on her and she was alone Raising her head she found she was looking straight across the street to the lighted windows of the rooms of Ronicky Doone and Bill Gregg While she watched she saw the silhouette of a man and woman running to each other saw them clasped in each other s arms Ruth dropped to her knees and buried her face in her hands Chapter Twenty five Unhappy Freedom Once out in the street Caroline had cast one glance of terror over her shoulder at the towering facade of the house of John Mark then she fled as fast as her feet would carry her straight across the street and up the steps of the rooming house and frantically up the stairs a panic behind her Presently she was tapping hurriedly and loudly on a door while with her head turned she watched for the coming of some swift avenging figure from behind John Mark had given her up but it was impossible for John Mark to give up anything When would he strike That was the only question Then the door opened The very light that poured out into the dim hall was like the reach of a friendly hand and there was Ronicky Doone laughing for pure joy and there was Bill Gregg s haggard face as if he saw a ghost I told you Bill and here she is After that she forgot Ronicky Doone and the rest of the world except Gregg as he took her in his arms and asked over and over How did it come about How did it come about And over and over she answered It was Ronicky Bill We owe everything to him and Ruth Tolliver This brought from Ronicky a sudden question And what of her What of Ruth Tolliver She wouldn t come It pricked the bubble of Caroline s happiness that question Staring at the frowning face of Ronicky Doone her heart for a moment misgave her How could she tell the truth How could she admit her cowardice which had accepted Ruth s great sacrifice No she said at last Ruth stayed Talk about that afterward Ronicky pleaded Bill Gregg I got about a million things to say to Caroline I m going to talk now said Ronicky gravely They s something queer about the way Caroline said that Will you let me ask you a few more questions Won t you wait asked Caroline in an agony of remorse and shame Won t you wait till the morning Ronicky Doone walked up and down the room for a moment He had no wish to break in upon the long delayed happiness of these two While he paced he heard Bill Gregg saying that they must start at once and put three thousand miles between them and that devil John Mark and he heard Caroline say that there was no longer anything to fear the claws of the devil had been trimmed and he would not reach after them he had promised At that Ronicky whirled sharply on them again What made Mark change his mind about you he asked He isn t the sort to change his mind without a pretty good reason What bought him off Nothing but a price would change him I guess And she had to admit It was Ruth She paid the price he asked harshly How Caroline She promised to marry him Ronicky The bitter truth was coming now and she cringed as she spoke it The tall body of Ronicky Doone was trembling with excitement She made that promise so that you could go free Caroline No no exclaimed Bill Gregg It s true said the girl We were about to leave together when John Mark stopped us Ruth was coming with you asked Ronicky Yes And when Mark stopped you she offered herself in exchange for your freedom Y yes Both she and Bill Gregg looked apprehensively at the dark face of Ronicky Doone where a storm was gathering But he restrained his anger with a mighty effort She was going to cut away from that life and start over is that straight Caroline Yes Get the police Ronicky said Bill Gregg They sure can t hold no woman agin her will in this country Don t you see that it is her will asked Ronicky Doone darkly Ain t she made a bargain Don t you think she s ready and willing to live up to it She sure is son and she ll go the limit to do what she s said she ll do You stay here I ll go out and tackle the job Then I go too said Bill Gregg stoutly You been through enough for me Here s where I go as far as you go I m ready when you re ready Ronicky It was so just an offer that even Caroline dared not cry out against it but she sat with her hands clasped close together her eyes begging Ronicky to let the offer go Ronicky Doone nodded slowly I hoped you d say that Bill he said But I ll tell you what you stay here for a while and I ll trot down and take a look around and try to figure out what s to be done Can t just walk up and rap at the front door of the house you know And I can t go in the way I went before No doubt about that I got to step light So let me go out and look around will you Bill Then I ll come back and tell you what I ve decided Once in the street Ronicky looked dubiously across at the opposite house He realized that more than an hour had passed since Caroline had left John Mark s house What had happened to Ruth in that hour The front of the house was lighted in two or three windows but those lights could tell him nothing From the inside of the house he could locate Ruth s room again but from the outside it was impossible for him to do it The whole house of course was thoroughly guarded against his attack for attack they knew he would The only question was from what angle he would deliver his assault In that case of course the correct thing was to find the unexpected means But how could he outguess a band of trained criminals They would have foreseen far greater subtleties than any he could attempt They would be so keen that the best way to take them by surprise might be simply to step up to the house ring the door bell and enter if the door were opened The idea intrigued him at once They might be and no doubt were guarding every obscure cellar window every skylight To trick them was impossible but it was always possible to bluff any man even John Mark and his followers Straight across the street marched Ronicky Doone and up the steps of the opposite house and rang the bell not a timid ring but two sharp pressures such as would announce a man in a hurry a brisk man who did not wish to be delayed He took only one precaution pulling his hat down so that the black shadow of the brim would fall like a robber s mask across the upper part of his face Then he waited as a man both hurried and certain turning a little away from the door at an angle which still more effectually concealed him while he tapped impatiently with one foot Presently the door opened after he made certain that someone had looked out at him from the side window How much had they seen How much had they guessed as to the identity of this night visitor The softness of the opening of the door and the whisper of the wind as it rushed into the hall beyond were like a hiss of threatening secrecy And then from the shadow of that meager opening a voice was saying Who s there The very caution however reassured Ronicky Doone Had they suspected that it was he they would either have kept the door definitely closed or else they would have flung it open and boldly invited him in I want to see Harry Morgan quick he said and stepped close to the door At his bold approach the door was closed like the winking of an eye until it was barely an inch ajar Keep back came the warning through this small opening Keep clear bo Damnation exclaimed Ronicky What s the idea I want Harry I tell you Harry ain t here Just hand me that piece of paper over there and I ll write out the message said Ronicky pointing to the little table just beyond the doorman The latter turned with a growl and the moment he was halfway around Ronicky Doone sprang in His right arm fastened around the head of the unlucky warder and passing down to his throat crushed it in a strangle hold His other hand darting out in strong precision caught the right arm of the warder at the wrist and jerked it back between his shoulders In an instant he was effectively gagged and bound by those two movements and Ronicky Doone pausing for an instant to make sure of himself heard footsteps in the hall above It was too late to do what he had hoped yet he must take his prize out of the way For that purpose he half carried half dragged his victim through the doorway and into the adjoining room There he deposited him on the floor as near death as life Relaxing his hold on the man s throat he whipped out his Colt and tucked the cold muzzle under the chin of the other Now don t stir he said don t whisper don t move a muscle Partner I m Ronicky Doone Now talk quick Where s Ruth Tolliver Upstairs In her room Yes Ronicky started to rise then for there had been a slight fraction of a second s pause before the victim answered he changed his mind I ought to smash your head open for that lie he said at a random guess Tell me straight now where s Ruth Tolliver How can I tell if she ain t in her room Look said Ronicky Doone if anyone comes into the hall before you ve told me where the girl is you re dead partner That s straight now talk She s with Mark And where s he He d kill me if I tell Not if I find him before he finds you His killing days are ended Where s Mark and the girl Has he run off with her Yes They re married asked Ronicky feeling that it might be a wild goose chase after all I dunno But where are they Heaven help me then Ill tell you He began to whisper swiftly incoherently his voice shaking almost to silence as he reached the heart of his narrative Chapter Twenty six Hills and Sea The summerhouse lay in a valley between two hills resting on the lawn before it Ruth Tolliver lay with her head pillowed back between her hands and the broad brim of her straw that flopped down to shade her eyes She could look up on either side to the sweep of grass with the wind twinkling in it grass that rolled smoothly up to the gentle blue sky beyond On the one hand it was very near to her that film of blue but to her right the narrow bright heads of a young poplar grove pushed up beyond the hilltop and that made the sky fall back an immeasurable distance Not very much variety in that landscape but there was an infinite variety in the changes of the open air silence Overtones all of them but what a range If she found that what was immediately overhead and beside her was too bland if she wearied of that lovely drift of clouds across the sky then she had only to raise herself upon one elbow and look down to the broad white band of the earth and the startling blue of the ocean beyond She was a little way up among the hills to be sure but in spite of her elevation when she looked out toward the horizon it seemed that the sea was hollowed like a great bowl that the horizon wave was apt at any moment to roll in upon the beach and overwhelm her among the hills Not a very great excitement for such a girl as Ruth Tolliver to be sure Particularly when the faint crease between her eyes told of a perpetual worry and a strain under which she was now living She was trying to lose herself in forgetfulness in this open drowsy climate Behind her a leisurely step came down one of the garden paths It brought her to attention at once A shadow passed across her face and instantly she was sitting up alert and excited John Mark sat down cross legged beside her a very changed John Mark indeed He wore white trousers and low white shoes with a sack coat of blue a cool looking man even on this sultry day The cane which he insisted upon at all times he had planted between his knees to help in the process of lowering himself to the ground Now he hooked the head over his shoulder pushed back his hat and smiled at the girl Everything is finished he said calmly How well you look Ruth that hair of yours against the green grass Everything is finished the license and the clergyman will arrive here within the hour She shrugged her shoulders As a rule she tried at least to be politely acquiescent but now and then something in her revolted But John Mark was an artist in choosing remarks and moments which should not be noticed Apparently her silence made not even a ripple on the calm surface of his assurance He had been so perfectly diplomatic indeed during the whole affair that she had come to respect and fear him more than ever Even in that sudden midnight departure from the house in Beekman Place in that unaccountable panic which made him decide to flee from the vicinity of Ronicky Doone even in that critical moment he had made sure that there was a proper chaperon with them During all her years with him he had always taken meticulous care that she should be above the slightest breath of suspicion a strange thing when the work to which he had assigned her was considered Well he asked now that you ve seen how do you like it If you wish we ll move today after the ceremony It s only a temporary halting place or it can be a more or less permanent home just as you please It rather amused her to listen to this deprecatory manner of speech Of course she could direct him in small matters but in such a thing as the choice of a residence she knew that in the end he would absolutely have his own way I don t know she said I like silence just now I ll stay here as long as you re contented He pressed her hand very lightly it was the only time he had caressed her since they left New York and his hand left hers instantly Of course he explained I m glad to be at a distance for a time a place to which we can t be followed By Ronicky Doone Her question had sprung impulsively to her lips Exactly From the first he had been amazingly frank in confessing his fear of the Westerner Who else in the world would I care about for an instant Where no other has ever crossed me once successfully he has done so twice That you know makes me begin to feel that my fate is wrapped up in the young devil He shuddered at the thought as if a cold wind had struck him I think you need not worry about him said the girl faintly I suppose by this time he is in such a condition that he will never worry another soul in the world The other turned and looked at her for a long grave moment You think he attempted to break into the house And didn t you expect the same thing Why else did you leave New York I confess that was my idea but I think no harm has come to him The chances are nine out of ten at least that he has not been badly hurt She turned away her hands clenched hard Oh my honor he insisted with some emotion I gave directions that if he made an attack he was not to be harmed more than necessary to disarm him Knowing that to disarm him would mean to kill him Not at all After all he is not such a terrible fellow as that not at all my dear A blow a shot might have dropped him But unless it were followed by a second he would not be killed Single shots and single blows rarely kill you know She nodded more hopefully and then her eyes turned with a wide question upon her companion He answered it at once with the utmost frankness You wonder why I gave such orders when I dread Doone when I so dread Doone when I so heartily want him out of my way forever I ll tell you If Doone were killed there would be a shadow between us at once Not that I believe you love him no that cannot be He may have touched your heart but he cannot have convinced your head and you are equal parts of brain and soul my dear Therefore you cannot love him She controlled the faintest of smiles at the surety of his analysis He could never escape from an old conclusion that the girl must be in large part his own product he could never keep from attributing to her his own motives But just suppose she said that Ronicky Doone broke into your house forced one of your men to tell him where we are and then followed us at once He would be about due to arrive now What if all that happened He smiled at her If all that happened you are quite right he would be about due to arrive I suppose being a Westerner that the first thing he would do in the village would be to hire a horse to take him out here and he would come galloping yonder where you see that white road tossing over the hills And what if he does come she asked Then said John Mark very gravely he will indeed be in serious danger It will be the third time that he has threatened me And the third time You ve prepared even for his coming here she asked the thought tightening the muscles of her throat When you have such a man as Ronicky Doone on your hands he confessed you have to be ready for anything Yes I have prepared If he comes he ll come by the straightest route certain that we don t expect him He ll run blindly into the trap Yonder you see where the two hills almost close over the road yonder is Shorty Kruger behind the rocks waiting and watching A very good gunman is Shorty Know him Yes she said shuddering Of course I know him But even suppose that the he passes Kruger down there in the hollow where the road bends in toward us you can see Lefty himself I wired him to come and there he is Lefty asked the girl aghast Lefty himself said John Mark You see how much I respect Ronicky Doone s fighting properties Yes Lefty himself the great the infallible Lefty She turned her back on the white road which led from the village and faced the sea If we are down here long enough he said I ll have a little wharf built inside that cove You see Then we can bring up a motor boat and anchor it in there Do you know much about boats Almost nothing That s true but we ll correct it Between you and me if I had to choose between a boat and a horse I don t know which I should Two sharp detonations cut off his words While he raised a startled hand for silence they remained staring at one another and the long faint echoes rolled across the hills A revolver shot first far off he said and then a rifle shot That metallic clang always means a rifle shot He turned and she turned with him Covering their eyes from the white light of the sun they peered at the distant road where as he had pointed out the two hills leaned together and left a narrow footing between The miracle has happened said John Mark in a perfectly sober voice It is Ronicky Doone Chapter Twenty seven The Last Stand At the same instant she saw what his keener eye had discerned the moment before A small trail of dust was blowing down the road just below the place where the two hills leaned together Under it was the dimly discernible dust veiled form of a horseman riding at full speed Fate is against me said John Mark in his quiet way Why should this dare devil be destined to hunt me I can gain nothing by his death but your hate And if he succeeds in breaking through Lefty as he has broken through Kruger even then he shall win nothing I swear it As he spoke he looked at her in gloomy resolution but the girl was on fire fear and joy were fighting in her face In her ecstasy she was clinging to the man beside her Think of it think of it she exclaimed He has done what I said he would do Ah I read his mind Ronicky Doone Ronicky Doone was there ever your like under the wide wide sky He s brushed Kruger out of his way Not entirely said John Mark calmly not entirely you see As he spoke they heard again the unmistakable sound of a rifle shot and then another and another ringing from the place where the two hills leaned over the road It s Kruger declared John Mark calmly That chivalrous idiot Doone apparently shot him down and didn t wait to finish him Very clever work on his part but very sloppy However he seems to have wounded Kruger so badly that my gunman can t hit his mark For Ronicky Doone if it were indeed he was still galloping down the road more and more clearly discernible while the rifle firing behind him ceased Of course that firing will be the alarm for Lefty went on John Mark seeming to enjoy the spectacle before him as if it were a thing from which he was entirely detached And Lefty can make his choice Kruger was his pal If he wants to revenge the fall of Kruger he may shoot from behind a tree If not he ll shoot from the open and it will be an even fight The terror of it all the whole realization sprang up in the girl In a moment she was crying Stop him John for Heaven s sake find a way to stop him There is only one power that can turn the trick I m afraid answered John Mark That power is Lefty If he shoots Lefty he ll come straight toward us on his way to the house and if he sees you If he sees me he ll shoot me of course declared Mark She stared at him John she said I know you re brave but you won t try to face him I m fairly expert with a gun He added But it s good of you to be concerned about me I am concerned more than concerned John A woman has premonitions and I tell you I know as well as I know I m standing here that if you face Ronicky Doone you ll go down You re right replied Mark I fear that I have been too much of a specialist so I shall not face Doone Then start for the house and hurry Run away and leave you here The dust cloud and the figure of the rider in it were sweeping rapidly down on the grove in the hollow where Lefty waited And the girl was torn between three emotions Joy at the coming of the adventurer fear for him terror at the thought of his meeting with Mark It would be murder John I ll go with you if you ll start now No he said quietly I won t run Besides it is impossible for him to take you from me Impossible she asked What do you mean When the time comes you ll see Now he s nearly there watch The rider was in full view now driving his horse at a stretching gallop There was no doubt about the identity of the man They could not make out his face of course at that distance but something in the careless dash of his seat in the saddle something about the slender erect body cried out almost in words that this was Ronicky Doone A moment later the first treetops of the grove brushed across him and he was lost from view The girl buried her face in her hands then she looked up By this time he must have reached Lefty and yet there was no sound of shooting Had Lefty found discretion the better part of valor and let him go by unhindered But in that case the swift gallop of the horse would have borne the rider through the grove by this time What s happened she asked of John Mark What can have happened down there A very simple story said Mark Lefty as I feared has been more chivalrous than wise He has stepped out into the road and ordered Ronicky to stop and Ronicky has stopped Now he is sitting in his saddle looking down to Lefty and they are holding a parley very like two knights of the old days exchanging compliments before they try to cut each other s throats But even as he spoke there was the sound of a gun exploding and then a silence One shot one revolver shot said John Mark in his deadly calm voice It is as I said They drew at a signal and one of them proved far the faster It was a dead shot for only one was needed to end the battle One of them is standing the other lies dead under the shadow of that grove my dear Which is it Which is it asked the girl in a whisper Then she threw up her hands with a joyous cry Ronicky Doone Ronicky Ronicky Doone A horseman was breaking into view through the grove and now he rode out into full view below them unmistakably Ronicky Doone Even at that distance he heard the cry and throwing up his hand with a shout that tingled faintly up to them he spurred straight up the slope toward them Ruth Tolliver started forward but a hand closed over her wrist with a biting grip and brought her to a sudden halt She turned to find John Mark an automatic hanging loosely in his other hand His calm had gone and in his dead white face the eyes were rolling and gleaming and his set lips trembled You were right he said I cannot face him Not that I fear death but there would be a thousand damnations in it if I died knowing that he would have you after my eyes were closed I told you he could not take you not living my dear Dead he may have us both John said the girl staring and bewildered In the name of pity John in the name of all the goodness you have showed me don t do it He laughed wildly I am about to lose the one thing on earth I have ever cared for and still I can smile I am about to die by my own hand and still I can smile For the last time will you stand up like your old brave self Mercy she cried In Heaven s name Then have it as you are he said and she saw the sun flash on the steel and he raised the gun She closed her eyes waited heard the distant drumming of hoofs on the turf of the hillside Then she caught the report of a gun But it was strangely far away that sound She thought at first that the bullet must have numbed as it struck her Presently a shooting pain would pass through her body then death Opening her bewildered eyes she beheld John Mark staggering the automatic lying on the ground his hands clutching at his breast Then glancing to one side she saw the form of Ronicky Doone riding as fast as spur would urge his horse the long Colt balanced in his hand That then was the shot she had heard a long range chance shot when he saw what was happening on top of the hill So swift was Doone s coming that by the time she had reached her feet again he was beside her and they leaned over John Mark together As they did so Mark s eyes opened then they closed again as if with pain When he looked again his sight was clear As I expected he said dryly I see your faces together both together and actually wasting sympathy on me Tush tush So rich in happiness that you can waste time on me John said the girl on her knees and weeping beside him you know that I have always cared for you but as a brother John and not Really he said calmly you are wasting emotion I am not going to die and I wish you would put a bandage around me and send for some of the men at the house to carry me up there That bullet of yours by Harry a very pretty snap shot just raked across my breast as far as I can make out Perhaps it broke a bone or two but that s all Yes I am to have the pleasure of living His smile was ghastly thing and growing suddenly weak as if for the first time in his life he allowed his indomitable spirit to relax his head fell to one side and he lay in a limp faint Chapter Twenty eight Hope Deferred Time in six months brought the year to the early spring that time when even the mountain desert forgets its sternness for a month or two Six months had not made Bill Gregg rich from his mine but it had convinced him on the contrary that a man with a wife must have a sure income even if it be a small one He squatted on a small piece of land gathered a little herd and having thrown up a four room shack he and Caroline lived as happily as king and queen Not that domains were very large but from their hut on the hill they could look over a fine sweep of country which did not all belong to them to be sure but which they constantly promised themselves should one day be theirs It was the dull period of the afternoon the quiet waiting period which comes between three or four o clock and the sunset and Bill and his wife sat in the shadow of the mighty silver spruce before their door The great tree was really more of a home for them than the roof they had built to sleep under Presently Caroline stood up and pointed She s coming she said and looking down the hillside she smiled in anticipation The rider below them winding up the trail looked up and waved then urged her horse to a full gallop for the short remnant of the distance before her It was Ruth Tolliver who swung down from the saddle laughing and joyous from the ride A strangely changed Ruth she was She had turned to a brown beauty in the wind and the sun of the West a more buoyant and more graceful beauty She had accepted none of the offers of John Mark but leaving her old life entirely behind her as Ronicky Doone had suggested she went West to make her own living With Caroline and Bill Gregg she had found a home and her work was teaching the valley school half a dozen miles away Any mail asked Bill for she passed the distant group of mail boxes on her way to the school At that the face of the girl darkened One letter she said and I want you to read it aloud Caroline Then we ll all put our heads together and see if we can make out what it means She handed the letter to Caroline who shook it out It s from Ronicky she exclaimed It s from Ronicky said Ruth Tolliver gravely so gravely that the other two raised their heads and cast silent glances at her Caroline read aloud Dear Ruth I figure that I m overdue back at Bill s place by about a month By two months corrected Ruth soberly And I ve got to apologize to them and you for being so late Matter of fact I started right pronto to get back on time but something turned up You see I went broke Caroline dropped the letter with an exclamation Do you think he s gone back to gambling Ruth No said the girl He gave me his promise never to play for money again and a promise from Ronicky Doone is as good as minted gold It sure is agreed Bill Gregg Caroline went on with the letter I went broke because Pete Darnely was in a terrible hole having fallen out with his old man and Pete needed a lift Which of course I gave him pronto Pete being a fine gent There was an exclamation of impatience from Ruth Tolliver Isn t that like Ronicky Isn t that typical I m afraid it is said the other girl with a touch of sadness Dear old Ronicky but such a wild man She continued in the reading But I ve got a scheme on now by which I ll sure get a stake and come back and then you and me can get married as soon as you feel like saying the word The scheme is to find a lost mine A lost mine shouted Bill Gregg his practical miner s mind revolting at this idea My guns is Ronicky plumb nutty That s all he s got to do just find a lost mine Well if that ain t plenty may I never see a yearling ag in Find a lost mine went on Caroline her voice trembling between tears and laughter and sink a new shaft a couple of hundred feet to find where the old vein Sink a shaft a couple of hundred feet said Bill Gregg And him broke Where ll he get the money to sink the shaft When we begin to take out the pay dirt went on Caroline I ll either come or send for you and Hush up said Bill Gregg softly Caroline looked up and saw the tears streaming down the face of Ruth Tolliver I m so sorry poor dear she whispered going to the other girl But Ruth Tolliver shook her head I m only crying she said because it s so delightfully and beautifully and terribly like Ronicky to write such a letter and tell of such plans He s given away a lot of money to help some spendthrift and now he s gone to get more money by finding a lost mine But do you see what it means Caroline It means that he doesn t love me really Don t love you asked Bill Gregg Then he s a plumb fool Why Hush Bill put in Caroline You mustn t say that she added to Ruth Of course you have reason to be sad about it and angry too Sad perhaps but not angry said Ruth Tolliver How could I ever be really angry with Ronicky Hasn t he given me a chance to live a clean life Hasn t he given me this big free open West to live in And what would I be without Ronicky What would have happened to me in New York Oh no not angry But I ve simply waked up Caroline I see now that Ronicky never cared particularly about me He was simply in love with the danger of my position As a matter of fact I don t think he ever told me in so many words that he loved me I simply took it for granted because he did such things for me as even a man in love would not have done After the danger and uniqueness were gone Ronicky simply lost interest Don t say such things exclaimed Caroline It s true said Ruth steadily If he really wanted to come here well did you ever hear of anything Ronicky wanted that he didn t get Except money suggested Bill Gregg Well he even gets that but most generally he gives it away pretty pronto He d come like a bullet from a gun if he really wanted me said Ruth No the only way I can bring Ronicky is to surround myself with new dangers terrible dangers make myself a lost cause again Then Ronicky would come laughing and singing eager as ever Oh I think I know him And what are you going to do asked Caroline The only thing I can do said the other girl I m going to wait Far far north two horsemen came at that same moment to a splitting of the trail they rode The elder bearded man pointed ahead That s the roundabout way he said but it s sure the only safe way We ll travel there Ronicky eh Ronicky Doone lifted his head and his bay mare lifted her head at the same instant The two were strangely in touch with one another I dunno he said I ain t heard of anybody taking the short cut for years not since the big slide in the canyon But I got a feeling I d sort of like to try it Save a lot of time and give us a lot of fun Unless it breaks our necks Sure said Ronicky but you don t enjoy having your neck safe
