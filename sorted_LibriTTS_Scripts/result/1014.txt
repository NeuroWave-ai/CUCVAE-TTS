GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LURE OF THE DIM TRAILS Produced by Simon Page THE LURE OF THE DIM TRAILS By B M Bower CHAPTER I IN SEARCH OF THE WESTERN TONE What do you care anyway asked Reeve Howard philosophically It isn t as if you depended on the work for a living Why worry over the fact that a mere pastime fails to be financially a success You don t need to write Neither do you need to slave over those dry point things Thurston retorted in none the best humor with his comforter You ve an income bigger than mine yet you toil over Grecian nosed women with untidy hair as if each one meant a meal and a bed A meal and a bed that s good you must think I live like a king And I notice you hate like the mischief to fail even though Only I never have failed put in Reeve Howard with the amused complacency born of much adulation Thurston kicked a foot rest out of his way Well I have The fashion now is for swashbuckling tales with a haze of powder smoke rising to high heaven The public taste runs to gore and more gore and kidnappings of beautiful maidens bah Follow the fashion then if you must write Get out of your pink tea and orchid atmosphere and take your heroines out West away out beyond the Mississippi and let them be kidnapped Or New Mexico would do New Mexico is also beyond the Mississippi I believe Thurston hinted Perhaps it is What I mean is write what the public wants since you don t relish failure Why don t you do things about the plains It ought to be easy and you were born out there somewhere It should come natural I have Thurston sighed My last rejection states that the local color is weak and unconvincing Hang the local color The foot rest suffered again Reeve Howard was getting into his topcoat languidly as he did everything else The thing to do then he drawled is to go out and study up on it Get in touch with that country and your local color will convince Personally though I like those little society skits you do Skits exploded Thurston My last was a four part serial I never did a skit in my life Beg pardon which is more than you did after accusing my studies of having untidy hair Don t look so glum Phil Go out and learn your West a month or so will put you up to date and by Jove I half envy you the trip That is what put the idea into Thurston s head and as Thurston s ideas generally bore fruit of one sort or another he went out that very day and ordered from his tailor a complete riding outfit and because he was a good customer the tailor consented to rush the work It seemed to Thurston looking over cuts of the very latest styles in riding clothes that already he was breathing the atmosphere of the plains That night he stayed at home and dreamed of the West His memory coupled with what he had heard and idealized by his imagination conjured dim visions of what he had once known had known and forgotten of a land here men and conditions harked back to the raw foundations of civilization where wide plains flecked with sage brush and ribboned with faint brown trails spread away and away to a far sky line For Phil Thurston was range born if not range bred His father had chosen always to live out on the edge of things out where the trails of men are dim and far apart and the silent prairie bequeaths a heritage of distance hunger to her sons While he brooded grew a keen longing to see again the little town huddled under the bare brown hills that shut out the world to see the gay blanketed Indians who stole like painted shadows about the place and the broad river always hurrying away to the sunrise He had been afraid of the river and of the bare hills and the Indians He felt that his mother also had been afraid He pictured again and he picture was blurred and indistinct the day when strange men had brought his father mysteriously home men who were silent save for the shuffling of their feet and who carried their big hats awkwardly in their hands There had been a day of hushed voices and much weeping and gloom and he had been afraid to play Then they had carried his father as mysteriously away again and his mother had hugged him close and cried bitterly and long The rest was blank When one is only five the present quickly blurs what is past and he wondered that after all these years he should feel the grip of something very like homesickness and for something more than half forgotten But though he did not realize it in his veins flowed the adventurous blood of his father and to it the dim trails were calling In four days he set his face eagerly toward the dun deserts and the sage brush gray At Chicago a man took the upper berth in Thurston s section and settled into the seat with a deep sigh presumably of thankfulness Thurston with the quick eye of those who write observed the whiteness of his ungloved hands the coppery tan of cheeks and throat the clear keenness of his eyes and the four dimples in the crown of his soft gray hat and recognized him as a fine specimen of the Western type of farmer returning home from the stockman s Mecca After that he went calmly back to his magazine and forgot all about him Twenty miles out the stranger leaned forward and tapped him lightly on the knee Say I hate to interrupt yuh he began in a whimsical drawl evidently characteristic of the man but I d like to know where it is I ve seen yuh before Thurston glanced up impersonally hesitated between annoyance and a natural desire to be courteous and replied that he had no memory of any previous meeting Mebby not admitted the other and searched the face of Thurston with his keen eyes It came to Phil that they were also a bit wistful but he went unsympathetically back to his reading Five miles more and be touched Thurston again apologetically yet insistently Say he drawled ain t your name Thurston I ll bet a carload uh steers it is Bud Thurston And your home range is Fort Benton Phil stared and confessed to all but the Bud That s what me and your dad always called yuh the man asserted Well I ll be hanged But I knew it I knew I d run acrost yuh somewheres You re the dead image uh your dad Bill Thurston And me and Bill freighted together from Whoop up to Benton along in the seventies Before yuh was born we was chums I don t reckon you d remember me Hank Graves that used to pack yuh around on his back and fill yuh up on dried prunes when dried prunes was worth money Yuh used to call em frumes and Why it was me with your dad when the Indians pot shot him at Chimney Rock and it was me helped your mother straighten things up so she could pull out back where she come from She never took to the West much How is she Dead Too bad she was a mighty fine woman your mother was Well I ll be hanged Bud Thurston little tow headed Bud that used to holler for frumes if he seen me coming a mile off Doggone your measly hide where s all them pink apurns yuh used to wear He leaned back and laughed a silent inner convulsion of pure gladness Philip Thurston was generally speaking a conservative young man and one slow to make friends slower still to discard them He was astonished to feel a choky sensation in his throat and a stinging of eyelids and a leap in his blood To be thus taken possession of by a blunt speaking stranger not at all in his class to be addressed as Bud and informed that he once devoured dried prunes to be told Doggone your measly hide should have affronted him much Instead he seemed to be swept mysteriously back into the primitive past and to feel akin to this stranger with the drawl and the keen eyes It was the blood of his father coming to its own From that hour the two were friends Hank Graves in his whimsical drawl told Phil things about his father that made his blood tingle with pride his father whom he had almost forgotten yet who had lived bravely his life daring where other men quailed going steadfastly upon his way when other men hesitated So borne swiftly into the West they talked and the time seemed short The train had long since been racing noisily over the silent prairies spread invitingly with tender green great lonely inscrutable luring men with a spell as sure and as strong as is the spell of the sea The train reeled across a trestle that spanned a deep dry gash in the earth In the green bottom huddled a cluster of pygmy cattle and mounted men farther down were two white flakes of tents like huge snowflakes left unmelted in the green canyon That s the Lazy Eight my outfit Graves informed Thurston with the unconscious pride of possession pointing a forefinger as they whirled on I ve got to get off next station Yuh want to remember Bud the Lazy Eight s your home from now on We ll make a cow puncher of yuh in no time you ve got it in yuh or yuh wouldn t look so much like your dad And you can write stories about us all yuh want we won t kick The way I ve got the summer planned out you ll waller chin deep in material all yuh got to do is foller the Lazy Eight through till shipping time Thurston had not intended learning to be a cow puncher or following the Lazy Eight or any other hieroglyphic through till shipping time whenever that was But facing Hank Graves he had not the heart to tell him so or that he had planned to spend only a month or six weeks at most in the West gathering local color and perhaps a plot or two and a few types Thurston was great on types The train slowed at a little station with a dismal red section house in the immediate background and a red fronted saloon close beside Here we are cried Graves and I ain t sorry only I wisht you was going to stop right now But I ll look for yuh in three or four days at the outside So long Bud Remember the Lazy Eight s your hang out CHAPTER II LOCAL COLOR IN THE RAW For the rest of the way Thurston watched the green hills slide by and the greener hollows and gave himself up to visions of Fort Benton visions of creaking bull trains crawling slowly like giant brown worms up and down the long hill of many high piled bales of buffalo hides upon the river bank and clamorous little steamers churning up against the current the Fort Benton that had for many rushing miles filled and colored the speech of Hank Graves and stimulated his childish half memory But when he reached the place and wandered aimlessly about the streets the vision faded into half resentful realization that these things were no more forever For the bull trains a roundup outfit clattered noisily out of town and disappeared in an elusive dust cloud for the gay blanketed Indians slipping like painted shadows from view stray cow boys galloped into town slid from their saddles and clanked with dragging rowels into the nearest saloon or the post office Between whiles the town cuddled luxuriously down in the deep little valley and slept while the river undisturbed by pompous steamers murmured a lullaby It was not the Fort Benton he had come far to see so that on the second day he went away up the long hill that shut out the world and until the east bound train came from over the prairies paced the depot platform impatiently with never a vision to keep him company For a long time the gaze of Thurston clung fascinated to the wide prairie land feeling again the stir in his blood Then when a deep cut shut from him the sight of the wilderness he chanced to turn his head and looked straight into the clear blue gray eyes of a girl across the aisle Thurston considered himself immune from blue gray or any other eyes so that he permitted himself to regard her calmly and judicially his mind reverting to the fact that he would need a heroine to be kidnapped and wondering if she would do She was a Western girl he could tell that by the tan and by her various little departures from the Eastern styles such as doing her hair low rather than high Where he had been used to seeing the hair of woman piled high and skewered with many pins hers was brushed smoothly back smoothly save for little irresponsible waves here and there Thurston decided that the style was becoming to her He wondered if the fellow beside her were her brother

none	none	reminded himself sagely that brothers do not as a rule devote their time quite so assiduously to the entertainment of their sisters He could not stare at her forever and so he gave over his speculations and went back to the prairies Another hour and Thurston was stiffing a yawn when the coaches bumped sharply together and with wheels screeching protest as the brakes clutched them the train grinding protest in every joint came with a final heavy jar to a dead stop Thurston thought it was a wreck until out ahead came the sharp crackling of rifles A passenger behind him leaned out of the window and a bullet shattered the glass above his head he drew back hastily Some one hurried through the front vestibule the door was pushed unceremoniously open and a man a giant he seemed to Thurston stopped just inside glared down the length of the coach through slits in the black cloth over his face and bawled Hands up Thurston was so utterly surprised that his hands jerked themselves involuntarily above his head though he did not feel particularly frightened he was filled with a stupefied sort of curiosity to know what would come next The coach so far as he could see seemed filled with uplifted trembling hands so that he did not feel ashamed of his own The man behind him put up his hands with the other but one of them held a revolver that barked savagely and unexpectedly close against the car of Thurston Thurston ducked There was an echo from the front and the man behind who risked so much on one shot lurched into the aisle swaying uncertainly between the seats He of the mask fired again viciously and the other collapsed into a still awkwardly huddled heap on the floor The revolver dropped from his fingers and struck against Thurston s foot making him wince Thurston had never before seen death come to a man and the very suddenness of it unnerved him All his faculties were numbed before that terrible pitiless form in the door and the limp dead body at his feet in the aisle He did not even remember that here was the savage local color he had come far a seeking He quite forgot to improve the opportunity by making mental note of all the little convincing details as was his wont Presently he awoke to the realization of certain words spoken insistently close beside him He turned his eyes and saw that the girl her eyes staring straight before her her slim brown hands uplifted was yet commanding him imperiously her voice holding to that murmuring monotone more discreet than a whisper The gun drop down and get it He can t see to shoot for the seat in front Get the gun Get the gun was what she was saying Thurston looked at her helplessly imploringly In truth he had never fired a gun in all his peaceful life The gun get it and shoot Her eyes moved quickly in a cautious side long glance that commanded impatiently Her straight eyebrows drew together imperiously Then when he met her eyes with that same helpless look she said another word that hurt It was Coward Thurston looked down at the gun and at the huddled form A tiny river of blood was creeping toward him Already it had reached his foot and his shoe was red along the sole He moved his foot quickly away from it and shuddered Coward murmured the girl contemptuously again and a splotch of anger showed under the tan of her cheek Thurston caught his breath and wondered if he could do it he looked toward the door and thought how far it was to send a bullet straight when a man has never in all his life fired a gun And without looking he could see that horrible red stream creeping toward him like some monster in a nightmare His flesh crimpled with physical repulsion but he meant to try perhaps he could shoot the man in the mask so that there would be another huddled lifeless Thing on the floor and another creeping red stream At that instant the tawny haired young fellow beside the girl gathered himself for a spring flung himself headlong before her and into the aisle caught the dead man s pistol from the floor and fired seemingly with one movement Then he sprang up still firing as fast as the trigger could move From the door came answer shot for shot and the car was filled with the stifling odor of burnt powder A woman screamed hysterically Then a puff of cool prairie breeze came in through the shattered window behind Thurston and the smoke cloud lifted like a curtain blown upward in the wind The tawny haired young fellow was walking coolly down the aisle the smoking revolver pointing like an accusing finger toward the outlaw who lay stretched upon his face his fingers twitching Outside rifles were crackling like corn in a giant popper Presently it slackened to an occasional shot A brakeman followed by two coatless mail clerks with Winchesters ran down the length of the train calling out that there was no danger The thud of their running feet and the wholesome mingling of their shouting struck sharply in the silence after the shooting One of the men swung up on the steps of the day coach and came in Hello

none	none	he cried to the tawny haired boy Got one did yuh That s good We did too got him alive Think uh the nerve uh that Wagner bunch to go up against a train in broad daylight Made an easy getaway too except the feller we gloomed in the express car How s this one Dead No I reckon he ll get well enough to stretch a rope he killed a man in here He motioned toward the huddled figure in the aisle They came together lifted the dead man and carried him away to the baggage car A brakeman came with a cloth and wiped up the red pool and Thurston pressed his lips tightly together and turned away his head he could not remember when the sight of anything had made him so deathly sick Once he glanced slyly at the girl opposite and saw that she was very white under her tan and that the hands in her lap were clasped tightly and yet shook But she met his eyes squarely and Thurston did not look at her again he did not like the expression of her mouth News of the holdup had been telegraphed ahead and all Shellanne which was not much of a crowd gathered at the station to meet the train and congratulate the heroes Thurston alighted almost shamefacedly into the midst of the loud voiced commotion While he was looking uncertainly about him wondering where to go and what to do a voice he knew hailed him with drawling welcome Hello Bud Got back quicker than you expected didn t yuh It s lucky I happened to be in town yuh can ride out with me Say yuh got quite a bunch uh local color for a story didn t yuh You ll be writing blood and thunder for a month on the strength of this little episode I reckon his twinkling eyes teased though his face was quite serious as was his voice She of the blue gray eyes turned and measured Thurston with a deliberate leisurely glance and her mouth still had that unpleasant expression Thurston colored guiltily but Hank Graves lifted his hat and called her Mona and asked her if she wasn t scared stiff and if she were home to
7705_101580_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 stay 
none	none	Then he beckoned to the tawny haired fellow with his finger and winked at Mona a proceeding which shocked Thurston considerably Mona here hold on a minute can t yuh Mona this is a friend uh mine Bud Thurston s his name He s come out to study us up and round up a hunch uh real Western atmosphere He s a story writer I used to whack bulls all over the country with his father Bud this is Mona Stevens she ranges down close to the Lazy Eight so the sooner yuh git acquainted the quicker He did not explain what would be the quicker and Thurston s embarrassment was only aggravated by the introduction Miss Stevens gave him a chilly smile the kind that is worse than none at all and turned her back thinly pretending that she heard her brother calling her which she did not Her brother was loudly explaining what would have happened if he had been on that train and had got a whack at the robbers and his sister was far from his mind Graves slapped the shoulder of the fellow they had called Park You young devil next time I leave the place for a week yes or overnight I ll lock yuh up in the blacksmith shop Have yuh got to be Mona s special escort these days Wish I was Park retorted unmoved Different here yuh ain t much account as it is Bud this here s my wagon boss Park Holloway one of em that is I m going to turn yuh over to him and let him wise yuh up Say you young bucks ought to get along together pretty smooth Your dads run buffalo together before either of yuh was born Well let s be moving we ain t home yet Got a war bag Bud Late that night Thurston lay upon a home made bed and listened to the frogs croaking monotonously in the hollow behind the house and to the lone coyote which harped upon the subject of his wrongs away on a distant hillside and to the subdued snoring of Hank Graves in the room beyond He was trying to adjust himself to this new condition of things and the new condition refused utterly to be measured by his accepted standard According to that standard he should feel repulsed and annoyed by the familiarity of strangers who persisted in calling him Bud without taking the trouble to find out whether or not he liked it And what puzzled Thurston and put him all at sea was the consciousness that he did like it and that it struck familiarly upon his ears as something to which he had been accustomed in the past Also according to his well ordered past he should hate this raw life and rawer country where could occur such brutal things as he had that day witnessed He should dislike a man like Park Holloway who having wounded a man unto death had calmly dismissed the subject with the regret that his aim had not been better so that he could have saved the county the expense of trying and hanging the fellow Thurston was amazed to find that down in the inner man of him he admired Park Holloway exceedingly and privately resolved to perfect himself in the use of fire arms he who had been wont to deplore the thinly veneered savagery of men who liked such things After much speculation he decided that Mona Stevens would not do for a kidnapped heroine He could not seem to see her in such a position and besides he told himself that such a type of girl did not attract him at all She had called him a coward and why simply because he straight from the trammels of civilization had not been prepared to meet the situation thrust upon him which she had thrust upon him She had demanded of him something he had not the power to accomplish and she had called him a coward And in his heart Thurston knew that it was unjust and that he was not a coward CHAPTER III FIRST IMPRESSIONS Thurston dressed immaculately in riding clothes of the latest English cut went airily down the stairs and discovered that he was not early as he had imagined Seven o clock he had told himself proudly was not bad for a beginner and he had smiled in anticipation of Hank Graves surprise which was fortunate since he would otherwise have been cheated of smiling at all For Hank Graves he learned from the cook had eaten breakfast at five and had left the ranch more than an hour before the men also were scattered to their work Properly humbled in spirit he sat down to the kitchen table and ate his belated breakfast while the cook kneaded bread at the other end of the same table and eyed Thurston with frank amusement Thurston had never before been conscious of feeling ill at ease in the presence of a servant and hurried through the meal so that he could escape into the clear sunshine feeling a bit foolish in the unaccustomed bagginess of his riding breeches and the snugness of his leggings for he had never taken to outdoor sports except as an onlooker from the shade of a grand stand or piazza While he was debating the wisdom of writing a detailed description of yesterday s tragedy while it was still fresh in his mind and stowing it away for future color Park Holloway rode into the yard and on to the stables He nodded at Thurston and grinned without apparent cause as the cook had done Thurston followed him to the corral and watched him pull the saddle off his horse and throw it carelessly to one side It looked cumbersome that saddle quite unlike the ones he had inspected in the New York shops He grasped the horn lifted upon it and said Jove Heavy ain t it Park laughed and slipped the bridle down over the ears of his horse and dismissed him with a slap on the rump Don t yuh like the looks of it he added indulgently Thurston engaged in wondering what all those little strings were for felt the indulgence and straightened How should I know he retorted Anyone can see that my ignorance is absolute I expect you to laugh at me mister Holloway Call me Park said he of the tawny hair and leaned against the fence looking extremely boyish and utterly incapable of walking calmly down upon a barking revolver and shooting as he went You re bound to learn all about saddles and what they re made for he went on So long as yuh don t get swell headed the first time yuh stick on a horse that side steps a little or back down from a few hard knocks you ll be all right Thurston had not intended getting out and actually living the life he had come to observe but something got in his nerves and his blood and bred an impulse to which he yielded without reserve Park see here he said eagerly Graves said he d turn me over to you so you could er teach me wisdom It s deuced rough on you but I hope you won t refuse to be bothered with me I want to learn everything And I want you to find fault like the mischief and er knock me into shape if it s possible He was very modest over his ignorance and his voice rang true Park studied him gravely Bud he said at last you ll do You re greener right now than a blue joint meadow in June but yuh got the right stuff in yuh and it s a go with me You come along with us after that trail herd and you ll get knocked into shape fast enough Smoke Thurston shook his head Not those I dunno I m afraid yuh can t be the real thing unless yuh fan your lungs with cigarette smoke regular The twinkle belied him though Say where did you pick them bloomers They were made in New York Thurston smiled in sickly fashion He had all along been uncomfortably aware of the sharp contrast between his own modish attire and the somewhat disreputable leathern chaps of his host s foreman Well commented Park you told me to find fault like the mischief and I m going to call your bluff This here s Montana recollect and I raise the long howl over them habiliments The best thing you can do is pace along to the house and discard before the boys get sight of yuh They d queer yuh with the whole outfit sure Uh course he went on soothingly when he saw the resentment in Thurston s eyes I expect they re real stylish back East but the boys ain t educated to stand for anything like that they d likely tell yuh they set like the hide on the hind legs of an elephant which is a fact I hate to say it Kid but they sure do look like the devil So would you in New York Thurston flung back at him Why sure But this ain t New York this here s the Lazy Eight corral and I m doing yuh a favor You wouldn t like to have the boys shooting holes through the slack would yuh You amble right along and get some pants on and when you ve wised up some you ll thank me a lot I m going on a little jaunt down the creek before dinner and you might go along you ll need to get hardened to the saddle anyway before we start for Billings or you ll do most uh riding on the mess wagon Thurston albeit in resentful mood went meekly and did as he was commanded to do and no man save Park and the cook ever glimpsed those smart riding clothes of English cut Now yuh look a heap more human was the way Park signified his approval of the change Here s a little horse that s easy to ride and dead gentle if yuh don t spur him in the neck which you ain t liable to do at present and Hank says you can have this saddle for keeps Hank used to ride it but he out growed it and got one longer in the seat When we start for Billings to trail up them cattle of course you ll get a string of your own to ride A string I m afraid I don t quite understand Yuh don t savvy riding a string A string m son is ten or a dozen saddle horses that yuh ride turn about and nobody else has got any right to top one every fellow has got his own string yuh see Thurston eyed his horse distrustfully I think he ventured one will be enough for me I ll scarcely need a dozen The truth was that he thought Park was laughing at him Park slid sidewise in the saddle and proceeded to roll another cigarette I d be willing to bet that by fall you ll have a good sized string rode down to a whisper You wait wait till it gets in your blood Why I d die if you took me off the range Wait till yuh set out in the dark on your horse and count the stars and watch the big dipper swing around towards morning and listen to the cattle breathing close by sleeping while you ride around em playing guardian angel over their dreams Wait till yuh get up at daybreak and are in the saddle with the pink uh sunrise and know you ll sleep fifteen or twenty miles from there that night and yuh lay down at night with the smell of new grass in your nostrils where your bed had bruised it Why Bud if you re a man you ll be plumb spoiled for your little old East Then he swung back his feet and the horses broke into a lope which jarred the unaccustomed frame of Thurston mightily though he kept the pace doggedly I ve got to go down to the Stevens place Park informed him You met Mona yesterday it was her come down on the train with me yuh remember Thurston did remember very distinctly Hank says yuh compose stories Is that right Thurston s mind came back from wondering how Mona Stevens mouth looked when she was pleased with one and he nodded Well there s a lot in this country that ain t ever been wrote about I guess at least if it was I never read it and I read considerable But the trouble is them that know ain t in the writing business and them that write don t know The way I ve figured it they set back East somewhere and write it like they think maybe it is and it s a hell of a job they make of it Thurston remembering the time when he too set back East and wrote it like he thought maybe it was blushed guiltily He was thankful that his stories of the West had without exception been rejected as of little worth He shuddered to think of one of them falling into the hands of Park Holloway I came out to learn and I want to learn it thoroughly he said in the face of much physical discomfort Just then the horses slowed for a climb and he breathed thanks In the first place he began again when he had readjusted himself carefully in the saddle I wish you d tell me just where you are going with the wagons and what you mean by trailing a herd Why I thought I said we were going to Billings Park answered surprised What we re going to do when we get there is to receive a shipment of cattle young steer that s coming up from the Panhandle which is a part uh Texas And we trail em up here and turn em loose this side the river After that we ll start the calf roundup The Lazy Eight runs two wagons yuh know I run one and Deacon Smith runs the other we work together though most of the time It makes quite a crew twenty five or thirty men I didn t know said Thurston dubiously that you ever shipped cattle into this country I supposed you shipped them out Is mister Graves buying some Hank I guess yes six thousand head uh yearlings and two year olds this spring some seasons it s more We get in young stock every year and turn em loose on the range till they re ready to ship It s cheaper than raising calves yuh know When yuh get to Billings Bud you ll see some cattle Why our bunch alone will make seven trains and that ain t a commencement Cattle s cheap down South this year and seems like everybody s buying Hank didn t buy as much as some because he runs quite a bunch uh cows we ll brand six or seven thousand calves this spring Hank sure knows how to rake in the coin Thurston agreed as politely as he could for the jolting They had again struck the level and seven miles at Park s usual pace was heartbreaking to a man not accustomed to the saddle Thurston had written just before leaving home a musical bit of verse born of his luring dreams about the joy of speeding fleetly where the grassland meets the sky and he was gritting his teeth now over the idiotic lines When they reached the ranch and Mona s mother came to the door and invited them in he declined almost rudely for he had a feeling that once out of the saddle he would have difficulty in getting into it again Besides Mona was not at home according to her mother So they did not tarry and Thurston reached the Lazy Eight alive but with the glamour quite gone from his West If he had not been the son of his father he would have taken the first train which pointed its nose to the East and he would never again have essayed the writing of Western stories or musical verse which sung the joys of galloping blithely off to the sky line He had just been galloping off to a sky line that was always just before and he had not been blithe nor did the memory of it charm Of a truth the very thought of things Western made him swear mild city bred oaths He choked back his awe of the cook and asked him quite humbly what was good to take the soreness from one s muscles afterward he had crept painfully up the stairs clasping to his bosom a beer bottle filled with pungent home made liniment which the cook had gravely declared out uh sight for saddle galls Hank Graves when he heard the story with artistic touches from the cook slapped his thigh and laughed one of his soundless chuckles The son of a gun He s the right stuff Never whined eh I knew it He s his dad over again from the ground up And loved him the better CHAPTER IV THE TRAIL HERD Thurston tucked the bulb of his camera down beside the bellows and closed the box with a snap I wonder what old Reeve would say to that view he mused aloud Old who Oh a fellow back in New York Jove he d throw up his dry point heads and take to oils and landscapes if he could see this The this was a panoramic view of the town and surrounding valley of Billings The day was sunlit and still and far objects stood up with sharp outlines in the clear atmosphere Here and there the white tents of waiting trail outfits splotched the bright green of the prairie Horsemen galloped to and from the town at top speed and a long grimy red stock train had just snorted out on a siding by the stockyards where the bellowing of thirsty cattle came faintly like the roar of pounding surf in the distance Thurston quite a different Thurston from the trim pale young man who had followed the lure of the West two weeks before drew a long breath and looked out over the hurrying waters of the Yellowstone It was good to be alive and young and to live the tented life of the plains it was good even to be speeding fleetly where the grassland meets the sky for two weeks in the saddle had changed considerably his view point He turned again to the dust and roar of the stockyards a mile or so away Perhaps he remarked hopefully the next train will be ours Strange how soon a man may identify himself with new conditions and new aims He had come West to look upon the life from the outside and now his chief thought was of the coming steers which he referred to unblushingly as our cattle Such is the spell of the range Let s ride on over Bud Park proposed That s likely the Circle Bar shipment Their bunch comes from the same place ours does and I want to see how they stack up Thurston agreed and went to saddle up He had mastered the art of saddling and could on lucky days and when he was in what he called form rope the horse he wanted to say nothing of the times when his loop settled unexpectedly over the wrong victim Park Holloway for instance who once got it neatly under his chin much to his disgust and the astonishment of Thurston I m going to take my Kodak said he I like to watch them unload and I can get some good pictures with this sunlight When you ve hollered em up and down the chutes as many times as I have Park told him yuh won t need no pictures to help yuh remember what it s like It was an old story with Park and Thurston s enthusiasm struck him as a bit funny He perched upon a corner of the fence out of the way and smoked cigarettes while he watched the cattle and shouted pleasantries to the men who prodded and swore and gesticulated at the wild eyed huddle in the pens Soon his turn would come but just now he was content to look on and take his ease For the life of me cried Thurston sidling gingerly over to him I can t see where they all come from For two days these yards have never been empty The country will soon be one vast herd Two days huh this thing ll go on for weeks m son And after all is over you ll wonder where the dickens they all went to Montana is some bigger than you realize I guess And next fall when shipping starts you ll think you re seeing raw porterhouse steaks for the whole world Let s drift out uh this dust you ll have time to get a carload uh pictures before our bunch rolls in As a matter of fact it was two weeks before the Lazy Eight consignment arrived Thurston haunted the stockyards with his Kodak but after the first two or three days he took no pictures For every day was but a repetition of those that had gone before a great grimy engine shunting cars back and forth on the siding an endless stream of weary young cattle flowing down the steep chutes into the pens from the pens to the branding chutes where they were burned deep with the mark of their new owners then out through the great gate crowding pushing wild to flee from restraint yet held in and guided by mounted cowboys out upon the green prairie where they could feast once more upon sweet grasses and drink their fill from the river of clear mountain water out upon the weary march of the trail on and on for long days until some boundary which their drivers hailed with joy was passed and they were free at last to roam at will over the wind brushed range land to lie down in some cool sweet scented swale and chew their cuds in peace Two weeks and then came a telegram for Park In the reading of it he shuffled off his attitude of boyish irresponsibility and became in a breath the cool business like leader of men Holding the envelope still in his hand he sought out Thurston who was practicing with a rope As Park approached him he whirled the noose and cast it neatly over the peak of the night hawk s teepee Good shot Park encouraged but I d advise yuh to take another target You ll have the tent down over Scotty s ears and then you ll think yuh stirred up a mess uh hornets Say Bud our cattle are coming and I m going to be short uh men If you d like a job I ll take yuh on and take chances on licking yuh into shape Maybe the wages won t appeal to yuh but I m willing to throw in heaps uh valuable experience that won t cost yuh a cent He lowered an eyelid toward the cook tent although no one was visible Thurston studied the matter while he coiled his rope and no longer Secretly he had wanted all along to be a part of the life instead of an onlooker I ll take the job Park if you think I can hold it down The speech would doubtless have astonished Reeve Howard in more ways than one but Reeve Howard was already a part of the past in Thurston s mind He was for living the present Well Park retorted it ll be your own funeral if yuh get fired Better stake yourself to a pair uh chaps you ll need em on the trip Also a large rainbow hued silk handkerchief if I want to look the part Thurston bantered If yuh don t want your darned neck blistered yuh mean Park flung over his shoulders Your wages and schooling start in to morrow at sunup It was early in the morning when the first train arrived hungry thirsty tired bawling a general protest against fate and man s mode of travel Thurston with a long pole in his hand stood on the narrow plank near the top of a chute wall and prodded vaguely at an endless moving incline of backs Incidentally he took his cue from his neighbors and shouted till his voice was a croak though he could not see that he accomplished anything either by his prodding or his shouting Below him surged the sea of hide and horns which was barely suggestive of the animals as individuals Out in the corrals the dust cloud hung low just as it had hovered every day for more than two weeks just as it would hover every day for two weeks longer Across the yards near the big outer gate Deacon Smith s crew was already beginning to brand The first train was barely unloaded when the second trailed in and out on the siding and so the third came also Then came a lull for the consignment had been split in two and the second section was several hours behind the first Thurston rode out to camp aching with the strain and ravenously hungry after toiling with his muscles for the first time in his life for his had been days of physical ease He had yet to learn the art of working so that every movement counted something accomplished as did the others besides he had been in constant fear of losing his hold on the fence and plunging headlong amongst the trampling hoofs below a fate that he shuddered to contemplate He did not however mention that fear or his muscle ache to any man he might be green but he was not the man to whine When he went back into the dust and roar Park ordered him curtly to tend the branding fire since both crews would brand that afternoon and get the corrals cleared for the next shipment Thurston thanked Park mentally tending branding fire sounded very much like child s play Soon the gray dust cloud took on a shade of blue in places where the smoke from the fires cut through a new tang smote the nostrils the rank odor of burning hair and searing hides a new note crept into the clamoring roar the low keyed blat of pain and fright Thurston turned away his head from the sight and the smell and piled on wood until Park stopped him with Say Bud we ain t celebrating any election It ain t a bonfire we want it s heat just keep her going and save wood all yuh can After an hour of fire tending Thurston decided that there were things more wearisome than hollering em down the chutes His eyes were smarting intolerably with smoke and heat and the smell of the branding was not nice but through the long afternoon he stuck to the work shrewdly guessing that the others were not having any fun either Park and the Deacon worked as hard as any branding the steers as they were squeezed one by one fast in the little branding chutes The setting sun shone redly through the smoke before Thurston was free to kick the half burnt sticks apart and pour water upon them as directed by Park Think yuh earned your little old dollar and thirty three cents Bud Park asked him And Thurston smiled a tired sooty smile that seemed all teeth I hope so at any rate I have a deep inner knowledge of the joys of branding cattle Wait till yuh burn Lazy Eights on wriggling blatting calves for two or three hours at a stretch before yuh talk about the joys uh branding Park rubbed eloquently his aching biceps At dusk Thurston crept into his blankets feeling that he would like the night to be at least thirty six hours long He was just settling into a luxurious leather upholstered dream chair preparatory to telling Reeve Howard his Western experiences when Park s voice bellowed into the tent Roll out boys we got a train pulling in There was hurried dressing in the dark of the bed tent hasty mounting and a hastier ride through the cool night air There were long hours at the chutes prodding down at a wavering line of moving shadows while the big dipper hung bright in the sky and lighted lanterns bobbed back and forth along the train waving signals to one another At intervals Park s voice cut crisply through the turmoil giving orders to men whom he could not see The east was lightening to a pale yellow when the men climbed at last into their saddles and galloped out to camp for a hurried breakfast Thurston had been comforting his aching body with the promise of rest and sleep but three thousand cattle were milling impatiently in the stockyards so presently he found himself fanning a sickly little blaze with his hat while he endeavored to keep the smoke from his tired eyes Of a truth Reeve Howard would have stared mightily at sight of him Once Park passing by smiled down upon him grimly Here s where yuh get the real thing in local color he taunted but Thurston was too busy to answer The stress of living had dimmed his eye for the picturesque That night one Philip Thurston slept as sleeps the dead But he awoke with the others and thanked the Lord there were no more cattle to unload and brand When he went out on day herd that afternoon he fancied that he was getting into the midst of things and taking his place with the veterans He would have been filled with resentment had he suspected the truth that Park carefully eased those first days of his novitiate That was why none of the night guarding fell to him until they had left Billings many miles behind them CHAPTER V THE STORM The third night he was detailed to stand with Bob MacGregor on the middle guard which lasts from eleven o clock until two The outfit had camped near the head of a long shallow basin that had a creek running through down the winding banks of it lay the white tented camps of seven other trail herds the cattle making great brown blotches against the green at sundown Thurston hoped they would all be there in the morning when the sun came up so that he could get a picture Aw they ll be miles away by then Bob assured him unfeelingly By the signs you can take snap shots by lightning in another hour Got your slicker Bud Thurston said he hadn t and Bob shook his head prophetically You ll sure wish yuh had it before yuh hit camp again when yuh get wise you ll ride with your slicker behind the cantle rain or shine They ll need singing to to night Thurston prudently kept silent since he knew nothing whatever about it and Bob gave him minute directions about riding his rounds and how to turn a stray animal back into the herd without disturbing the others The man they relieved met them silently and rode away to camp Off to the right an animal coughed and a black shape moved out from the shadows Bob swung towards it and the shape melted again into the splotch of shade which was the sleeping herd He motioned to the left Yuh can go that way and yuh want to sing something or whistle so they ll know what yuh are His tone was subdued as it had not been before He seemed to drift away into the darkness and soon his voice rose away across the herd singing As he drew nearer Thurston caught the words at first disjointed and indistinct then plainer as they met It was a song he had never heard before because its first popularity had swept far below his social plane She s o only a bird in a gil ded cage A beautiful sight to see e e You may think she seems ha a aappy and free from ca a re The singer passed on and away and only the high notes floated across to Thurston who whistled softly under his breath while he listened Then as they neared again on the second round the words came pensively Her beauty was so o old For an old man s go o old She s a bird in a gilded ca a age Thurston rode slowly like one in a dream and the lure of the range land was strong upon him The deep breathing of three thousand sleeping cattle the strong animal odor the black night which grew each moment blacker and the rhythmic ebb and flow of the clear untrained voice of a cowboy singing to his charge If he could put it into words if he could but picture the broody stillness with frogs cr ekk er ekking along the reedy creek bank and a coyote yapping weirdly upon a distant hilltop From the southwest came mutterings half defiant and ominous A breeze whispered something to the grasses as it crept away down the valley I stood in a church yard just at ee eve While the sunset adorned the west It was Bob drawing close out of the night You re doing fine Kid keep her a going he commended in an undertone as he passed and Thurston moistened his unaccustomed lips and began industriously whistling The Heart Bowed Down and from that jumped to Faust Fifteen minutes exhausted his memory of the whistleable parts and he was not given to tiresome repetitions He stopped for a moment and Bob s voice chanted admonishingly from somewhere Keep her a go o ing Bud old boy So Thurston took breath and began on The Holy City and came near laughing at the incongruity of the song only he remembered that he must not frighten the cattle and checked the impulse Say Bob began when he came near enough do yuh know the words uh that piece It s a peach I wisht you d sing it He rode on still humming the woes of the lady who married for gold Thurston obeyed while the high piled thunder heads rumbled deep accompaniment like the resonant lower tones of a bass viol Last night I lay a sleeping there came a dream so fair I stood in old Jerusalem beside the temple there A steer stepped restlessly out of the herd and Thurston s horse trained to the work of his own accord turned him gently back I heard the children singing and ever as they sang Me thought the voice of angels from heaven in answer rang From the west the thunder boomed drowning the words in its deep throated growl Jerusalem Jerusalem lift up your gates and sing Hit her up a little faster Bud or we ll lose some They re getting on their feet with that thunder Sunfish in answer to Thurston s touch on the reins quickened to a trot The joggling was not conducive to the best vocal expression but the singer persevered Hosanna in the highest Hosanna to your King Flash the lightning cut through the storm clouds and Bob who had contented himself with a subdued whistling while he listened took up the refrain Jerusalem Jerusalem It was as if a battery of heavy field pieces boomed overhead The entire herd was on its feet and stood close huddled their tails to the coming storm Now the horses were loping steadily in their endless circling a pace they could hold for hours if need be For one blinding instant Thurston saw far down the valley then the black curtain dropped as suddenly as it had lifted Keep a hollering Bud came the command and after it Bob s voice trilled high above the thunder growl Hosanna in the high est Hosanna to your King A strange thrill of excitement came to Thurston It was all new to him for his life had been sheltered from the rages of nature He had never before been out under the night sky when it was threatening as now He flinched when came an ear splitting crash that once again lifted the black curtain and showed him white lighted the plain In the dark that followed came a rhythmic thud of hoofs far up the creek and the rattle of living castanets Sunfish threw up his head and listened muscles a quiver There s a bunch a running called Bob from across the frightened herd If they hit us give Sunfish his head he s been there before and keep on the outside Thurston yelled All right but the pounding roar of the stampede drowned his voice A whirlwind of frenzied steers bore down upon him twenty five hundred Panhandle two year olds though he did not know it then his mind was all a daze with one sentence zigzagging through it like the lightning over his head Give Sunfish his head and keep on the outside That was what saved him for he had the sense to obey After a few minutes of breathless racing with a roar as of breakers in his ears and the crackle of clashing horns and the gleaming of rolling eyeballs close upon his horse s heels he found himself washed high and dry as it were while the tumult swept by Presently he was galloping along behind and wondering dully how he got there though perhaps Sunfish knew well enough In his story of the West the one that had failed to be convincing he had in his ignorance described a stampede and it had not been in the least like this one He blushed at the memory and wondered if he should ever again feel qualified to write of these things Great drops of rain pounded him on the back as he rode chill drops that went to the skin He thought of his new canary colored slicker in the bed tent and before he knew it swore just as any of the other men would have done under similar provocation it was the first real able bodied oath he had ever uttered He was becoming assimilated with the raw conditions of life He heard a man s voice calling to him and distinguished the dim shape of a rider close by He shouted that password of the range Hello What outfit is this the man cried again The Lazy Eight snapped Thurston sure that the other had come with the stampede Then feeling the anger of temporary authority What in hell are you up to letting your cattle run If Park could have heard him say that for Reeve Howard Down the long length of the valley they swept gathering to themselves other herds and other riders as incensed as were themselves It is not pretty work nor amusing to gallop madly in the wake of a stampede at night keeping up the stragglers and taking the chance of a broken neck with the rain to make matters worse Bob MacGregor sought Thurston with much shouting and having found him they rode side by side And always the thunder boomed overhead and by the lightning flashes they glimpsed the turbulent sea of cattle fleeing they knew not where or why with blind fear crowding their heels The noise of it roused the camps as they thundered by men rose up peered out from bed tents as the stampede swept past cursed the delay it would probably make hoped none of the boys got hurt and thanked the Lord the tents were pitched close to the creek and out of the track of the maddened herds Then they went back to bed to wait philosophically for daylight When Sunfish between flashes stumbled into a shallow washout and sent Thurston sailing unbeautifully over his head Bob pulled up and slid off his horse in a hurry Yuh hurt Bud he cried anxiously bending over him For Thurston from the very frankness of his verdant ignorance had won for himself the indulgent protectiveness of the whole outfit not a man but watched unobtrusively over his welfare and Bob MacGregor went farther and loved him whole heartedly His voice when he spoke was unequivocally frightened Thurston sat up and wiped a handful of mud off his face if it had not been so dark Bob would have shouted at the spectacle I m kinda sorter shuck up like he quoted ruefully And my nose is skinned thank you Where s that devil of a horse Bob stood over him and grinned My I m surprised at yuh Bud What would your Sunday school teacher say if she heard yuh Anyway yuh ain t got any call to cuss Sunfish he ain t to blame He s used to fellows that can ride Shut up Thurston commanded inelegantly I d like to see you ride a horse when he s upside down Aw come on urged Bob giving up the argument We ll be plumb lost from the herd if we don t hustle They got into their saddles again and went on riding by sound and the rare glimpses the lightning gave them as it flared through the storm away to the east Wet Bob sung out sympathetically from the streaming shelter of his slicker Thurston wriggling away from his soaked clothing grunted a sarcastic negative The cattle were drifting now before the storm which had settled to a monotonous downpour The riders two or three men for every herd that had joined in the panic circled a veritable picket line without the password There would be no relief ride out to them that night and they knew it and settled to the long wait for morning Thurston took up his station next to Bob rode until he met the next man and then retraced his steps till he faced Bob again rode until the world seemed unreal and far away with nothing left but the night and the riding back and forth on his beat and the rain that oozed through his clothes and trickled uncomfortably down inside his collar He lost all count of time and was startled when at last came gray dawn As the light grew brighter his eyes widened and forgot their sleep hunger he had not thought it would be like this He was riding part way across one end of a herd larger than his imagination had ever pictured three thousand cattle had seemed to him a multitude yet here were more than twenty thousand wet draggled their backs humped miserably from the rain which but a half hour since had ceased He was still gazing and wondering when Park rode up to him Lord Bud you re a sight Did the bunch walk over yuh he greeted No only Sunfish snapped Thurston crossly Time was when Philip Thurston would not have answered any man abruptly however great the provocation He was only lately getting down to the real elemental man of him to the son of Bill Thurston bull whacker prospector follower of dim trails He rode silently back to camp with Bob ate his breakfast got into dry clothes and went out and tied his slicker deliberately and securely behind the cantle of his saddle though the sun was shining straight into his eyes and the sky fairly twinkled it was so clean of clouds Bob watched him with eyes that laughed My you re an ambitious son of a gun he chuckled And you ve got the slicker question settled in your mind I see yuh learn easy it takes two or three soakings to learn some folks We ve got to go back and help with the herd haven t we Thurston asked The horses are all out Yep They ll stay out too till noon m son We hike to bed if anybody should ask yuh So it was not till after dinner that he rode back to the great herd with his Kodak in his pocket to find the cattle split up into several bunches The riders at once went to work separating the different brands He was too green a hand to do anything but help hold the cut and that was so much like ordinary herd ing that his interest flagged He wanted more than anything to ride into the bunch and single out a Lazy Eight steer skillfully hazing him down the slope to the cut as he saw the others do Bob told him it was the biggest mix up he had ever seen and Bob had ridden the range in every State where beef grows wild He was in the thickest of the huddle was Bob working as if he did not know the meaning of fatigue Thurston watching him thread his way in and out of the restless milling herd only to reappear unexpectedly at the edge with a steer just before the nose of his horse rush it out from among the others wheeling darting this way and that as it tried to dodge back and always coming off victor wondered if he could ever learn to do it Being in pessimistic mood he told himself that he would probably always remain a greenhorn to be borne with and coached and given boy s work to do all because he had been cheated of his legacy of the dim trails and forced to grow up in a city hedged about all his life by artificial conditions his conscience wedded to convention CHAPTER VI THE BIG DIVIDE The long drive was nearly over Even Thurston s eyes brightened when he saw away upon the sky line the hills that squatted behind the home ranch of the Lazy Eight The past month had been one of rapid living under new conditions and at sight of them it seemed only a few days since he had first glimpsed that broken line of hills and the bachelor household in the coulee below As the travel weary herd swung down the long hill into the valley of the Milk River stepping out briskly as they sighted the cool water in the near distance the past month dropped away from Thurston and what had gone just before came back fresh as the happenings of the morning There was the Stevens ranch a scant half mile away from where the tents already gleamed on their last camp of the long trail the smoke from the cook tent telling of savory meats and puddings the bare thought of which made one hurry his horse His eyes dwelt longest however upon the Stevens house half hidden among the giant cottonwoods and he wondered if Mona would still smile at him with that unpleasant uplift at the corner of her red mouth He would take care that she did not get the chance to smile at him in any fashion he told himself with decision He wondered if those train robbers had been captured and if the one Park wounded was still alive He shivered when he thought of the dead man in the aisle and hoped he would never witness another death involuntarily he glanced down at his right stirrup half expecting to see his boot red with human blood It was not nice to remember that scene and he gave his shoulders an impatient hitch and tried to think of something else Mindful of his vow he had bought a gun in Billings but he had not yet learned to hit anything he aimed at for firearms are hushed in roundup camps except when dire necessity breeds a law of its own Range cattle do not take kindly to the popping of pistols So Thurston s revolver was yet unstained with powder grime and was packed away inside his bed He was promising his pride that he would go up on the hill back of the Lazy Eight corrals and shoot until even Mona Stevens must respect his marksmanship when Park galloped back to him The world has moved some while we was gone he announced in the tone of one who has news to tell and enjoys thoroughly the telling Yuh mind the fellow I laid out in the hold up He got all right again and they stuck him in jail along with another one old Lauman the sheriff glommed a week ago Well they didn t do a thing last night but knock a deputy in the head annex his gun swipe a Winchester and a box uh shells out uh the office and hit the high places Old Lauman is hot on their trail but he ain t met up with em yet that anybody s heard When he does there ll sure be something doing They say the deputy s about all in they smashed his skull with a big iron poker I wish I could handle a gun Thurston said between his teeth I d go after them myself I wish I d been left to grow up out here where I belong I m all West but the training and I never knew it till a month ago I ought to ride and rope and shoot with the best of you and I can t do a thing All I know is books I can criticize an opera and a new play and I m considered something of an authority on clothes but I can t shoot Aw go easy Park laughed at him What if yuh can t do the double roll Riding and shooting and roping s all right we couldn t very well get along without them accomplishments But that s all they are just accomplishments We know a man when we see him and it don t matter whether he can ride a bronk straight up or don t know which way a saddle sets on a horse If he s a man he gets as square a deal as we can give him Park reached for his cigarette book And as for hunting outlaws he finished we ve got old Lauman paid to do that And he s dead onto his job you bet when he goes out after a man he comes pretty near getting him m son But I sure do wish I d killed that jasper while I was about it it would have saved Lauman a lot uh hard riding Thurston could scarcely explain to Park that his desire to hunt train robbers was born of a half defiant wish to vindicate to Mona Stevens his courage and so he said nothing at all He wondered if Park had heard her whisper that day and knew how he had failed to obey her commands and if he had heard her call him a coward He had often wondered that but Park had a way of keeping things to himself and Thurston could never quite bring himself to open the subject boldly At any rate if Park had heard he hoped that he understood how it was and did not secretly despise him for it Women he told himself bitterly are never quite just After the four o clock supper he and Bob MacGregor went up the valley to relieve the men on herd There was one nice thing about Park as a foreman he tried to pair off his crew according to their congeniality That was why Thurston usually stood guard with Bob whom he liked better than any of the others always excepting Park himself I brought my gun along Bob told him apologetically when they were left to themselves It s a habit I ve got when I know there s bad men rampaging around the country The boys kinda gave me the laugh when they seen me haul it out uh my war bag but I just told em to go to thunder Do you think those Naw Uh course not I just pack it on general principles same as an old woman packs her umbrella Say this is dead easy The bunch is pretty well broke ain t it I m sure glad to see old Milk River again this here trailing cattle gets plumb monotonous He got down and settled his back comfortably against a rock Below them spread the herd feeding quietly Yes sir this is sure a snap he repeated after he had made himself a smoke They s only two ways a bunch could drift if they wanted to which they don t up the river or down This hill s a little too steep for em to tackle unless they was crowded hard Good feed here too Too bad yuh don t smoke Bud There s nothing like a good smooth rock to your back and a cigarette in your face on a nice lazy day like this It s the only kind uh day herding I got any use for I ll take the rock to my back if you ll just slide along and make room Thurston laughed I don t hanker for a cigarette but I do wish I had my Kodak Aw t ell with your Kodak Bob snorted Can t yuh carry this layout in your head I ve got a picture gallery in mine that I wouldn t trade for a farm I don t need no Kodak in mine thankye You just let this here view soak into your system Bud where yuh can t lose it Thurston did Long after he could close his eyes and see it in every detail the long green slope with hundreds of cattle loitering in the rank grass growth the winding sweep of the river and the green rolling hills beyond and Bob leaning against the rock beside him smoking luxuriously with half closed eyes while their horses dozed with drooping heads a rein length away Say Bud Bob s voice drawled sleepily I wisht you d sing that Jerusalem song I want to learn the words to it I m plumb stuck on that piece It s different from the general run uh songs don t yuh think Most of em s about your old home that yuh left in boyhood s happy days and go back to find your girl dead and sleeping in a little church yard or else it s your mother or your girl marries the other man and you get it handed to yuh right along and they make a fellow kinda sick to his stomach when he s got to sing em two or three hours at a stretch on night guard just because he s plumb ignorant of anything better This here Jerusalem one sounds kinda grand and the cattle seems to like it too for a change The composer would feel flattered if he heard that Thurston laughed He wanted to be left alone to day dream and watch the clouds trail lazily across to meet the hills and there was an embryonic poem forming phrase by phrase in his mind But he couldn t refuse Bob anything so he sat a bit straighter and cleared his throat He sang well well enough indeed to be sought after at informal affairs among his set at home When he came to the refrain Bob took his cigarette from between his lips and held it in his fingers while he joined his voice lustily to Thurston s Jerusalem Jerusalem Lift up your gates and sing Hosanna in the high est Hosanna to your King The near cattle lifted their heads to stare stupidly a moment then moved a few steps slowly nosing for the sweetest grass tufts The horses shifted their weight resting one leg with the hoof barely touching the earth twitched their ears at the flies and slept again And then me thought my dream was changed The streets no longer rang Hushed were the glad Hosannas The little children sang Tamale lifted his head and gazed inquiringly up the hill but Bob was not observant of signs just then He was Striving with his recreant memory for the words that came after The sun grew dark with mystery The morn was cold and still As the shadow of a cross arose Upon a lonely hill Tamale stirred restlessly with head uplifted and ears pointed straight before up the steep bluff Old Ironsides Thurston s mount was not the sort to worry about anything but his feed and paid no attention Bob turned and glanced the way Tamale was looking saw nothing and settled down again on the small of his back He sees a badger or something he Said Go on Bud with the chorus Jerusalem Jerusalem Lift up your gates and sing Lift up your hands damn quick mimicked a voice just behind If yuh ain t got anything to do but lay in the shade of a rock and yawp we ll borrow your cayuses You ain t needin em by the looks They squirmed around until they could stare into two black gun barrels and then their hands went up their faces held a particularly foolish expression that must have been amusing to the men behind the guns One of the gun barrels lowered and a hand reached out and quietly took possession of Tamale s reins the owner of the hand got calmly into Bob s saddle Bob gritted his teeth It was evident their movements had been planned minutely in advance for once settled to his liking the fellow tested the stirrups to make sure they were the right length and raising his gun pointed it at the two in a business like manner that left no doubt of his meaning Whereupon the man behind them came forward and appropriated Old Ironsides to his own use Too bad we had to interrupt Sunday school he remarked ironically You can go ahead with the meetin now the collection has been took up He laughed without any real mirth in his voice and gathered up the reins If yuh want our horses they re up on the bench I don t reckon they ll ever turn another cow but such as they are you re quite welcome Better set still boys till we get out uh sight one of us ll keep an eye peeled for yuh So long and much obliged They turned and rode warily down the slope Now wouldn t that jar yuh asked Bob in deep disgust His hands dropped to his sides in another second he was up and shooting savagely Get behind the rock Bud he commanded Just then a rifle cracked and Bob toppled drunkenly and went limply to the grass My God cried Thurston and didn t know that he spoke He snatched up Bob s revolver and fired shot after shot at the galloping figures Not one seemed to do any good the first shot hit a two year old square in the ribs After that there were no cattle within rifle range One of the outlaws stopped took deliberate aim with the stolen Winchester and fired meaning to kill but he miscalculated the range a bit and Thurston crumpled down with a bullet in his thigh The revolver was empty now and fell smoking at his feet So he lay and cursed impotently while he watched the marauders ride out of sight up the valley When the rank timber growth hid their flying figures he crawled over to where Bob lay and tried to lift him Art you hurt was the idiotic question he asked Bob opened his eyes and waited a breath as if to steady his thought Did I get one Bud I m afraid not Thurston confessed and immediately after wished that he had lied and said yes Are you hurt he repeated senselessly Who me Bob s eyes wavered in their directness Don t yuh bother none about me evasively But you ve got to tell me You they He choked over the words Well I guess they got me all right But don t let that worry yuh it don t me He tried to speak carelessly and convincingly but it was a miserable failure He did not want to die did Bob however much he might try to hide the fact Thurston was not in the least imposed upon He turned away his head pretending to look after the outlaws and set his teeth together tight He did not want to act a fool All at once he grew dizzy and sick and lay down heavily till the faintness passed Bob tried to lift himself to his elbow failing that he put out a hand and laid it on Thurston s shoulder Did they get you too he queried anxiously The damn coyotes It s nothing just a leg put out of business Thurston hurried to assure him Where are you hurt Bob Aw I ain t any X ray Bob retorted weakly but gamely Somewheres inside uh me It went in my side but the Lord knows where it wound up It hurts like the devil He lay quiet a minute I wish do yuh feel like finishing that song Bud Thurston gulped down a lump that was making his throat ache When he answered his voice was very gentle I ll try a verse old man The last one we d just come to the last It s most like church I I never went much on religion Bud but when a fellow s going out over the Big Divide You re not Thurston contradicted fiercely as if that could make it different He thought he could not bear those jerky sentences All right Bud We won t fight over it Go ahead The last verse Thurston eased his leg to a better position drew himself up till his shoulders rested against the rock and began with an occasional odd break in his voice I saw the holy city Beside the tideless Sea The light of God was on its street The gates were open wide And all who would might enter And no one was denied Wonder if that there applies to bone headed cowpunchers Bob muttered drowsily And all who would Thurston glanced quickly at his face caught his breath sharply at what he saw there written and dropped his head upon his arms And so Park and his men hurrying to the sound of the shooting found them in the shadow of the rock CHAPTER VII AT THE STEVENS PLACE When the excitement of the outrage had been pushed aside by the insistent routine of everyday living Thurston found himself thrust from the fascination of range life and into the monotony of invalidism and he was anything but resigned To be sure he was well cared for at the Stevens ranch where Park and the boys had taken him that day and missus Stevens mothered him as he could not remember being mothered before Hank Graves rode over nearly every day to sit beside the bed and curse the Wagner gang back to their great great grandfathers and down to more than the third generation yet unborn and to tell him the news On the second visit he started to give him the details of Bob s funeral but Thurston would not listen and told him so plainly All right then Bud I won t talk about it But we sure done the right thing by the boy had the best preacher in Shellanne out and flowers till further notice a cross uh carnations and the boys sent up to Minot and had a spur made uh oh well all right I ll shut up about it I know how yuh feel Bud it broke us all up to have him go that way He sure was a white boy if ever there was one and ahem I d give a thousand dollars hard coin to get my hands on them Wagners It would uh been all off with them sure if the boys had run acrost em I d uh let em stay out and hunt a while longer only old Lauman ll get em all right and we re late as it is with the calf roundup Lauman ll run em down and by the Lord I ll hire Bowman myself and ship him out from Helena to help prosecute em They re dead men if he takes the case against em Bud and I ll get him sure and to hell with the cost of it They ll swing for what they done to you and Bob if it takes every hoof I own Thurston told him he hoped they would be caught and yes hanged though he had never before advocated capital punishment But when he thought of Bob the care naught whole souled fellow He tried not to think of him for thinking unmanned him He had the softest of hearts where his friends were concerned and there were times when he felt that he could with relish officiate at the Wagners execution He fought against remembrance of that day and for sake of diversion he took to studying a large pastel portrait of Mona which hung against the wall opposite his bed It was rather badly done and at first when he saw it he laughed at the thought that even the great still plains of the range land cannot protect one against the ubiquitous picture agent In the parlor he supposed there would be crayon pictures of grandmothers and aunts further evidence of the agent s glibness He was glad that it was Mona who smiled down at him instead of a grand mother or an aunt For Mona did smile and in spite of the cheap crudity the smile was roguish with little dimply creases at the corners of the mouth and not at all unpleasant If the girl would only look like that in real life he told himself a fellow would probably get to liking her He supposed she thought him a greater coward than ever now just because he hadn t got killed If he had he would be a hero now like Bob Well Bob was a hero the way he had jumped up and begun shooting required courage of the suicidal sort He had stood up and shot also and had succeeded only in being ridiculous he hoped nobody had told Mona about his hitting that steer When he could walk again he would learn to shoot so that the range stock wouldn t suffer from his marksmanship After a week of seeing only missus Stevens or sympathetic men acquaintances he began to wonder why Mona stayed so persistently away Then one morning she came in to take his breakfast things out She did not however stay a second longer than was absolutely necessary and she was perfectly composed and said good morning in her most impersonal tone At least Thurston hoped she had no tone more impersonal than that He decided that she had really beautiful eyes and hair after she had gone he looked up at the picture told himself that it did not begin to do her justice and sighed a bit He was very dull and even her companionship he thought would be pleasant if only she would come down off her pedestal and be humanly sociable When he wrote a story about a fellow being laid up in the same house with a girl a girl with big blue gray eyes and ripply brown hair he would have the girl treat the fellow at least decently She would read poetry to him and bring him flowers and do ever so many nice things that would make him hate to get well He decided that he would write just that kind of story he would idealize it of course and have the fellow in love with the girl you have to in stories In real life it doesn t necessarily follow that because a fellow admires a girl s hair and eyes and wants to be on friendly terms he is in love with her For example he emphatically was not in love with Mona Stevens He only wanted her to be decently civil and to stop holding a foolish grudge against him for not standing up and letting himself be shot full of holes because she commanded it In the afternoons missus Stevens would sit beside him and knit things and talk to him in a pleasantly garrulous fashion and he would lie and listen to her and to Mona singing somewhere Mona sang very well he thought he wondered if she had ever had any training Also he wished he dared ask her not to sing that song about She s only a bird in a gilded cage It brought back too vividly the nights when he and Bob stood guard under the quiet stars And then one day he hobbled out into the dining room and ate dinner with the family Since he sat opposite Mona she was obliged to look at him occasionally whether she would or no Thurston had a strain of obstinacy in his nature and when he decided that Mona should not only look at him but should talk to him as well he set himself diligently to attain that end He was not the man to sit down supinely and let a girl calmly ignore him so Mona presently found herself talking to him with some degree of cordiality and what is more to the point listening to him when he talked It is probable that Thurston never had tried so hard in his life to win a girl s attention It was while he was still hobbling with a cane and taxing his imagination daily to invent excuses for remaining that Lauman the sheriff rode up to the door with a deputy and asked shelter for themselves and the two Wagners who glowered sullenly down from their weary horses When they had been safely disposed in Thurston s bedroom with one of the ranch hands detailed to guard them Lauman and his man gave themselves up to the joy of a good meal Their own cooking they said got mighty tame especially when they hadn t much to cook and dared not have a fire They had come upon the outlaws by mere accident and it is hard telling which was the most surprised But Lauman was perhaps the quickest man with a gun in Valley County else he would not have been serving his fourth term as sheriff He got the drop and kept it while his deputy did the rest It had been a hard chase he said and a long one if you counted time instead of miles But he had them now harmless as rattlers with their fangs fresh drawn He wanted to get them to Glasgow before people got to hear of their capture he thought they wouldn t be any too safe if the boys knew he had them If he had known that the Lazy Eight roundup had just pulled in to the home ranch that afternoon and that Dick Farney one of the Stevens men had slipped out to the corral and saddled his swiftest horse it is quite possible that Lauman would not have lingered so long over his supper or drank his third cup of coffee with real cream in it with so great a relish And if he had known that the Circle Bar boys were camped just three miles away within hailing distance of the Lazy Eight trail he would doubtless have postponed his after supper smoke He was sitting revolver in hand watching the Wagners give a practical demonstration of the extent of their appetites when Thurston limped in from the porch his eyes darker than usual There are a lot of riders coming mister Lauman he announced quietly It sounds like a whole roundup I thought you ought to know The prisoners went white and put down knife and fork If they had never feared before plainly they were afraid then Lauman s face did not in the least change Put the hand cuffs on Waller he said If you ve got a room that ain t easy to get at from the outside missus Stevens I guess I ll have to ask yuh for the use of it missus Stevens had lived long in Valley County and had learned how to meet emergencies Put em right down cellar she invited briskly There s just the trap door into it and the windows ain t big enough for a cat to go through Mona get a candle for mister Lauman She turned to hurry the girl and found Mona at her elbow with a light That s the kind uh woman I like to have around Lauman chuckled Come on boys hustle down there if yuh want to see Glasgow again Trembling all their dare devil courage sapped from them by the menace of Thurston s words they stumbled down the steep stairs and the darkness swallowed them Lauman beckoned to his deputy You go with em Waller he ordered If anybody but me offers to lift this trap shoot Don t yuh take any chances Blow out that candle soon as you re located It was then that fifty riders clattered into the yard and up to the front door grouping in a way that left no exit unseen Thurston standing in the doorway knew them almost to a man Lazy Eight boys they were men who night after night had spread their blankets under the tent roof with him and with Bob MacGregor Bob who lay silently out on the hill back of the home ranch house waiting for the last great round up They glanced at him in mute greeting and dismounted without a word With them mingled the Circle Bar boys as silent and grim as their fellows Lauman came up and peered into the dusk Thurston observed that he carried his Winchester unobtrusively in one hand Why hello boys he greeted cheerfully But for the rifle you never would have guessed he knew their errand Hello Lauman answered Park matching him for cheerfulness Then We rode over to hang them Wagners Lauman grinned I hate to disappoint yuh Park but I ve kinda set my heart on doing that little job myself I m the one that caught em and if you d followed my trail the last month you d say I earned the privilege Maybe so Park admitted pleasantly but we ve got a little personal matter to settle up with those jaspers Bob MacGregor was one of us yuh remember I ll hang em just as dead as you can Lauman argued But yuh won t do it so quick Park lashed back They re spoiling the air every breath they draw We want em and I guess that pretty near settles it Not by a damn sight it don t I ve never had a man took away from me yet boys and I ve been your sheriff a good many years You hike right back to camp yuh can t have em Thurston could scarcely realize the deadliness of their purpose He knew them for kind hearted laughter loving young fellows who would give their last dollar to a friend He could not believe that they would resort to violence now Besides this was not his idea of a mob he had fancied they would howl threats and wave bludgeons as they did in stories Mobs always howled and seethed with passion at one s doors they did not stand about and talk quietly as though the subject was trivial and did not greatly concern them But the men were pressing closer and their very calmness had he known it was ominous Lauman shifted his rifle ready for instant aim Boys look here he began more gravely I can t say I blame yuh looking at it from your view point If you d caught these men when yuh was out hunting em you could uh strung em up and I d likely uh had business somewhere else about that time But yuh didn t catch em yuh give up the chase and left em to me And yuh got to remember that I m the one that brought em in They re in my care I m sworn to protect em and turn em over to the law and it ain t a question uh whether they deserve it or not That s what I m paid for and I expect to go right ahead according to orders and hang em by law You can t have em unless yuh lay me out first and I don t reckon any of yuh would go that far There s never been a man hung by law in this county yet a voice cried angrily and impatiently That ain t saying there never will be Lauman flung back Don t yuh worry they ll get all that s coming to them all right How about the time yuh had em in your rotten old jail and let em get out and run loose around the country killing off white men drawled another a Circle Bar man Now boys A hand the hand of him who had stood guard over the Wagners in the bedroom during supper reached out through the doorway and caught his rifle arm Taken unawares from behind he whirled and then went down under the weight of men used to wrassling calves Even old Lauman was no match for them and presently he found himself stretched upon the porch with three Lazy Eight boys sitting on his person which being inclined to portliness he found very uncomfortable Moved by an impulse he had no name for Thurston snatched the sheriff s revolver from its scabbard As the heap squirmed pantingly upon the porch he stepped into the doorway to avoid being tripped which was the wisest move he could have made for it put him in the shadow and there were men of the Circle Bar whose trigger finger would not have hesitated just then had he been in plain sight and had they known his purpose Just hold on there boys he called and they could see the glimmer of the gun barrel Those of the Lazy Eight laughed at him Aw put it down Bud Park admonished That s too dangerous a toy for you to be playing with and yuh know damn well yuh can t hit anything I killed a steer once Thurston reminded him meekly whereat the laugh hushed for they remembered I know I can t shoot straight he went on frankly but you re taking that much the greater chance If I have to I ll cut loose and there s no telling where the bullets may strike That s right Park admitted Stand still boys he s more dangerous than a gun that isn t loaded What d yuh want m son I want to talk to you for about five minutes I ve got a game leg so that I can neither run nor fight but I hope you ll listen to me The Wagners can t get away they re locked up with a deputy standing over them with a gun and on top of that they re handcuffed They re as helpless boys as two trapped coyotes He looked down over the crowd which shifted uneasily no one spoke That s what struck me most he continued You know what I thought of Bob don t you And I didn t thank them for boring a hole in my leg it wasn t any kindness of theirs that it didn t land higher they weren t shooting at me for fun And I d have killed them both with a clear conscience if I could I tried hard enough But it was different then out in the open where a man had an even break I don t believe if I had shot as straight as I wanted to that I d ever have felt a moment s compunction But now when they re disarmed and shackled and altogether helpless I couldn t walk up to them deliberately and kill them could you It could be done and done easily You have Lauman where he can t do anything and I m not of much account in a fight so you ve really only one deputy sheriff and two women to get the best of You could drag these men out and hang them in the cottonwoods and they couldn t raise a hand to defend themselves We could do it easily but when it was done and the excitement had passed I d have a picture in my memory that I d hate to look at I d have an hour in my life that would haunt me And so would you You d hate to look back and think that one time you helped kill a couple of men who couldn t fight back Let the law do it boys You don t want them to live and I don t nobody does for they deserve to die But it isn t for us to play judge and jury and hangman here to night Let them get what s coming to them at the hands of the officers you ve elected for that purpose They won t get off Hank Graves says they will hang if it takes every hoof he owns He said he would bring Bowman down here to help prosecute them I don t know Bowman I do a voice spoke somewhere in the darkness Lawyer from Helena Never lost a case I m glad to hear it for he s the man that will prosecute They haven t a ghost of a show to get out of it Lauman here is responsible for their safe keeping and I guess now that he knows them better we needn t be afraid they ll escape again And it s as Lauman said he ll hang them quite as dead as you can He s drawing a salary to do these things make him earn it It s a nasty job boys and you wouldn t get anything out of it but a nasty memory A hand that did not feel like the hand of a man rested for an instant on his arm Mona brushed by him and stepped out where the rising moon shone on her hair and into her big blue gray eyes I wish you all would please go away she said You are making mamma sick She s got it in her head that you are going to do something awful and I can t convince her you re not I told her you wouldn t do anything so sneaking but she s awfully nervous about it Won t you please go right now They looked sheepishly at one another every man of them feared the ridicule of his neighbor Why sure we ll go cried Park rallying We were going anyway in a minute Tell your mother we were just congratulating Lauman on rounding up these Wagners Come on boys And you Bud hurry up and get well again we miss yuh round the Lazy Eight The three who were sitting on Lauman got up and he gave a sigh of relief Say yuh darned cowpunchers don t have no mercy on an old man s carcass at all he groaned in exaggerated self pity Next time yuh want to congratulate me I wish you d put it in writing and send it by mail A little ripple of laughter went through the crowd Then they swung up on their horses and galloped away in the moonlight CHAPTER VIII A QUESTION OF NERVE That was your victory Miss Stevens Allow me to congratulate you If Thurston showed any ill grace in his tone it was without intent But it did seem unfortunate that just as he was waxing eloquent and felt sure of himself and something of a hero Mona should push him aside as though he were of no account and disperse a bunch of angry cowboys with half a dozen words She looked at him with her direct blue gray eyes and smiled And her smile had no unpleasant uplift at the corners it was the dimply roguish smile of the pastel portrait only several times nicer Re could hardly believe it he just opened his eyes wide and stared When he came to a sense of his rudeness Mona was back in the kitchen helping with the supper dishes just as though nothing had happened unless one observed the deep apple red of her cheeks while her mother who showed not the faintest symptoms of collapse flourished a dish towel made of a bleached flour sack with the stamp showing a faint pink and blue XXXX across the center I knew all the time they wouldn t do anything when it came right to the point she declared Bless their hearts they thought they would but they re too soft hearted even when they are mad If yuh go at em right yuh can talk em over easy It done me good to hear yuh talk right up to em Bud missus Stevens had called hi Bud from the first time she laid eyes on him That s all under the sun they needed just somebody to set em thinking about the other side You re a real good speaker seems to me you ought to study to be a preacher Thurston s face turned red But presently he forgot everything in his amazement for Mona the dignified Mona of the scornful eyes and the chilly smile actually giggled giggled like any ordinary girl and shot him a glance that had in it pure mirth and roguish teasing and a dash of coquetry He sat down and giggled with her feeling idiotically happy and for no reason under the sun that he could name He had promised his conscience that he would go home to the Lazy Eight in the morning but he didn t he somehow contrived overnight to invent a brand new excuse for his conscience to swallow or not as it liked Hank Graves had the same privilege as for the Stevens trio he blessed their hospitable souls for not wanting any excuse whatever for his staying They were frankly glad to have him there at least missus Stevens and Jack were As for Mona he was not so sure but he hoped she didn t mind This was the reason inspired by his great desire he was going to write a story and Mona was unconsciously to furnish the material for his heroine and so of course he needed to be there so that he might study his subject That sounded very well to himself but to Hank Graves for some reason it seemed very funny When Thurston told him Hank was taken with a fit of strangling that turned his face a dark purple Afterward he explained brokenly that something had got down his Sunday throat and Thurston who had never heard of a man s Sunday throat eyed him with suspicion Hank blinked at him with tears still in his quizzical eyes and slapped him on the back after the way of the West and any other enlightened country where men are not too dignified to be their real selves and drawled in a way peculiar to himself That s all right Bud You stay right here as long as yuh want to I don t blame yuh if I was you I d want to spend a lot uh time studying this particular brand uh female girl myself She s out uh sight Bud and I don t believe any uh the boys has got his loop on her so far though I could name a dozen or so that would be tickled to death if they had You just go right ahead and file your little old claim You re getting things mixed Thurston interrupted rather testily I m not in love with her I well it s like this if you were going to paint a picture of those mountains off there you d want to be where you could look at them wouldn t you You wouldn t necessarily want to to own them just because you felt they d make a fine picture Your interest would be er entirely impersonal Uh huh Hank agreed his keen eyes searching Phil s face amusedly Therefore it doesn t follow that I m getting foolish about a girl just because I hang it what the Dickens makes you look at a fellow that way You make me Uh huh said Hank again smoothing the lower half of his face with one hand You re a mighty nice little boy Bud I ll bet Mona thinks so too and when yuh get growed up you ll know a whole lot more than yuh do right now Well I guess I ll be moving When yuh get that er story done you ll come back to the ranch I reckon Be good Thurston watched him ride away and then flounced oh men do flounce at times in spirit if not in deed and there would be no lack of the deed if only they wore skirts that could rustle indignantly in sympathy with the wearer to his room Plainly Hank did not swallow the excuse any more readily than did his conscience To prove the sincerity of his assertion to himself his conscience and to Hank Graves he straightway got out a thick pad of paper and sharpened three lead pencils to an exceeding fine point Then he sat him down by the window where he could see the kitchen door which was the one most used by the family and nibbled the tip off one of the pencils like any school girl For ten minutes he bluffed himself into believing that he was trying to think of a title the plain truth is he was wondering if Mona would go for a ride that afternoon and if so might he venture to suggest going with her He thought of the crimply waves in Mona s hair and pondered what adjectives would best describe it without seeming commonplace Rippling was too old though it did seem to hit the case all right He laid down the pad and nearly stood on his head trying to reach his Dictionary of Synonyms and Antonyms without getting out of his chair While he was clawing after it it lay on the floor where he had thrown it that morning because it refused to divulge some information he wanted he heard some one open and close the kitchen door and came near kinking his neck trying to get up in time to see who it was He failed to see anyone and returned to the dictionary Ripple to have waves like running water That was just the way her hair looked especially over the temples and at the nape of her neck Jove what a tempting white neck it was Um m Ripple wave undulate uneven irregular Lord what fools are the men who write dictionaries Antonym hang the antonyms The kitchen door slammed He craned again It was Jack going to town most likely Thurston shrewdly guessed that missus Stevens leaned far more upon Mona than she did upon Jack although he could hardly accuse her of leaning on anyone But he observed that the men looked to her for orders He perceived that the point was gone from his pencil and proceeded to sharpen it Then he heard Mona singing in the kitchen and recollected that missus Stevens had promised him warm doughnuts for supper Perhaps Mona was frying them at that identical moment and he had never seen anyone frying doughnuts He caught up his cane and limped out to investigate That is how much his heart just then was set upon writing a story that would breathe of the plains One great hindrance to the progress of his story was the difficulty he had in selecting a hero for his heroine Hank Graves suggested that he use Park and even went so far as to supply Thurston with considerable data which went to prove that Park would not be averse to figuring in a love story with Mona But Thurston was not what one might call enthusiastic and Hank laughed his deep inner laugh when he was well away from the house Thurston on the contrary glowered at the world for two hours after Park was a fine fellow and Thurston liked him about as well as any man he knew in the West but And thus it went On each and every visit to the Stevens ranch and they were many Hank learning by direct inquiry that the story still suffered for lack of a hero suggested some fellow whom he had at one time and another caught shining around Mona And with each suggestion Thurston would draw down his eyebrows till he came near getting a permanent frown A love story without a hero while it would no doubt be original and all that would hardly appeal to an editor Phil tried heroes wholly imaginary but he had a trick of making his characters seem very real to himself and sometimes to other people as well So that after a few passages of more or less ardent love making he would in a sense grow jealous and spoil the story by annihilating the hero thereof Heaven only knows how long the thing would have gone on if he hadn t one temptingly beautiful evening reverted to the day of the hold up and apologized for not obeying her command He explained as well as he could just why he sat petrified with his hands in the air And then having brought the thing freshly to her mind he somehow lost control of his wits and told her he loved her He told her a good deal in the next two minutes that he might better have kept to himself just then But a man generally makes a glorious fool of himself once or twice in his life and it seems the more sensible the man the more thorough a job he makes of it Mona moved a little farther away from him and when she answered she did not choose her words Of all things she said evenly I admire a brave man and despise a coward You were chicken hearted that day and you know it you ve just admitted it Why in another minute I d have had that gun myself and I d have shown you but Park got it before I really had a chance I hated to seem spectacular but it served you right If you d had any nerve I wouldn t have had to sit there and tell you what to do If ever I marry anybody mister Thurston it will be a man Which means I suppose that I m not one he asked angrily I don t know yet Mona smiled her unpleasant smile the one that did not belong in the story he was going to write You re new to the country you see Maybe you ve got nerve you haven t shown much so far as I know except when you talked to the boys that night But you must have known that they wouldn t hurt you anyway A man must have a little courage as much as I have which isn t asking much or I d never marry him in the world Not even if you liked him his smile was wistful Not even if I loved him Mona declared and fled into the house Thurston gathered himself together and went down to the stable and borrowed a horse of Jack who had just got back from town and rode home to the Lazy Eight When Hank heard that he was home to stay at least until he could join the roundup again he didn t say a word for full five minutes Then Got your story done he drawled and his eyes twinkled Thurston was going up the stairs to his old room and Hank could not swear positively to the reply he got But he thought it sounded like Oh damn the story CHAPTER IX THE DRIFT OF THE HERDS Weeks slipped by and to Thurston they seemed but days His world weariness and cynicism disappeared the first time he met Mona after he had left there so unceremoniously for Mona not being aware of his cynicism received him on the old friendly footing and seemed to have quite forgotten that she had ever called him a coward or refused to marry him So Thurston forgot it also so long as he was with her How he filled in the hours he could scarcely have told certain it is that he accomplished nothing at all so far as Western stories were concerned Reeve Howard wrote in slightly shocked phrases to ask what was keeping him so long and assured him that he was missing much by staying away Thurston mentally agreed with him long enough to begin packing his trunk it was idiotic to keep staying on when he was clearly receiving no benefit thereby When however he picked up a book which he had told Mona he would take over to her the next time he went he stopped and considered There was the Wagner trial coming off in a month or so he couldn t get out of attending it for he had been subpoenaed as a witness for the prosecution And there was the beef roundup going to start before long he really ought to stay and take that in there would be some fine chances for pictures And really he didn t care so much for the Barry Wilson bunch and the long list of festivities which trailed ever in its wake at any rate they weren t worth rushing two thirds across the continent for He sat down and wrote at length to Reeve Howard explaining very carefully and not altogether convincingly just why he could not possibly go home at present After that he saddled and rode over to the Stevens place with the book leaving his trunk yawning emptily in the middle of his badly jumbled belongings After that he spent three weeks on the beef roundup At first he was full of enthusiasm and worked quite as if he had need of the wages but after two or three big drives the novelty wore off quite suddenly and nothing then remained but a lot of hard work For instance standing guard on long rainy nights when the cattle walked and walked might at first seem picturesque and all that but must at length cease to be amusing Likewise the long hours which he spent on day herd when the wind was raw and penetrating and like to blow him out of the saddle also standing at the stockyard chutes and forcing an unwilling stream of rollicky wild eyed steers up into the cars that would carry them to Chicago After three weeks of it he awoke one particularly nasty morning and thanked the Lord he was not obliged to earn his bread at all to say nothing of earning it in so distressful a fashion There was a lull in the shipping because cars were not then available He promptly took advantage of it and rode by the very shortest trail to the ranch and Mona But Mona was visiting friends in Chinook and there was no telling when she would return Thurston in the next few days owned to himself that there was no good reason for his tarrying longer in the big un peopled West and that the proper thing for him to do was go back home to New York He had come to stay a month and he had stayed five He could ride and rope like an old timer and he was well qualified to put up a stiff gun fight had the necessity ever arisen which it had not He had three hundred and seventy one pictures of different phases of range life not counting as many that were over exposed or under exposed or out of focus He had six unfinished stories in each of which the heroine had big blue gray eyes and crimply hair and the title and bare skeleton of a seventh in which the same sort of eyes and hair would probably develop later He had proposed to Mona three times and had been three times rebuffed though not it must be owned with that tone of finality which precludes hope He was tanned a fine brown which became him well His eyes had lost the dreamy introspective look of the student and author and had grown keen with the habit of studying objects at long range He walked with that peculiar stiff legged gait which betrays long hours spent in the saddle and he wore a silk handkerchief around his neck habitually and had forgotten the feel of a dress suit He answered to the name Bud more readily than to his own and he made practical use of the slang and colloquialisms of the plains without any mental quotation marks By all these signs and tokens he had learned his West and should have taken himself back to civilization when came the frost He had come to get into touch with his chosen field of fiction that he might write as one knowing whereof he spoke So far as he had gone he was in touch with it he was steeped to the eyes in local color and there was the rub The lure of it was strong upon him and he might not loosen its hold He was the son of his father he had found himself and knew that like him he loved best to travel the dim trails Gene Wasson came in and slammed the door emphatically shut after him She s sure coming he complained while he pulled the icicles from his mustache and cast them into the fire She s going to be a real old howler by the signs What yuh doing Bud Writing poetry Thurston nodded assent with certain mental reservations so far the editors couldn t seem to make up their minds that it was poetry Well say I wish you d slap in a lot uh things about hazy lazy daisy days in the spring that jingles fine and green grass and the sun shining and making the hills all goldy yellow and prairie dogs chip chip chipping on the dobe flats Prairie dogs would go all right in poetry wouldn t they They re sassy little cusses and I don t know of anything that would rhyme with em but maybe you do And read it all out to me after supper Maybe it ll make me kinda forget there s a blizzard on Another one Thurston got up to scratch a trench in the half inch layer of frost on the cabin window Why it only cleared up this morning after three days of it Can t help that This is just another chapter uh that same story When these here Klondike Chinooks gets to lapping over each other they never know when to quit Every darn one has got to be continued tacked onto the tail of it the winter All the difference is you can t read the writing but I can I ve got some mail for yuh Bud And old Hank wanted me to ask yuh if you d like to go to Glasgow next Thursday and watch old Lauman start the Wagner boys for wherever s hot enough He can get yuh in you being in the writing business He says to tell yuh it s a good chance to take notes so yuh can write a real stylish story with lots uh murder and sudden death in it We don t hang folks out here very often and yuh might have to go back East after pointers if yuh pass this up Oh go easy It turns me sick when I think about it how they looked when they got their sentence and all that I certainly don t care to see them hanged though they do deserve it Where are the letters Thurston sprawled across the table for them One was from Reeve Howard he put it by Another had a printed address in the corner an address that started his pulse a beat or two faster for he had not yet reached that blase stage where he could receive a personal letter from one of the Eight Leading without the flicker of an eye lash He still gloated over his successes and was cast into the deeps by his failures He held the envelope to the light shook it tentatively like any woman guessed hastily and hopefully at the contents and tore off an end impatiently From the great fireplace Gene watched him curiously and half enviously He wished he could get important looking letters from New York every few days It must make a fellow feel that he amounted to something Gene you remember that story I read to you one night that yarn about the fellow that lived alone in the hills and how the wolves used to come and sit on the ridge and howl o nights you know the one you said was out uh sight They took it all right and here what do you think of that He tossed the letter over to Gene who caught it just as it was about to be swept into the flame with the draught in Thurston in the days which he spent one of the half dozen Lazy Eight line camps with Gene down by the river had been writing of the West writing in fear and trembling for now he knew how great was his subject and his ignorance of it In the long evenings while the fire crackled and the flames played a game they had invented a game where they tried which could leap highest up the great chimney while the north wind whoo ooed around the eaves and fine frozen snow meal swished against the one little window while shivering drifting range cattle tramped restlessly through the sparse willow growth seeking comfort where was naught but cold and snow and bitter driving wind while the gray wolves hunted in packs and had not long to wait for their supper Thurston had written better than he knew He had sent the cold of the blizzards and the howl of the wolves he had sent bits of the wind swept plains back to New York in long white envelopes And the editors were beginning to watch for his white envelopes and to seize them eagerly when they came greedy for what was within Not every day can they look upon a few typewritten pages and see the range land spread now frowning now smiling before them Gee they say here they want a lot the same brand and at any old price yuh might name I wouldn t mind writing stories myself Gene kicked a log back into the flame where it would do the most good His big square shouldered figure stood out sharply against the glow Thurston watching him meditatively wanted to tell him that he was the sort of whom good stories are made But for men like Gene strong purposeful brave the West would lose half its charm He was like Bob in many ways and for that Thurston liked him and stayed with him in the line camp when he might have been taking his ease at the home ranch It was wild and lonely down there between the bare hills and the frozen river but the wildness and the loneliness appealed to him It was primitive and at times uncomfortable He slept in a bunk built against the wall with hard boards under him and a sod roof over his head There were times when the wind blew its fiercest and rattled dirt down into his face unless he covered it with a blanket And every other day he had to wash the dishes and cook and when it was Gene s turn to cook Thurston chopped great armloads of wood for the fireplace to eat o nights Also he must fare forth wrapped to the eyes and help Gene drive back the cattle which drifted into the river bottom lest they cross the river on the ice and range where they should not But in the evenings he could sit in the fire glow and listen to the wind and to the coyotes and the gray wolves and weave stories that even the most hyper critical of editors could not fail to find convincing By day he could push the coffee box that held his typewriter over by the frosted window when he had an hour or two to spare and whang away at a rate which filled Gene with wonder Sometimes he rode over to the home ranch for a day or two but Mona was away studying music so he found no inducement to remain and drifted back to the little sod roofed cabin by the river and to Gene The winter settled down with bared teeth like a bull dog and never a chinook came to temper the cold and give respite to man or beast Blizzards that held them in fear of their lives close to shelter for days came down from the north and with them came the drifting herds By hundreds they came hurrying miserably before the storms When the wind lashed them without mercy even in the bottom land they pushed reluctantly out upon the snow covered ice of the Missouri Then Gene and Thurston watching from their cabin window would ride out and turn them pitilessly back into the teeth of the storm They came by hundreds thin gaunt from cold and hunger They came by thousands lowing their misery as they wandered aimlessly seeking that which none might find food and shelter and warmth for their chilled bodies When the Canada herds pushed down upon them the boys gave over trying to keep them north of the river while they turned one bunch a dozen others were straggling out from shore the timid following single file behind a leader more venturesome or more desperate than his fellows So the march went on and on big Southern bred steer grappling the problem of his first Northern winter thin flanked cow with shivering rough coated calf trailing at her heels humpbacked yearling with little nubs of horns telling that he was lately in his calfhood red cattle spotted cattle white cattle black cattle white faced Herefords Short horns scrubs Texas longhorns of the sort invariably pictured in stampedes 
7705_101578_000015_000000	train-clean-360	still they came 
none	none	drifting out of the cold wilderness and on into wilderness as cold Through the shifting wall of the worst blizzard that season Thurston watched the weary fruitless endless march of the range Where do they all come from he exclaimed once when the snow veil lifted and showed the river black with cattle Lord I dunno Gene answered shrugging his shoulders against the pity of it I seen some brands yesterday that I know belongs up in the Cypress Hills country If things don t loosen up pretty soon the whole darned range will be swept clean uh stock as far north as cattle run I m looking for reindeer next Something ought to be done Thurston declared uneasily turning away from the sight I ve had the bellowing of starving cattle in my ears day and night for nearly a month The thing s getting on my nerves It s getting on the nerves uh them that own em a heap worse Gene told him grimly and piled more wood on the fire for the cold bit through even the thick walls of the cabin when the flames in the fireplace died and the door hinges were crusted deep with ice There s going to be the biggest loss this range has ever known It s the owners fault snapped Thurston whose nerves were in that irritable state which calls loudly for a vent of some sort Even argument with Gene fruitless though it perforce must be would be a relief It s their own fault I don t pity them any why don t they take care of their stock If I owned cattle do you think I d sit in the house and watch them starve through the winter What if yuh owned more than yuh could feed It d be a case uh have to then There s fifty thousand Lazy Eight cattle walking the range somewhere today How the dickens is old Hank going to feed them fifty thousand or five thousand It takes every spear uh hay he s got to feed his calves He could buy hay Thurston persisted Buy hay for fifty thousand cattle Where would he get it Say Bud I guess yuh don t realize that s some cattle All ails you is yuh don t savvy the size uh the thing I ll bet yuh there won t be less than three hundred thousand head cross this river before spring Some of them belong in Canada you said so yourself I know it but look at all the country south of us all the other cow States Why Bud when yuh talk about feeding every critter that runs the range you re plumb foolish Anyway it s a damnable pity Thurston asserted petulantly Sure it is The grass is there but it s under fourteen inches uh snow right now and more coming they say it s twelve feet deep up in the mountains You ll see some great old times in the spring Bud if yuh stay You will won t yuh Thurston laughed shortly I suppose it s safe to say I will he answered I ought to have gone last fall but I didn t It will probably be the same thing over again I ought to go in the spring but I won t You bet you won t Talk about big roundups what yuh seen last spring wasn t a commencement Every hoof that crosses this river and lives till spring will have to be rounded up and brought back again They ll be scattered clean down to the Yellowstone and every Northern outfit has got to go down and help work the range from there back I tell yuh Bud yuh want to lay in a car load uh films and throw away all them little jerk water snap shots yuh got There s going to be roundups like these old Panhandle rannies tell about when the green grass comes Gene thinking blissfully of the tented life sprawled his long legs toward the snapping blaze and crooned dreamily while without the blizzard raged more fiercely a verse from an old camp song Out on the roundup boys I tell yuh what yuh get Little chunk uh bread and a little chunk uh meat Little black coffee boys chuck full uh alkali Dust in your throat boys and gravel in your eye So polish up your saddles oil your slickers and your guns For we re bound for Lonesome Prairie when the green grass comes CHAPTER X THE CHINOOK One night in late March a sullen faraway roar awakened Thurston in his bunk He turned over and listened wondering what on earth was the matter More than anything it sounded like a hurrying freight train only the railroad lay many miles to the north and trains do not run at large over the prairie Gene snored peacefully an arm s length away Outside the snow lay deep on the levels while in the hollows were great white drifts that at bedtime had glittered frostily in the moonlight On the hill tops the gray wolves howled across coulees to their neighbors and slinking coyotes yapped foolishly at the moon Thurston drew the blanket up over his ears for the fire had died to a heap of whitening embers and the cold of the cabin made the nose of him tingle The roar grew louder and nearer then the cabin shivered and creaked in the suddenness of the blast that struck it A clod of dirt plumbed down upon his shoulder bringing with it a shower of finer particles Another blizzard he groaned and the worst we ve had yet by the sound The wind shrieked down the chimney and sought the places where the chinking was loose It howled up the coulees putting the wolves themselves to shame Gene flopped over like a newly landed fish grunted some unintelligible words and slept again For an hour Thurston lay and listened to the blast and selfishly thanked heaven it was his turn at the cooking If the storm kept up like that he told himself he was glad he did not have to chop the wood He lifted the blanket and sniffed tentatively then cuddled back into cover swearing that a thermometer would register zero at that very moment on his pillow The storm came in gusts as the worst blizzards do at times It made him think of the nursery story about the fifth little pig who built a cabin of rocks and how the wolf threatened I ll huff and I ll puff and I ll blow your house down It was as if he himself were the fifth little pig and as if the wind were the wolf The wolf wind would stop for whole minutes gather his great lungs full of air and then without warning would huff and puff his hardest But though the cabin was not built of rocks it was nevertheless a staunch little shelter and sturdily withstood the shocks He pitied the poor cattle still fighting famine and frost as only range bred stock can fight He pictured them drifting miserably before the fury of the wind or crowding for shelter under some friendly cutback their tails to the storm waiting stolidly for the dawn that would bring no relief Then with the roar and rattle in his ears he fell asleep In that particular line camp on the Missouri the cook s duties began with building a fire in the morning Thurston waked reluctantly shivered in anticipation under the blankets gathered together his fortitude and crept out of his bunk While he was dressing his teeth chattered like castanets in a minstrel show He lighted the fire hurriedly and stood backed close before it listening to the rage of the wind He was growing very tired of the monotony of winter he could no longer see any beauty in the high turreted snow clad hills nor the bare red faces of the cliffs frowning down upon him I don t suppose you could see to the river bank he mused and Gene will certainly tear the third commandment to shreds before he gets the water hole open He went over to the window meaning to scratch a peep hole in the frost just as he had done every day for the past three months lifted a hand then stopped bewildered For instead of frost there was only steam with ridges of ice yet clinging to the sash and dripping water in a tiny rivulet He wiped the steam hastily away with his palm and looked out Good heavens Gene he shouted in a voice to wake the Seven Sleepers The world s gone mad overnight Are you dead man Get up and look out The whole damn country is running water and the hills are bare as this floor Uh huh Gene knuckled his eyes and sat up Chinook struck us in the night Didn t yuh hear it Thurston pulled open the door and stood face to face with the miracle of the West He had seen Mother Nature in many a changeful mood but never like this The wind blew warm from the southwest and carried hints of green things growing and the song of birds he breathed it gratefully into his lungs and let it riot in his hair The sky was purplish and soft with heavy drifting clouds high piled like a summer storm It looked like rain he thought The bare hills were sodden with snow water and the drifts in the coulees were dirt grimed and forbidding The great river lay a gray stretch of water soaked snow over the ice with little clear pools reflecting the drab clouds above A crow flapped lazily across the foreground and perched like a blot of fresh spilled ink on the top of a dead cottonwood and cawed raucous greeting to the spring The wonder of it dazed Thurston and made him do unusual things that morning All winter he had been puffed with pride over his cooking but now he scorched the oatmeal let the coffee boil over and blackened the bacon and committed divers other grievous sins against Gene s clamoring appetite Nor did he feel the shame that he should have felt He simply could not stay in the cabin five minutes at a time and for it he had no apology After breakfast he left the dishes un washed upon the table and went out and made merry with nature He could scarce believe that yesterday he had frosted his left ear while he brought a bucket of water up from the river and that it had made his lungs ache to breathe the chill air Now the path to the river was black and dry and steamed with warmth Across the water cattle were feeding greedily upon the brown grasses that only a few hours before had been locked away under a crust of frozen snow They won t starve now he exulted pointing them out to Gene No you bet not Gene answered If this don t freeze up on us the wagons ll be starting in a month or so I guess we can be thinking about hitting the trail for home pretty soon now The river ll break up if this keeps going a week Say this is out uh sight It s warmer out uh doors than it is in the house Darn the old shack anyway I m plumb sick uh the sight of it It looked all right to me in a blizzard but now it s me for the range m son He went off to the stable with long swinging strides that matched all nature for gladness singing cheerily So polish up your saddles oil your slickers and your guns For we re hound for Lonesome Prairie when the green grass comes 
7705_101578_000001_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XI 
none	none	FOLLOWING THE DIM TRAILS 
7705_101578_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Thurston did not go on the horse roundup 
none	none	He explained to the boys when they clamored against his staying that he had a host of things to write and it would keep him busy till they were ready to start with the wagons for the big rendezvous on the Yellowstone the exact point of which had yet to be decided upon by the Stock Association when it met The editors were after him he said and if he ever expected to get anywhere in a literary sense it be hooved him to keep on the smiley side of the editors 
7705_101578_000003_000000	train-clean-360	That sounded all right as far as it went but unfortunately it did not go far 
7705_101578_000003_000001	train-clean-360	The boys winked at one another gravely behind his back and jerked their thumbs knowingly toward Milk River by which pantomime they reminded one another quite unnecessarily that Mona Stevens had come home 
none	none	However they kept their skepticism from becoming obtrusive so that Thurston believed his excuses passed on their face value 
7705_101578_000003_000003	train-clean-360	The boys it would seem realized that it is against human nature for a man to declare openly to his fellows his intention of laying last desperate siege to the heart of a girl who has already refused him three times and to ask her for the fourth time if she will reconsider her former decisions and marry him 
7705_101578_000004_000000	train-clean-360	That is really what kept Thurston at the Lazy Eight 
none	none	His writing became once more a mere incident in his life 
7705_101578_000004_000002	train-clean-360	During the winter when he did not see her he could bring himself to think occasionally of other things and it is a fact that the stories he wrote with no heroine at all hit the mark the straightest 
none	none	Now when he was once again under the spell of big clear blue gray eyes and crimply brown hair his stories lost something of their virility and verged upon the sentimental in tone 
7705_101578_000005_000001	train-clean-360	And since he was not a fool he realized the falling off and chafed against it and wondered why it was 
none	none	Surely a man who is in love should be well qualified to write convincingly of the obsession but Thurston did not He came near going to the other extreme and refusing to write at all 
7705_101578_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The wagons were out two weeks which is quite long enough for a crisis to arise in the love affair of any man 
7705_101578_000006_000001	train-clean-360	By the time the horse roundup was over one Philip Thurston was in pessimistic mood and quite ready to follow the wagons the farther the better 
none	none	Also they could not start too soon to please him 
7705_101578_000006_000003	train-clean-360	His thoughts still ran to blue gray eyes and ripply hair but he made no attempt to put them into a story 
7705_101578_000007_000000	train-clean-360	He packed his trunk carefully with everything he would not need on the roundup and his typewriter he put in the middle 
none	none	He told himself bitterly that he had done with crimply haired girls and with every other sort of girl If he could figure in something heroic only he said melodramatic he might possibly force her to think well of him But heroic situations and opportunities come not every day to a man and girls who demand that their knights shall be brave in face of death need not complain if they are left knightless at the last 
7705_101578_000008_000000	train-clean-360	He wrote to Reeve Howard the night before they were to start and apologized gracefully for having neglected him during the past three weeks and told him he would certainly be home in another month 
7705_101578_000008_000001	train-clean-360	He said that he was in danger of being satiated with the Western tone and would be glad to shake the hand of civilized man once more 
7705_101578_000008_000002	train-clean-360	This was distinctly unfair because he had no quarrel with the masculine portion of the West 
none	none	If he had said civilized woman it would have been more just and more illuminating to Reeve Howard who wondered what scrape Phil had gotten himself into with those savages For the first few days of the trip Thurston was in that frame of mind which makes a man want to ride by himself with shoulders hunched moodily and eyes staring straight before the nose of his horse But the sky was soft and seemed to smile down at him and the clouds loitered in the blue of it and drifted aimlessly with no thought of reaching harbor on the sky line From under his horse s feet the prairie sod sent up sweet earthy odors into his nostrils and the tinkle of the bells in the saddle bunch behind him made music in his ears the sort of music a true cowboy loves 
7705_101578_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Yellow throated meadow larks perched swaying in the top of gray sage bushes and sang to him that the world was good Sober gray curlews circled over his head their long funny bills thrust out straight as if to point the way for their bodies to follow and cried Kor r eck kor r eck which means just what the meadow larks sang 
none	none	So Thurston hearing it all about him seeing it and smelling it and feeling the riot of Spring in his blood straightened the hunch out of his shoulders and admitted that it was all true that the world was good At Miles City he found himself in the midst of a small army the regulars of the range which grew hourly larger as the outfits rolled in 
7705_101578_000011_000001	train-clean-360	The rattle of mess wagons driven by the camp cook and followed by the bed wagon was heard from all directions 
none	none	Jingling cavvies herds of saddle horses they were driven and watched over by the horse wrangler came out of the wilderness in the wake of the wagons Thurston got out his camera and took pictures of the scene In the first ten different camps appeared he mourned because two others were perforced omitted Two hours later he snapped the Kodak upon fifteen and there were four beyond range of the lens 
7705_101578_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Park came along saw what he was doing and laughed 
none	none	Yuh better wait till they commence to come he said
7705_101578_000012_000002	train-clean-360	 When yuh can stand on this little hill and count fifty or sixty outfits camped within two or three miles uh here yuh might begin taking pictures 
7705_101578_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I think you re loading me 
7705_101578_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Thurston retorted calmly winding up the roll for another exposure 
7705_101578_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 All right suit yourself about it Park walked off and left him peering into the view finder 
none	none	Still they came 
7705_101578_000015_000001	train-clean-360	From Swift Current to the Cypress Hills the Canadian cattlemen sent their wagons to join the big meet 
none	none	From the Sweet Grass Hills to the mouth of Milk River not a stock grower but was represented From the upper Musselshell they came and from out the Judith Basin from Shellanne east to Fort Buford Truly it was a gathering of the clans such as eastern Montana had never before seen 
7705_101578_000016_000000	train-clean-360	For a day and a night the cowboys made merry in town while their foremen consulted and the captains appointed by the Association mapped out the different routes 
7705_101578_000016_000001	train-clean-360	At times like these foremen such as Park and Deacon Smith were shorn of their accustomed power and worked under orders as strict as those they gave their men 
none	none	Their future movements thoroughly understood the army moved down upon the range in companies of five and six crews and the long summer s work began each rider a unit in the war against the chaos which the winter had wrought in the fight of the stockmen to wrest back their fortunes from the wilderness and to hold once more their sway over the range land Their method called for concerted action although it was simple enough Two of the Lazy Eight wagons under Park and Gene Wasson for Hank that spring was running four crews and had promoted Gene wagon boss of one joined forces with the Circle Bar the Flying U and a Yellowstone outfit whose wagon boss knowing best the range was captain of the five crews and drove north gathering and holding all stock which properly ranged beyond the Missouri 
7705_101578_000019_000000	train-clean-360	That meant day after day of riding circle which is being interpreted riding out ten or twelve miles from camp then turning and driving everything before them to a point near the center of the circle thus formed 
7705_101578_000019_000001	train-clean-360	When they met the cattle were bunched and all stock which belonged on that range was cut out leaving only those which had crossed the river during the storms of winter 
7705_101578_000019_000002	train-clean-360	These were driven on to the next camping place and held which meant constant day herding and night guarding work which cowboys hate more than anything else 
none	none	There would be no calf roundup proper that spring for all calves were branded as they were gathered Many there were among the she stock that would not cross the river again their carcasses made unsightly blots in the coulee bottoms and on the wind swept levels Of the calves that had followed their mothers on the long trail hundreds had dropped out of the march and been left behind for the wolves 
7705_101578_000020_000003	train-clean-360	But not all 
none	none	Range bred cattle are blessed with rugged constitutions and can bear much of cold and hunger The cow that can turn tail to a biting wind the while she ploughs to the eyes in snow and roots out a very satisfactory living for herself breeds calves that will in time do likewise and grow fat and strong in the doing 
7705_101578_000020_000006	train-clean-360	He is a sturdy self reliant little rascal is the range bred calf 
none	none	When fifteen hundred head of mixed stock bearing Northern brands were in the hands of the day herders Park and his crew were detailed to take them on and turn them loose upon their own range north of Milk River Thurston felt that he had gleaned about all the experience he needed and more than enough hard riding and short sleeping and hurried eating He announced that he was ready to bid good by to the range 
7705_101578_000021_000001	train-clean-360	He would help take the herd home he told Park and then he intended to hit the trail for little old New York 
none	none	He still agreed with the meadow larks that the world was good but he had made himself believe that he really thought the civilized portion of it was better especially when the uncivilized part holds a girl who persists in saying no when she should undoubtedly say yes and insists that a man must be a hero else she will have none of him 
7705_101579_000001_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XII 
7705_101579_000001_000001	train-clean-360	HIGH WATER
7705_101579_000002_000000	train-clean-360	It was nearing the middle of June and it was getting to be a very hot June at that 
none	none	For two days the trail herd had toiled wearily over the hills and across the coulees between the Missouri and Milk River 
7705_101579_000002_000002	train-clean-360	Then the sky threatened for a day and after that they plodded in the rain 
7705_101579_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank the Lord that s done with sighed Park when he saw the last of the herd climb all dripping up the north bank of the Milk River To morrow we can turn em loose 
7705_101579_000003_000001	train-clean-360	And I tell yuh Bud we didn t get across none too soon 
7705_101579_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Yuh notice how the river s coming up 
7705_101579_000003_000003	train-clean-360	A day later and we d have had to hold the herd on the other side no telling how long 
7705_101579_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 It is higher than usual I noticed that Thurston agreed absently 
none	none	He was thinking more of Mona just then than of the river He wondered if she would be at home 
7705_101579_000004_000003	train-clean-360	He could easily ride down there and find out It wasn t far not a quarter of a mile but he assured himself that he wasn t going and that he was not quite a fool he hoped Even if she were at home what good could that possibly do him 
none	none	Just give him several bad nights when he would lie in his corner of the tent and listen to the boys snoring with a different key for every man 
7705_101579_000004_000005	train-clean-360	Such nights were not pleasant nor were the thoughts that caused them 
7705_101579_000005_000000	train-clean-360	From where they were camped upon a ridge which bounded a broad coulee on the east he could look down upon the Stevens ranch nestling in the bottomland the house half hidden among the cottonwoods 
7705_101579_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Through the last hours of the afternoon he watched it hungrily 
7705_101579_000005_000002	train-clean-360	The big corral ran down to the water s edge and he noted idly that three panels of the fence extended out into the river and that the muddy water was creeping steadily up until at sundown the posts of the first panel barely showed above the water 
7705_101579_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Park came up to him and looked down upon the little valley 
none	none	I never did see any sense in Jack Stevens building where he did he remarked There ain t a June flood that don t put his corral under water and some uh these days it s going to get the house He was too lazy to dig a well back on high ground he d rather take chances on having the whole business washed off the face uh the earth
7705_101579_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 There must be danger of it this year if ever Thurston observed uneasily 
7705_101579_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 The river is coming up pretty fast it seems to me 
none	none	It must have raised three feet since we crossed this afternoon I ll course there s danger with all that snow coming out uh the mountains And like as not Jack s in Shellanne roosting on somebody s pool table and telling it scary instead uh staying at home looking after his stuff 
7705_101579_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Where yuh going Bud 
7705_101579_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I m going to ride down there Thurston answered constrainedly 
none	none	The women may be all alone
7705_101579_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I ll go along if you ll hold on a minute 
7705_101579_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Jack ain t got a lick uh sense 
7705_101579_000010_000002	train-clean-360	I don t care if he is Mona s brother 
7705_101579_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Half brother corrected Thurston as he swung up into the saddle 
7705_101579_000011_000001	train-clean-360	He had a poor opinion of Jack and resented even that slight relation to Mona 
none	none	The road was soggy with the rain which fell steadily down in the bottom the low places in the road were already under water and the river widening almost perceptibly in its headlong rush down the narrow valley crept inch by inch up its low banks 
7705_101579_000012_000001	train-clean-360	When they galloped into the yard which sloped from the house gently down to the river fifty yards away Mona s face appeared for a moment in the window 
7705_101579_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Evidently she had been watching for some one and Thurston s heart flopped in his chest as he wondered fleetingly if it could be himself 
7705_101579_000012_000003	train-clean-360	When she opened the door her eyes greeted him with a certain wistful expression that he had never seen in them before 
7705_101579_000012_000004	train-clean-360	He was guilty of wishing that Park had stayed in camp 
7705_101579_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I m glad you rode over she welcomed but she was careful after that first swift glance to look at Park 
none	none	Jack wasn t at camp was he He went to town this morning and I looked for hi back long before now But it s a mistake ever to look for Jack until he s actually in sight 
7705_101579_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Park smiled vaguely 
7705_101579_000014_000001	train-clean-360	He was afraid it would not be polite to agree with her as emphatically as he would like to have done 
7705_101579_000014_000002	train-clean-360	But Thurston had no smile ready polite or otherwise 
7705_101579_000014_000003	train-clean-360	Instead he drew down his brows in a way not complimentary to Jack 
7705_101579_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Where is your mother he asked almost peremptorily 
none	none	Mamma went to Great Falls last week she told him primly just grazing him with one of her impersonal glances which nearly drove him to desperation
7705_101579_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 Aunt Mary has typhoid fever there seems to be so much of that this spring and they sent for mamma 
none	none	She s such a splendid nurse you know 
7705_101579_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Thurston did know but he passed over the subject 
none	none	And you re alone he demanded
7705_101579_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Certainly not aren t you two here Mona could be very pert when she tried 
7705_101579_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 Jack and I are holding down the ranch just now the boys are all on roundup of course 
7705_101579_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Jack went to town today to see some one 
7705_101579_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Um m yes of course 
7705_101579_000019_000001	train-clean-360	It was Park still trying to be polite and not commit himself on the subject of Jack 
7705_101579_000019_000002	train-clean-360	The some one whom Jack went oftenest to see was the bartender in the Palace saloon but it was not necessary to tell her that 
7705_101579_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 The river s coming up pretty fast Mona he ventured 
7705_101579_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 Don t yuh think yuh ought to pull out and go visiting 
7705_101579_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 No I don t Mona s tone was very decided 
none	none	I wouldn t drop down on a neighbor without warning just because the river happens to be coming up It has come up every June since we ve been living here and there have been several of them At the worst it never came inside the gate
7705_101579_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 You can never tell what it might do Park argued 
none	none	Yuh know yourself there s never been so much snow in the mountains 
7705_101579_000022_000002	train-clean-360	This hot weather we ve been having lately and then the rain will bring it a whooping 
none	none	Can t yuh ride over to the Jonses One of us ll go with yuh
7705_101579_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 No I can t Mona s chin went up perversely 
7705_101579_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 I m no coward I hope even if there was any danger which there isn t 
7705_101579_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Thurston s chin went up also and he sat a bit straighter 
7705_101579_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Whether she meant it or not he took her words as a covert stab at himself 
7705_101579_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Probably she did not mean it at any rate the blood flew consciously to her cheeks after she had spoken and she caught her under lip sharply between her teeth 
7705_101579_000024_000003	train-clean-360	And that did not help matters or make her temper more yielding 
7705_101579_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Anyway she added hurriedly Jack will be here he s likely to come any minute now 
none	none	Uh course if Jack s got some new kind of half hitch he can put on the river and hold it back yuh ll be all right fleered Park with the freedom of an old friend He had known Mona when she wore dresses to her shoe tops and her hair in long brown curls down her back She wrinkled her nose at him also with the freedom of an old friend and Thurston stirred restlessly in his chair 
7705_101579_000027_000001	train-clean-360	He did not like even Park to be too familiar with Mona though he knew there was a girl in Shellanne whose name Park sometimes spoke in his sleep 
7705_101579_000028_000000	train-clean-360	She lifted the big glass lamp down from its place on the clock shelf and lighted it with fingers not quite steady 
7705_101579_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 You men she remarked think women ought to be wrapped in pink cotton and put in a glass cabinet 
none	none	If by any miracle the river should come up around the house I flatter myself I should be able to cope with the situation I d just saddle my horse and ride out to high ground
7705_101579_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Would yuh Park grinned skeptically 
none	none	The road from here to the hill is half under water right now the river s got over the bank above and is flooding down through the horse pasture By the time the water got up here the river d be as wide and deep one side uh yuh as the other 
7705_101579_000029_000003	train-clean-360	Then where d yuh be at 
7705_101579_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 It won t get up here though Mona asserted coolly 
none	none	It never has
7705_101579_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 No and the Lazy Eight never had to work the Yellowstone range on spring roundup before either Park told her meaningly 
7705_101579_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Whereupon Mona got upon her pedestal and smiled her unpleasant smile against which even Park had no argument ready 
7705_101579_000033_000000	train-clean-360	They lingered till long after all good cowpunchers are supposed to be in their beds unless they are standing night guard but Jack failed to appear 
none	none	The rain drummed upon the roof and the river swished and gurgled against the crumbling banks and grumbled audibly to itself because the hills stood immovably in their places and set bounds which it could not pass however much it might rage against their base 
7705_101579_000034_000000	train-clean-360	When the clock struck a wheezy nine Mona glanced at it significantly and smothered a yawn more than half affected 
7705_101579_000034_000001	train-clean-360	It was a hint which no man with an atom of self respect could overlook 
none	none	With mutual understanding the two rose
7705_101579_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I guess we ll have to be going Park said with some ceremony 
none	none	I kept think ing maybe Jack would show up it ain t right to leave yuh here alone like this
7705_101579_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t see why not I m not the least bit afraid Mona said 
7705_101579_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Her tone was impersonal and had in it a note of dismissal 
7705_101579_000037_000000	train-clean-360	So there being nothing else that they could do they said good night and took themselves off 
7705_101579_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 This is sure fierce Park grumbled when they struck the lower ground Darn a man like Jack Stevens 
none	none	He ll hang out there in town and bowl up on other men s money till plumb daylight It s a wonder Mona didn t go with her mother 
7705_101579_000038_000003	train-clean-360	But no it d be awful if Jack had to cook his own grub for a week 
7705_101579_000038_000004	train-clean-360	Say the water has come up a lot don t yuh think Bud If it raises much more Mona ll sure have a chance to cope with the situation 
7705_101579_000038_000005	train-clean-360	It d just about serve her right too 
7705_101579_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Thurston did not think so but he was in too dispirited a mood to argue the point 
none	none	It had not been good for his peace of mind to sit and watch the color come and go in Mona s cheeks and the laughter spring unheralded into her dear big eyes and the light tangle itself in the waves of her hair He guided his horse carefully through the deep places and noted uneasily how much deeper it was than when they had crossed before 
7705_101579_000040_000001	train-clean-360	He cursed the conventions which forbade his staying and watching over the girl back there in the house which already stood upon an island cut off from the safe high land by a strip of backwater that was widening and deepening every minute and when it rose high enough to flow into the river below would have a current that would make a nasty crossing 
7705_101579_000041_000000	train-clean-360	On the first rise he stopped and looked back at the light which shone out from among the dripping cottonwoods 
7705_101579_000041_000001	train-clean-360	Even then he was tempted to go back and brave her anger that he might feel assured of her safety 
7705_101579_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh come on Park cried impatiently 
none	none	We can t do any good sitting out here in the rain 
7705_101579_000042_000002	train-clean-360	I don t suppose the water will get clear up to the house it ll likely do things to the sheds and corrals though and serve Jack right 
7705_101579_000042_000003	train-clean-360	Come on Bud 
none	none	Mona won t have us around so the sooner we get under cover the better for us 
7705_101579_000042_000005	train-clean-360	She s got lots uh nerve I guess she ll make out all right 
7705_101579_000043_000000	train-clean-360	There was common sense in the argument and Thurston recognized it and rode on to camp 
7705_101579_000043_000001	train-clean-360	But instead of unsaddling as he would naturally have done he tied Sunfish to the bed wagon and threw his slicker over his back to protect him from the rain 
none	none	And though Park said nothing he followed Thurston s example CHAPTER XIII
7705_101580_000000_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll STAY ALWAYS 
none	none	For a long time Thurston lay with wide open eyes staring up at nothing listening to the rain and thinking 
7705_101580_000001_000001	train-clean-360	By and by the rain ceased and he could tell by the dim whiteness of the tent roof that the clouds must have been swept away from before the moon then just past the full 
none	none	He got up carefully so as not to disturb the others and crept over two or three sleeping forms on his way to the opening untied the flap and went out The whole hilltop and the valley below were bathed in mellow radiance 
7705_101580_000002_000002	train-clean-360	He studied critically the wide sweep of the river 
7705_101580_000002_000003	train-clean-360	He might almost have thought it the Missouri itself it stretched so far from bank to bank indeed it seemed to know no banks but the hills themselves 
7705_101580_000002_000004	train-clean-360	He turned toward where the light had shone among the cottonwoods below there was nothing but a great blot of shade that told him nothing 
7705_101580_000003_000000	train-clean-360	A step sounded just behind 
7705_101580_000003_000001	train-clean-360	A hand the hand of Park rested upon his shoulder 
none	none	Looks kinda dubious don t it kid 
7705_101580_000003_000003	train-clean-360	Was yuh thinking about riding down there 
7705_101580_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Thurston answered simply 
7705_101580_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 Are you coming 
7705_101580_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Sure Park assented 
7705_101580_000006_000000	train-clean-360	They got upon their horses and headed down the trail to the Stevens place 
7705_101580_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Thurston would have put Sunfish to a run but Park checked him 
7705_101580_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Go easy he admonished 
none	none	If there s swimming to be done and it s a cinch there will be he s going to need all the wind he s got 
7705_101580_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Down the hill they stopped at the edge of a raging torrent and strained their eyes to see what lay on the other side 
7705_101580_000008_000001	train-clean-360	While they looked a light twinkled out from among the tree tops 
7705_101580_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Thurston caught his breath sharply 
7705_101580_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 She s upstairs he said and his voice sounded strained and unnatural It s just a loft where they store stuff He started to ride into the flood 
7705_101580_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Come on back here yuh chump Park roared 
none	none	Get off and loosen the cinch before yuh go in there or yuh won t get far Sunfish ll need room to breathe once he gets to bucking that current He s a good water horse just give him his head and don t get rattled and interfere with him And we ve got to go up a ways before we start in He led the way upstream skirting under the bluff and Thurston chafing against the delay followed obediently Trees were racing down their clean washed roots reaching up in a tangle from the water their branches waving like imploring arms 
7705_101580_000011_000002	train-clean-360	A black tar papered shack went scudding past lodged upon a ridge where the water was shallower and sat there swaying drunkenly 
none	none	Upon it a great yellow cat clung and yowled his fear
7705_101580_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 That s old Dutch Henry s house Park shouted above the roar 
7705_101580_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll bet he s cussing things blue on some pinnacle up there He laughed at the picture his imagination conjured and rode out into the swirl 
none	none	Thurston kept close behind mindful of Park s command to give Sunfish his head Sunfish had carried him safely out of the stampede and he had no fear of him now His chief thought was a wish that he might do this thing quite alone He was jealous of Park s leading and thought bitterly that Mona would thank Park alone and pass him by with scant praise and he did so want to vindicate himself The next minute he was cursing his damnable selfishness A tree had swept down just before him caught Park and his horse in its branches and hurried on as if ashamed of what it had done Thurston in that instant came near jerking Sunfish around to follow but he checked the impulse as it was formed and left the reins alone which was wise 
7705_101580_000014_000003	train-clean-360	He could not have helped Park and he could very easily have drowned himself 
7705_101580_000014_000004	train-clean-360	Though it was not thought of himself but of Mona that stayed his hand 
7705_101580_000015_000000	train-clean-360	They landed at the gate 
7705_101580_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Sunfish scrambled with his feet for secure footing found it and waded up to the front door 
7705_101580_000015_000002	train-clean-360	The water was a foot deep on the porch 
7705_101580_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Thurston beat an imperative tattoo upon the door with the butt of his quirt and shouted 
7705_101580_000015_000004	train-clean-360	And Mona s voice shorn of its customary assurance answered faintly from the loft 
none	none	He shouted again giving directions in a tone of authority which must have sounded strange to her but which she did not seem to resent and obeyed without protest She had to wade from the stairs to the door and when Thurston stooped and lifted her up in front of him she looked as if she were very glad to have him there
7705_101580_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 You didn t cope with the situation after all he remarked while she was settling herself firmly in the saddle 
7705_101580_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 I went to sleep and didn t notice the water till it was coming in at the door she explained 
none	none	And then 
7705_101580_000018_000002	train-clean-360	She stopped abruptly 
7705_101580_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Then what he demanded maliciously 
7705_101580_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 Were you afraid 
7705_101580_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 A little she confessed reluctantly 
none	none	Thurston gloated over it in silence until he remembered Park 
7705_101580_000021_000001	train-clean-360	After that he could think of little else 
none	none	As before now Sunfish battled as seemed to him best for Thurston astride behind the saddle held Mona somewhat tighter than he need to have done and let the horse go So long as Sunfish had footing he braced himself against the mad rush of waters and forged ahead But out where the current ran swimming deep he floundered desperately under his double burden While his strength lasted he kept his head above water struggling gamely against the flood that lapped over his back and bubbled in his nostrils 
7705_101580_000022_000003	train-clean-360	Thurston felt his laboring and clutched Mona still tighter 
none	none	Of a sudden the horse s head went under the black water came up around Thurston s throat with a hungry swish and Sunfish went out from under him like an eel There was a confused roaring in his ears a horrid sense of suffocation for a moment But he had learned to swim when he was a boy at school and he freed one hand from its grip on Mona and set to paddling with much vigor and considerably less skill 
7705_101580_000023_000002	train-clean-360	And though the under current clutched him and the weight of Mona taxed his strength he managed to keep them both afloat and to make a little headway until the deepest part lay behind them 
none	none	How thankful he was when his feet touched bottom no one but himself ever knew His ears hummed from the water in them and the roar of the river was to him as the roar of the sea his eyes smarted from the clammy touch of the dingy froth that went hurrying by in monster flakes his lungs ached and his heart pounded heavily against his ribs when he stopped gasping beyond reach of the water devils that lapped viciously behind 
7705_101580_000025_000000	train-clean-360	He stood a minute with his arm still around her and coughed his voice clear 
7705_101580_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 Park went down he began hardly knowing what it was he was saying 
none	none	Park He stopped then shouted the name aloud Park Oh h Park 
7705_101580_000026_000000	train-clean-360	And from somewhere down the river came a faint reassuring whoop 
7705_101580_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank the Lord gasped Thurston and leaned against her for a second Then he straightened 
7705_101580_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 Are you all right he asked and drew her toward a rock near at hand for in truth the knees of him were shaking 
7705_101580_000027_000002	train-clean-360	They sat down and he looked more closely at her face and discovered that it was wet with something more than river water 
none	none	Mona the self assured Mona the strong hearted was crying And instinctively he knew that not the chill alone made her shiver He was keeping his arm around her waist deliberately and it pleased him that she let it stay After a minute she did something which surprised him mightily and pleased him more she dropped her face down against the soaked lapels of his coat and left it there 
7705_101580_000027_000007	train-clean-360	He laid a hand tenderly against her cheek and wondered if he dared feel so happy 
7705_101580_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Little girl oh little girl he said softly and stopped 
none	none	For the crowding emotions in his heart and brain the English language has no words Mona lifted her face and looked into his eyes Her own were soft and shining in the moonlight and she was smiling a little the roguish little smile of the imitation pastel portrait You you ll unpack your typewriter won t you please and and stay Thurston crushed her close Stay The range land will never get rid of me now he cried jubilantly
7705_101580_000030_000003	train-clean-360	 Hank wanted to take me into the Lazy Eight so now I ll buy an interest and stay always 
7705_101580_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 You dear Mona snuggled close and learned how it feels to be kissed if she had never known before 
7705_101580_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Sunfish having scrambled ashore a few yards farther down came up to them and stood waiting as if to be forgiven for his failure to carry them safe to land but Thurston after the first inattentive glance ungratefully took no heed of him 
7705_101580_000033_000000	train-clean-360	There was a sound of scrambling foot steps and Park came dripping up to them 
none	none	Well say he greeted Ain t yuh got anything to do but set here and er look at the moon Break away and come up to camp 
7705_101580_000033_000004	train-clean-360	I ll rout out the cook and make him boil us some coffee 
7705_101580_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Thurston turned joyfully toward him 
7705_101580_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 Park old fellow I was afraid 
7705_101580_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Yuh better reform and quit being afraid Park bantered 
none	none	I got out uh the mix up fine but I guess my horse went on down poor devil 
7705_101580_000035_000002	train-clean-360	I was poking around below there looking for him 
7705_101580_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Well Mona I see yuh was able to cope with the situation all right but yuh needed Bud mighty bad I reckon 
7705_101580_000036_000001	train-clean-360	The chances is yuh won t have no house in the morning so Bud ll have to get busy and rustle one for yuh 
7705_101580_000036_000002	train-clean-360	I guess you ll own up now that the water can get through the gate He laughed in his teasing way 
7705_101580_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Mona stood up and her shining eyes were turned to Thurston 
7705_101580_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 I don t care she asserted with reddened cheeks 
7705_101580_000037_000002	train-clean-360	 I m just glad it did get through 
7705_101580_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Same here said Thurston with much emphasis 
7705_101580_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Then with Mona once more in the saddle and with Thurston leading Sunfish by the bridle rein they trailed damply and happily up the long ridge to where the white tents of the roundup gleamed sharply against the sky line
