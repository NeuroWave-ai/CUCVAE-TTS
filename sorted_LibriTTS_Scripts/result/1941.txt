GUTENBERG EBOOK LETTERS OF TWO BRIDES Produced by John Bickers and Dagny LETTERS OF TWO BRIDES By Honore de Balzac Translated by R S Scott DEDICATION To George Sand Your name dear George while casting a reflected radiance on my book can gain no new glory from this page And yet it is neither self interest nor diffidence which has led me to place it there but only the wish that it should bear witness to the solid friendship between us which has survived our wanderings and separations and triumphed over the busy malice of the world This feeling is hardly likely now to change The goodly company of friendly names which will remain attached to my works forms an element of pleasure in the midst of the vexation caused by their increasing number Each fresh book in fact gives rise to fresh annoyance were it only in the reproaches aimed at my too prolific pen as though it could rival in fertility the world from which I draw my models Would it not be a fine thing George if the future antiquarian of dead literatures were to find in this company none but great names and generous hearts friends bound by pure and holy ties the illustrious figures of the century May I not justly pride myself on this assured possession rather than on a popularity necessarily unstable For him who knows you well it is happiness to be able to sign himself as I do here Your friend DE BALZAC PARIS June eighteen forty LETTERS OF TWO BRIDES FIRST PART I LOUISE DE CHAULIEU TO RENEE DE MAUCOMBE PARIS September Sweetheart I too am free And I am the first too unless you have written to Blois at our sweet tryst of letter writing Raise those great black eyes of yours fixed on my opening sentence and keep this excitement for the letter which shall tell you of my first love By the way why always first Is there I wonder a second love Don t go running on like this you will say but tell me rather how you made your escape from the convent where you were to take your vows Well dear I don t know about the Carmelites but the miracle of my own deliverance was I can assure you most humdrum The cries of an alarmed conscience triumphed over the dictates of a stern policy there s the whole mystery The sombre melancholy which seized me after you left hastened the happy climax my aunt did not want to see me die of a decline and my mother whose one unfailing cure for my malady was a novitiate gave way before her So I am in Paris thanks to you my love Dear Renee could you have seen me the day I found myself parted from you well might you have gloried in the deep impression you had made on so youthful a bosom We had lived so constantly together sharing our dreams and letting our fancy roam together that I verily believe our souls had become welded together like those two Hungarian girls whose death we heard about from M Beauvisage poor misnamed being Never surely was man better cut out by nature for the post of convent physician Tell me did you not droop and sicken with your darling In my gloomy depression I could do nothing but count over the ties which bind us But it seemed as though distance had loosened them I wearied of life like a turtle dove widowed of her mate Death smiled sweetly on me and I was proceeding quietly to die To be at Blois at the Carmelites consumed by dread of having to take my vows there a Mlle de la Valliere but without her prelude and without my Renee How could I not be sick sick unto death How different it used to be That monotonous existence where every hour brings its duty its prayer its task with such desperate regularity that you can tell what a Carmelite sister is doing in any place at any hour of the night or day that deadly dull routine which crushes out all interest in one s surroundings had become for us two a world of life and movement Imagination had thrown open her fairy realms and in these our spirits ranged at will each in turn serving as magic steed to the other the more alert quickening the drowsy the world from which our bodies were shut out became the playground of our fancy which reveled there in frolicsome adventure The very Lives of the Saints helped us to understand what was so carefully left unsaid But the day when I was reft of your sweet company I became a true Carmelite such as they appeared to us a modern Danaid who instead of trying to fill a bottomless barrel draws every day from Heaven knows what deep an empty pitcher thinking to find it full My aunt knew nothing of this inner life How could she who has made a paradise for herself within the two acres of her convent understand my revolt against life A religious life if embraced by girls of our age demands either an extreme simplicity of soul such as we sweetheart do not possess or else an ardor for self sacrifice like that which makes my aunt so noble a character But she sacrificed herself for a brother to whom she was devoted to do the same for an unknown person or an idea is surely more than can be asked of mortals For the last fortnight I have been gulping down so many reckless words burying so many reflections in my bosom and accumulating such a store of things to tell fit for your ear alone that I should certainly have been suffocated but for the resource of letter writing as a sorry substitute for our beloved talks How hungry one s heart gets I am beginning my journal this morning and I picture to myself that yours is already started and that in a few days I shall be at home in your beautiful Gemenos valley which I know only through your descriptions just as you will live that Paris life revealed to you hitherto only in our dreams Well then sweet child know that on a certain morning a red letter day in my life there arrived from Paris a lady companion and Philippe the last remaining of my grandmother s valets charged to carry me off When my aunt summoned me to her room and told me the news I could not speak for joy and only gazed at her stupidly My child she said in her guttural voice I can see that you leave me without regret but this farewell is not the last we shall meet again God has placed on your forehead the sign of the elect You have the pride which leads to heaven or to hell but your nature is too noble to choose the downward path I know you better than you know yourself with you passion I can see will be very different from what it is with most women She drew me gently to her and kissed my forehead The kiss made my flesh creep for it burned with that consuming fire which eats away her life which has turned to black the azure of her eyes and softened the lines about them has furrowed the warm ivory of her temples and cast a sallow tinge over the beautiful face Before replying I kissed her hands Dear aunt I said I shall never forget your kindness and if it has not made your nunnery all that it ought to be for my health of body and soul you may be sure nothing short of a broken heart will bring me back again and that you would not wish for me You will not see me here again till my royal lover has deserted me and I warn you that if I catch him death alone shall tear him from me I fear no Montespan She smiled and said Go madcap and take your idle fancies with you There is certainly more of the bold Montespan in you than of the gentle la Valliere I threw my arms round her The poor lady could not refrain from escorting me to the carriage There her tender gaze was divided between me and the armorial bearings At Beaugency night overtook me still sunk in a stupor of the mind produced by these strange parting words What can be awaiting me in this world for which I have so hungered To begin with I found no one to receive me my heart had been schooled in vain My mother was at the Bois de Boulogne my father at the Council my brother the Duc de Rhetore never comes in I am told till it is time to dress for dinner Miss Griffith she is not unlike a griffin and Philippe took me to my rooms The suite is the one which belonged to my beloved grandmother the Princess de Vauremont to whom I owe some sort of a fortune which no one has ever told me about As you read this you will understand the sadness which came over me as I entered a place sacred to so many memories and found the rooms just as she had left them I was to sleep in the bed where she died Sitting down on the edge of the sofa I burst into tears forgetting I was not alone and remembering only how often I had stood there by her knees the better to hear her words There I had gazed upon her face buried in its brown laces and worn as much by age as by the pangs of approaching death The room seemed to me still warm with the heat which she kept up there How comes it that Armande Louise Marie de Chaulieu must be like some peasant girl who sleeps in her mother s bed the very morrow of her death For to me it was as though the Princess who died in eighteen seventeen had passed away but yesterday I saw many things in the room which ought to have been removed Their presence showed the carelessness with which people busy with the affairs of state may treat their own and also the little thought which had been given since her death to this grand old lady who will always remain one of the striking figures of the eighteenth century Philippe seemed to divine something of the cause of my tears He told me that the furniture of the Princess had been left to me in her will and that my father had allowed all the larger suites to remain dismantled as the Revolution had left them On hearing this I rose and Philippe opened the door of the small drawing room which leads into the reception rooms In these I found all the well remembered wreckage the panels above the doors which had contained valuable pictures bare of all but empty frames broken marbles mirrors carried off In old days I was afraid to go up the state staircase and cross these vast deserted rooms so I used to get to the Princess rooms by a small staircase which runs under the arch of the larger one and leads to the secret door of her dressing room My suite consisting of a drawing room bedroom and the pretty morning room in scarlet and gold of which I have told you lies in the wing on the side of the Invalides The house is only separated from the boulevard by a wall covered with creepers and by a splendid avenue of trees which mingle their foliage with that of the young elms on the sidewalk of the boulevard But for the blue and gold dome of the Invalides and its gray stone mass you might be in a wood The style of decoration in these rooms together with their situation indicates that they were the old show suite of the duchesses while the dukes must have had theirs in the wing opposite The two suites are decorously separated by the two main blocks as well as by the central one which contained those vast gloomy resounding halls shown me by Philippe all despoiled of their splendor as in the days of my childhood Philippe grew quite confidential when he saw the surprise depicted on my countenance For you must know that in this home of diplomacy the very servants have a reserved and mysterious air He went on to tell me that it was expected a law would soon be passed restoring to the fugitives of the Revolution the value of their property and that my father is waiting to do up his house till this restitution is made the king s architect having estimated the damage at three hundred thousand livres This piece of news flung me back despairing on my drawing room sofa Could it be that my father instead of spending this money in arranging a marriage for me would have left me to die in the convent This was the first thought to greet me on the threshold of my home Ah Renee what would I have given then to rest my head upon your shoulder or to transport myself to the days when my grandmother made the life of these rooms You two in all the world have been alone in loving me you away at Maucombe and she who survives only in my heart the dear old lady whose still youthful eyes used to open from sleep at my call How well we understood each other These memories suddenly changed my mood What at first had seemed profanation now breathed of holy association It was sweet to inhale the faint odor of the powder she loved still lingering in the room sweet to sleep beneath the shelter of those yellow damask curtains with their white pattern which must have retained something of the spirit emanating from her eyes and breath I told Philippe to rub up the old furniture and make the rooms look as if they were lived in I explained to him myself how I wanted everything arranged and where to put each piece of furniture In this way I entered into possession and showed how an air of youth might be given to the dear old things The bedroom is white in color a little dulled with time just as the gilding of the fanciful arabesques shows here and there a patch of red but this effect harmonizes well with the faded colors of the Savonnerie tapestry which was presented to my grandmother by Louis XV along with his portrait The timepiece was a gift from the Marechal de Saxe and the china ornaments on the mantelpiece came from the Marechal de Richelieu My grandmother s portrait painted at the age of twenty five hangs in an oval frame opposite that of the King The Prince her husband is conspicuous by his absence I like this frank negligence untinged by hypocrisy a characteristic touch which sums up her charming personality Once when my grandmother was seriously ill her confessor was urgent that the Prince who was waiting in the drawing room should be admitted He can come in with the doctor and his drugs was the reply The bed has a canopy and well stuffed back and the curtains are looped up with fine wide bands The furniture is of gilded wood upholstered in the same yellow damask with white flowers which drapes the windows and which is lined there with a white silk that looks as though it were watered The panels over the doors have been painted by what artist I can t say but they represent one a sunrise the other a moonlight scene The fireplace is a very interesting feature in the room It is easy to see that life in the last century centered largely round the hearth where great events were enacted The copper gilt grate is a marvel of workmanship and the mantelpiece is most delicately finished the fire irons are beautifully chased the bellows are a perfect gem The tapestry of the screen comes from the Gobelins and is exquisitely mounted charming fantastic figures run all over the frame on the feet the supporting bar and the wings the whole thing is wrought like a fan Dearly should I like to know who was the giver of this dainty work of art which was such a favorite with her How often have I seen the old lady her feet upon the bar reclining in the easy chair with her dress half raised in front toying with the snuff box which lay upon the ledge between her box of pastilles and her silk mits What a coquette she was to the day of her death she took as much pains with her appearance as though the beautiful portrait had been painted only yesterday and she were waiting to receive the throng of exquisites from the Court How the armchair recalls to me the inimitable sweep of her skirts as she sank back in it These women of a past generation have carried off with them secrets which are very typical of their age The Princess had a certain turn of the head a way of dropping her glance and her remarks a choice of words which I look for in vain even in my mother There was subtlety in it all and there was good nature the points were made without any affectation Her talk was at once lengthy and concise she told a good story and could put her meaning in three words Above all she was extremely free thinking and this has undoubtedly had its effect on my way of looking at things From seven years old till I was ten I never left her side it pleased her to attract me as much as it pleased me to go This preference was the cause of more than one passage at arms between her and my mother and nothing intensifies feeling like the icy breath of persecution How charming was her greeting Here you are little rogue when curiosity had taught me how to glide with stealthy snake like movements to her room She felt that I loved her and this childish affection was welcome as a ray of sunshine in the winter of her life I don t know what went on in her rooms at night but she had many visitors and when I came on tiptoe in the morning to see if she were awake I would find the drawing room furniture disarranged the card tables set out and patches of snuff scattered about This drawing room is furnished in the same style as the bedroom The chairs and tables are oddly shaped with claw feet and hollow mouldings Rich garlands of flowers beautifully designed and carved wind over the mirrors and hang down in festoons On the consoles are fine china vases The ground colors are scarlet and white My grandmother was a high spirited striking brunette as might be inferred from her choice of colors I have found in the drawing room a writing table I remember well the figures on it used to fascinate me it is plaited in graven silver and was a present from one of the Genoese Lomellini Each side of the table represents the occupations of a different season there are hundreds of figures in each picture and all in relief I remained alone for two hours while old memories rose before me one after another on this spot hallowed by the death of a woman most remarkable even among the witty and beautiful Court ladies of Louis XV s day You know how abruptly I was parted from her at a day s notice in eighteen sixteen Go and bid good bye to your grandmother said my mother The Princess received me as usual without any display of feeling and expressed no surprise at my departure You are going to the convent dear she said and will see your aunt there who is an excellent woman I shall take care though that they don t make a victim of you you shall be independent and able to marry whom you please Six months later she died Her will had been given into the keeping of the Prince de Talleyrand the most devoted of all her old friends He contrived while paying a visit to Mlle de Chargeboeuf to intimate to me through her that my grandmother forbade me to take the vows I hope sooner or later to meet the Prince and then I shall doubtless learn more from him Thus sweetheart if I have found no one in flesh and blood to meet me I have comforted myself with the shade of the dear Princess and have prepared myself for carrying out one of our pledges which was as you know to keep each other informed of the smallest details in our homes and occupations It makes such a difference to know where and how the life of one we love is passed Send me a faithful picture of the veriest trifles around you omitting nothing not even the sunset lights among the tall trees October nineteenth It was three in the afternoon when I arrived About half past five Rose came and told me that my mother had returned so I went downstairs to pay my respects to her My mother lives in a suite on the ground floor exactly corresponding to mine and in the same block I am just over her head and the same secret staircase serves for both My father s rooms are in the block opposite but are larger by the whole of the space occupied by the grand staircase on our side of the building These ancestral mansions are so spacious that my father and mother continue to occupy the ground floor rooms in spite of the social duties which have once more devolved on them with the return of the Bourbons and are even able to receive in them I found my mother dressed for the evening in her drawing room where nothing is changed I came slowly down the stairs speculating with every step how I should be met by this mother who had shown herself so little of a mother to me and from whom during eight years I had heard nothing beyond the two letters of which you know Judging it unworthy to simulate an affection I could not possibly feel I put on the air of a pious imbecile and entered the room with many inward qualms which however soon disappeared My mother s tack was equal to the occasion She made no pretence of emotion she neither held me at arm s length nor hugged me to her bosom like a beloved daughter but greeted me as though we had parted the evening before Her manner was that of the kindliest and most sincere friend as she addressed me like a grown person first kissing me on the forehead My dear little one she said if you were to die at the convent it is much better to live with your family You frustrate your father s plans and mine but the age of blind obedience to parents is past M de Chaulieu s intention and in this I am quite at one with him is to lose no opportunity of making your life pleasant and of letting you see the world At your age I should have thought as you do therefore I am not vexed with you it is impossible you should understand what we expected from you You will not find any absurd severity in me and if you have ever thought me heartless you will soon find out your mistake Still though I wish you to feel perfectly free I think that to begin with you would do well to follow the counsels of a mother who wishes to be a sister to you I was quite charmed by the Duchess who talked in a gentle voice straightening my convent tippet as she spoke At the age of thirty eight she is still exquisitely beautiful She has dark blue eyes with silken lashes a smooth forehead and a complexion so pink and white that you might think she paints Her bust and shoulders are marvelous and her waist is as slender as yours Her hand is milk white and extraordinarily beautiful the nails catch the light in their perfect polish the thumb is like ivory the little finger stands just a little apart from the rest and the foot matches the hand it is the Spanish foot of Mlle de Vandenesse If she is like this at forty at sixty she will still be a beautiful woman I replied sweetheart like a good little girl I was as nice to her as she to me nay nicer Her beauty completely vanquished me it seemed only natural that such a woman should be absorbed in her regal part I told her this as simply as though I had been talking to you I daresay it was a surprise to her to hear words of affection from her daughter s mouth and the unfeigned homage of my admiration evidently touched her deeply Her manner changed and became even more engaging she dropped all formality as she said I am much pleased with you and I hope we shall remain good friends The words struck me as charmingly naive but I did not let this appear for I saw at once that the prudent course was to allow her to believe herself much deeper and cleverer than her daughter So I only stared vacantly and she was delighted I kissed her hands repeatedly telling her how happy it made me to be so treated and to feel at my ease with her I even confided to her my previous tremors She smiled put her arm round my neck and drawing me towards her kissed me on the forehead most affectionately Dear child she said we have people coming to dinner to day Perhaps you will agree with me that it is better for you not to make your first appearance in society till you have been in the dressmaker s hands so after you have seen your father and brother you can go upstairs again I assented most heartily My mother s exquisite dress was the first revelation to me of the world which our dreams had pictured but I did not feel the slightest desire to rival her My father now entered and the Duchess presented me to him He became all at once most affectionate and played the father s part so well that I could not but believe his heart to be in it Taking my two hands in his and kissing them with more of the lover than the father in his manner he said So this is my rebel daughter And he drew me towards him with his arm passed tenderly round my waist while he kissed me on the cheeks and forehead The pleasure with which we shall watch your success in society will atone for the disappointment we felt at your change of vocation he said Then turning to my mother Do you know that she is going to turn out very pretty and you will be proud of her some day Here is your brother Rhetore Alphonse he said to a fine young man who came in here is your convent bred sister who threatens to send her nun s frock to the deuce My brother came up in a leisurely way and took my hand which he pressed Come come you may kiss her said my father And he kissed me on both cheeks I am delighted to see you he said and I take your side against my father I thanked him but could not help thinking he might have come to Blois when he was at Orleans visiting our Marquis brother in his quarters Fearing the arrival of strangers I now withdrew I tidied up my rooms and laid out on the scarlet velvet of my lovely table all the materials necessary for writing to you meditating all the while on my new situation This my fair sweetheart is a true and veracious account of the return of a girl of eighteen after an absence of nine years to the bosom of one of the noblest families in the kingdom I was tired by the journey as well as by all the emotions I had been through so I went to bed in convent fashion at eight o clock after supper They have preserved even a little Saxe service which the dear Princess used when she had a fancy for taking her meals alone II THE SAME TO THE SAME November twenty fifth Next day I found my rooms done out and dusted and even flowers put in the vases by old Philippe I began to feel at home Only it didn t occur to anybody that a Carmelite schoolgirl has an early appetite and Rose had no end of trouble in getting breakfast for me Mlle goes to bed at dinner time she said to me and gets up when the Duke is just returning home I began to write About one o clock my father knocked at the door of the small drawing room and asked if he might come in I opened the door he came in and found me writing to you My dear he began you will have to get yourself clothes and to make these rooms comfortable In this purse you will find twelve thousand francs which is the yearly income I purpose allowing you for your expenses You will make arrangements with your mother as to some governess whom you may like in case Miss Griffith doesn t please you for Mme de Chaulieu will not have time to go out with you in the mornings A carriage and man servant shall be at your disposal Let me keep Philippe I said So be it he replied But don t be uneasy you have money enough of your own to be no burden either to your mother or me May I ask how much I have Certainly my child he said Your grandmother left you five hundred thousand francs this was the amount of her savings for she would not alienate a foot of land from the family This sum has been placed in Government stock and with the accumulated interest now brings in about forty thousand francs a year With this I had purposed making an independence for your second brother and it is here that you have upset my plans Later however it is possible that you may fall in with them It shall rest with yourself for I have confidence in your good sense far more than I had expected I do not need to tell you how a daughter of the Chaulieus ought to behave The pride so plainly written in your features is my best guarantee Safeguards such as common folk surround their daughters with would be an insult in our family A slander reflecting on your name might cost the life of the man bold enough to utter it or the life of one of your brothers if by chance the right should not prevail No more on this subject Good bye little one He kissed me on the forehead and went out I cannot understand the relinquishment of this plan after nine years persistence in it My father s frankness is what I like There is no ambiguity about his words My money ought to belong to his Marquis son Who then has had bowels of mercy My mother My father Or could it be my brother I remained sitting on my grandmother s sofa staring at the purse which my father had left on the mantelpiece at once pleased and vexed that I could not withdraw my mind from the money It is true further speculation was useless My doubts had been cleared up and there was something fine in the way my pride was spared Philippe has spent the morning rushing about among the various shops and workpeople who are to undertake the task of my metamorphosis A famous dressmaker by name Victorine has come as well as a woman for underclothing and a shoemaker I am as impatient as a child to know what I shall be like when I emerge from the sack which constituted the conventual uniform but all these tradespeople take a long time the corset maker requires a whole week if my figure is not to be spoilt You see I have a figure dear this becomes serious Janssen the Operatic shoemaker solemnly assures me that I have my mother s foot The whole morning has gone in these weighty occupations Even a glovemaker has come to take the measure of my hand The underclothing woman has got my orders At the meal which I call dinner and the others lunch my mother told me that we were going together to the milliner s to see some hats so that my taste should be formed and I might be in a position to order my own This burst of independence dazzles me I am like a blind man who has just recovered his sight Now I begin to understand the vast interval which separates a Carmelite sister from a girl in society Of ourselves we could never have conceived it During this lunch my father seemed absent minded and we left him to his thoughts he is deep in the King s confidence I was entirely forgotten but from what I have seen I have no doubt he will remember me when he has need of me He is a very attractive man in spite of his fifty years His figure is youthful he is well made fair and extremely graceful in his movements He has a diplomatic face at once dumb and expressive his nose is long and slender and he has brown eyes What a handsome pair Strange thoughts assail me as it becomes plain to me that these two so perfectly matched in birth wealth and mental superiority live entirely apart and have nothing in common but their name The show of unity is only for the world The cream of the Court and diplomatic circles were here last night Very soon I am going to a ball given by the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse and I shall be presented to the society I am so eager to know A dancing master is coming every morning to give me lessons for I must be able to dance in a month or I can t go to the ball Before dinner my mother came to talk about the governess with me I have decided to keep Miss Griffith who was recommended by the English ambassador Miss Griffith is the daughter of a clergyman her mother was of good family and she is perfectly well bred She is thirty six and will teach me English The good soul is quite handsome enough to have ambitions she is Scotch poor and proud and will act as my chaperon She is to sleep in Rose s room Rose will be under her orders I saw at a glance that my governess would be governed by me In the six days we have been together she has made very sure that I am the only person likely to take an interest in her while for my part I have ascertained that for all her statuesque features she will prove accommodating She seems to me a kindly soul but cautious I have not been able to extract a word of what passed between her and my mother Another trifling piece of news My father has this morning refused the appointment as Minister of State which was offered him This accounts for his preoccupied manner last night He says he would prefer an embassy to the worries of public debate Spain in especial attracts him This news was told me at lunch the one moment of the day when my father mother and brother see each other in an easy way The servants then only come when they are rung for The rest of the day my brother as well as my father spends out of the house My mother has her toilet to make between two and four she is never visible at four o clock she goes out for an hour s drive when she is not dining out she receives from six to seven and the evening is given to entertainments of various kinds theatres balls concerts at homes In short her life is so full that I don t believe she ever has a quarter of an hour to herself She must spend a considerable time dressing in the morning for at lunch which takes place between eleven and twelve she is exquisite The meaning of the things that are said about her is dawning on me She begins the day with a bath barely warmed and a cup of cold coffee with cream then she dresses She is never except on some great emergency called before nine o clock In summer there are morning rides and at two o clock she receives a young man whom I have never yet contrived to see Behold our family life We meet at lunch and dinner though often I am alone with my mother at this latter meal and I foresee that still oftener I shall take it in my own rooms following the example of my grandmother with only Miss Griffith for company for my mother frequently dines out I have ceased to wonder at the indifference my family have shown to me In Paris my dear it is a miracle of virtue to love the people who live with you for you see little enough of them as for the absent they do not exist Knowing as this may sound I have not yet set foot in the streets and am deplorably ignorant I must wait till I am less of the country cousin and have brought my dress and deportment into keeping with the society I am about to enter the whirl of which amazes me even here where only distant murmurs reach my ear So far I have not gone beyond the garden but the Italian opera opens in a few days and my mother has a box there I am crazy with delight at the thought of hearing Italian music and seeing French acting Already I begin to drop convent habits for those of society I spend the evening writing to you till the moment for going to bed arrives This has been postponed to ten o clock the hour at which my mother goes out if she is not at the theatre There are twelve theatres in Paris I am grossly ignorant and I read a lot but quite indiscriminately one book leading to another I find the names of fresh books on the cover of the one I am reading but as I have no one to direct me I light on some which are fearfully dull What modern literature I have read all turns upon love the subject which used to bulk so largely in our thoughts because it seemed that our fate was determined by man and for man But how inferior are these authors to two little girls known as Sweetheart and Darling otherwise Renee and Louise Ah my love what wretched plots what ridiculous situations and what poverty of sentiment Two books however have given me wonderful pleasure Corinne and Adolphe Apropos of this I asked my father one day whether it would be possible for me to see Mme de Stael My father mother and Alphonse all burst out laughing and Alphonse said Where in the world has she sprung from To which my father replied What fools we are She springs from the Carmelites My child Mme de Stael is dead said my mother gently When I finished Adolphe I asked Miss Griffith how a woman could be betrayed Why of course when she loves was her reply Renee tell me do you think we could be betrayed by a man Miss Griffith has at last discerned that I am not an utter ignoramus that I have somewhere a hidden vein of knowledge the knowledge we learned from each other in our random arguments She sees that it is only superficial facts of which I am ignorant The poor thing has opened her heart to me Her curt reply to my question when I compare it with all the sorrows I can imagine makes me feel quite creepy Once more she urged me not to be dazzled by the glitter of society to be always on my guard especially against what most attracted me This is the sum total of her wisdom and I can get nothing more out of her Her lectures therefore become a trifle monotonous and she might be compared in this respect to the bird which has only one cry III THE SAME TO THE SAME December My Darling Here I am ready to make my bow to the world By way of preparation I have been trying to commit all the follies I could think of before sobering down for my entry This morning I have seen myself after many rehearsals well and duly equipped stays shoes curls dress ornaments all in order Following the example of duelists before a meeting I tried my arms in the privacy of my chamber I wanted to see how I would look and had no difficulty in discovering a certain air of victory and triumph bound to carry all before it I mustered all my forces in accordance with that splendid maxim of antiquity Know thyself and boundless was my delight in thus making my own acquaintance Griffith was the sole spectator of this doll s play in which I was at once doll and child You think you know me You are hugely mistaken Here is a portrait then Renee of your sister formerly disguised as a Carmelite now brought to life again as a frivolous society girl She is one of the greatest beauties in France Provence of course excepted I don t see that I can give a more accurate summary of this interesting topic True I have my weak points but were I a man I should adore them They arise from what is most promising in me When you have spent a fortnight admiring the exquisite curves of your mother s arms and that mother the Duchesse de Chaulieu it is impossible my dear not to deplore your own angular elbows Yet there is consolation in observing the fineness of the wrist and a certain grace of line in those hollows which will yet fill out and show plump round and well modeled under the satiny skin The somewhat crude outline of the arms is seen again in the shoulders Strictly speaking indeed I have no shoulders but only two bony blades standing out in harsh relief My figure also lacks pliancy there is a stiffness about the side lines Poof There s the worst out But then the contours are bold and delicate the bright pure flame of health bites into the vigorous lines a flood of life and of blue blood pulses under the transparent skin and the fairest daughter of Eve would seem a Negress beside me I have the foot of a gazelle My joints are finely turned my features of a Greek correctness It is true madame that the flesh tints do not melt into each other but at least they stand out clear and bright In short I am a very pretty green fruit with all the charm of unripeness I see a great likeness to the face in my aunt s old missal which rises out of a violet lily There is no silly weakness in the blue of my insolent eyes the white is pure mother of pearl prettily marked with tiny veins and the thick long lashes fall like a silken fringe My forehead sparkles and the hair grows deliciously it ripples into waves of pale gold growing browner towards the centre whence escape little rebel locks which alone would tell that my fairness is not of the insipid and hysterical type I am a tropical blonde with plenty of blood in my veins a blonde more apt to strike than to turn the cheek What do you think the hairdresser proposed He wanted if you please to smooth my hair into two bands and place over my forehead a pearl kept in place by a gold chain He said it would recall the Middle Ages I told him I was not aged enough to have reached the middle or to need an ornament to freshen me up The nose is slender and the well cut nostrils are separated by a sweet little pink partition an imperious mocking nose with a tip too sensitive ever to grow fat or red Sweetheart if this won t find a husband for a dowerless maiden I m a donkey The ears are daintily curled a pearl hanging from either lobe would show yellow The neck is long and has an undulating motion full of dignity In the shade the white ripens to a golden tinge Perhaps the mouth is a little large But how expressive what a color on the lips how prettily the teeth laugh Then dear there is a harmony running through all What a gait what a voice We have not forgotten how our grandmother s skirts fell into place without a touch In a word I am lovely and charming When the mood comes I can laugh one of our good old laughs and no one will think the less of me the dimples impressed by Comedy s light fingers on my fair cheeks will command respect Or I can let my eyes fall and my heart freeze under my snowy brows I can pose as a Madonna with melancholy swan like neck and the painters virgins will be nowhere my place in heaven would be far above them A man would be forced to chant when he spoke to me So you see my panoply is complete and I can run the whole gamut of coquetry from deepest bass to shrillest treble It is a huge advantage not to be all of one piece Now my mother is neither playful nor virginal Her only attitude is an imposing one when she ceases to be majestic she is ferocious It is difficult for her to heal the wounds she makes whereas I can wound and heal together We are absolutely unlike and therefore there could not possibly be rivalry between us unless indeed we quarreled over the greater or less perfection of our extremities which are similar I take after my father who is shrewd and subtle I have the manner of my grandmother and her charming voice which becomes falsetto when forced but is a sweet toned chest voice at the ordinary pitch of a quiet talk I feel as if I had left the convent to day for the first time For society I do not yet exist I am unknown to it What a ravishing moment I still belong only to myself like a flower just blown unseen yet of mortal eye In spite of this my sweet as I paced the drawing room during my self inspection and saw the poor cast off school clothes a queer feeling came over me Regret for the past anxiety about the future fear of society a long farewell to the pale daisies which we used to pick and strip of their petals in light hearted innocence there was something of all that but strange fantastic visions also rose which I crushed back into the inner depths whence they had sprung and whither I dared not follow them My Renee I have a regular trousseau It is all beautifully laid away and perfumed in the cedar wood drawers with lacquered front of my charming dressing table There are ribbons shoes gloves all in lavish abundance My father has kindly presented me with the pretty gewgaws a girl loves a dressing case toilet service scent box fan sunshade prayer book gold chain cashmere shawl He has also promised to give me riding lessons And I can dance To morrow yes to morrow evening I come out My dress is white muslin and on my head I wear a garland of white roses in Greek style I shall put on my Madonna face I mean to play the simpleton and have all the women on my side My mother is miles away from any idea of what I write to you She believes me quite destitute of mind and would be dumfounded if she read my letter My brother honors me with a profound contempt and is uniformly and politely indifferent He is a handsome young fellow but melancholy and given to moods I have divined his secret though neither the Duke nor Duchess has an inkling of it In spite of his youth and his title he is jealous of his father He has no position in the State no post at Court he never has to say I am going to the Chamber I alone in the house have sixteen hours for meditation My father is absorbed in public business and his own amusements my mother too is never at leisure no member of the household practises self examination they are constantly in company and have hardly time to live I should immensely like to know what is the potent charm wielded by society to keep people prisoner from nine every evening till two or three in the morning and force them to be so lavish alike of strength and money When I longed for it I had no idea of the separations it brought about or its overmastering spell But then I forget it is Paris which does it all It is possible it seems for members of one family to live side by side and know absolutely nothing of each other A half fledged nun arrives and in a couple of weeks has grasped domestic details of which the master diplomatist at the head of the house is quite ignorant Or perhaps he does see and shuts his eyes deliberately as part of the father s role There is a mystery here which I must plumb IV THE SAME TO THE SAME December fifteenth Yesterday at two o clock I went to drive in the Champs Elysees and the Bois de Boulogne It was one of those autumn days which we used to find so beautiful on the banks of the Loire So I have seen Paris at last The Place Louis XV is certainly very fine but the beauty is that of man s handiwork I was dressed to perfection pensive with set face though inwardly much tempted to laugh under a lovely hat my arms crossed Would you believe it Not a single smile was thrown at me not one poor youth was struck motionless as I passed not a soul turned to look again and yet the carriage proceeded with a deliberation worthy of my pose No I am wrong there was one a duke and a charming man who suddenly reined in as we went by The individual who thus saved appearances for me was my father and he proclaimed himself highly gratified by what he saw I met my mother also who sent me a butterfly kiss from the tips of her fingers The worthy Griffith who fears no man cast her glances hither and thither without discrimination In my judgment a young woman should always know exactly what her eye is resting on I was mad with rage One man actually inspected my carriage without noticing me This flattering homage probably came from a carriage maker I have been quite out in the reckoning of my forces Plainly beauty that rare gift which comes from heaven is commoner in Paris than I thought I saw hats doffed with deference to simpering fools a purple face called forth murmurs of It is she My mother received an immense amount of admiration There is an answer to this problem and I mean to find it The men my dear seemed to me generally very ugly The very few exceptions are bad copies of us Heaven knows what evil genius has inspired their costume it is amazingly inelegant compared with those of former generations It has no distinction no beauty of color or romance it appeals neither to the senses nor the mind nor the eye and it must be very uncomfortable It is meagre and stunted The hat above all struck me it is a sort of truncated column and does not adapt itself in the least to the shape of the head but I am told it is easier to bring about a revolution than to invent a graceful hat Courage in Paris recoils before the thought of appearing in a round felt and for lack of one day s daring men stick all their lives to this ridiculous headpiece And yet Frenchmen are said to be fickle The men are hideous anyway whatever they put on their heads I have seen nothing but worn hard faces with no calm nor peace in the expression the harsh lines and furrows speak of foiled ambition and smarting vanity A fine forehead is rarely seen And these are the product of Paris I said to Miss Griffith Most cultivated and pleasant men she replied I was silent The heart of a spinster of thirty six is a well of tolerance In the evening I went to the ball where I kept close to my mother s side She gave me her arm with a devotion which did not miss its reward All the honors were for her I was made the pretext for charming compliments She was clever enough to find me fools for my partners who one and all expatiated on the heat and the beauty of the ball till you might suppose I was freezing and blind Not one failed to enlarge on the strange unheard of extraordinary odd remarkable fact that he saw me for the first time My dress which dazzled me as I paraded alone in my white and gold drawing room was barely noticeable amidst the gorgeous finery of most of the married women Each had her band of faithful followers and they all watched each other askance A few were radiant in triumphant beauty and amongst these was my mother A girl at a ball is a mere dancing machine a thing of no consequence whatever The men with rare exceptions did not impress me more favorably here than at the Champs Elysees They have a used up look their features are meaningless or rather they have all the same meaning The proud stalwart bearing which we find in the portraits of our ancestors men who joined moral to physical vigor has disappeared Yet in this gathering there was one man of remarkable ability who stood out from the rest by the beauty of his face But even he did not rouse in me the feeling which I should have expected I do not know his works and he is a man of no family Whatever the genius and the merits of a plebeian or a commoner he could never stir my blood Besides this man was obviously so much more taken up with himself than with anybody else that I could not but think these great brain workers must look on us as things rather than persons When men of intellectual power love they ought to give up writing otherwise their love is not the real thing The lady of their heart does not come first in all their thoughts I seemed to read all this in the bearing of the man I speak of I am told he is a professor orator and author whose ambition makes him the slave of every bigwig My mind was made up on the spot It was unworthy of me I determined to quarrel with society for not being impressed by my merits and I gave myself up to the simple pleasure of dancing which I thoroughly enjoyed I heard a great deal of inept gossip about people of whom I know nothing but perhaps it is my ignorance on many subjects which prevents me from appreciating it as I saw that most men and women took a lively pleasure in certain remarks whether falling from their own lips or those of others Society bristles with enigmas which look hard to solve It is a perfect maze of intrigue Yet I am fairly quick of sight and hearing and as to my wits Mlle de Maucombe does not need to be told I returned home tired with a pleasant sort of tiredness and in all innocence began describing my sensations to my mother who was with me She checked me with the warning that I must never say such things to any one but her My dear child she added it needs as much tact to know when to be silent as when to speak This advice brought home to me the nature of the sensations which ought to be concealed from every one not excepting perhaps even a mother At a glance I measured the vast field of feminine duplicity I can assure you sweetheart that we in our unabashed simplicity would pass for two very wide awake little scandal mongers What lessons may be conveyed in a finger on the lips in a word a look All in a moment I was seized with excessive shyness What may I never again speak of the natural pleasure I feel in the exercise of dancing How then I said to myself about the deeper feelings I went to bed sorrowful and I still suffer from the shock produced by this first collision of my frank joyous nature with the harsh laws of society Already the highway hedges are flecked with my white wool Farewell beloved V RENEE DE MAUCOMBE TO LOUISE DE CHAULIEU October How deeply your letter moved me above all when I compare our widely different destinies How brilliant is the world you are entering how peaceful the retreat where I shall end my modest career

speeding on your own business give a thought to the recluse of La Crampade Remember that on neither side have the heads of the family any people of taste in Paris to make their purchases I shall reply to your letter later VI DON FELIPE HENAREZ TO DON FERNAND PARIS September The address of this letter my brother will show you that the head of your house is out of reach of danger If the massacre of our ancestors in the Court of Lions made Spaniards and Christians of us against our will it left us a legacy of Arab cunning and it may be that I owe my safety to the blood of the Abencerrages still flowing in my veins Fear made Ferdinand s acting so good that Valdez actually believed in his protestations But for me the poor Admiral would have been done for Nothing it seems will teach the Liberals what a king is This particular Bourbon has been long known to me and the more His Majesty assured me of his protection the stronger grew my suspicions A true Spaniard has no need to repeat a promise A flow of words is a sure sign of duplicity Valdez took ship on an English vessel For myself no sooner did I see the cause of my beloved Spain wrecked in Andalusia than I wrote to the steward of my Sardinian estate to make arrangements for my escape Some hardy coral fishers were despatched to wait for me at a point on the coast and when Ferdinand urged the French to secure my person I was already in my barony of Macumer amidst brigands who defy all law and all avengers The last Hispano Moorish family of Granada has found once more the shelter of an African desert and even a Saracen horse in an estate which comes to it from Saracens How the eyes of these brigands who but yesterday had dreaded my authority sparkled with savage joy and pride when they found they were protecting against the King of Spain s vendetta the Duc de Soria their master and a Henarez the first who had come to visit them since the time when the island belonged to the Moors More than a score of rifles were ready to point at Ferdinand of Bourbon son of a race which was still unknown when the Abencerrages arrived as conquerors on the banks of the Loire My idea had been to live on the income of these huge estates which unfortunately we have so greatly neglected but my stay there convinced me that this was impossible and that Queverdo s reports were only too correct The poor man had twenty two lives at my disposal and not a single real prairies of twenty thousand acres and not a house virgin forests and not a stick of furniture A million piastres and a resident master for half a century would be necessary to make these magnificent lands pay I must see to this The conquered have time during their flight to ponder their own case and that of their vanquished party At the spectacle of my noble country a corpse for monks to prey on my eyes filled with tears I read in it the presage of Spain s gloomy future At Marseilles I heard of Riego s end Painfully did it come home to me that my life also would henceforth be a martyrdom but a martyrdom protracted and unnoticed Is existence worthy the name when a man can no longer die for his country or live for a woman To love to conquer this twofold form of the same thought is the law graven on our sabres emblazoned on the vaulted roofs of our palaces ceaselessly whispered by the water which rises and falls in our marble fountains But in vain does it nerve my heart the sabre is broken the palace in ashes the living spring sucked up by the barren sand Here then is my last will and testament Don Fernand you will understand now why I put a check upon your ardor and ordered you to remain faithful to the rey netto As your brother and friend I implore you to obey me as your master I command You will go to the King and will ask from him the grant of my dignities and property my office and titles He will perhaps hesitate and may treat you to some regal scowls but you must tell him that you are loved by Marie Heredia and that Marie can marry none but a Duc de Soria This will make the King radiant It is the immense fortune of the Heredia family which alone has stood between him and the accomplishment of my ruin Your proposal will seem to him therefore to deprive me of a last resource and he will gladly hand over to you my spoils You will then marry Marie The secret of the mutual love against which you fought was no secret to me and I have prepared the old Count to see you take my place Marie and I were merely doing what was expected of us in our position and carrying out the wishes of our fathers everything else is in your favor You are beautiful as a child of love and are possessed of Marie s heart I am an ill favored Spanish grandee for whom she feels an aversion to which she will not confess Some slight reluctance there may be on the part of the noble Spanish girl on account of my misfortunes but this you will soon overcome Duc de Soria your predecessor would neither cost you a regret nor rob you of a maravedi My mother s diamonds which will suffice to make me independent I will keep because the gap caused by them in the family estate can be filled by Marie s jewels You can send them therefore by my nurse old Urraca the only one of my servants whom I wish to retain No one can prepare my chocolate as she does During our brief revolution my life of unremitting toil was reduced to the barest necessaries and these my salary was sufficient to provide You will therefore find the income of the last two years in the hands of your steward This sum is mine but a Duc de Soria cannot marry without a large expenditure of money therefore we will divide it You will not refuse this wedding present from your brigand brother Besides I mean to have it so The barony of Macumer not being Spanish territory remains to me Thus I have still a country and a name should I wish to take up a position in the world again Thank Heaven this finishes our business and the house of Soria is saved At the very moment when I drop into simple Baron de Macumer the French cannon announce the arrival of the Duc d Angouleme You will understand why I break off October When I arrived here I had not ten doubloons in my pocket He would indeed be a poor sort of leader who in the midst of calamities he has not been able to avert has found means to feather his own nest For the vanquished Moor there remains a horse and the desert for the Christian foiled of his hopes the cloister and a few gold pieces But my present resignation is mere weariness I am not yet so near the monastery as to have abandoned all thoughts of life Ozalga had given me several letters of introduction to meet all emergencies amongst these one to a bookseller who takes with our fellow countrymen the place which Galignani holds with the English in Paris This man has found eight pupils for me at three francs a lesson I go to my pupils every alternate day so that I have four lessons a day and earn twelve francs which is more than I require When Urraca comes I shall make some Spanish exile happy by passing on to him my connection I lodge in the Rue Hillerin Bertin with a poor widow who takes boarders My room faces south and looks out on a little garden It is perfectly quiet I have green trees to look upon and spend the sum of one piastre a day I am amazed at the amount of calm pure pleasure which I enjoy in this life after the fashion of Dionysius at Corinth From sunrise until ten o clock I smoke and take my chocolate sitting at my window and contemplating two Spanish plants a broom which rises out of a clump of jessamine gold on a white ground colors which must send a thrill through any scion of the Moors At ten o clock I start for my lessons which last till four when I return for dinner Afterwards I read and smoke till I go to bed I can put up for a long time with a life like this compounded of work and meditation of solitude and society Be happy therefore Fernand my abdication has brought no afterthoughts I have no regrets like Charles V no longing to try the game again like Napoleon Five days and nights have passed since I wrote my will to my mind they might have been five centuries Honor titles wealth are for me as though they had never existed Now that the conventional barrier of respect which hedged me round has fallen I can open my heart to you dear boy Though cased in the armor of gravity this heart is full of tenderness and devotion which have found no object and which no woman has divined not even she who from her cradle has been my destined bride In this lies the secret of my political enthusiasm Spain has taken the place of a mistress and received the homage of my heart And now Spain too is gone Beggared of all I can gaze upon the ruin of what once was me and speculate over the mysteries of my being Why did life animate this carcass and when will it depart Why has that race pre eminent in chivalry breathed all its primitive virtues its tropical love its fiery poetry into this its last offshoot if the seed was never to burst its rugged shell if no stem was to spring forth no radiant flower scatter aloft its Eastern perfumes Of what crime have I been guilty before my birth that I can inspire no love Did fate from my very infancy decree that I should be stranded a useless hulk on some barren shore I find in my soul the image of the deserts where my fathers ranged illumined by a scorching sun which shrivels up all life Proud remnant of a fallen race vain force love run to waste an old man in the prime of youth here better than elsewhere shall I await the last grace of death Alas under this murky sky no spark will kindle these ashes again to flame Thus my last words may be those of Christ My God Thou hast forsaken me Cry of agony and terror to the core of which no mortal has ventured yet to penetrate You can realize now Fernand what a joy it is to me to live afresh in you and Marie I shall watch you henceforth with the pride of a creator satisfied in his work Love each other well and go on loving if you would not give me pain any discord between you would hurt me more than it would yourselves Our mother had a presentiment that events would one day serve her wishes It may be that the longing of a mother constitutes a pact between herself and God Was she not moreover one of those mysterious beings who can hold converse with Heaven and bring back thence a vision of the future How often have I not read in the lines of her forehead that she was coveting for Fernand the honors and the wealth of Felipe When I said so to her she would reply with tears laying bare the wounds of a heart which of right was the undivided property of both her sons but which an irresistible passion gave to you alone Her spirit therefore will hover joyfully above your heads as you bow them at the altar My mother have you not a caress for your Felipe now that he has yielded to your favorite even the girl whom you regretfully thrust into his arms What I have done is pleasing to our womankind to the dead and to the King it is the will of God Make no difficulty then Fernand obey and be silent P S Tell Urraca to be sure and call me nothing but M Henarez Don t say a word about me to Marie You must be the one living soul to know the secrets of the last Christianized Moor in whose veins runs the blood of a great family which took its rise in the desert and is now about to die out in the person of a solitary exile Farewell VII LOUISE DE CHAULIEU TO RENEE DE MAUCOMBE WHAT To be married so soon But this is unheard of At the end of a month you become engaged to a man who is a stranger to you and about whom you know nothing The man may be deaf there are so many kinds of deafness he may be sickly tiresome insufferable Don t you see Renee what they want with you You are needful for carrying on the glorious stock of the l Estorades that is all You will be buried in the provinces Are these the promises we made each other Were I you I would sooner set off to the Hyeres islands in a caique on the chance of being captured by an Algerian corsair and sold to the Grand Turk Then I should be a Sultana some day and wouldn t I make a stir in the harem while I was young yes and afterwards too You are leaving one convent to enter another I know you you are a coward and you will submit to the yoke of family life with a lamblike docility But I am here to direct you you must come to Paris There we shall drive the men wild and hold a court like queens Your husband sweetheart in three years from now may become a member of the Chamber I know all about members now and I will explain it to you You will work that machine very well you can live in Paris and become there what my mother calls a woman of fashion Oh you needn t suppose I will leave you in your grange Monday For a whole fortnight now my dear I have been living the life of society one evening at the Italiens another at the Grand Opera and always a ball afterwards Ah society is a witching world The music of the Opera enchants me and whilst my soul is plunged in divine pleasure I am the centre of admiration and the focus of all the opera glasses But a single glance will make the boldest youth drop his eyes I have seen some charming young men there all the same I don t care for any of them not one has roused in me the emotion which I feel when I listen to Garcia in his splendid duet with Pellegrini in Otello Heavens how jealous Rossini must have been to express jealousy so well What a cry in Il mio cor si divide I m speaking Greek to you for you never heard Garcia but then you know how jealous I am What a wretched dramatist Shakespeare is Othello is in love with glory he wins battles he gives orders he struts about and is all over the place while Desdemona sits at home and Desdemona who sees herself neglected for the silly fuss of public life is quite meek all the time Such a sheep deserves to be slaughtered Let the man whom I deign to love beware how he thinks of anything but loving me For my part I like those long trials of the old fashioned chivalry That lout of a young lord who took offence because his sovereign lady sent him down among the lions to fetch her glove was in my opinion very impertinent and a fool too Doubtless the lady had in reserve for him some exquisite flower of love which he lost as he well deserved the puppy But here am I running on as though I had not a great piece of news to tell you My father is certainly going to represent our master the King at Madrid I say our master for I shall make part of the embassy My mother wishes to remain here and my father will take me so as to have some woman with him My dear this seems to you no doubt very simple but there are horrors behind it all the same in a fortnight I have probed the secrets of the house My mother would accompany my father to Madrid if he would take M de Canalis as a secretary to the embassy But the King appoints the secretaries the Duke dare neither annoy the King who hates to be opposed nor vex my mother and the wily diplomat believes he has cut the knot by leaving the Duchess here M de Canalis who is the great poet of the day is the young man who cultivates my mother s society and who no doubt studies diplomacy with her from three o clock to five Diplomacy must be a fine subject for he is as regular as a gambler on the Stock Exchange The Duc de Rhetore our elder brother solemn cold and whimsical would be extinguished by his father at Madrid therefore he remains in Paris Miss Griffith has found out also that Alphonse is in love with a ballet girl at the Opera How is it possible to fall in love with legs and pirouettes We have noticed that my brother comes to the theatre only when Tullia dances there he applauds the steps of this creature and then goes out Two ballet girls in a family are I fancy more destructive than the plague My second brother is with his regiment and I have not yet seen him Thus it comes about that I have to act as the Antigone of His Majesty s ambassador Perhaps I may get married in Spain and perhaps my father s idea is a marriage there without dowry after the pattern of yours with this broken down guard of honor My father asked if I would go with him and offered me the use of his Spanish master Spain the country for castles in the air I cried Perhaps you hope that it may mean marriages for me For sole reply he honored me with a meaning look For some days he has amused himself with teasing me at lunch he watches me and I dissemble In this way I have played with him cruelly as father and ambassador in petto Hadn t he taken me for a fool He asked me what I thought of this and that young man and of some girls whom I had met in several houses I replied with quite inane remarks on the color of their hair their faces and the difference in their figures My father seemed disappointed at my crassness and inwardly blamed himself for having asked me Still father I added don t suppose I am saying what I really think mother made me afraid the other day that I had spoken more frankly than I ought of my impressions With your family you can speak quite freely my mother replied Very well then I went on The young men I have met so far strike me as too self centered to excite interest in others they are much more taken up with themselves than with their company They can t be accused of lack of candor at any rate They put on a certain expression to talk to us and drop it again in a moment apparently satisfied that we don t use our eyes The man as he converses is the lover silent he is the husband The girls again are so artificial that it is impossible to know what they really are except from the way they dance their figures and movements alone are not a sham But what has alarmed me most in this fashionable society is its brutality The little incidents which take place when supper is announced give one some idea to compare small things with great of what a popular rising might be Courtesy is only a thin veneer on the general selfishness I imagined society very different Women count for little in it that may perhaps be a survival of Bonapartist ideas Armande is coming on extraordinarily said my mother Mother did you think I should never get beyond asking to see Mme de Stael My father smiled and rose from the table Saturday My dear I have left one thing out Here is the tidbit I have reserved for you The love which we pictured must be extremely well hidden I have seen not a trace of it True I have caught in drawing rooms now and again a quick exchange of glances but how colorless it all is Love as we imagined it a world of wonders of glorious dreams of charming realities of sorrows that waken sympathy and smiles that make sunshine does not exist The bewitching words the constant interchange of happiness the misery of absence the flood of joy at the presence of the beloved one where are they What soil produces these radiant flowers of the soul Which is wrong We or the world I have already seen hundreds of men young and middle aged not one has stirred the least feeling in me No proof of admiration and devotion on their part not even a sword drawn in my behalf would have moved me Love dear is the product of such rare conditions that it is quite possible to live a lifetime without coming across the being on whom nature has bestowed the power of making one s happiness The thought is enough to make one shudder for if this being is found too late what then For some days I have begun to tremble when I think of the destiny of women and to understand why so many wear a sad face beneath the flush brought by the unnatural excitement of social dissipation Marriage is a mere matter of chance Look at yours A storm of wild thoughts has passed over my mind To be loved every day the same yet with a difference to be loved as much after ten years of happiness as on the first day such a love demands years The lover must be allowed to languish curiosity must be piqued and satisfied feeling roused and responded to Is there then a law for the inner fruits of the heart as there is for the visible fruits of nature Can joy be made lasting In what proportion should love mingle tears with pleasures The cold policy of the funereal monotonous persistent routine of the convent seemed to me at these moments the only real life while the wealth the splendor the tears the delights the triumph the joy the satisfaction of a love equal shared and sanctioned appeared a mere idle vision I see no room in this city for the gentle ways of love for precious walks in shady alleys the full moon sparkling on the water while the suppliant pleads in vain Rich young and beautiful I have only to love and love would become my sole occupation my life yet in the three months during which I have come and gone eager and curious nothing has appealed to me in the bright covetous keen eyes around me No voice has thrilled me no glance has made the world seem brighter Music alone has filled my soul music alone has at all taken the place of our friendship Sometimes at night I will linger for an hour by my window gazing into the garden summoning the future with all it brings out of the mystery which shrouds it There are days too when having started for a drive I get out and walk in the Champs Elysees and picture to myself that the man who is to waken my slumbering soul is at hand that he will follow and look at me Then I meet only mountebanks vendors of gingerbread jugglers passers by hurrying to their business or lovers who try to escape notice These I am tempted to stop asking them You who are happy tell me what is love But the impulse is repressed and I return to my carriage swearing to die an old maid Love is undoubtedly an incarnation and how many conditions are needful before it can take place We are not certain of never quarreling with ourselves how much less so when there are two This is a problem which God alone can solve I begin to think that I shall return to the convent If I remain in society I shall do things which will look like follies for I cannot possibly reconcile myself to what I see I am perpetually wounded either in my sense of delicacy my inner principles or my secret thoughts Ah my mother is the happiest of women adored as she is by Canalis her great little man My love do you know I am seized sometimes with a horrible craving to know what goes on between my mother and that young man Griffith tells me she has gone through all these moods she has longed to fly at women whose happiness was written in their face she has blackened their character torn them to pieces According to her virtue consists in burying all these savage instincts in one s innermost heart But what then of the heart It becomes the sink of all that is worst in us It is very humiliating that no adorer has yet turned up for me I am a marriageable girl but I have brothers a family relations who are sensitive on the point of honor Ah if that is what keeps men back they are poltroons The part of Chimene in the Cid and that of the Cid delight me What a marvelous play Well good bye VIII THE SAME TO THE SAME January Our master is a poor refugee forced to keep in hiding on account of the part he played in the revolution which the Duc d Angouleme has just quelled a triumph to which we owe some splendid fetes Though a Liberal and doubtless a man of the people he has awakened my interest I fancy that he must have been condemned to death I make him talk for the purpose of getting at his secret but he is of a truly Castilian taciturnity proud as though he were Gonsalvo di Cordova and nevertheless angelic in his patience and gentleness His pride is not irritable like Miss Griffith s it belongs to his inner nature he forces us to civility because his own manners are so perfect and holds us at a distance by the respect he shows us My father declares that there is a great deal of the nobleman in Senor Henarez whom among ourselves he calls in fun Don Henarez A few days ago I took the liberty of addressing him thus He raised his eyes which are generally bent on the ground and flashed a look from them that quite abashed me my dear he certainly has the most beautiful eyes imaginable I asked him if I had offended him in any way and he said to me in his grand rolling Spanish I am here only to teach you Spanish I blushed and felt quite snubbed I was on the point of making some pert answer when I remembered what our dear mother in God used to say to us and I replied instead It would be a kindness to tell me if you have anything to complain of A tremor passed through him the blood rose in his olive cheeks he replied in a voice of some emotion Religion must have taught you better than I can to respect the unhappy Had I been a don in Spain and lost everything in the triumph of Ferdinand VII your witticism would be unkind but if I am only a poor teacher of languages is it not a heartless satire Neither is worthy of a young lady of rank I took his hand saying In the name of religion also I beg you to pardon me He bowed opened my Don Quixote and sat down This little incident disturbed me more than the harvest of compliments gazing and pretty speeches on my most successful evening During the lesson I watched him attentively which I could do the more safely as he never looks at me As the result of my observations I made out that the tutor whom we took to be forty is a young man some years under thirty My governess to whom I had handed him over remarked on the beauty of his black hair and of his pearly teeth As to his eyes they are velvet and fire but he is plain and insignificant Though the Spaniards have been described as not a cleanly people this man is most carefully got up and his hands are whiter than his face He stoops a little and has an extremely large oddly shaped head His ugliness which however has a dash of piquancy is aggravated by smallpox marks which seam his face His forehead is very prominent and the shaggy eyebrows meet giving a repellent air of harshness There is a frowning plaintive look on his face reminding one of a sickly child which owes its life to superhuman care as Sister Marthe did As my father observed his features are a shrunken reproduction of those of Cardinal Ximenes The natural dignity of our tutor s manners seems to disconcert the dear Duke who doesn t like him and is never at ease with him he can t bear to come in contact with superiority of any kind As soon as my father knows enough Spanish we start for Madrid When Henarez returned two days after the reproof he had given me I remarked by way of showing my gratitude I have no doubt that you left Spain in consequence of political events If my father is sent there as seems to be expected we shall be in a position to help you and might be able to obtain your pardon in case you are under sentence It is impossible for any one to help me he replied But I said is that because you refuse to accept any help or because the thing itself is impossible Both he said with a bow and in a tone which forbade continuing the subject My father s blood chafed in my veins I was offended by this haughty demeanor and promptly dropped Senor Henarez All the same my dear there is something fine in this rejection of any aid He would not accept even our friendship I reflected whilst conjugating a verb Suddenly I stopped short and told him what was in my mind but in Spanish Henarez replied very politely that equality of sentiment was necessary between friends which did not exist in this case and therefore it was useless to consider the question Do you mean equality in the amount of feeling on either side or equality in rank I persisted determined to shake him out of this provoking gravity He raised once more those awe inspiring eyes and mine fell before them Dear this man is a hopeless enigma He seemed to ask whether my words meant love and the mixture of joy pride and agonized doubt in his glance went to my heart It was plain that advances which would be taken for what they were worth in France might land me in difficulties with a Spaniard and I drew back into my shell feeling not a little foolish The lesson over he bowed and his eyes were eloquent of the humble prayer Don t trifle with a poor wretch This sudden contrast to his usual grave and dignified manner made a great impression on me It seems horrible to think and to say but I can t help believing that there are treasures of affection in that man IX MME DE L ESTORADE TO MLLE DE CHAULIEU December All is over my dear child and it is Mme de l Estorade who writes to you But between us there is no change it is only a girl the less Don t be troubled I did not give my consent recklessly or without much thought My life is henceforth mapped out for me and the freedom from all uncertainty as to the road for me to follow suits my mind and disposition A great moral power has stepped in and once for all swept what we call chance out of my life We have the property to develop our home to beautify and adorn for me there is also a household to direct and sweeten and a husband to reconcile to life In all probability I shall have a family to look after children to educate What would you have Everyday life cannot be cast in heroic mould No doubt there seems at any rate at first sight no room left in this scheme of life for that longing after the infinite which expands the mind and soul But what is there to prevent me from launching on that boundless sea our familiar craft Nor must you suppose that the humble duties to which I dedicate my life give no scope for passion To restore faith in happiness to an unfortunate who has been the sport of adverse circumstances is a noble work and one which alone may suffice to relieve the monotony of my existence I can see no opening left for suffering and I see a great deal of good to be done I need not hide from you that the love I have for Louis de l Estorade is not of the kind which makes the heart throb at the sound of a step and thrills us at the lightest tones of a voice or the caress of a burning glance but on the other hand there is nothing in him which offends me What am I to do you will ask with that instinct for all which is great and noble with those mental energies which have made the link between us and which we still possess I admit that this thought has troubled me But are these faculties less ours because we keep them concealed using them only in secret for the welfare of the family as instruments to produce the happiness of those confided to our care to whom we are bound to give ourselves without reserve The time during which a woman can look for admiration is short it will soon be past and if my life has not been a great one it will at least have been calm tranquil free from shocks Nature has favored our sex in giving us a choice between love and motherhood I have made mine My children shall be my gods and this spot of earth my Eldorado I can say no more to day Thank you much for all the things you have sent me Give a glance at my needs on the enclosed list I am determined to live in an atmosphere of refinement and luxury and to take from provincial life only what makes its charm In solitude a woman can never be vulgarized she remains herself I count greatly on your kindness for keeping me up to the fashion My father in law is so delighted that he can refuse me nothing and turns his house upside down We are getting workpeople from Paris and renovating everything X MLLE DE CHAULIEU TO MME DE L ESTORADE January Oh Renee you have made me miserable for days So that bewitching body those beautiful proud features that natural grace of manner that soul full of priceless gifts those eyes where the soul can slake its thirst as at a fountain of love that heart with its exquisite delicacy that breadth of mind those rare powers fruit of nature and of our interchange of thought treasures whence should issue a unique satisfaction for passion and desire hours of poetry to outweigh years joys to make a man serve a lifetime for one gracious gesture all this is to be buried in the tedium of a tame commonplace marriage to vanish in the emptiness of an existence which you will come to loath I hate your children before they are born They will be monsters So you know all that lies before you you have nothing left to hope or fear or suffer And supposing the glorious morning rises which will bring you face to face with the man destined to rouse you from the sleep into which you are plunging Ah a cold shiver goes through me at the thought Well at least you have a friend You it is understood are to be the guardian angel of your valley You will grow familiar with its beauties will live with it in all its aspects till the grandeur of nature the slow growth of vegetation compared with the lightning rapidity of thought become like a part of yourself and as your eye rests on the laughing flowers you will question your own heart When you walk between your husband silent and contented in front and your children screaming and romping behind I can tell you beforehand what you will write to me Your misty valley your hills bare or clothed with magnificent trees your meadow the wonder of Provence with its fresh water dispersed in little runlets the different effects of the atmosphere this whole world of infinity which laps you round and which God has made so various will recall to you the infinite sameness of your soul s life But at least I shall be there my Renee and in me you will find a heart which no social pettiness shall ever corrupt a heart all your own Monday My dear my Spaniard is quite adorably melancholy there is something calm severe manly and mysterious about him which interests me profoundly His unvarying solemnity and the silence which envelops him act like an irritant on the mind His mute dignity is worthy of a fallen king Griffith and I spend our time over him as though he were a riddle How odd it is A language master captures my fancy as no other man has done Yet by this time I have passed in review all the young men of family the attaches to embassies and the ambassadors generals and inferior officers the peers of France their sons and nephews the court and the town The coldness of the man provokes me The sandy waste which he tries to place and does place between us is covered by his deeprooted pride he wraps himself in mystery The hanging back is on his side the boldness on mine This odd situation affords me the more amusement because the whole thing is mere trifling What is a man a Spaniard and a teacher of languages to me I make no account of any man whatever were he a king We are worth far more I am sure than the greatest of them What a slave I would have made of Napoleon If he had loved me shouldn t he have felt the whip Yesterday I aimed a shaft at M Henarez which must have touched him to the quick He made no reply the lesson was over and he bowed with a glance at me in which I read that he would never return This suits me capitally there would be something ominous in starting an imitation Nouvelle Heloise I have just been reading Rousseau s and it has left me with a strong distaste for love Passion which can argue and moralize seems to me detestable Clarissa also is much too pleased with herself and her long little letter but Richardson s work is an admirable picture my father tells me of English women Rousseau s seems to me a sort of philosophical sermon cast in the form of letters Love as I conceive it is a purely subjective poem In all that books tell us about it there is nothing which is not at once false and true And so my pretty one as you will henceforth be an authority only on conjugal love it seems to me my duty in the interest of course of our common life to remain unmarried and have a grand passion so that we may enlarge our experience Tell me every detail of what happens to you especially in the first few days with that strange animal called a husband I promise to do the same for you if ever I am loved Farewell poor martyred darling XI MME DE L ESTORADE TO MLLE DE CHAULIEU La Crampade Your Spaniard and you make me shudder my darling I write this line to beg of you to dismiss him All that you say of him corresponds with the character of those dangerous adventurers who having nothing to lose will take any risk This man cannot be your husband and must not be your lover I will write to you more fully about the inner history of my married life when my heart is free from the anxiety your last letter has roused in it XII MLLE DE CHAULIEU TO MME DE L ESTORADE February At nine o clock this morning sweetheart my father was announced in my rooms I was up and dressed I found him solemnly seated beside the fire in the drawing room looking more thoughtful than usual He pointed to the armchair opposite to him Divining his meaning I sank into it with a gravity which so well aped his that he could not refrain from smiling though the smile was dashed with melancholy You are quite a match for your grandmother in quick wittedness he said Come father don t play the courtier here I replied you want something from me He rose visibly agitated and talked to me for half an hour This conversation dear really ought to be preserved As soon as he had gone I sat down to my table and tried to recall his words This is the first time that I have seen my father revealing his inner thoughts He began by flattering me and he did not do it badly I was bound to be grateful to him for having understood and appreciated me Armande he said I was quite mistaken in you and you have agreeably surprised me When you arrived from the convent I took you for an average young girl ignorant and not particularly intelligent easily to be bought off with gewgaws and ornaments and with little turn for reflection You are complimentary to young girls father Oh there is no such thing as youth nowadays he said with the air of a diplomat Your mind is amazingly open You take everything at its proper worth your clear sightedness is extraordinary there is no hoodwinking you You pass for being blind and all the time you have laid your hand on causes while other people are still puzzling over effects In short you are a minister in petticoats the only person here capable of understanding me It follows then that if I have any sacrifice to ask from you it is only to yourself I can turn for help in persuading you I am therefore going to explain to you quite frankly my former plans to which I still adhere In order to recommend them to you I must show that they are connected with feelings of a very high order and I shall thus be obliged to enter into political questions of the greatest importance to the kingdom which might be wearisome to any one less intelligent than you are When you have heard me I hope you will take time for consideration six months if necessary You are entirely your own mistress and if you decline to make the sacrifice I ask I shall bow to your decision and trouble you no further This preface my sweetheart made me really serious and I said Speak father Here then is the deliverance of the statesman My child France is in a very critical position which is understood only by the King and a few superior minds But the King is a head without arms the great nobles who are in the secret of the danger have no authority over the men whose company operation is needful in order to bring about a happy result These men cast up by popular election refuse to lend themselves as instruments Even the able men among them carry on the work of pulling down society instead of helping us to strengthen the edifice In a word there are only two parties the party of Marius and the party of Sulla I am for Sulla against Marius This roughly speaking is our position To go more into details the Revolution is still active it is embedded in the law and written on the soil it fills people s minds The danger is all the greater because the greater number of the King s counselors seeing it destitute of armed forces and of money believe it completely vanquished The King is an able man and not easily blinded but from day to day he is won over by his brother s partisans who want to hurry things on He has not two years to live and thinks more of a peaceful deathbed than of anything else Shall I tell you my child which is the most destructive of all the consequences entailed by the Revolution You would never guess In Louis XVI the Revolution has decapitated every head of a family The family has ceased to exist we have only individuals In their desire to become a nation Frenchmen have abandoned the idea of empire in proclaiming the equal rights of all children to their father s inheritance they have killed the family spirit and created the State treasury But all this has paved the way for weakened authority for the blind force of the masses for the decay of art and the supremacy of individual interests and has left the road open to the foreign invader We stand between two policies either to found the State on the basis of the family or to rest it on individual interest in other words between democracy and aristocracy between free discussion and obedience between Catholicism and religious indifference I am among the few who are resolved to oppose what is called the people and that in the people s true interest It is not now a question of feudal rights as fools are told nor of rank it is a question of the State and of the existence of France The country which does not rest on the foundation of paternal authority cannot be stable That is the foot of the ladder of responsibility and subordination which has for its summit the King The King stands for us all To die for the King is to die for oneself for one s family which like the kingdom cannot die All animals have certain instincts the instinct of man is for family life A country is strong which consists of wealthy families every member of whom is interested in defending a common treasure it is weak when composed of scattered individuals to whom it matters little whether they obey seven or one a Russian or a Corsican so long as each keeps his own plot of land blind in their wretched egotism to the fact that the day is coming when this too will be torn from them Terrible calamities are in store for us in case our party fails Nothing will be left but penal or fiscal laws your money or your life The most generous nation on the earth will have ceased to obey the call of noble instincts Wounds past curing will have been fostered and aggravated an all pervading jealousy being the first Then the upper classes will be submerged equality of desire will be taken for equality of strength true distinction even when proved and recognized will be threatened by the advancing tide of middle class prejudice It was possible to choose one man out of a thousand but amongst three millions discrimination becomes impossible when all are moved by the same ambitions and attired in the same livery of mediocrity No foresight will warn this victorious horde of that other terrible horde soon to be arrayed against them in the peasant proprietors in other words twenty million acres of land alive stirring arguing deaf to reason insatiable of appetite obstructing progress masters in their brute force But said I interrupting my father what can I do to help the State I feel no vocation for playing Joan of Arc in the interests of the family or for finding a martyr s block in the convent You are a little hussy cried my father If I speak sensibly to you you are full of jokes when I jest you talk like an ambassadress Love lives on contrasts was my reply And he laughed till the tears stood in his eyes You will reflect on what I have told you you will do justice to the large and confiding spirit in which I have broached the matter and possibly events may assist my plans I know that so far as you are concerned they are injurious and unfair and this is the reason why I appeal for your sanction of them less to your heart and your imagination than to your reason I have found more judgment and commonsense in you than in any one I know You flatter yourself I said with a smile for I am every inch your child In short he went on one must be logical You can t have the end without the means and it is our duty to set an example to others From all this I deduce that you ought not to have money of your own till your younger brother is provided for and I want to employ the whole of your inheritance in purchasing an estate for him to go with the title But I said you won t interfere with my living in my own fashion and enjoying life if I leave you my fortune Provided he replied that your view of life does not conflict with the family honor reputation and I may add glory Come come I cried what has become of my excellent judgment There is not in all France he said with bitterness a man who would take for wife a daughter of one of our noblest families without a dowry and bestow one on her If such a husband could be found it would be among the class of rich parvenus on this point I belong to the eleventh century And I also I said But why despair Are there no aged peers You are an apt scholar Louise he exclaimed Then he left me smiling and kissing my hand I received your letter this very morning and it led me to contemplate that abyss into which you say that I may fall A voice within seemed to utter the same warning So I took my precautions Henarez my dear dares to look at me and his eyes are disquieting They inspire me with what I can only call an unreasoning dread Such a man ought no more to be looked at than a frog he is ugly and fascinating For two days I have been hesitating whether to tell my father point blank that I want no more Spanish lessons and have Henarez sent about his business But in spite of all my brave resolutions I feel that the horrible sensation which comes over me when I see that man has become necessary to me I say to myself Once more and then I will speak His voice my dear is sweetly thrilling his speaking is just like la Fodor s singing His manners are simple entirely free from affectation And what teeth Just now as he was leaving he seemed to divine the interest I take in him and made a gesture oh most respectfully as though to take my hand and kiss it then checked himself apparently terrified at his own boldness and the chasm he had been on the point of bridging There was the merest suggestion of all this but I understood it and smiled for nothing is more pathetic than to see the frank impulse of an inferior checking itself abashed The love of a plebeian for a girl of noble birth implies such courage My smile emboldened him The poor fellow looked blindly about for his hat he seemed determined not to find it and I handed it to him with perfect gravity His eyes were wet with unshed tears It was a mere passing moment yet a world of facts and ideas were contained in it We understood each other so well that on a sudden I held out my hand for him to kiss Possibly this was equivalent to telling him that love might bridge the interval between us Well I cannot tell what moved me to do it Griffith had her back turned as I proudly extended my little white paw I felt the fire of his lips tempered by two big tears Oh my love I lay in my armchair nerveless dreamy I was happy and I cannot explain to you how or why What I felt only a poet could express My condescension which fills me with shame now seemed to me then something to be proud of he had fascinated me that is my one excuse Friday This man is really very handsome He talks admirably and has remarkable intellectual power My dear he is a very Bossuet in force and persuasiveness when he explains the mechanism not only of the Spanish tongue but also of human thought and of all language His mother tongue seems to be French When I expressed surprise at this he replied that he came to France when quite a boy following the King of Spain to Valencay What has passed within this enigmatic being He is no longer the same man He came dressed quite simply but just as any gentleman would for a morning walk He put forth all his eloquence and flashed wit like rays from a beacon all through the lesson Like a man roused from lethargy he revealed to me a new world of thoughts He told me the story of some poor devil of a valet who gave up his life for a single glance from a queen of Spain What could he do but die I exclaimed This delighted him and he looked at me in a way which was truly alarming In the evening I went to a ball at the Duchesse de Lenoncourt s The Prince de Talleyrand happened to be there and I got M de Vandenesse a charming young man to ask him whether among the guests at his country place in eighteen oh nine he remembered any one of the name of Henarez Vandenesse reported the Prince s reply word for word as follows Henarez is the Moorish name of the Soria family who are they say descendants of the Abencerrages converted to Christianity The old Duke and his two sons were with the King The eldest the present Duke de Soria has just had all his property titles and dignities confiscated by King Ferdinand who in this way avenges a long standing feud The Duke made a huge mistake in consenting to form a constitutional ministry with Valdez Happily he escaped from Cadiz before the arrival of the Duc d Angouleme who with the best will in the world could not have saved him from the King s wrath This information gave me much food for reflection I cannot describe to you the suspense in which I passed the time till my next lesson which took place this morning During the first quarter of an hour I examined him closely debating inwardly whether he were duke or commoner without being able to come to any conclusion He seemed to read my fancies as they arose and to take pleasure in thwarting them At last I could endure it no longer Putting down my book suddenly I broke off the translation I was making of it aloud and said to him in Spanish You are deceiving us You are no poor middle class Liberal You are the Duke de Soria Mademoiselle he replied with a gesture of sorrow unhappily I am not the Duc de Soria I felt all the despair with which he uttered the word unhappily Ah my dear never should I have conceived it possible to throw so much meaning and passion into a single word His eyes had dropped and he dared no longer look at me M de Talleyrand I said in whose house you spent your years of exile declares that any one bearing the name of Henarez must either be the late Duc de Soria or a lacquey He looked at me with eyes like two black burning coals at once blazing and ashamed The man might have been in the torture chamber All he said was My father was in truth the servant of the King of Spain Griffith could make nothing of this sort of lesson An awkward silence followed each question and answer In one word I said are you a nobleman or not You know that in Spain even beggars are noble This reticence provoked me Since the last lesson I had given play to my imagination in a little practical joke I had drawn an ideal portrait of the man whom I should wish for my lover in a letter which I designed giving to him to translate So far I had only put Spanish into French not French into Spanish I pointed this out to him and begged Griffith to bring me the last letter I had received from a friend of mine I shall find out I thought from the effect my sketch has on him what sort of blood runs in his veins I took the paper from Griffith s hands saying Let me see if I have copied it rightly For it was all in my writing I handed him the paper or if you will the snare and I watched him while he read as follows He who is to win my heart my dear must be harsh and unbending with men but gentle with women His eagle eye must have power to quell with a single glance the least approach to ridicule He will have a pitying smile for those who would jeer at sacred things above all at that poetry of the heart without which life would be but a dreary commonplace I have the greatest scorn for those who would rob us of the living fountain of religious beliefs so rich in solace His faith therefore should have the simplicity of a child though united to the firm conviction of an intelligent man who has examined the foundations of his creed His fresh and original way of looking at things must be entirely free from affectation or desire to show off His words will be few and fit and his mind so richly stored that he cannot possibly become a bore to himself any more than to others All his thoughts must have a high and chivalrous character without alloy of self seeking while his actions should be marked by a total absence of interested or sordid motives Any weak points he may have will arise from the very elevation of his views above those of the common herd for in every respect I would have him superior to his age Ever mindful of the delicate attentions due to the weak he will be gentle to all women but not prone lightly to fall in love with any for love will seem to him too serious to turn into a game Thus it might happen that he would spend his life in ignorance of true love while all the time possessing those qualities most fitted to inspire it But if ever he find the ideal woman who has haunted his waking dreams if he meet with a nature capable of understanding his own one who could fill his soul and pour sunlight over his life could shine as a star through the mists of this chill and gloomy world lend fresh charm to existence and draw music from the hitherto silent chords of his being needless to say he would recognize and welcome his good fortune And she too would be happy Never by word or look would he wound the tender heart which abandoned itself to him with the blind trust of a child reposing in its mother s arms For were the vision shattered it would be the wreck of her inner life To the mighty waters of love she would confide her all The man I picture must belong in expression in attitude in gait in his way of performing alike the smallest and the greatest actions to that race of the truly great who are always simple and natural He need not be good looking but his hands must be beautiful His upper lip will curl with a careless ironic smile for the general public whilst he reserves for those he loves the heavenly radiant glance in which he puts his soul Will mademoiselle allow me he said in Spanish in a voice full of agitation to keep this writing in memory of her This is the last lesson I shall have the honor of giving her and that which I have just received in these words may serve me for an abiding rule of life I left Spain a fugitive and penniless but I have to day received from my family a sum sufficient for my needs You will allow me to send some poor Spaniard in my place In other words he seemed to me to say This little game must stop He rose with an air of marvelous dignity and left me quite upset by such unheard of delicacy in a man of his class He went downstairs and asked to speak with my father At dinner my father said to me with a smile Louise you have been learning Spanish from an ex minister and a man condemned to death The Duc de Soria I said Duke replied my father No he is not that any longer he takes the title now of Baron de Macumer from a property which still remains to him in Sardinia He is something of an original I think Don t brand with that word which with you always implies some mockery and scorn a man who is your equal and who I believe has a noble nature Baronne de Macumer exclaimed my father with a laughing glance at me Pride kept my eyes fixed on the table But said my mother Henarez must have met the Spanish ambassador on the steps Yes replied my father the ambassador asked me if I was conspiring against the King his master but he greeted the ex grandee of Spain with much deference and placed his services at his disposal All this dear Mme de l Estorade happened a fortnight ago and it is a fortnight now since I have seen the man who loves me for that he loves me there is not a doubt What is he about If only I were a fly or a mouse or a sparrow I want to see him alone myself unseen at his house Only think a man exists to whom I can say Go and die for me And he is so made that he would go at least I think so Anyhow there is in Paris a man who occupies my thoughts and whose glance pours sunshine into my soul Is not such a man an enemy whom I ought to trample under foot What There is a man who has become necessary to me a man without whom I don t know how to live You married and I in love Four little months and those two doves whose wings erst bore them so high have fluttered down upon the flat stretches of real life Sunday Yesterday at the Italian Opera I could feel some one was looking at me my eyes were drawn as by a magnet to two wells of fire gleaming like carbuncles in a dim corner of the orchestra Henarez never moved his eyes from me The wretch had discovered the one spot from which he could see me and there he was I don t know what he may be as a politician but for love he has a genius Behold my fair Renee where our business now stands as the great Corneille has said XIII MME DE L ESTORADE TO MLLE DE CHAULIEU LA CRAMPADE February 
22_121148_000002_000000	train-clean-360	My dear Louise I was bound to wait some time before writing to you but now I know or rather I have learned many things which for the sake of your future happiness I must tell you 
22_121148_000002_000001	train-clean-360	The difference between a girl and a married woman is so vast that the girl can no more comprehend it than the married woman can go back to girlhood again 
none	none	I chose to marry Louis de l Estorade rather than return to the convent that at least is plain So soon as I realized that the convent was the only alternative to marrying Louis I had as girls say to submit and my submission once made the next thing was to examine the situation and try to make the best of it 
22_121148_000004_000000	train-clean-360	The serious nature of what I was undertaking filled me at first with terror 
22_121148_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Marriage is a matter concerning the whole of life whilst love aims only at pleasure 
none	none	On the other hand marriage will remain when pleasures have vanished and it is the source of interests far more precious than those of the man and woman entering on the alliance 
22_121148_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Might it not therefore be that the only requisite for a happy marriage was friendship a friendship which for the sake of these advantages would shut its eyes to many of the imperfections of humanity 
none	none	Now there was no obstacle to the existence of friendship between myself and Louis de l Estorade Having renounced all idea of finding in marriage those transports of love on which our minds used so often and with such perilous rapture to dwell I found a gentle calm settling over me If debarred from love why not seek for happiness I said to myself Moreover I am loved and the love offered me I shall accept 
22_121148_000004_000006	train-clean-360	My married life will be no slavery but rather a perpetual reign 
none	none	What is there to say against such a situation for a woman who wishes to remain absolute mistress of herself 
22_121148_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The important point of separating marriage from marital rights was settled in a conversation between Louis and me in the course of which he gave proof of an excellent temper and a tender heart 
none	none	Darling my desire was to prolong that fair season of hope which never culminating in satisfaction leaves to the soul its virginity 
22_121148_000005_000002	train-clean-360	To grant nothing to duty or the law to be guided entirely by one s own will retaining perfect independence what could be more attractive more honorable 
22_121148_000006_000000	train-clean-360	A contract of this kind directly opposed to the legal contract and even to the sacrament itself could be concluded only between Louis and me 
none	none	This difficulty the first which has arisen is the only one which has delayed the completion of our marriage 
22_121148_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Although at first I may have made up my mind to accept anything rather than return to the convent it is only in human nature having got an inch to ask for an ell and you and I sweet love are of those who would have it all 
none	none	I watched Louis out of the corner of my eye and put it to myself Has suffering had a softening or a hardening effect on him By dint of close study I arrived at the conclusion that his love amounted to a passion Once transformed into an idol whose slightest frown would turn him white and trembling I realized that I might venture anything 
22_121148_000007_000002	train-clean-360	I drew him aside in the most natural manner on solitary walks during which I discreetly sounded his feelings 
22_121148_000007_000003	train-clean-360	I made him talk and got him to expound to me his ideas and plans for our future 
none	none	My questions betrayed so many preconceived notions and went so straight for the weak points in this terrible dual existence that Louis has since confessed to me the alarm it caused him to find in me so little of the ignorant maiden Then I listened to what he had to say in reply 
22_121148_000008_000001	train-clean-360	He got mixed up in his arguments as people do when handicapped by fear and before long it became clear that chance had given me for adversary one who was the less fitted for the contest because he was conscious of what you magniloquently call my greatness of soul Broken by sufferings and misfortune he looked on himself as a sort of wreck and three fears in especial haunted him 
22_121148_000009_000000	train-clean-360	First we are aged respectively thirty seven and seventeen and he could not contemplate without quaking the twenty years that divide us 
none	none	In the next place he shares our views on the subject of my beauty and it is cruel for him to see how the hardships of his life have robbed him of youth Finally he felt the superiority of my womanhood over his manhood 
22_121148_000009_000003	train-clean-360	The consciousness of these three obvious drawbacks made him distrustful of himself he doubted his power to make me happy and guessed that he had been chosen as the lesser of two evils 
none	none	One evening he tentatively suggested that I only married him to escape the convent
22_121148_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 I cannot deny it was my grave reply 
none	none	My dear it touched me to the heart to see the two great tears which stood in his eyes Never before had I experienced the shock of emotion which a man can impart to us Louis I went on as kindly as I could it rests entirely with you whether this marriage of convenience becomes one to which I can give my whole heart 
22_121148_000013_000001	train-clean-360	The favor I am about to ask from you will demand unselfishness on your part far nobler than the servitude to which a man s love when sincere is supposed to reduce him 
none	none	The question is Can you rise to the height of friendship such as I understand it Life gives us but one friend and I wish to be yours 
22_121148_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Friendship is the bond between a pair of kindred souls united in their strength and yet independent 
22_121148_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Let us be friends and comrades to bear jointly the burden of life 
22_121148_000014_000003	train-clean-360	Leave me absolutely free 
none	none	I would put no hindrance in the way of your inspiring me with a love similar to your own but I am determined to be yours only of my own free gift Create in me the wish to give up my freedom and at once I lay it at your feet
22_121148_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Infuse with passion then if you will this friendship and let the voice of love disturb its calm 
none	none	On my part I will do what I can to bring my feelings into accord with yours One thing above all I would beg of you Spare me the annoyances to which the strangeness of our mutual position might give rise to our relations with others 
22_121148_000015_000004	train-clean-360	I am neither whimsical nor prudish and should be sorry to get that reputation but I feel sure that I can trust to your honor when I ask you to keep up the outward appearance of wedded life 
none	none	Never dear have I seen a man so happy as my proposal made Louis The blaze of joy which kindled in his eyes dried up the tears Do not fancy I concluded that I ask this from any wish to be eccentric 
22_121148_000017_000001	train-clean-360	It is the great desire I have for your respect which prompts my request 
none	none	If you owe the crown of your love merely to the legal and religious ceremony what gratitude could you feel to me later for a gift in which my goodwill counted for nothing 
22_121148_000017_000003	train-clean-360	If during the time that I remained indifferent to you yielding only a passive obedience such as my mother has just been urging on me a child were born to us do you suppose that I could feel towards it as I would towards one born of our common love 
22_121148_000017_000004	train-clean-360	A passionate love may not be necessary in marriage but at least you will admit that there should be no repugnance 
22_121148_000017_000005	train-clean-360	Our position will not be without its dangers in a country life such as ours will be ought we not to bear in mind the evanescent nature of passion 
none	none	Is it not simple prudence to make provision beforehand against the calamities incident to change of feeling He was greatly astonished to find me at once so reasonable and so apt at reasoning but he made me a solemn promise after which I took his hand and pressed it affectionately 
22_121148_000019_000000	train-clean-360	We were married at the end of the week 
none	none	Secure of my freedom I was able to throw myself gaily into the petty details which always accompany a ceremony of the kind and to be my natural self Perhaps I may have been taken for an old bird as they say at Blois A young girl delighted with the novel and hopeful situation she had contrived to make for herself and may have passed for a strong minded female Dear the difficulties which would beset my life had appeared to me clearly as in a vision and I was sincerely anxious to make the happiness of the man I married 
22_121148_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Now in the solitude of a life like ours marriage soon becomes intolerable unless the woman is the presiding spirit 
none	none	A woman in such a case needs the charm of a mistress combined with the solid qualities of a wife To introduce an element of uncertainty into pleasure is to prolong illusion and render lasting those selfish satisfactions which all creatures hold and should shroud a woman in expectancy crown her sovereign and invest her with an exhaustless power a redundancy of life that makes everything blossom around her The more she is mistress of herself the more certainly will the love and happiness she creates be fit to weather the storms of life But above all I have insisted on the greatest secrecy in regard to our domestic arrangements A husband who submits to his wife s yoke is justly held an object of ridicule A woman s influence ought to be entirely concealed The charm of all we do lies in its unobtrusiveness If I have made it my task to raise a drooping courage and restore their natural brightness to gifts which I have dimly descried it must all seem to spring from Louis himself Such is the mission to which I dedicate myself a mission surely not ignoble and which might well satisfy a woman s ambition Why I could glory in this secret which shall fill my life with interest in this task towards which my every energy shall be bent while it remains concealed from all but God and you I am very nearly happy now but should I be so without a friendly heart in which to pour the confession 
22_121148_000023_000001	train-clean-360	For how make a confidant of him 
22_121148_000023_000002	train-clean-360	My happiness would wound him and has to be concealed 
none	none	He is sensitive as a woman like all men who have suffered much For three months we remained as we were before marriage As you may imagine during this time I made a close study of many small personal matters which have more to do with love than is generally supposed 
22_121148_000024_000002	train-clean-360	In spite of my coldness Louis grew bolder and his nature expanded 
none	none	I saw on his face a new expression a look of youth The greater refinement which I introduced into the house was reflected in his person Insensibly I became accustomed to his presence and made another self of him By dint of constant watching I discovered how his mind and countenance harmonize The animal that we call a husband to quote your words disappeared and one balmy evening I discovered in his stead a lover whose words thrilled me and on whose arm I leant with pleasure beyond words In short to be open with you as I would be with God before whom concealment is impossible the perfect loyalty with which he had kept his oath may have piqued me and I felt a fluttering of curiosity in my heart Bitterly ashamed I struggled with myself Alas when pride is the only motive for resistance excuses for capitulation are soon found 
22_121148_000025_000000	train-clean-360	We celebrated our union in secret and secret it must remain between us When you are married you will approve this reserve 
none	none	Enough that nothing was lacking either of satisfaction for the most fastidious sentiment or of that unexpectedness which brings in a sense its own sanction Every witchery of imagination of passion of reluctance overcome of the ideal passing into reality played its part 
22_121148_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Yet in spite of all this enchantment I once more stood out for my complete independence 
none	none	I can t tell you all my reasons for this To you alone shall I confide even as much as this I believe that women whether passionately loved or not lose much in their relation with their husbands by not concealing their feelings about marriage and the way they look at it 
22_121148_000027_000000	train-clean-360	My one joy and it is supreme springs from the certainty of having brought new life to my husband before I have borne him any children Louis has regained his youth strength and spirits 
22_121148_000027_000001	train-clean-360	He is not the same man 
22_121148_000027_000002	train-clean-360	With magic touch I have effaced the very memory of his sufferings It is a complete metamorphosis 
none	none	Louis is really very attractive now Feeling sure of my affection he throws off his reserve and displays unsuspected gifts To be the unceasing spring of happiness for a man who knows it and adds gratitude to love ah dear one this is a conviction which fortifies the soul even more than the most passionate love can do The force thus developed at once impetuous and enduring simple and diversified brings forth ultimately the family that noble product of womanhood which I realize now in all its animating beauty The old father has ceased to be a miser He gives blindly whatever I wish for The servants are content it seems as though the bliss of Louis had let a flood of sunshine into the household where love has made me queen Even the old man would not be a blot upon my pretty home and has brought himself into line with all my improvements to please me he has adopted the dress and with the dress the manners of the day 
22_121148_000030_000000	train-clean-360	We have English horses a coupe a barouche and a tilbury 
none	none	The livery of our servants is simple but in good taste Of course we are looked on as spendthrifts 
22_121148_000030_000003	train-clean-360	I apply all my intellect I am speaking quite seriously to managing my household with economy and obtaining for it the maximum of pleasure with the minimum of cost 
none	none	I have already convinced Louis of the necessity of getting roads made in order that he may earn the reputation of a man interested in the welfare of his district 
22_121148_000031_000001	train-clean-360	I insist too on his studying a great deal Before long I hope to see him a member of the Council General of the Department through the influence of my family and his mother s 
22_121148_000031_000002	train-clean-360	I have told him plainly that I am ambitious and that I was very well pleased his father should continue to look after the estate and practise economies because I wished him to devote himself exclusively to politics 
none	none	If we had children I should like to see them all prosperous and with good State appointments 
22_121148_000031_000004	train-clean-360	Under penalty therefore of forfeiting my esteem and affection he must get himself chosen deputy for the department at the coming elections my family would support his candidature and we should then have the delight of spending all our winters in Paris 
none	none	Ah my love by the ardor with which he embraced my plans I can gauge the depth of his affection To conclude here is a letter he wrote me yesterday from Marseilles where he had gone to spend a few hours
22_121148_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 MY SWEET RENEE When you gave me permission to love you I began to believe in happiness now I see it unfolding endlessly before me 
none	none	The past is merely a dim memory a shadowy background without which my present bliss would show less radiant 
22_121148_000033_000002	train-clean-360	When I am with you love so transports me that I am powerless to express the depth of my affection I can but worship and admire 
none	none	Only at a distance does the power of speech return You are supremely beautiful Renee and your beauty is of the statuesque and regal type on which time leaves but little impression 
22_121148_000033_000005	train-clean-360	No doubt the love of husband and wife depends less on outward beauty than on graces of character which are yours also in perfection still let me say that the certainty of having your unchanging beauty on which to feast my eyes gives me a joy that grows with every glance 
22_121148_000033_000006	train-clean-360	There is a grace and dignity in the lines of your face expressive of the noble soul within and breathing of purity beneath the vivid coloring 
none	none	The brilliance of your dark eyes the bold sweep of your forehead declare a spirit of no common elevation sound and trustworthy in every relation and well braced to meet the storms of life should such arise The keynote of your character is its freedom from all pettiness You do not need to be told all this but I write it because I would have you know that I appreciate the treasure I possess Your favors to me however slight will always make my happiness in the far distant future as now for I am sensible how much dignity there is in our promise to respect each other s liberty 
22_121148_000033_000011	train-clean-360	Our own impulse shall with us alone dictate the expression of feeling 
none	none	We shall be free even in our fetters I shall have the more pride in wooing you again now that I know the reward you place on victory 
22_121148_000033_000014	train-clean-360	You cannot speak breathe act or think without adding to the admiration I feel for your charm both of body and mind 
none	none	There is in you a rare combination of the ideal the practical and the bewitching which satisfies alike judgment a husband s pride desire and hope and which extends the boundaries of love beyond those of life itself Oh my loved one may the genius of love remain faithful to me and the future be full of those delights by means of which you have glorified all that surrounds me I long for the day which shall make you a mother that I may see you content with the fulness of your life may hear you in the sweet voice I love and with the thoughts bless the love which has refreshed my soul and given new vigor to my powers the love which is my pride and whence I have drawn as from a magic fountain fresh life Yes I shall be all that you would have me I shall take a leading part in the public life of the district and on you shall fall the rays of a glory which will owe its existence to the desire of pleasing you 
22_121148_000034_000000	train-clean-360	So much for my pupil dear 
none	none	Do you suppose he could have written like this before A year hence his style will have still further improved Louis is now in his first transport what I look forward to is the uniform and continuous sensation of content which ought to be the fruit of a happy marriage when a man and woman in perfect trust and mutual knowledge have solved the problem of giving variety to the infinite This is the task set before every true wife the answer begins to dawn on me and I shall not rest till I have made it mine You see that he fancies himself vanity of men the chosen of my heart just as though there were no legal bonds Nevertheless I have not yet got beyond that external attraction which gives us strength to put up with a good deal 
22_121148_000035_000002	train-clean-360	Yet Louis is lovable his temper is wonderfully even and he performs as a matter of course acts on which most men would plume themselves 
none	none	In short if I do not love him I shall find no difficulty in being good to him So here are my black hair and my black eyes whose lashes act according to you like Venetian blinds my commanding air and my whole person raised to the rank of sovereign power Ten years hence dear why should we not both be laughing and gay in your Paris whence I shall carry you off now and again to my beautiful oasis in Provence 
22_121148_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Oh Louise don t spoil the splendid future which awaits us both 
22_121148_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Don t do the mad things with which you threaten me 
none	none	My husband is a young man prematurely old why don t you marry some young hearted graybeard in the Chamber of Peers There lies your vocation XIV THE DUC DE SORIA TO THE BARON DE MACUMER MADRID MY DEAR BROTHER You did not make me Duc de Soria in order that my actions should belie the name How could I tolerate my happiness if I knew you to be a wanderer deprived of the comforts which wealth everywhere commands Neither Marie nor I will consent to marry till we hear that you have accepted the money which Urraca will hand over to you These two millions are the fruit of your own savings and Marie s We have both prayed kneeling before the same altar and with what earnestness God knows for your happiness My dear brother it cannot be that these prayers will remain unanswered Heaven will send you the love which you seek to be the consolation of your exile Marie read your letter with tears and is full of admiration for you As for me I consent not for my own sake but for that of the family The King justified your expectations Oh that I might avenge you by letting him see himself dwarfed before the scorn with which you flung him his toy as you might toss a tiger its food The only thing I have taken for myself dear brother is my happiness I have taken Marie For this I shall always be beholden to you as the creature to the Creator There will be in my life and in Marie s one day not less glorious than our wedding day it will be the day when we hear that your heart has found its mate that a woman loves you as you ought to be and would be loved Do not forget that if you live for us we also live for you You can write to us with perfect confidence under cover to the Nuncio sending your letters via Rome The French ambassador at Rome will no doubt undertake to forward them to Monsignore Bemboni at the State Secretary s office whom our legate will have advised No other way would be safe Farewell dear exile dear despoiled one Be proud at least of the happiness which you have brought to us if you cannot be happy in it God will doubtless hear our prayers which are full of your name XV LOUISE DE CHAULIEU TO MME DE L ESTORADE March Ah my love marriage is making a philosopher of you Your darling face must indeed have been jaundiced when you wrote me those terrible views of human life and the duty of women Do you fancy you will convert me to matrimony by your programme of subterranean labors Alas is this then the outcome for you of our too instructed dreams We left Blois all innocent armed with the pointed shafts of meditation and lo the weapons of that purely ideal experience have turned against your own breast If I did not know you for the purest and most angelic of created beings I declare I should say that your calculations smack of vice What my dear in the interest of your country home you submit your pleasures to a periodic thinning as you do your timber Oh rather let me perish in all the violence of the heart s storms than live in the arid atmosphere of your cautious arithmetic As girls we were both unusually enlightened because of the large amount of study we gave to our chosen subjects but my child philosophy without love or disguised under a sham love is the most hideous of conjugal hypocrisies I should imagine that even the biggest of fools might detect now and again the owl of wisdom squatting in your bower of roses a ghastly phantom sufficient to put to flight the most promising of passions You make your own fate instead of waiting a plaything in its hands We are each developing in strange ways A large dose of philosophy to a grain of love is your recipe a large dose of love to a grain of philosophy is mine Why Rousseau s Julie whom I thought so learned is a mere beginner to you Woman s virtue quotha How you have weighed up life Alas I make fun of you and after all perhaps you are right In one day you have made a holocaust of your youth and become a miser before your time Your Louis will be happy I daresay If he loves you of which I make no doubt he will never find out that for the sake of your family you are acting as a courtesan does for money and certainly men seem to find happiness with them judging by the fortunes they squander thus A keen sighted husband might no doubt remain in love with you but what sort of gratitude could he feel in the long run for a woman who had made of duplicity a sort of moral armor as indispensable as her stays Love dear is in my eyes the first principle of all the virtues conformed to the divine likeness Like all other first principles it is not a matter of arithmetic it is the Infinite in us I cannot but think you have been trying to justify in your own eyes the frightful position of a girl married to a man for whom she feels nothing more than esteem You prate of duty and make it your rule and measure but surely to take necessity as the spring of action is the moral theory of atheism To follow the impulse of love and feeling is the secret law of every woman s heart You are acting a man s part and your Louis will have to play the woman Oh my dear your letter has plunged me into an endless train of thought I see now that the convent can never take the place of mother to a girl I beg of you my grand angel with the black eyes so pure and proud so serious and so pretty do not turn away from these cries which the first reading of your letter has torn from me I have taken comfort in the thought that while I was lamenting love was doubtless busy knocking down the scaffolding of reason It may be that I shall do worse than you without any reasoning or calculations Passion is an element in life bound to have a logic not less pitiless than yours Monday Yesterday night I placed myself at the window as I was going to bed to look at the sky which was wonderfully clear The stars were like silver nails holding up a veil of blue In the silence of the night I could hear some one breathing and by the half light of the stars I saw my Spaniard perched like a squirrel on the branches of one of the trees lining the boulevard and doubtless lost in admiration of my windows The first effect of this discovery was to make me withdraw into the room my feet and hands quite limp and nerveless but beneath the fear I was conscious of a delicious undercurrent of joy I was overpowered but happy Not one of those clever Frenchmen who aspire to marry me has had the brilliant idea of spending the night in an elm tree at the risk of being carried off by the watch My Spaniard has no doubt been there for some time Ah he won t give me any more lessons he wants to receive them well he shall have one If only he knew what I said to myself about his superficial ugliness Others can philosophize besides you Renee It was horrid I argued to fall in love with a handsome man Is it not practically avowing that the senses count for three parts out of four in a passion which ought to be super sensual Having got over my first alarm I craned my neck behind the window in order to see him again and well was I rewarded By means of a hollow cane he blew me in through the window a letter cunningly rolled round a leaden pellet Good Heavens will he suppose I left the window open on purpose But what was to be done To shut it suddenly would be to make oneself an accomplice I did better I returned to my window as though I had seen nothing and heard nothing of the letter then I said aloud Come and look at the stars Griffith Griffith was sleeping as only old maids can But the Moor hearing me slid down and vanished with ghostly rapidity He must have been dying of fright and so was I for I did not hear him go away apparently he remained at the foot of the elm After a good quarter of an hour during which I lost myself in contemplation of the heavens and battled with the waves of curiosity I closed my widow and sat down on the bed to unfold the delicate bit of paper with the tender touch of a worker amongst the ancient manuscripts at Naples It felt redhot to my fingers What a horrible power this man has over me I said to myself All at once I held out the paper to the candle I would burn it without reading a word Then a thought stayed me What can he have to say that he writes so secretly Well dear I did burn it reflecting that though any other girl in the world would have devoured the letter it was not fitting that I Armande Louise Marie de Chaulieu should read it The next day at the Italian opera he was at his post But I feel sure that ex prime minister of a constitutional government though he is he could not discover the slightest agitation of mind in any movement of mine I might have seen nothing and received nothing the evening before This was most satisfactory to me but he looked very sad Poor man in Spain it is so natural for love to come in at the window During the interval it seems he came and walked in the passages This I learned from the chief secretary of the Spanish embassy who also told the story of a noble action of his As Duc de Soria he was to marry one of the richest heiresses in Spain the young princess Marie Heredia whose wealth would have mitigated the bitterness of exile But it seems that Marie disappointing the wishes of the fathers who had betrothed them in their earliest childhood loved the younger son of the house of Soria to whom my Felipe gave her up Allowing himself to be despoiled by the King of Spain He would perform this piece of heroism quite simply I said to the young man You know him then was his ingenuous reply My mother smiled What will become of him for he is condemned to death I asked Though dead to Spain he can live in Sardinia Ah then Spain is the country of tombs as well as castles I said trying to carry it off as a joke There is everything in Spain even Spaniards of the old school my mother replied The Baron de Macumer obtained a passport not without difficulty from the King of Sardinia the young diplomatist went on He has now become a Sardinian subject and he possesses a magnificent estate in the island with full feudal rights He has a palace at Sassari If Ferdinand VII were to die Macumer would probably go in for diplomacy and the Court of Turin would make him ambassador Though young he is Ah he is young Certainly mademoiselle though young he is one of the most distinguished men in Spain I scanned the house meanwhile through my opera glass and seemed to lend an inattentive ear to the secretary but between ourselves I was wretched at having burnt his letter In what terms would a man like that express his love For he does love me To be loved adored in secret to know that in this house where all the great men of Paris were collected there was one entirely devoted to me unknown to everybody Ah Renee now I understand the life of Paris its balls and its gaieties It all flashed on me in the true light When we love we must have society were it only to sacrifice it to our love I felt a different creature and such a happy one My vanity pride self love all were flattered Heaven knows what glances I cast upon the audience Little rogue the Duchess whispered in my ear with a smile Yes Renee my wily mother had deciphered the hidden joy in my bearing and I could only haul down my flag before such feminine strategy Those two words taught me more of worldly wisdom than I have been able to pick up in a year for we are in March now Alas no more Italian opera in another month How will life be possible without that heavenly music when one s heart is full of love When I got home my dear with determination worthy of a Chaulieu I opened my window to watch a shower of rain Oh if men knew the magic spell that a heroic action throws over us they would indeed rise to greatness a poltroon would turn hero What I had learned about my Spaniard drove me into a very fever I felt certain that he was there ready to aim another letter at me I was right and this time I burnt nothing Here then is the first love letter I have received madame logician each to her kind Louise it is not for your peerless beauty I love you nor for your gifted mind your noble feeling the wondrous charm of all you say and do nor yet for your pride your queenly scorn of baser mortals a pride blent in you with charity for what angel could be more tender Louise I love you because for the sake of a poor exile you have unbent this lofty majesty because by a gesture a glance you have brought consolation to a man so far beneath you that the utmost he could hope for was your pity the pity of a generous heart You are the one woman whose eyes have shone with a tenderer light when bent on me And because you let fall this glance a mere grain of dust yet a grace surpassing any bestowed on me when I stood at the summit of a subject s ambition I long to tell you Louise how dear you are to me and that my love is for yourself alone without a thought beyond a love that far more than fulfils the conditions laid down by you for an ideal passion Know then idol of my highest heaven that there is in the world an offshoot of the Saracen race whose life is in your hands who will receive your orders as a slave and deem it an honor to execute them I have given myself to you absolutely and for the mere joy of giving for a single glance of your eye for a touch of the hand which one day you offered to your Spanish master I am but your servitor Louise I claim no more No I dare not think that I could ever be loved but perchance my devotion may win for me toleration Since that morning when you smiled upon me with generous girlish impulse divining the misery of my lonely and rejected heart you reign there alone You are the absolute ruler of my life the queen of my thoughts the god of my heart I find you in the sunshine of my home the fragrance of my flowers the balm of the air I breathe the pulsing of my blood the light that visits me in sleep One thought alone troubled this happiness your ignorance All unknown to you was this boundless devotion the trusty arm the blind slave the silent tool the wealth for henceforth all I possess is mine only as a trust which lay at your disposal unknown to you the heart waiting to receive your confidence and yearning to replace all that your life I know it well has lacked the liberal ancestress so ready to meet your needs a father to whom you could look for protection in every difficulty a friend a brother The secret of your isolation is no secret to me If I am bold it is because I long that you should know how much is yours Take all Louise and is so doing bestow on me the one life possible for me in this world the life of devotion In placing the yoke on my neck you run no risk I ask nothing but the joy of knowing myself yours Needless even to say you will never love me it cannot be otherwise I must love you from afar without hope without reward beyond my own love In my anxiety to know whether you will accept me as your servant I have racked my brain to find some way in which you may communicate with me without any danger of compromising yourself Injury to your self respect there can be none in sanctioning a devotion which has been yours for many days without your knowledge Let this then be the token At the opera this evening if you carry in your hand a bouquet consisting of one red and one white camellia emblem of a man s blood at the service of the purity he worships that will be my answer I ask no more thenceforth at any moment ten years hence or to morrow whatever you demand shall be done so far as it is possible for man to do it by your happy servant FELIPE HENAREZ P S You must admit dear that great lords know how to love See the spring of the African lion What restrained fire What loyalty What sincerity How high a soul in low estate I felt quite small and dazed as I said to myself What shall I do It is the mark of a great man that he puts to flight all ordinary calculations He is at once sublime and touching childlike and of the race of giants In a single letter Henarez has outstripped volumes from Lovelace or Saint Preux Here is true love no beating about the bush Love may be or it may not but where it is it ought to reveal itself in its immensity Here am I shorn of all my little arts To refuse or accept That is the alternative boldly presented me without the ghost of an opening for a middle course No fencing allowed This is no longer Paris we are in the heart of Spain or the far East It is the voice of Abencerrage and it is the scimitar the horse and the head of Abencerrage which he offers prostrate before a Catholic Eve Shall I accept this last descendant of the Moors Read again and again his Hispano Saracenic letter Renee dear and you will see how love makes a clean sweep of all the Judaic bargains of your philosophy Renee your letter lies heavy on my heart you have vulgarized life for me What need have I for finessing Am I not mistress for all time of this lion whose roar dies out in plaintive and adoring sighs Ah how he must have raged in his lair of the Rue Hillerin Bertin I know where he lives I have his card F Baron de Macumer He has made it impossible for me to reply All I can do is to fling two camellias in his face What fiendish arts does love possess pure honest simple minded love Here is the most tremendous crisis of a woman s heart resolved into an easy simple action Oh Asia I have read the Arabian Nights here is their very essence two flowers and the question is settled We clear the fourteen volumes of Clarissa Harlowe with a bouquet I writhe before this letter like a thread in the fire To take or not to take my two camellias Yes or No kill or give life At last a voice cries to me Test him And I will test him XVI THE SAME TO THE SAME March I am dressed in white white camellias in my hair and another in my hand My mother has red camellias so it would not be impossible to take one from her if I wished I have a strange longing to put off the decision to the last moment and make him pay for his red camellia by a little suspense What a vision of beauty Griffith begged me to stop for a little and be admired The solemn crisis of the evening and the drama of my secret reply have given me a color on each cheek I sport a red camellia laid upon a white one A M Everybody admired me but only one adored He hung his head as I entered with a white camellia but turned pale as the flower when later I took a red one from my mother s hand To arrive with the two flowers might possibly have been accidental but this deliberate action was a reply My confession therefore is fuller than it need have been The opera was Romeo and Juliet As you don t know the duet of the two lovers you can t understand the bliss of two neophytes in love as they listen to this divine outpouring of the heart On returning home I went to bed but only to count the steps which resounded on the sidewalk My heart and head darling are all on fire now What is he doing What is he thinking of Has he a thought a single thought that is not of me Is he in very truth the devoted slave he painted himself How to be sure Or again has it ever entered his head that if I accept him I lay myself open to the shadow of a reproach or am in any sense rewarding or thanking him I am harrowed by the hair splitting casuistry of the heroines in Cyrus and Astraea by all the subtle arguments of the court of love Has he any idea that in affairs of love a woman s most trifling actions are but the issue of long brooding and inner conflicts of victories won only to be lost What are his thoughts at this moment How can I give him my orders to write every evening the particulars of the day just gone He is my slave whom I ought to keep busy I shall deluge him with work Sunday Morning Only towards morning did I sleep a little It is midday now I have just got Griffith to write the following letter To the Baron de Macumer Mademoiselle de Chaulieu begs me Monsieur le Baron to ask you to return to her the copy of a letter written to her by a friend which is in her own handwriting and which you carried away Believe me et cetera GRIFFITH My dear Griffith has gone out she has gone to the Rue Hillerin Bertin she had handed in this little love letter for my slave who returned to me in an envelope my sweet portrait stained with tears He has obeyed Oh my sweet it must have been dear to him Another man would have refused to send it in a letter full of flattery but the Saracen has fulfilled his promises He has obeyed It moves me to tears XVII THE SAME TO THE SAME April second Yesterday the weather was splendid I dressed myself like a girl who wants to look her best in her sweetheart s eyes My father yielding to my entreaties has given me the prettiest turnout in Paris two dapple gray horses and a barouche which is a masterpiece of elegance I was making a first trial of this and peeped out like a flower from under my sunshade lined with white silk As I drove up the avenue of the Champs Elysees I saw my Abencerrage approaching on an extraordinarily beautiful horse Almost every man nowadays is a finished jockey and they all stopped to admire and inspect it He bowed to me and on receiving a friendly sign of encouragement slackened his horse s pace so that I was able to say to him You are not vexed with me for asking for my letter it was no use to you Then in a lower voice You have already transcended the ideal Your horse makes you an object of general interest I went on aloud My steward in Sardinia sent it to me He is very proud of it for this horse which is of Arab blood was born in my stables This morning my dear Henarez was on an English sorrel also very fine but not such as to attract attention My light mocking words had done their work He bowed to me and I replied with a slight inclination of the head The Duc d Angouleme has bought Macumer s horse My slave understood that he was deserting the role of simplicity by attracting the notice of the crowd A man ought to be remarked for what he is not for his horse or anything else belonging to him To have too beautiful a horse seems to me a piece of bad taste just as much as wearing a huge diamond pin I was delighted at being able to find fault with him Perhaps there may have been a touch of vanity in what he did very excusable in a poor exile and I like to see this childishness Oh my dear old preacher do my love affairs amuse you as much as your dismal philosophy gives me the creeps Dear Philip the Second in petticoats are you comfortable in my barouche Do you see those velvet eyes humble yet so eloquent and glorying in their servitude which flash on me as some one goes by He is a hero Renee and he wears my livery and always a red camellia in his buttonhole while I have always a white one in my hand How clear everything becomes in the light of love How well I know my Paris now It is all transfused with meaning And love here is lovelier grander more bewitching than elsewhere I am convinced now that I could never flirt with a fool or make any impression on him It is only men of real distinction who can enter into our feelings and feel our influence Oh my poor friend forgive me I forgot our l Estorade But didn t you tell me you were going to make a genius of him I know what that means You will dry nurse him till some day he is able to understand you Good bye I am a little off my head and must stop XVIII MME DE L ESTORADE TO LOUISE DE CHAULIEU April My angel or ought I not rather to say my imp of evil you have without meaning it grieved me sorely I would say wounded were we not one soul And yet it is possible to wound oneself How plain it is that you have never realized the force of the word indissoluble as applied to the contract binding man and woman I have no wish to controvert what has been laid down by philosophers or legislators they are quite capable of doing this for themselves but dear one in making marriage irrevocable and imposing on it a relentless formula which admits of no exceptions they have rendered each union a thing as distinct as one individual is from another Each has its own inner laws which differ from those of others The laws regulating married life in the country for instance cannot be the same as those regulating a household in town where frequent distractions give variety to life Or conversely married life in Paris where existence is one perpetual whirl must demand different treatment from the more peaceful home in the provinces But if place alters the conditions of marriage much more does character The wife of a man born to be a leader need only resign herself to his guidance whereas the wife of a fool conscious of superior power is bound to take the reins in her own hand if she would avert calamity You speak of vice and it is possible that after all reason and reflection produce a result not dissimilar from what we call by that name For what does a woman mean by it but perversion of feeling through calculation Passion is vicious when it reasons admirable only when it springs from the heart and spends itself in sublime impulses that set at naught all selfish considerations Sooner or later dear one you too will say Yes dissimulation is the necessary armor of a woman if by dissimulation be meant courage to bear in silence prudence to foresee the future Every married woman learns to her cost the existence of certain social laws which in many respects conflict with the laws of nature Marrying at our age it would be possible to have a dozen children What is this but another name for a dozen crimes a dozen misfortunes It would be handing over to poverty and despair twelve innocent darlings whereas two children would mean the happiness of both a double blessing two lives capable of developing in harmony with the customs and laws of our time The natural law and the code are in hostility and we are the battle ground Would you give the name of vice to the prudence of the wife who guards her family from destruction through its own acts One calculation or a thousand what matter if the decision no longer rests with the heart And of this terrible calculation you will be guilty some day my noble Baronne de Macumer when you are the proud and happy wife of the man who adores you or rather being a man of sense he will spare you by making it himself You see dear dreamer that I have studied the code in its bearings on conjugal relations And when at last that day comes you will understand that we are answerable only to God and to ourselves for the means we employ to keep happiness alight in the heart of our homes Far better is the calculation which succeeds in this than the reckless passion which introduces trouble heart burnings and dissension I have reflected painfully on the duties of a wife and mother of a family Yes sweet one it is only by a sublime hypocrisy that we can attain the noblest ideal of a perfect woman You tax me with insincerity because I dole out to Louis from day to day the measure of his intimacy with me but is it not too close an intimacy which provokes rupture My aim is to give him in the very interest of his happiness many occupations which will all serve as distractions to his love and this is not the reasoning of passion If affection be inexhaustible it is not so with love the task therefore of a woman truly no light one is to spread it out thriftily over a lifetime At the risk of exciting your disgust I must tell you that I persist in the principles I have adopted and hold myself both heroic and generous in so doing Virtue my pet is an abstract idea varying in its manifestations with the surroundings Virtue in Provence in Constantinople in London and in Paris bears very different fruit but is none the less virtue Each human life is a substance compacted of widely dissimilar elements though viewed from a certain height the general effect is the same If I wished to make Louis unhappy and to bring about a separation all I need do is to leave the helm in his hands I have not had your good fortune in meeting with a man of the highest distinction but I may perhaps have the satisfaction of helping him on the road to it Five years hence let us meet in Paris and see I believe we shall succeed in mystifying you You will tell me then that I was quite mistaken and that M de l Estorade is a man of great natural gifts As for this brave love of which I know only what you tell me these tremors and night watches by starlight on the balcony this idolatrous worship this deification of woman I knew it was not for me You can enlarge the borders of your brilliant life as you please mine is hemmed in to the boundaries of La Crampade And you reproach me for the jealous care which alone can nurse this modest and fragile shoot into a wealth of lasting and mysterious happiness I believed myself to have found out how to adapt the charm of a mistress to the position of a wife and you have almost made me blush for my device Who shall say which of us is right which is wrong Perhaps we are both right and both wrong Perhaps this is the heavy price which society exacts for our furbelows our titles and our children I too have my red camellias but they bloom on my lips in smiles for my double charge the father and the son whose slave and mistress I am But my dear your last letters made me feel what I have lost You have taught me all a woman sacrifices in marrying One single glance did I take at those beautiful wild plateaus where you range at your sweet will and I will not tell you the tears that fell as I read But regret is not remorse though it may be first cousin to it You say Marriage has made you a philosopher Alas bitterly did I feel how far this was from the truth as I wept to think of you swept away on love s torrent But my father has made me read one of the profoundest thinkers of these parts the man on whom the mantle of Boussuet has fallen one of those hard headed theorists whose words force conviction While you were reading Corinne I conned Bonald and here is the whole secret of my philosophy He revealed to me the Family in its strength and holiness According to Bonald your father was right in his homily Farewell my dear fancy my friend my wild other self XIX LOUISE DE CHAULIEU TO MME DE L ESTORADE Well my Renee you are a love of a woman and I quite agree now that we can only be virtuous by cheating Will that satisfy you Moreover the man who loves us is our property we can make a fool or a genius of him as we please only between ourselves the former happens more commonly You will make yours a genius and you won t tell the secret there are two heroic actions if you will Ah if there were no future life how nicely you would be sold for this is martyrdom into which you are plunging of your own accord You want to make him ambitious and to keep him in love Child that you are surely the last alone is sufficient Tell me to what point is calculation a virtue or virtue calculation You won t say Well we won t quarrel over that since we have Bonald to refer to We are and intend to remain virtuous nevertheless at this moment I believe that you with all your pretty little knavery are a better woman than I am Yes I am shockingly deceitful I love Felipe and I conceal it from him with an odious hypocrisy I long to see him leap from his tree to the top of the wall and from the wall to my balcony and if he did how I should wither him with my scorn You see I am frank enough with you What restrains me Where is the mysterious power which prevents me from telling Felipe dear fellow how supremely happy he has made me by the outpouring of his love so pure so absolute so boundless so unobtrusive and so overflowing Mme de Mirbel is painting my portrait and I intend to give it to him my dear What surprises me more and more every day is the animation which love puts into life How full of interest is every hour every action every trifle and what amazing confusion between the past the future and the present One lives in three tenses at once Is it still so after the heights of happiness are reached Oh tell me I implore you what is happiness Does it soothe or does it excite I am horribly restless I seem to have lost all my bearings a force in my heart drags me to him spite of reason and spite of propriety There is this gain that I am better able to enter into your feelings Felipe s happiness consists in feeling himself mine the aloofness of his love his strict obedience irritate me just as his attitude of profound respect provoked me when he was only my Spanish master I am tempted to cry out to him as he passes Fool if you love me so much as a picture what will it be when you know the real me Oh Renee you burn my letters don t you I will burn yours If other eyes than ours were to read these thoughts which pass from heart to heart I should send Felipe to put them out and perhaps to kill the owners by way of additional security Monday Oh Renee how is it possible to fathom the heart of man My father ought to introduce me to M Bonald since he is so learned I would ask him I envy the privilege of God who can read the undercurrents of the heart Does he still worship That is the whole question If ever in gesture glance or tone I were to detect the slightest falling off in the respect he used to show me in the days when he was my instructor in Spanish I feel that I should have strength to put the whole thing from me Why these fine words these grand resolutions you will say Dear I will tell you My fascinating father who treats me with the devotion of an Italian cavaliere servente for his lady had my portrait painted as I told you by Mme de Mirbel I contrived to get a copy made good enough to do for the Duke and sent the original to Felipe I despatched it yesterday and these lines with it Don Felipe your single hearted devotion is met by a blind confidence Time will show whether this is not to treat a man as more than human It was a big reward It looked like a promise and dreadful to say a challenge but which will seem to you still more dreadful I quite intended that it should suggest both these things without going so far as actually to commit me If in his reply there is Dear Louise or even Louise he is done for Tuesday No he is not done for The constitutional minister is perfect as a lover Here is his letter Every moment passed away from your sight has been filled by me with ideal pictures of you my eyes closed to the outside world and fixed in meditation on your image which used to obey the summons too slowly in that dim palace of dreams glorified by your presence Henceforth my gaze will rest upon this wondrous ivory this talisman might I not say since your blue eyes sparkle with life as I look and paint passes into flesh and blood If I have delayed writing it is because I could not tear myself away from your presence which wrung from me all that I was bound to keep most secret Yes closeted with you all last night and to day I have for the first time in my life given myself up to full complete and boundless happiness Could you but see yourself where I have placed you between the Virgin and God you might have some idea of the agony in which the night has passed But I would not offend you by speaking of it for one glance from your eyes robbed of the tender sweetness which is my life would be full of torture for me and I implore your clemency therefore in advance Queen of my life and of my soul oh that you could grant me but one thousandth part of the love I bear you This was the burden of my prayer doubt worked havoc in my soul as I oscillated between belief and despair between life and death darkness and light A criminal whose verdict hangs in the balance is not more racked with suspense than I as I own to my temerity The smile imaged on your lips to which my eyes turned ever and again and alone able to calm the storm roused by the dread of displeasing you From my birth no one not even my mother has smiled on me The beautiful young girl who was designed for me rejected my heart and gave hers to my brother Again in politics all my efforts have been defeated In the eyes of my king I have read only thirst for vengeance from childhood he has been my enemy and the vote of the Cortes which placed me in power was regarded by him as a personal insult Less than this might breed despondency in the stoutest heart Besides I have no illusion I know the gracelessness of my person and am well aware how difficult it is to do justice to the heart within so rugged a shell To be loved had ceased to be more than a dream to me when I met you Thus when I bound myself to your service I knew that devotion alone could excuse my passion But as I look upon this portrait and listen to your smile that whispers of rapture the rays of a hope which I had sternly banished pierced the gloom like the light of dawn again to be obscured by rising mists of doubt and fear of your displeasure if the morning should break to day No it is impossible you should love me yet I feel it but in time as you make proof of the strength the constancy and depth of my affection you may yield me some foothold in your heart If my daring offends you tell me so without anger and I will return to my former part But if you consent to try and love me be merciful and break it gently to one who has placed the happiness of his life in the single thought of serving you My dear as I read these last words he seemed to rise before me pale as the night when the camellias told their story and he knew his offering was accepted These words in their humility were clearly something quite different from the usual flowery rhetoric of lovers and a wave of feeling broke over me it was the breath of happiness The weather has been atrocious impossible to go to the Bois without exciting all sorts of suspicions Even my mother who often goes out regardless of rain remains at home and alone Wednesday evening I have just seen him at the Opera my dear he is another man He came to our box introduced by the Sardinian ambassador Having read in my eyes that this audacity was taken in good part he seemed awkwardly conscious of his limbs and addressed the Marquise d Espard as mademoiselle A light far brighter than the glare of the chandeliers flashed from his eyes At last he went out with the air of a man who didn t know what he might do next The Baron de Macumer is in love exclaimed Mme de Maufrigneuse Strange isn t it for a fallen minister replied my mother I had sufficient presence of mind myself to regard with curiosity Mmes de Maufrigneuse and d Espard and my mother as though they were talking a foreign language and I wanted to know what it was all about but inwardly my soul sank in the waves of an intoxicating joy There is only one word to express what I felt and that is rapture Such love as Felipe s surely makes him worthy of mine I am the very breath of his life my hands hold the thread that guides his thoughts To be quite frank I have a mad longing to see him clear every obstacle and stand before me asking boldly for my hand Then I should know whether this storm of love would sink to placid calm at a glance from me Ah my dear I stopped here and I am still all in a tremble As I wrote I heard a slight noise outside and rose to see what it was From my window I could see him coming along the ridge of the wall at the risk of his life I went to the bedroom window and made him a sign it was enough he leaped from the wall ten feet and then ran along the road as far as I could see him in order to show me that he was not hurt That he should think of my fear at the moment when he must have been stunned by his fall moved me so much that I am still crying I don t know why Poor ungainly man what was he coming for what had he to say to me I dare not write my thoughts and shall go to bed joyful thinking of all that we would say if we were together Farewell fair silent one I have not time to scold you for not writing but it is more than a month since I have heard from you Does this mean that you are at last happy Have you lost the complete independence which you were so proud of and which to night has so nearly played me false XX RENEE DE L ESTORADE TO LOUISE DE CHAULIEU May If love be the life of the world why do austere philosophers count it for nothing in marriage Why should Society take for its first law that the woman must be sacrificed to the family introducing thus a note of discord into the very heart of marriage And this discord was foreseen since it was to meet the dangers arising from it that men were armed with new found powers against us But for these we should have been able to bring their whole theory to nothing whether by the force of love or of a secret persistent aversion I see in marriage as it at present exists two opposing forces which it was the task of the lawgiver to reconcile When will they be reconciled I said to myself as I read your letter Oh my dear one such letter alone is enough to overthrow the whole fabric constructed by the sage of Aveyron under whose shelter I had so cheerfully ensconced myself The laws were made by old men any woman can see that and they have been prudent enough to decree that conjugal love apart from passion is not degrading and that a woman in yielding herself may dispense with the sanction of love provided the man can legally call her his In their exclusive concern for the family they have imitated Nature whose one care is to propagate the species Formerly I was a person now I am a chattel Not a few tears have I gulped down alone and far from every one How gladly would I have exchanged them for a consoling smile Why are our destinies so unequal Your soul expands in the atmosphere of a lawful passion For you virtue will coincide with pleasure If you encounter pain it will be of your own free choice Your duty if you marry Felipe will be one with the sweetest freest indulgence of feeling Our future is big with the answer to my question and I look for it with restless eagerness You love and are adored Oh my dear let this noble romance the old subject of our dreams take full possession of your soul Womanly beauty refined and spiritualized in you was created by God for His own purposes to charm and to delight Yes my sweet guard well the secret of your heart and submit Felipe to those ingenious devices of ours for testing a lover s metal Above all make trial of your own love for this is even more important It is so easy to be misled by the deceptive glamour of novelty and passion and by the vision of happiness Alone of the two friends you remain in your maiden independence and I beseech you dearest do not risk the irrevocable step of marriage without some guarantee It happens sometimes when two are talking together apart from the world their souls stripped of social disguise that a gesture a word a look lights up as by a flash some dark abyss You have courage and strength to tread boldly in paths where others would be lost You have no conception in what anxiety I watch you Across all this space I see you my heart beats with yours Be sure therefore to write and tell me everything Your letters create an inner life of passion within my homely peaceful household which reminds me of a level highroad on a gray day The only event here my sweet is that I am playing cross purposes with myself But I don t want to tell you about it just now it must wait for another day With dogged obstinacy I pass from despair to hope now yielding now holding back It may be that I ask from life more than we have a right to claim In youth we are so ready to believe that the ideal and the real will harmonize I have been pondering alone seated beneath a rock in my park and the fruit of my pondering is that love in marriage is a happy accident on which it is impossible to base a universal law My Aveyron philosopher is right in looking on the family as the only possible unit in society and in placing woman in subjection to the family as she has been in all ages The solution of this great for us almost awful question lies in our first child For this reason I would gladly be a mother were it only to supply food for the consuming energy of my soul Louis temper remains as perfect as ever his love is of the active my tenderness of the passive type He is happy plucking the flowers which bloom for him without troubling about the labor of the earth which has produced them Blessed self absorption At whatever cost to myself I fall in with his illusions as a mother in my idea of her should be ready to spend herself to satisfy a fancy of her child The intensity of his joy blinds him and even throws its reflection upon me The smile or look of satisfaction which the knowledge of his content brings to my face is enough to satisfy him And so my child is the pet name which I give him when we are alone And I wait for the fruit of all these sacrifices which remain a secret between God myself and you On motherhood I have staked enormously my credit account is now too large I fear I shall never receive full payment To it I look for employment of my energy expansion of my heart and the compensation of a world of joys Pray Heaven I be not deceived It is a question of all my future and horrible thought of my virtue XXI LOUISE DE CHAULIEU TO RENEE DE L ESTORADE June Dear wedded sweetheart Your letter has arrived at the very moment to hearten me for a bold step which I have been meditating night and day I feel within me a strange craving for the unknown or if you will the forbidden which makes me uneasy and reveals a conflict in progress in my soul between the laws of society and of nature I cannot tell whether nature in me is the stronger of the two but I surprise myself in the act of meditating between the hostile powers In plain words what I wanted was to speak with Felipe alone at night under the lime trees at the bottom of our garden There is no denying that this desire beseems the girl who has earned the epithet of an up to date young lady bestowed on me by the Duchess in jest and which my father has approved Yet to me there seems a method in this madness I should recompense Felipe for the long nights he has passed under my window at the same time that I should test him by seeing what he thinks of my escapade and how he comports himself at a critical moment Let him cast a halo round my folly behold in him my husband let him show one iota less of the tremulous respect with which he bows to me in the Champs Elysees farewell Don Felipe As for society I run less risk in meeting my lover thus than when I smile to him in the drawing rooms of Mme de Maufrigneuse and the old Marquise de Beauseant where spies now surround us on every side and Heaven only knows how people stare at the girl suspected of a weakness for a grotesque like Macumer I cannot tell you to what a state of agitation I am reduced by dreaming of this idea and the time I have given to planning its execution I wanted you badly What happy hours we should have chattered away lost in the mazes of uncertainty enjoying in anticipation all the delights and horrors of a first meeting in the silence of night under the noble lime trees of the Chaulieu mansion with the moonlight dancing through the leaves As I sat alone every nerve tingling I cried Oh Renee where are you Then your letter came like a match to gunpowder and my last scruples went by the board Through the window I tossed to my bewildered adorer an exact tracing of the key of the little gate at the end of the garden together with this note Your madness must really be put a stop to If you broke your neck you would ruin the reputation of the woman you profess to love Are you worthy of a new proof of regard and do you deserve that I should talk with you under the limes at the foot of the garden at the hour when the moon throws them into shadow Yesterday at one o clock when Griffith was going to bed I said to her Take your shawl dear and come out with me I want to go to the bottom of the garden without anyone knowing Without a word she followed me Oh my Renee what an awful moment when after a little pause full of delicious thrills of agony I saw him gliding along like a shadow When he had reached the garden safely I said to Griffith Don t be astonished but the Baron de Macumer is here and indeed it is on that account I brought you with me No reply from Griffith What would you have with me said Felipe in a tone of such agitation that it was easy to see he was driven beside himself by the noise slight as it was of our dresses in the silence of the night and of our steps upon the gravel I want to say to you what I could not write I replied Griffith withdrew a few steps It was one of those mild nights when the air is heavy with the scent of flowers My head swam with the intoxicating delight of finding myself all but alone with him in the friendly shade of the lime trees beyond which lay the garden shining all the more brightly because the white facade of the house reflected the moonlight The contrast seemed as it were an emblem of our clandestine love leading up to the glaring publicity of a wedding Neither of us could do more at first than drink in silently the ecstasy of a moment as new and marvelous for him as for me At last I found tongue to say pointing to the elm tree Although I am not afraid of scandal you shall not climb that tree again We have long enough played schoolboy and schoolgirl let us rise now to the height of our destiny Had that fall killed you I should have died disgraced I looked at him Every scrap of color had left his face And if you had been found there suspicion would have attached either to my mother or to me Forgive me he murmured If you walk along the boulevard I shall hear your step and when I want to see you I will open my window But I would not run such a risk unless some emergency arose Why have you forced me by your rash act to commit another and one which may lower me in your eyes The tears which I saw in his eyes were to me the most eloquent of answers What I have done to night I went on with a smile must seem to you the height of madness After we had walked up and down in silence more than once he recovered composure enough to say You must think me a fool and indeed the delirium of my joy has robbed me of both nerve and wits But of this at least be assured whatever you do is sacred in my eyes from the very fact that it seemed right to you I honor you as I honor only God besides And then Miss Griffith is here She is here for the sake of the others not for us I put in hastily My dear he understood me at once I know very well he said with the humblest glance at me that whether she is there or not makes no difference Unseen of men we are still in the presence of God and our own esteem is not less important to us than that of the world Thank you Felipe I said holding out my hand to him with a gesture which you ought to see A woman and I am nothing if not a woman is on the road to loving the man who understands her Oh only on the road I went on with a finger on my lips Don t let your hopes carry you beyond what I say My heart will belong only to the man who can read it and know its every turn Our views without being absolutely identical must be the same in their breadth and elevation I have no wish to exaggerate my own merits doubtless what seem virtues in my eyes have their corresponding defects All I can say is I should be heartbroken without them Having first accepted me as your servant you now permit me to love you he said trembling and looking in my face at each word My first prayer has been more than answered But I hastened to reply your position seems to me a better one than mine I should not object to change places and this change it lies with you to bring about In my turn I thank you he replied I know the duties of a faithful lover It is mine to prove that I am worthy of you the trials shall be as long as you choose to make them If I belie your hopes you have only God that I should say it to reject me I know that you love me I replied So far with a cruel emphasis on the words you stand first in my regard Otherwise you would not be here Then we began to walk up and down as we talked and I must say that so soon as my Spaniard had recovered himself he put forth the genuine eloquence of the heart It was not passion it breathed but a marvelous tenderness of feeling which he beautifully compared to the divine love His thrilling voice which lent an added charm to thoughts in themselves so exquisite reminded me of the nightingale s note He spoke low using only the middle tones of a fine instrument and words flowed upon words with the rush of a torrent It was the overflow of the heart No more I said or I shall not be able to tear myself away And with a gesture I dismissed him You have committed yourself now mademoiselle said Griffith In England that might be so but not in France I replied with nonchalance I intend to make a love match and am feeling my way that is all You see dear as love did not come to me I had to do as Mahomet did with the mountain Friday Once more I have seen my slave He has become very timid and puts on an air of pious devotion which I like for it seems to say that he feels my power and fascination in every fibre But nothing in his look or manner can rouse in these society sibyls any suspicion of the boundless love which I see Don t suppose though dear that I am carried away mastered tamed on the contrary the taming mastering and carrying away are on my side In short I am quite capable of reason Oh to feel again the terror of that fascination in which I was held by the schoolmaster the plebeian the man I kept at a distance The fact is that love is of two kinds one which commands and one which obeys The two are quite distinct and the passion to which the one gives rise is not the passion of the other To get her full of life perhaps a woman ought to have experience of both Can the two passions ever company exist Can the man in whom we inspire love inspire it in us Will the day ever come when Felipe is my master Shall I tremble then as he does now These are questions which make me shudder He is very blind In his place I should have thought Mlle de Chaulieu meeting me under the limes a cold calculating coquette with starched manners No that is not love it is playing with fire I am still fond of Felipe but I am calm and at my ease with him now No more obstacles What a terrible thought It is all ebb tide within and I fear to question my heart His mistake was in concealing the ardor of his love he ought to have forced my self control In a word I was naughty and I have not got the reward such naughtiness brings No dear however sweet the memory of that half hour beneath the trees it is nothing like the excitement of the old time with its Shall I go Shall I not go Shall I write to him Shall I not write Is it thus with all our pleasures Is suspense always better than enjoyment Hope than fruition Is it the rich who in very truth are the poor Have we not both perhaps exaggerated feeling by giving to imagination too free a rein There are times when this thought freezes me Shall I tell you why Because I am meditating another visit to the bottom of the garden without Griffith How far could I go in this direction Imagination knows no limit but it is not so with pleasure Tell me dear be furbelowed professor how can one reconcile the two goals of a woman s existence XXII LOUISE TO FELIPE I am not pleased with you If you did not cry over Racine s Berenice and feel it to be the most terrible of tragedies there is no kinship in our souls we shall never get on together and had better break off at once Let us meet no more Forget me for if I do not have a satisfactory reply I shall forget you You will become M le Baron de Macumer for me or rather you will cease to be at all Yesterday at Mme d Espard s you had a self satisfied air which disgusted me No doubt apparently about your conquest In sober earnest your self possession alarms me Not a trace in you of the humble slave of your first letter Far from betraying the absent mindedness of a lover you polished epigrams This is not the attitude of a true believer always prostrate before his divinity If you do not feel me to be the very breath of your life a being nobler than other women and to be judged by other standards then I must be less than a woman in your sight You have roused in me a spirit of mistrust Felipe and its angry mutterings have drowned the accents of tenderness When I look back upon what has passed between us I feel in truth that I have a right to be suspicious For know Prime Minister of all the Spains that I have reflected much on the defenceless condition of our sex My innocence has held a torch and my fingers are not burnt Let me repeat to you then what my youthful experience taught me In all other matters duplicity faithlessness and broken pledges are brought to book and punished but not so with love which is at once the victim the accuser the counsel judge and executioner The cruelest treachery the most heartless crimes are those which remain for ever concealed with two hearts alone for witness How indeed should the victim proclaim them without injury to herself Love therefore has its own code its own penal system with which the world has no concern Now for my part I have resolved never to pardon a serious misdemeanor and in love pray what is not serious Yesterday you had all the air of a man successful in his suit You would be wrong to doubt it and yet if this assurance robbed you of the charming simplicity which sprang from uncertainty I should blame you severely I would have you neither bashful nor self complacent I would not have you in terror of losing my affection that would be an insult but neither would I have you wear your love lightly as a thing of course Never should your heart be freer than mine If you know nothing of the torture that a single stab of doubt brings to the soul tremble lest I give you a lesson In a single glance I confided my heart to you and you read the meaning The purest feelings that ever took root in a young girl s breast are yours The thought and meditation of which I have told you served only to enrich the mind but if ever the wounded heart turns to the brain for counsel be sure the young girl would show some kinship with the demon of knowledge and of daring I swear to you Felipe if you love me as I believe you do and if I have reason to suspect the least falling off in the fear obedience and respect which you have hitherto professed if the pure flame of passion which first kindled the fire of my heart should seem to me any day to burn less vividly you need fear no reproaches I would not weary you with letters bearing any trace of weakness pride or anger nor even with one of warning like this But if I spoke no words Felipe my face would tell you that death was near And yet I should not die till I had branded you with infamy and sown eternal sorrow in your heart you would see the girl you loved dishonored and lost in this world and know her doomed to everlasting suffering in the next Do not therefore I implore you give me cause to envy the old happy Louise the object of your pure worship whose heart expanded in the sunshine of happiness since in the words of Dante she possessed Senza brama sicura ricchezza I have searched the Inferno through to find the most terrible punishment some torture of the mind to which I might link the vengeance of God Yesterday as I watched you doubt went through me like a sharp cold dagger s point Do you know what that means I mistrusted you and the pang was so terrible I could not endure it longer If my service be too hard leave it I would not keep you Do I need any proof of your cleverness Keep for me the flowers of your wit Show to others no fine surface to call forth flattery compliments or praise Come to me laden with hatred or scorn the butt of calumny come to me with the news that women flout you and ignore you and not one loves you then ah then you will know the treasures of Louise s heart and love We are only rich when our wealth is buried so deep that all the world might trample it under foot unknowing If you were handsome I don t suppose I should have looked at you twice or discovered one of the thousand reasons out of which my love sprang True we know no more of these reasons than we know why it is the sun makes the flowers to bloom and ripens the fruit Yet I could tell you of one reason very dear to me The character expression and individuality that ennoble your face are a sealed book to all but me Mine is the power which transforms you into the most lovable of men and that is why I would keep your mental gifts also for myself To others they should be as meaningless as your eyes the charm of your mouth and features Let it be mine alone to kindle the beacon of your intelligence as I bring the lovelight into your eyes I would have you the Spanish grandee of old days cold ungracious haughty a monument to be gazed at from afar like the ruins of some barbaric power which no one ventures to explore Now you have nothing better to do than to open up pleasant promenades for the public and show yourself of a Parisian affability Is my ideal portrait then forgotten Your excessive cheerfulness was redolent of your love Had it not been for a restraining glance from me you would have proclaimed to the most sharp sighted keen witted and unsparing of Paris salons that your inspiration was drawn from Armande Louise Marie de Chaulieu I believe in your greatness too much to think for a moment that your love is ruled by policy but if you did not show a childlike simplicity when with me I could only pity you Spite of this first fault you are still deeply admired by LOUISE DE CHAULIEU XXIII FELIPE TO LOUISE When God beholds our faults He sees also our repentance Yes my beloved mistress you are right I felt that I had displeased you but knew not how Now that you have explained the cause of your trouble I find in it fresh motive to adore you Like the God of Israel you are a jealous deity and I rejoice to see it For what is holier and more precious than jealousy My fair guardian angel jealousy is an ever wakeful sentinel it is to love what pain is to the body the faithful herald of evil Be jealous of your servant Louise I beg of you the harder you strike the more contrite will he be and kiss the rod in all submission which proves that he is not indifferent to you But alas dear if the pains it cost me to vanquish my timidity and master feelings you thought so feeble were invisible to you will Heaven think you reward them I assure you it needed no slight effort to show myself to you as I was in the days before I loved At Madrid I was considered a good talker and I wanted you to see for yourself the few gifts I may possess If this were vanity it has been well punished Your last glance utterly unnerved me Never had I so quailed even when the army of France was at the gates of Cadiz and I read peril for my life in the dissembling words of my royal master Vainly I tried to discover the cause of your displeasure and the lack of sympathy between us which this fact disclosed was terrible to me For in truth I have no wish but to act by your will think your thoughts see with your eyes respond to your joy and suffering as my body responds to heat and cold The crime and the anguish lay for me in the breach of unison in that common life of feeling which you have made so fair I have vexed her I exclaimed over and over again like one distraught My noble my beautiful Louise if anything could increase the fervor of my devotion or confirm my belief in your delicate moral intuitions it would be the new light which your words have thrown upon my own feelings Much in them of which my mind was formerly but dimly conscious you have now made clear If this be designed as chastisement what can be the sweetness of your rewards Louise for me it was happiness enough to be accepted as your servant You have given me the life of which I despaired No longer do I draw a useless breath I have something to spend myself for my force has an outlet if only in suffering for you Once more I say as I have said before that you will never find me other than I was when first I offered myself as your lowly bondman Yes were you dishonored and lost to use your own words my heart would only cling the more closely to you for your self sought misery It would be my care to staunch your wounds and my prayers should importune God with the story of your innocence and your wrongs Did I not tell you that the feelings of my heart for you are not a lover s only that I will be to you father mother sister brother ay a whole family anything or nothing as you may decree And is it not your own wish which has confined within the compass of a lover s feeling so many varying forms of devotion Pardon me then if at times the father and brother disappear behind the lover since you know they are none the less there though screened from view Would that you could read the feelings of my heart when you appear before me radiant in your beauty the centre of admiring eyes reclining calmly in your carriage in the Champs Elysees or seated in your box at the Opera Then would you know how absolutely free from selfish taint is the pride with which I hear the praises of your loveliness and grace praises which warm my heart even to the strangers who utter them When by chance you have raised me to elysium by a friendly greeting my pride is mingled with humility and I depart as though God s blessing rested on me Nor does the joy vanish without leaving a long track of light behind It breaks on me through the clouds of my cigarette smoke More than ever do I feel how every drop of this surging blood throbs for you Can you be ignorant how you are loved After seeing you I return to my study and the glitter of its Saracenic ornaments sinks to nothing before the brightness of your portrait when I open the spring that keeps it locked up from every eye and lose myself in endless musings or link my happiness to verse From the heights of heaven I look down upon the course of a life such as my hopes dare to picture it Have you never in the silence of the night or through the roar of the town heard the whisper of a voice in your sweet dainty ear Does no one of the thousand prayers that I speed to you reach home By dint of silent contemplation of your pictured face I have succeeded in deciphering the expression of every feature and tracing its connection with some grace of the spirit and then I pen a sonnet to you in Spanish on the harmony of the twofold beauty in which nature has clothed you These sonnets you will never see for my poetry is too unworthy of its theme I dare not send it to you Not a moment passes without thoughts of you for my whole being is bound up in you and if you ceased to be its animating principle every part would ache Now Louise can you realize the torture to me of knowing that I had displeased you while entirely ignorant of the cause The ideal double life which seemed so fair was cut short My heart turned to ice within me as hopeless of any other explanation I concluded that you had ceased to love me With heavy heart and yet not wholly without comfort I was falling back upon my old post as servant then your letter came and turned all to joy Oh might I but listen for ever to such chiding Once a child picking himself up from a tumble turned to his mother with the words Forgive me Hiding his own hurt he sought pardon for the pain he had caused her Louise I was that child and such as I was then I am now Here is the key to my character which your slave in all humility places in your hands But do not fear there will be no more stumbling Keep tight the chain which binds me to you so that a touch may communicate your lightest wish to him who will ever remain your slave FELIPE XXIV LOUISE DE CHAULIEU TO RENEE DE L ESTORADE October My dear friend How is it possible that you who brought yourself in two months to marry a broken down invalid in order to mother him should know anything of that terrible shifting drama enacted in the recesses of the heart which we call love a drama where death lies in a glance or a light reply I had reserved for Felipe one last supreme test which was to be decisive I wanted to know whether his love was the love of a Royalist for his King who can do no wrong Why should the loyalty of a Catholic be less supreme He walked with me a whole night under the limes at the bottom of the garden and not a shadow of suspicion crossed his soul Next day he loved me better but the feeling was as reverent as humble as regretful as ever he had not presumed an iota Oh he is a very Spaniard a very Abencerrage He scaled my wall to come and kiss the hand which in the darkness I reached down to him from my balcony He might have broken his neck how many of our young men would do the like But all this is nothing Christians suffer the horrible pangs of martyrdom in the hope of heaven The day before yesterday I took aside the royal ambassador to be at the court of Spain my much respected father and said to him with a smile Sir some of your friends will have it that you are marrying your dear Armande to the nephew of an ambassador who has been very anxious for this connection and has long begged for it Also that the marriage contract arranges for his nephew to succeed on his death to his enormous fortune and his title and bestows on the young couple in the meantime an income of a hundred thousand livres on the bride a dowry of eight hundred thousand francs Your daughter weeps but bows to the unquestioned authority of her honored parent Some people are unkind enough to say that behind her tears she conceals a worldly and ambitious soul Now we are going to the gentleman s box at the Opera to night and M le Baron de Macumer will visit us there Macumer needs a touch of the spur then said my father smiling at me as though I were a female ambassador You mistake Clarissa Harlowe for Figaro I cried with a glance of scorn and mockery When you see me with my right hand ungloved you will give the lie to this impertinent gossip and will mark your displeasure at it I may make my mind easy about your future You have no more got a girl s headpiece than Jeanne d Arc had a woman s heart You will be happy you will love nobody and will allow yourself to be loved This was too much I burst into laughter What is it little flirt he said I tremble for my country s interests And seeing him look quite blank I added At Madrid You have no idea how this little nun has learned in a year s time to make fun of her father he said to the Duchess Armande makes light of everything my mother replied looking me in the face What do you mean I asked Why you are not even afraid of rheumatism on these damp nights she said with another meaning glance at me Oh I answered the mornings are so hot The Duchess looked down It s high time she were married said my father and it had better be before I go If you wish it I replied demurely Two hours later my mother and I the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse and Mme d Espard were all four blooming like roses in the front of the box I had seated myself sideways giving only a shoulder to the house so that I could see everything myself unseen in that spacious box which fills one of the two angles at the back of the hall between the columns Macumer came stood up and put his opera glasses before his eyes so that he might be able to look at me comfortably In the first interval entered the young man whom I call king of the profligates The Comte Henri de Marsay who has great beauty of an effeminate kind entered the box with an epigram in his eyes a smile upon his lips and an air of satisfaction over his whole countenance He first greeted my mother Mme d Espard and the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse the Comte d Esgrignon and M de Canalis then turning to me he said I do not know whether I shall be the first to congratulate you on an event which will make you the object of envy to many Ah a marriage I cried Is it left for me a girl fresh from the convent to tell you that predicted marriages never come off M de Marsay bent down whispering to Macumer and I was convinced from the movement of his lips that what he said was this Baron you are perhaps in love with that little coquette who has used you for her own ends but as the question is one not of love but of marriage it is as well for you to know what is going on Macumer treated this officious scandal monger to one of those glances of his which seem to me so eloquent of noble scorn and replied to the effect that he was not in love with any little coquette His whole bearing so delighted me that directly I caught sight of my father the glove was off Felipe had not a shadow of fear or doubt How well did he bear out my expectations His faith is only in me society cannot hurt him with its lies Not a muscle of the Arab s face stirred not a drop of the blue blood flushed his olive cheek The two young counts went out and I said laughing to Macumer M de Marsay has been treating you to an epigram on me He did more he replied It was an epithalamium You speak Greek to me I said rewarding him with a smile and a certain look which always embarrasses him My father meantime was talking to Mme de Maufrigneuse I should think so he exclaimed The gossip which gets about is scandalous No sooner has a girl come out than everyone is keen to marry her and the ridiculous stories that are invented I shall never force Armande to marry against her will I am going to take a turn in the promenade otherwise people will be saying that I allowed the rumor to spread in order to suggest the marriage to the ambassador and Caesar s daughter ought to be above suspicion even more than his wife if that were possible The Duchesse de Maufrigneuse and Mme d Espard shot glances first at my mother then at the Baron brimming over with sly intelligence and repressed curiosity With their serpent s cunning they had at last got an inkling of something going on Of all mysteries in life love is the least mysterious It exhales from women I believe like a perfume and she who can conceal it is a very monster Our eyes prattle even more than our tongues Having enjoyed the delightful sensation of finding Felipe rise to the occasion as I had wished it was only in nature I should hunger for more So I made the signal agreed on for telling him that he might come to my window by the dangerous road you know of A few hours later I found him upright as a statue glued to the wall his hand resting on the balcony of my window studying the reflections of the light in my room My dear Felipe I said You have acquitted yourself well to night you behaved exactly as I should have done had I been told that you were on the point of marrying I thought he replied that you would hardly have told others before me And what right have you to this privilege The right of one who is your devoted slave In very truth I am and shall ever remain so But suppose this marriage was inevitable suppose that I had agreed Two flashing glances lit up the moonlight one directed to me the other to the precipice which the wall made for us He seemed to calculate whether a fall together would mean death but the thought merely passed like lightning over his face and sparkled in his eyes A power stronger than passion checked the impulse An Arab cannot take back his word he said in a husky voice I am your slave to do with as you will my life is not mine to destroy The hand on the balcony seemed as though its hold were relaxing I placed mine on it as I said Felipe my beloved from this moment I am your wife in thought and will Go in the morning to ask my father for my hand He wishes to retain my fortune but if you promise to acknowledge receipt of it in the contract his consent will no doubt be given I am no longer Armande de Chaulieu Leave me at once no breath of scandal must touch Louise de Macumer He listened with blanched face and trembling limbs then like a flash had cleared the ten feet to the ground in safety It was a moment of agony but he waved his hand to me and disappeared I am loved then I said to myself as never woman was before And I fell asleep in the calm content of a child my destiny for ever fixed About two o clock next day my father summoned me to his private room where I found the Duchess and Macumer There was an interchange of civilities I replied quite simply that if my father and M Henarez were of one mind I had no reason to oppose their wishes Thereupon my mother invited the Baron to dinner and after dinner we all four went for a drive in the Bois de Boulogne where I had the pleasure of smiling ironically to M de Marsay as he passed on horseback and caught sight of Macumer sitting opposite to us beside my father My bewitching Felipe has had his cards reprinted as follows HENAREZ Baron de Macumer formerly Duc de Soria Every morning he brings me with his own hands a splendid bouquet hidden in which I never fail to find a letter containing a Spanish sonnet in my honor which he has composed during the night Not to make this letter inordinately large I send you as specimens only the first and last of these sonnets which I have translated for your benefit word for word and line for line FIRST SONNET Many a time I ve stood clad in thin silken vest Drawn sword in hand with steady pulse Waiting the charge of a raging bull And the thrust of his horn sharper pointed than Phoebe s crescent I ve scaled on my lips the lilt of an Andalusian dance The steep redoubt under a rain of fire I ve staked my life upon a hazard of the dice Careless as though it were a gold doubloon My hand would seek the ball out of the cannon s mouth But now meseems I grow more timid than a crouching hair Or a child spying some ghost in the curtain s folds For when your sweet eye rests on me Any icy sweat covers my brow my knees give way I tremble shrink my courage gone SECOND SONNET Last night I fain would sleep to dream of thee But jealous sleep fled my eyelids I sought the balcony and looked towards heaven Always my glance flies upward when I think of thee Strange sight whose meaning love alone can tell The sky had lost its sapphire hue The stars dulled diamonds in their golden mount Twinkled no more nor shed their warmth The moon washed of her silver radiance lily white Hung mourning over the gloomy plain for thou hast robbed The heavens of all that made them bright The snowy sparkle of the moon is on thy lovely brow Heaven s azure centres in thine eyes Thy lashes fall like starry rays What more gracious way of saying to a young girl that she fills your life Tell me what you think of this love which expends itself in lavishing the treasures alike of the earth and of the soul Only within the last ten days have I grasped the meaning of that Spanish gallantry so famous in old days Ah me dear what is going on now at La Crampade How often do I take a stroll there inspecting the growth of our crops Have you no news to give of our mulberry trees our last winter s plantations Does everything prosper as you wish And while the buds are opening on our shrubs I will not venture to speak of the bedding out plants have they also blossomed in the bosom of the wife Does Louis continue his policy of madrigals Do you enter into each other s thoughts I wonder whether your little runlet of wedding peace is better than the raging torrent of my love Has my sweet lady professor taken offence I cannot believe it and if it were so I should send Felipe off at once post haste to fling himself at her knees and bring back to me my pardon or her head Sweet love my life here is a splendid success and I want to know how it fares with life in Provence We have just increased our family by the addition of a Spaniard with the complexion of a Havana cigar and your congratulations still tarry Seriously my sweet Renee I am anxious I am afraid lest you should be eating your heart out in silence for fear of casting a gloom over my sunshine Write to me at once naughty child and tell me your life in its every minutest detail tell me whether you still hold back whether your independence still stands erect or has fallen on its knees or is sitting down comfortably which would indeed be serious Can you suppose that the incidents of your married life are without interest for me I muse at times over all that you have said to me Often when at the Opera I seem absorbed in watching the pirouetting dancers I am saying to myself It is half past nine perhaps she is in bed What is she about Is she happy Is she alone with her independence or has her independence gone the way of other dead and castoff independences A thousand loves XXV RENEE DE L ESTORADE TO LOUISE DE CHAULIEU Saucy girl Why should I write What could I say Whilst your life is varied by social festivities as well as by the anguish the tempers and the flowers of love all of which you describe so graphically that I might be watching some first rate acting at the theatre mine is as monotonous and regular as though it were passed in a convent We always go to bed at nine and get up with daybreak Our meals are served with a maddening punctuality Nothing ever happens I have accustomed myself without much difficulty to this mapping out of the day which perhaps is after all in the nature of things Where would the life of the universe be but for that subjection to fixed laws which according to the astronomers so Louis tells me rule the spheres It is not order of which we weary Then I have laid upon myself certain rules of dress and these occupy my time in the mornings I hold it part of my duty as a wife to look as charming as possible I feel a certain satisfaction in it and it causes lively pleasure to the good old man and to Louis After lunch we walk When the newspapers arrive I disappear to look after my household affairs or to read for I read a great deal or to write to you I come back to the others an hour before dinner and after dinner we play cards or receive visits or pay them Thus my days pass between a contented old man who has done with passions and the man who owes his happiness to me Louis happiness is so radiant that it has at last warmed my heart For women happiness no doubt cannot consist in the mere satisfaction of desire Sometimes in the evening when I am not required to take a hand in the game and can sink back in my armchair imagination bears me on its strong wings into the very heart of your life Then its riches its changeful tints its surging passions become my own and I ask myself to what end such a stormy preface can lead May I not swallow up the book itself For you my darling the illusions of love are possible for me only the facts of homely life remain Yes your love seems to me a dream Therefore I find it hard to understand why you are determined to throw so much romance over it Your ideal man must have more soul than fire more nobility and self command than passion You persist in trying to clothe in living form the dream ideal of a girl on the threshold of life you demand sacrifices for the pleasure of rewarding them you submit your Felipe to tests in order to ascertain whether desire hope and curiosity are enduring in their nature But child behind all your fantastic stage scenery rises the altar where everlasting bonds are forged The very morrow of your marriage the graceful structure raised by your subtle strategy may fall before that terrible reality which makes of a girl a woman of a gallant a husband Remember that there is not exemption for lovers For them as for ordinary folk like Louis and me there lurks beneath the wedding rejoicings the great Perhaps of Rabelais I do not blame you though of course it was rash for talking with Felipe in the garden or for spending a night with him you on your balcony he on his wall but you make a plaything of life and I am afraid that life may some day turn the tables I dare not give you the counsel which my own experience would suggest but let me repeat once more from the seclusion of my valley that the viaticum of married life lies in these words resignation and self sacrifice For spite of all your tests your coyness and your vigilance I can see that marriage will mean to you what it has been to me The greater the passion the steeper the precipice we have hewn for our fall that is the only difference Oh what I would give to see the Baron de Macumer and talk with him for an hour or two Your happiness lies so near my heart XXVI LOUISE DE MACUMER TO RENEE DE L ESTORADE March As Felipe has carried out with a truly Saracenic generosity the wishes of my father and mother in acknowledging the fortune he has not received from me the Duchess has become even more friendly to me than before She calls me little sly boots little woman of the world and says I know how to use my tongue But dear mamma I said to her the evening before the contract was signed you attribute to cunning and smartness on my part what is really the outcome of the truest simplest most unselfish most devoted love that ever was I assure you that I am not at all the woman of the world you do me the honor of believing me to be Come come Armande she said putting her arm on my neck and drawing me to her in order to kiss my forehead you did not want to go back to the convent you did not want to die an old maid and like a fine noble hearted Chaulieu as you are you recognized the necessity of building up your father s family The Duke was listening If you knew Renee what flattery lies for him in these words I have watched you during the whole winter poking your little nose into all that goes on forming very sensible opinions about men and the present state of society in France And you have picked out the one Spaniard capable of giving you the splendid position of a woman who reigns supreme in her own house My little girl you treated him exactly as Tullia treats your brother What lessons they give in my sister s convent exclaimed my father A glance at my father cut him short at once then turning to the Duchess I said Madame I love my future husband Felipe de Soria with all the strength of my soul Although this love sprang up without my knowledge and though I fought it stoutly when it first made itself felt I swear to you that I never gave way to it till I had recognized in the Baron de Macumer a character worthy of mine a heart of which the delicacy the generosity the devotion and the temper are suited to my own But my dear she began interrupting me he is as ugly as As anything you like I retorted quickly but I love his ugliness If you love him Armande said my father and have the strength to master your love you must not risk your happiness Now happiness in marriage depends largely on the first days Days only interrupted my mother Then with a glance at my father she continued You had better leave us my dear to have our talk together You are to be married dear child the Duchess then began in a low voice in three days It becomes my duty therefore without silly whimpering which would be unfitting our rank in life to give you the serious advice which every mother owes to her daughter You are marrying a man whom you love and there is no reason why I should pity you or myself I have only known you for a year and if this period has been long enough for me to learn to love you it is hardly sufficient to justify floods of tears at the idea of losing you Your mental gifts are even more remarkable than those of your person you have gratified maternal pride and have shown yourself a sweet and loving daughter I in my turn can promise you that you will always find a staunch friend in your mother You smile Alas it too often happens that a mother who has lived on excellent terms with her daughter as long as the daughter is a mere girl comes to cross purposes with her when they are both women together It is your happiness which I want so listen to my words The love which you now feel is that of a young girl and is natural to us all for it is woman s destiny to cling to a man Unhappily pretty one there is but one man in the world for a woman And sometimes this man whom fate has marked out for us is not the one whom we mistaking a passing fancy for love choose as husband Strange as what I say may appear to you it is worth noting If we cannot love the man we have chosen the fault is not exclusively ours it lies with both or sometimes with circumstances over which we have no control Yet there is no reason why the man chosen for us by our family the man to whom our fancy has gone out should not be the man whom we can love The barriers which arise later between husband and wife are often due to lack of perseverance on both sides The task of transforming a husband into a lover is not less delicate than that other task of making a husband of the lover in which you have just proved yourself marvelously successful I repeat it your happiness is my object Never allow yourself then to forget that the first three months of your married life may work your misery if you do not submit to the yoke with the same forbearance tenderness and intelligence that you have shown during the days of courtship For my little rogue you know very well that you have indulged in all the innocent pleasures of a clandestine love affair If the culmination of your love begins with disappointment dislike nay even with pain well come and tell me about it Don t hope for too much from marriage at first it will perhaps give you more discomfort than joy The happiness of your life requires at least as patient cherishing as the early shoots of love To conclude if by chance you should lose the lover you will find in his place the father of your children In this my dear child lies the whole secret of social life Sacrifice everything to the man whose name you bear the man whose honor and reputation cannot suffer in the least degree without involving you in frightful consequences Such sacrifice is thus not only an absolute duty for women of our rank it is also their wisest policy This indeed is the distinctive mark of great moral principles that they hold good and are expedient from whatever aspect they are viewed But I need say no more to you on this point I fancy you are of a jealous disposition and my dear if you knew how jealous I am But you must not be stupid over it To publish your jealousy to the world is like playing at politics with your cards upon the table and those who let their own game be seen learn nothing of their opponents Whatever happens we must know how to suffer in silence She added that she intended having some plain talk about me with Macumer the evening before the wedding Raising my mother s beautiful arm I kissed her hand and dropped on it a tear which the tone of real feeling in her voice had brought to my eyes In the advice she had given me I read high principle worthy of herself and of me true wisdom and a tenderness of heart unspoilt by the narrow code of society Above all I saw that she understood my character These few simple words summed up the lessons which life and experience had brought her perhaps at a heavy price She was moved and said as she looked at me Dear little girl you ve got a nasty crossing before you And most women in their ignorance or their disenchantment are as wise as the Earl of Westmoreland We both laughed but I must explain the joke The evening before a Russian princess had told us an anecdote of this gentleman He had suffered frightfully from sea sickness in crossing the Channel and turned tail when he got near Italy because he had heard some one speak of crossing the Alps Thank you I ve had quite enough crossings already he said You will understand Renee that your gloomy philosophy and my mother s lecture were calculated to revive the fears which used to disturb us at Blois The nearer marriage approached the more did I need to summon all my strength my resolution and my affection to face this terrible passage from maidenhood to womanhood All our conversations came back to my mind I re read your letters and discerned in them a vague undertone of sadness This anxiety had one advantage at least it helped me to the regulation expression for a bride as commonly depicted The consequence was that on the day of signing the contract everybody said I looked charming and quite the right thing This morning at the Mairie it was an informal business and only the witnesses were present I am writing this tail to my letter while they are putting out my dress for dinner We shall be married at midnight at the Church of Sainte Valere after a very gay evening I confess that my fears give me a martyr like and modest air to which I have no right but which will be admired why I cannot conceive I am delighted to see that poor Felipe is every whit as timorous as I am society grates on him he is like a bat in a glass shop Thank Heaven the day won t last for ever he whispered to me in all innocence In his bashfulness and timidity he would have liked to have no one there The Sardinian ambassador when he came to sign the contract took me aside in order to present me with a pearl necklace linked together by six splendid diamonds a gift from my sister in law the Duchess de Soria Along with the necklace was a sapphire bracelet on the under side of which were engraved the words Though unknown beloved Two charming letters came with these presents which however I could not accept without consulting Felipe For I said I should not like to see you wearing ornaments that came from any one but me He kissed my hand quite moved and replied Wear them for the sake of the inscription and also for the kind feeling which is sincere Saturday evening Here then my poor Renee are the last words of your girl friend After the midnight Mass we set off for an estate which Felipe with kind thought for me has bought in Nivernais on the way to Provence Already my name is Louise de Macumer but I leave Paris in a few hours as Louise de Chaulieu However I am called there will never be for you but one Louise XXVII THE SAME TO THE SAME October I have not written to you dear since our marriage nearly eight months ago And not a line from you Madame you are inexcusable To begin with we set off in a post chaise for the Castle of Chantepleurs the property which Macumer has bought in Nivernais It stands on the banks of the Loire sixty leagues from Paris Our servants with the exception of my maid were there before us and we arrived after a very rapid journey the next evening I slept all the way from Paris to beyond Montargis My lord and master put his arm round me and pillowed my head on his shoulder upon an arrangement of handkerchiefs This was the one liberty he took and the almost motherly tenderness which got the better of his drowsiness touched me strangely I fell asleep then under the fire of his eyes and awoke to find them still blazing the passionate gaze remained unchanged but what thoughts had come and gone meanwhile Twice he had kissed me on the forehead At Briare we had breakfast in the carriage Then followed a talk like our old talks at Blois while the same Loire we used to admire called forth our praises and at half past seven we entered the noble long avenue of lime trees acacias sycamores and larches which leads to Chantepleurs At eight we dined at ten we were in our bedroom a charming Gothic room made comfortable with every modern luxury Felipe who is thought so ugly seemed to me quite beautiful in his graceful kindness and the exquisite delicacy of his affection Of passion not a trace All through the journey he might have been an old friend of fifteen years standing Later he has described to me with all the vivid touches of his first letter the furious storms that raged within and were not allowed to ruffle the outer surface So far I have found nothing very terrible in marriage I said as I walked to the window and looked out on the glorious moon which lit up a charming park breathing of heavy scents He drew near put his arm again round me and said Why fear it Have I ever yet proved false to my promise in gesture or look Why should I be false in the future Yet never were words or glances more full of mastery his voice thrilled every fibre of my heart and roused a sleeping force his eyes were like the sun in power Oh I exclaimed what a world of Moorish perfidy in this attitude of perpetual prostration He understood my dear So my fair sweetheart if I have let months slip by without writing you can now divine the cause I have to recall the girl s strange past in order to explain the woman to myself Renee I understand you now Not to her dearest friend not to her mother not perhaps even to herself can a happy bride speak of her happiness This memory ought to remain absolutely her own an added rapture a thing beyond words too sacred for disclosure Is it possible that the name of duty has been given to the delicious frenzy of the heart to the overwhelming rush of passion And for what purpose What malevolent power conceived the idea of crushing a woman s sensitive delicacy and all the thousand wiles of her modesty under the fetters of constraint What sense of duty can force from her these flowers of the heart the roses of life the passionate poetry of her nature apart from love To claim feeling as a right Why it blooms of itself under the sun of love and shrivels to death under the cold blast of distaste and aversion Let love guard his own rights Oh my noble Renee I understand you now I bow to your greatness amazed at the depth and clearness of your insight Yes the woman who has not used the marriage ceremony as I have done merely to legalize and publish the secret election of her heart has nothing left but to fly to motherhood When earth fails the soul makes for heaven One hard truth emerges from all that you have said Only men who are really great know how to love and now I understand the reason of this Man obeys two forces one sensual one spiritual Weak or inferior men mistake the first for the last whilst great souls know how to clothe the merely natural instinct in all the graces of the spirit The very strength of this spiritual passion imposes severe self restraint and inspires them with reverence for women Clearly feeling is sensitive in proportion to the calibre of the mental powers generally and this is why the man of genius alone has something of a woman s delicacy He understands and divines woman and the wings of passion on which he raises her are restrained by the timidity of the sensitive spirit But when the mind the heart and the senses all have their share in the rapture which transports us ah then there is no falling to earth rather it is to heaven we soar alas for only too brief a visit Such dear soul is the philosophy of the first three months of my married life Felipe is angelic Without figure of speech he is another self and I can think aloud with him His greatness of soul passes my comprehension Possession only attaches him more closely to me and he discovers in his happiness new motives for loving me For him I am the nobler part of himself I can foresee that years of wedded life far from impairing his affection will only make it more assured develop fresh possibilities of enjoyment and bind us in more perfect sympathy What a delirium of joy It is part of my nature that pleasure has an exhilarating effect on me it leaves sunshine behind and becomes a part of my inner being The interval which parts one ecstasy from another is like the short night which marks off our long summer days The sun which flushed the mountain tops with warmth in setting finds them hardly cold when it rises What happy chance has given me such a destiny My mother had roused a host of fears in me her forecast which though free from the alloy of vulgar pettiness seemed to me redolent of jealousy has been falsified by the event Your fears and hers my own all have vanished in thin air We remained at Chantepleurs seven months and a half for all the world like a couple of runaway lovers fleeing the parental warmth while the roses of pleasure crowned our love and embellished our dual solitude One morning when I was even happier than usual I began to muse over my lot and suddenly Renee and her prosaic marriage flashed into my mind It seemed to me that now I could grasp the inner meaning in your life Oh my sweet why do we speak a different tongue Your marriage of convenience and my love match are two worlds as widely separated as the finite from infinity You still walk the earth whilst I range the heavens Your sphere is human mine divine Love crowned me queen you reign by reason and duty So lofty are the regions where I soar that a fall would shiver me to atoms But no more of this I shrink from painting to you the rainbow brightness the profusion the exuberant joy of love s springtime as we know it For ten days we have been in Paris staying in a charming house in the Rue du Bac prepared for us by the architect to whom Felipe intrusted the decoration of Chantepleurs I have been listening in all the full content of an assured and sanctioned love to that divine music of Rossini s which used to soothe me when as a restless girl I hungered vaguely after experience They say I am more beautiful and I have a childish pleasure in hearing myself called Madame Friday morning Renee my fair saint the happiness of my own life pulls me for ever back to you I feel that I can be more to you than ever before you are so dear to me I have studied your wedded life closely in the light of my own opening chapters and you seem to me to come out of the scrutiny so great so noble so splendid in your goodness that I here declare myself your inferior and humble admirer as well as your friend When I think what marriage has been to me it seems to me that I should have died had it turned out otherwise And you live Tell me what your heart feeds on Never again shall I make fun of you Mockery my sweet is the child of ignorance we jest at what we know nothing of Recruits will laugh where the veteran soldier looks grave was a remark made to me by the Comte de Chaulieu that poor cavalry officer whose campaigning so far has consisted in marches from Paris to Fontainebleau and back again I surmise too my dear love that you have not told me all There are wounds which you have hidden You suffer I am convinced of it In trying to make out at this distance and from the scraps you tell me the reasons of your conduct I have weaved together all sorts of romantic theories about you She has made a mere experiment in marriage I thought one evening and what is happiness for me had proved only suffering to her Her sacrifice is barren of reward and she would not make it greater than need be The unctuous axioms of social morality are only used to cloak her disappointment Ah Renee the best of happiness is that it needs no dogma and no fine words to pave the way it speaks for itself while theory has been piled upon theory to justify the system of women s vassalage and thralldom If self denial be so noble so sublime what pray of my joy sheltered by the gold and white canopy of the church and witnessed by the hand and seal of the most sour faced of mayors Is it a thing out of nature For the honor of the law for her own sake but most of all to make my happiness complete I long to see my Renee content Oh tell me that you see a dawn of love for this Louis who adores you Tell me that the solemn symbolic torch of Hymen has not alone served to lighten your darkness but that love the glorious sun of our hearts pours his rays on you I come back always you see to this midday blaze which will be my destruction I fear Dear Renee do you remember how in your outbursts of girlish devotion you would say to me as we sat under the vine covered arbor of the convent garden I love you so Louise that if God appeared to me in a vision I would pray Him that all the sorrows of life might be mine and all the joy yours I burn to suffer for you Now darling the day has come when I take up your prayer imploring Heaven to grant you a share in my happiness I must tell you my idea I have a shrewd notion that you are hatching ambitious plans under the name of Louis de l Estorade Very good get him elected deputy at the approaching election for he will be very nearly forty then and as the Chamber does not meet till six months later he will have just attained the age necessary to qualify for a seat You will come to Paris there isn t that enough My father and the friends I shall have made by that time will learn to know and admire you and if your father in law will agree to found a family we will get the title of Comte for Louis That is something at least And we shall be together XXVIII RENEE DE L ESTORADE TO LOUISE DE MACUMER December My thrice happy Louise your letter made me dizzy For a few moments I held it in my listless hands while a tear or two sparkled on it in the setting sun I was alone beneath the small barren rock where I have had a seat placed far off like a lance of steel the Mediterranean shone The seat is shaded by aromatic shrubs and I have had a very large jessamine some honeysuckle and Spanish brooms transplanted there so that some day the rock will be entirely covered with climbing plants The wild vine has already taken root there But winter draws near and all this greenery is faded like a piece of old tapestry In this spot I am never molested it is understood that here I wish to be alone It is named Louise s seat a proof is it not that even in solitude I am not alone here If I tell you all these details to you so paltry and try to describe the vision of green with which my prophetic gaze clothes this bare rock on which top some freak of nature has set up a magnificent parasol pine it is because in all this I have found an emblem to which I cling It was while your blessed lot was filling me with joy and must I confess it with bitter envy too that I felt the first movement of my child within and this mystery of physical life reacted upon the inner recesses of my soul This indefinable sensation which partakes of the nature at once of a warning a delight a pain a promise and a fulfilment this joy which is mine alone unshared by mortal this wonder of wonders has whispered to me that one day this rock shall be a carpet of flowers resounding to the merry laughter of children that I shall at last be blessed among women and from me shall spring forth fountains of life Now I know what I have lived for Thus the first certainty of bearing within me another life brought healing to my wounds A joy that beggars description has crowned for me those long days of sacrifice in which Louis had already found his Sacrifice I said to myself how far does it excel passion What pleasure has roots so deep as one which is not personal but creative Is not the spirit of Sacrifice a power mightier than any of its results Is it not that mysterious tireless divinity who hides beneath innumerable spheres in an unexplored centre through which all worlds in turn must pass Sacrifice solitary and secret rich in pleasures only tasted in silence which none can guess at and no profane eye has ever seen Sacrifice jealous God and tyrant God of strength and victory exhaustless spring which partaking of the very essence of all that exists can by no expenditure be drained below its own level Sacrifice there is the keynote of my life For you Louise love is but the reflex of Felipe s passion the life which I shed upon my little ones will come back to me in ever growing fulness The plenty of your golden harvest will pass mine though late will be but the more enduring for each hour will see it renewed Love may be the fairest gem which Society has filched from Nature but what is motherhood save Nature in her most gladsome mood A smile has dried my tears Love makes my Louis happy but marriage has made me a mother and who shall say I am not happy also With slow steps then I returned to my white grange with the green shutters to write you these thoughts So it is darling that the most marvelous and yet the simplest process of nature has been going on in me for five months and yet in your ear let me whisper it so far it agitates neither my heart nor my understanding I see all around me happy the grandfather to be has become a child again trespassing on the grandchild s place the father wears a grave and anxious look they are all most attentive to me all talk of the joy of being a mother Alas I alone remain cold and I dare not tell you how dead I am to all emotion though I affect a little in order not to damp the general satisfaction But with you I may be frank and I confess that at my present stage motherhood is a mere affair of the imagination Louis was to the full as much surprised as I Does not this show how little unless by his impatient wishes the father counts for in this matter Chance my dear is the sovereign deity in child bearing My doctor while maintaining that this chance works in harmony with nature does not deny that children who are the fruit of passionate love are bound to be richly endowed both physically and mentally and that often the happiness which shone like a radiant star over their birth seems to watch over them through life It may be then Louise that motherhood reserves joys for you which I shall never know It may be that the feeling of a mother for the child of a man whom she adores as you adore Felipe is different from that with which she regards the offspring of reason duty and desperation Thoughts such as these which I bury in my inmost heart add to the preoccupation only natural to a woman soon to be a mother And yet as the family cannot exist without children I long to speed the moment from which the joys of family where alone I am to find my life shall date their beginning At present I live a life all expectation and mystery except for a sickening physical discomfort which no doubt serves to prepare a woman for suffering of a different kind I watch my symptoms and in spite of the attentions and thoughtful care with which Louis anxiety surrounds me I am conscious of a vague uneasiness mingled with the nausea the distaste for food and abnormal longings common to my condition If I am to speak candidly I must confess at the risk of disgusting you with the whole business to an incomprehensible craving for rotten fruit My husband goes to Marseilles to fetch the finest oranges the world produces from Malta Portugal Corsica and these I don t touch Then I hurry there myself sometimes on foot and in a little back street running down to the harbor close to the Town Hall I find wretched half putrid oranges two for a sou which I devour eagerly The bluish greenish shades on the mouldy parts sparkle like diamonds in my eyes they are flowers to me I forget the putrid odor and find them delicious with a piquant flavor and stimulating as wine My dear they are the first love of my life Your passion for Felipe is nothing to this Sometimes I can slip out secretly and fly to Marseilles full of passionate longings which grow more intense as I draw near the street I tremble lest the woman should be sold out of rotten oranges I pounce on them and devour them as I stand It seems to me an ambrosial food and yet I have seen Louis turn aside unable to bear the smell Then came to my mind the ghastly words of Obermann in his gloomy elegy which I wish I had never read Roots slake their thirst in foulest streams Since I took to this diet the sickness has ceased and I feel much stronger This depravity of taste must have a meaning for it seems to be part of a natural process and to be common to most women sometimes going to most extravagant lengths When my situation is more marked I shall not go beyond the grounds for I should not like to be seen under these circumstances I have the greatest curiosity to know at what precise moment the sense of motherhood begins It cannot possibly be in the midst of frightful suffering the very thought of which makes me shudder Farewell favorite of fortune Farewell my friend in whom I live again and through whom I am able to picture to myself this brave love this jealousy all on fire at a look these whisperings in the ear these joys which create for women as it were a new atmosphere a new daylight fresh life Ah pet I too understand love Don t weary of telling me everything Keep faithful to our bond I promise in my turn to spare you nothing Nay to conclude in all seriousness I will not conceal from you that on reading your letter a second time I was seized with a dread which I could not shake off This superb love seems like a challenge to Providence Will not the sovereign master of this earth Calamity take umbrage if no place be left for him at your feast What mighty edifice of fortune has he not overthrown Oh Louise forget not in all this happiness your prayers to God Do good be kind and merciful let your moderation if it may be avert disaster Religion has meant much more to me since I left the convent and since my marriage but your Paris news contains no mention of it In your glorification of Felipe it seems to me you reverse the saying and invoke God less than His saint But after all this panic is only excess of affection You go to church together I do not doubt and do good in secret The close of this letter will seem to you very primitive I expect but think of the too eager friendship which prompts these fears a friendship of the type of La Fontaine s which takes alarms at dreams at half formed misty ideas You deserve to be happy since through it all you still think of me no less than I think of you in my monotonous life which though it lacks color is yet not empty and if uneventful is not unfruitful God bless you then XXIX M DE L ESTORADE TO THE BARONNE DE MACUMER December eighteen twenty five Madame It is the desire of my wife that you should not learn first from the formal announcement of an event which has filled us with joy Renee has just given birth to a fine boy whose baptism we are postponing till your return to Chantepleurs Renee and I both earnestly hope that you may then come as far as La Crampade and will consent to act as godmother to our firstborn In this hope I have had him placed on the register under the name of Armand Louis de l Estorade Our dear Renee suffered much but bore it with angelic patience You who know her will easily understand that the assurance of bringing happiness to us all supported her through this trying apprenticeship to motherhood Without indulging in the more or less ludicrous exaggerations to which the novel sensation of being a father is apt to give rise I may tell you that little Armand is a beautiful infant and you will have no difficulty in believing it when I add that he has Renee s features and eyes So far at least this gives proof of intelligence The physician and accoucheur assure us that Renee is now quite out of danger and as she is proving an admirable nurse Nature has endowed her so generously my father and I are able to give free rein to our joy Madame may I be allowed to express the hope that this joy so vivid and intense which has brought fresh life into our house and has changed the face of existence for my dear wife may ere long be yours Renee has had a suite of rooms prepared and I only wish I could make them worthy of our guests But the cordial friendliness of the reception which awaits you may perhaps atone for any lack of splendor I have heard from Renee madame of your kind thought in regard to us and I take this opportunity of thanking you for it the more gladly because nothing could now be more appropriate The birth of a grandson has reconciled my father to sacrifices which bear hardly on an old man He has just bought two estates and La Crampade is now a property with an annual rental of thirty thousand francs My father intends asking the King s permission to form an entailed estate of it and if you are good enough to get for him the title of which you spoke in your last letter you will have already done much for your godson For my part I shall carry out your suggestions solely with the object of bringing you and Renee together during the sessions of the Chamber I am working hard with the view of becoming what is called a specialist But nothing could give me greater encouragement in my labors than the thought that you will take an interest in my little Armand Come then we beg of you and with your beauty and your grace your playful fancy and your noble soul enact the part of good fairy to my son and heir You will thus madame add undying gratitude to the respectful regard of Your very humble obedient servant LOUIS DE L ESTORADE XXX LOUISE DE MACUMER TO RENEE DE L ESTORADE January eighteen twenty six Macumer has just wakened me darling with your husband s letter First and foremost Yes We shall be going to Chantepleurs about the end of April To me it will be a piling up of pleasure to travel to see you and to be the godmother of your first child I must please have Macumer for godfather To take part in a ceremony of the Church with another as my partner would be hateful to me Ah if you could see the look he gave me as I said this you would know what store this sweetest of lovers sets on his wife I am the more bent on our visiting La Crampade together Felipe I went on because I might have a child there I too you know would be a mother And yet can you fancy me torn in two between you and the infant To begin with if I saw any creature were it even my own son taking my place in your heart I couldn t answer for the consequences Medea may have been right after all The Greeks had some good notions And he laughed So my sweetheart you have the fruit without the flowers I the flowers without the fruit The contrast in our lives still holds good Between the two of us we have surely enough philosophy to find the moral of it some day Bah only ten months married Too soon you will admit to give up hope We are leading a gay yet far from empty life as is the way with happy people The days are never long enough for us Society seeing me in the trappings of a married woman pronounces the Baronne de Macumer much prettier than Louise de Chaulieu a happy love is a most becoming cosmetic When Felipe and I drive along the Champs Elysees in the bright sunshine of a crisp January day beneath the trees frosted with clusters of white stars and face all Paris on the spot where last year we met with a gulf between us the contrast calls up a thousand fancies Suppose after all your last letter should be right in its forecast and we are too presumptuous If I am ignorant of a mother s joys you shall tell me about them I will learn by sympathy But my imagination can picture nothing to equal the rapture of love You will laugh at my extravagance but I assure you that a dozen times in as many months the longing has seized me to die at thirty while life was still untarnished amidst the roses of love in the embrace of passion To bid farewell to the feast at its brightest before disappointment has come having lived in this sunshine and celestial air and well nigh spent myself in love not a leaf dropped from my crown not an illusion perished in my heart what a dream is there Think what it would be to bear about a young heart in an aged body to see only cold dumb faces around me where even strangers used to smile to be a worthy matron Can Hell have a worse torture On this very subject in fact Felipe and I have had our first quarrel I contended that he ought to have sufficient moral strength to kill me in my sleep when I have reached thirty so that I might pass from one dream to another The wretch declined I threatened to leave him alone in the world and poor child he turned white as a sheet My dear this distinguished statesman is neither more nor less than a baby It is incredible what youth and simplicity he contrived to hide away Now that I allow myself to think aloud with him as I do with you and have no secrets from him we are always giving each other surprises Dear Renee Felipe and Louise the pair of lovers want to send a present to the young mother We would like to get something that would give you pleasure and we don t share the popular taste for surprises so tell me quite frankly please what you would like It ought to be something which would recall us to you in a pleasant way something which you will use every day and which won t wear out with use The meal which with us is most cheerful and friendly is lunch and therefore the idea occurred to me of a special luncheon service ornamented with figures of babies If you approve of this let me know at once for it will have to be ordered immediately if we are to bring it Paris artists are gentlemen of far too much importance to be hurried This will be my offering to Lucina Farewell dear nursing mother May all a mother s delights be yours I await with impatience your first letter which will tell me all about it I hope Some of the details in your husband s letter went to my heart Poor Renee a mother has a heavy price to pay I will tell my godson how dearly he must love you No end of love my sweet one XXXI RENEE DE L ESTORADE TO LOUISE DE MACUMER It is nearly five months now since baby was born and not once dear heart have I found a single moment for writing to you When you are a mother yourself you will be more ready to excuse me than you are now for you have punished me a little bit in making your own letters so few and far between Do write my darling Tell me of your pleasures lay on the blue as brightly as you please It will not hurt me for I am happy now happier than you can imagine I went in state to the parish church to hear the Mass for recovery from childbirth as is the custom in the old families of Provence I was supported on either side by the two grandfathers Louis father and my own Never had I knelt before God with such a flood of gratitude in my heart I have so much to tell you of so many feelings to describe that I don t know where to begin but from amidst these confused memories one rises distinctly that of my prayer in the church When I found myself transformed into a joyful mother on the very spot where as a girl I had trembled for my future it seemed to my fancy that the Virgin on the altar bowed her head and pointed to the infant Christ who smiled at me My heart full of pure and heavenly love I held out little Armand for the priest to bless and bathe in anticipation of the regular baptism to come later But you will see us together then Armand and me My child come see how readily the word comes and indeed there is none sweeter to a mother s heart and mind or on her lips well then dear child during the last two months I used to drag myself wearily and heavily about the gardens not realizing yet how precious was the burden spite of all the discomforts it brought I was haunted by forebodings so gloomy and ghastly that they got the better even of curiosity in vain did I picture the delights of motherhood My heart made no response even to the thought of the little one who announced himself by lively kicking That is a sensation dear which may be welcome when it is familiar but as a novelty it is more strange than pleasing I speak for myself at least you know I would never affect anything I did not really feel and I look on my child as a gift straight from Heaven For one who saw in it rather the image of the man she loved it might be different But enough of such sad thoughts gone I trust for ever When the crisis came I summoned all my powers of resistance and braced myself so well for suffering that I bore the horrible agony so they tell me quite marvelously For about an hour I sank into a sort of stupor of the nature of a dream I seemed to myself then two beings an outer covering racked and tortured by red hot pincers and a soul at peace In this strange state the pain formed itself into a sort of halo hovering over me A gigantic rose seemed to spring out of my head and grow ever larger and larger till it enfolded me in its blood red petals The same color dyed the air around and everything I saw was blood red At last the climax came when soul and body seemed no longer able to hold together the spasms of pain gripped me like death itself I screamed aloud and found fresh strength against this fresh torture Suddenly this concert of hideous cries was overborne by a joyful sound the shrill wail of the newborn infant No words can describe that moment It was as though the universe took part in my cries when all at once the chorus of pain fell hushed before the child s feeble note They laid me back again in the large bed and it felt like paradise to me even in my extreme exhaustion Three or four happy faces pointed through tears to the child My dear I exclaimed in terror It s just like a little monkey Are you really and truly certain it is a child I fell back on my side miserably disappointed at my first experience of motherly feeling Don t worry dear said my mother who had installed herself as nurse Why you ve got the finest baby in the world You mustn t excite yourself but give your whole mind now to turning yourself as much as possible into an animal a milch cow pasturing in the meadow I fell asleep then fully resolved to let nature have her way Ah my sweet how heavenly it was to waken up from all the pain and haziness of the first days when everything was still dim uncomfortable confused A ray of light pierced the darkness my heart and soul my inner self a self I had never known before rent the envelope of gloomy suffering as a flower bursts its sheath at the first warm kiss of the sun at the moment when the little wretch fastened on my breast and sucked Not even the sensation of the child s first cry was so exquisite as this This is the dawn of motherhood this is the Fiat lux Here is happiness joy ineffable though it comes not without pangs Oh my sweet jealous soul how you will relish a delight which exists only for ourselves the child and God For this tiny creature all knowledge is summed up in its mother s breast This is the one bright spot in its world towards which its puny strength goes forth Its thoughts cluster round this spring of life which it leaves only to sleep and whither it returns on waking Its lips have a sweetness beyond words and their pressure is at once a pain and a delight a delight which by every excess becomes pain or a pain which culminates in delight The sensation which rises from it and which penetrates to the very core of my life baffles all description It seems a sort of centre whence a myriad joy bearing rays gladden the heart and soul To bear a child is nothing to nourish it is birth renewed every hour Oh Louise there is no caress of lover with half the power of those little pink hands as they stray about seeking whereby to lay hold on life And the infant glances now turned upon the breast now raised to meet our own What dreams come to us as we watch the clinging nursling All our powers whether of mind or body are at its service for it we breathe and think in it our longings are more than satisfied The sweet sensation of warmth at the heart which the sound of his first cry brought to me like the first ray of sunshine on the earth came again as I felt the milk flow into his mouth again as his eyes met mine and at this moment I have felt it once more as his first smile gave token of a mind working within for he has laughed my dear A laugh a glance a bite a cry four miracles of gladness which go straight to the heart and strike chords that respond to no other touch A child is tied to our heart strings as the spheres are linked to their creator we cannot think of God except as a mother s heart writ large It is only in the act of nursing that a woman realizes her motherhood in visible and tangible fashion it is a joy of every moment The milk becomes flesh before our eyes it blossoms into the tips of those delicate flower like fingers it expands in tender transparent nails it spins the silky tresses it kicks in the little feet Oh those baby feet how plainly they talk to us In them the child finds its first language Yes Louise nursing is a miracle of transformation going on before one s bewildered eyes Those cries they go to your heart and not your ears those smiling eyes and lips those plunging feet they speak in words which could not be plainer if God traced them before you in letters of fire What else is there in the world to care about The father Why you could kill him if he dreamed of waking the baby Just as the child is the world to us so do we stand alone in the world for the child The sweet consciousness of a common life is ample recompense for all the trouble and suffering for suffering there is Heaven save you Louise from ever knowing the maddening agony of a wound which gapes afresh with every pressure of rosy lips and is so hard to heal the heaviest tax perhaps imposed on beauty For know Louise and beware it visits only a fair and delicate skin My little ape has in five months developed into the prettiest darling that ever mother bathed in tears of joy washed brushed combed and made smart for God knows what unwearied care we lavish upon those tender blossoms So my monkey has ceased to exist and behold in his stead a baby as my English nurse says a regular pink and white baby He cries very little too now for he is conscious of the love bestowed on him indeed I hardly ever leave him and I strive to wrap him round in the atmosphere of my love Dear I have a feeling now for Louis which is not love but which ought to be the crown of a woman s love where it exists Nay I am not sure whether this tender fondness this unselfish gratitude is not superior to love From all that you have told me of it dear pet I gather that love has something terribly earthly about it whilst a strain of holy piety purifies the affection a happy mother feels for the author of her far reaching and enduring joys A mother s happiness is like a beacon lighting up the future but reflected also on the past in the guise of fond memories The old l Estorade and his son have moreover redoubled their devotion to me I am like a new person to them Every time they see me and speak to me it is with a fresh holiday joy which touches me deeply The grandfather has I verily believe turned child again he looks at me admiringly and the first time I came down to lunch he was moved to tears to see me eating and suckling the child The moisture in these dry old eyes generally expressive only of avarice was a wonderful comfort to me I felt that the good soul entered into my joy As for Louis he would shout aloud to the trees and stones of the highway that he has a son and he spends whole hours watching your sleeping godson He does not know he says when he will grow used to it These extravagant expressions of delight show me how great must have been their fears beforehand Louis has confided in me that he had believed himself condemned to be childless Poor fellow he has all at once developed very much and he works even harder than he did The father in him has quickened his ambition For myself dear soul I grow happier and happier every moment Each hour creates a fresh tie between the mother and her infant The very nature of my feelings proves to me that they are normal permanent and indestructible whereas I shrewdly suspect love for instance of being intermittent Certainly it is not the same at all moments the flowers which it weaves into the web of life are not all of equal brightness love in short can and must decline But a mother s love has no ebb tide to fear rather it grows with the growth of the child s needs and strengthens with its strength Is it not at once a passion a natural craving a feeling a duty a necessity a joy Yes darling here is woman s true sphere Here the passion for self sacrifice can expend itself and no jealousy intrudes Here too is perhaps the single point on which society and nature are at one Society in this matter enforces the dictates of nature strengthening the maternal instinct by adding to it family spirit and the desire of perpetuating a name a race an estate How tenderly must not a woman cherish the child who has been the first to open up to her these joys the first to call forth the energies of her nature and to instruct her in the grand art of motherhood The right of the eldest which in the earliest times formed a part of the natural order and was lost in the origins of society ought never in my opinion to have been questioned Ah how much a mother learns from her child The constant protection of a helpless being forces us to so strict an alliance with virtue that a woman never shows to full advantage except as a mother Then alone can her character expand in the fulfilment of all life s duties and the enjoyment of all its pleasures A woman who is not a mother is maimed and incomplete Hasten then my sweetest to fulfil your mission Your present happiness will then be multiplied by the wealth of my delights twenty third I had to tear myself from you because your godson was crying I can hear his cry from the bottom of the garden But I would not let this go without a word of farewell I have just been reading over what I have said and am horrified to see how vulgar are the feelings expressed What I feel every mother alas since the beginning must have felt I suppose in the same way and put into the same words You will laugh at me as we do at the naive father who dilates on the beauty and cleverness of his of course quite exceptional offspring But the refrain of my letter darling is this and I repeat it I am as happy now as I used to be miserable This grange and is it not going to be an estate a family property has become my land of promise The desert is past and over A thousand loves darling pet Write to me for now I can read without a tear the tale of your happy love Farewell XXXII MME DE MACUMER TO MME DE L ESTORADE March eighteen twenty six Do you know dear that it is more than three months since I have written to you or heard from you I am the more guilty of the two for I did not reply to your last but you don t stand on punctilio surely Macumer and I have taken your silence for consent as regards the baby wreathed luncheon service and the little cherubs are starting this morning for Marseilles It took six months to carry out the design And so when Felipe asked me to come and see the service before it was packed I suddenly waked up to the fact that we had not interchanged a word since the letter of yours which gave me an insight into a mother s heart My sweet it is this terrible Paris there s my excuse What pray is yours Oh what a whirlpool is society Didn t I tell you once that in Paris one must be as the Parisians Society there drives out all sentiment it lays en embargo on your time and unless you are very careful soon eats away your heart altogether What an amazing masterpiece is the character of Celimene in Moliere s Le Misanthrope She is the society woman not only of Louis XIV s time but of our own and of all time Where should I be but for my breastplate the love I bear Felipe This very morning I told him as the outcome of these reflections that he was my salvation If my evenings are a continuous round of parties balls concerts and theatres at night my heart expands again and is healed of the wounds received in the world by the delights of the passionate love which await my return I dine at home only when we have friends so called with us and spend the afternoon there only on my day for I have a day now Wednesday for receiving I have entered the lists with Mmes d Espard and de Maufrigneuse and with the old Duchesse de Lenoncourt and my house has the reputation of being a very lively one I allowed myself to become the fashion because I saw how much pleasure my success gave Felipe My mornings are his from four in the afternoon till two in the morning I belong to Paris Macumer makes an admirable host witty and dignified perfect in courtesy and with an air of real distinction No woman could help loving such a husband even if she had chosen him without consulting her heart My father and mother have left for Madrid Louis XVIII being out of the way the Duchess had no difficulty in obtaining from our good natured Charles X the appointment of her fascinating poet so he is carried off in the capacity of attache My brother the Duc de Rhetore deigns to recognize me as a person of mark As for my younger brother The Comte de Chaulieu this buckram warrior owes me everlasting gratitude Before my father left he spent my fortune in acquiring for the Count an estate of forty thousand francs a year entailed on the title and his marriage with Mlle de Mortsauf an heiress from Touraine is definitely arranged The King in order to preserve the name and titles of the de Lenoncourt and de Givry families from extinction is to confer these together with the armorial bearings by patent on my brother Certainly it would never have done to allow these two fine names and their splendid motto Faciem semper monstramus to perish Mlle de Mortsauf who is granddaughter and sole heiress of the Duc de Lenoncourt Givry will it is said inherit altogether more than one hundred thousand livres a year The only stipulation my father has made is that the de Chaulieu arms should appear in the centre of the de Lenoncourt escutcheon Thus my brother will be Duc de Lenoncourt The young de Mortsauf to whom everything would otherwise go is in the last stage of consumption his death is looked for every day The marriage will take place next winter when the family are out of mourning I am told that I shall have a charming sister in law in Mlle de Mortsauf So you see that my father s reasoning is justified The outcome of it all has won me many compliments and my marriage is explained to everybody s satisfaction To complete our success the Prince de Talleyrand out of affection for my grandmother is showing himself a warm friend to Macumer Society which began by criticising me has now passed to cordial admiration In short I now reign a queen where barely two years ago I was an insignificant item Macumer finds himself the object of universal envy as the husband of the most charming woman in Paris At least a score of women as you know are always in that proud position Men murmur sweet things in my ear or content themselves with greedy glances This chorus of longing and admiration is so soothing to one s vanity that I confess I begin to understand the unconscionable price women are ready to pay for such frail and precarious privileges A triumph of this kind is like strong wine to vanity self love and all the self regarding feelings To pose perpetually as a divinity is a draught so potent in its intoxicating effects that I am no longer surprised to see women grow selfish callous and frivolous in the heart of this adoration The fumes of society mount to the head You lavish the wealth of your soul and spirit the treasures of your time the noblest efforts of your will upon a crowd of people who repay you in smiles and jealousy The false coin of their pretty speeches compliments and flattery is the only return they give for the solid gold of your courage and sacrifices and all the thought that must go to keep up without flagging the standard of beauty dress sparkling talk and general affability You are perfectly aware how much it costs and that the whole thing is a fraud but you cannot keep out of the vortex Ah my sweetheart how one craves for a real friend How precious to me are the love and devotion of Felipe and how my heart goes out to you Joyfully indeed are we preparing for our move to Chantepleurs where we can rest from the comedy of the Rue de Bac and of the Paris drawing rooms Having just read your letter again I feel that I cannot better describe this demoniac paradise than by saying that no woman of fashion in Paris can possibly be a good mother Good bye then for a short time dear one We shall stay at Chantepleurs only a week at most and shall be with you about May tenth So we are actually to meet again after more than two years What changes since then Here we are both matrons both in our promised land I of love you of motherhood If I have not written my sweetest it is not because I have forgotten you And what of the monkey godson Is he still pretty and a credit to me He must be more than nine months old now I should dearly like to be present when he makes his first steps upon this earth but Macumer tells me that even precocious infants hardly walk at ten months We shall have some good gossips there and cut pinafores as the Blois folk say I shall see whether a child as the saying goes spoils the pattern P S If you deign to reply from your maternal heights address to Chantepleurs I am just off XXXIII MME DE L ESTORADE TO MME DE MACUMER My child If ever you become a mother you will find out that it is impossible to write letters during the first two months of your nursing Mary my English nurse and I are both quite knocked up It is true I had not told you that I was determined to do everything myself Before the event I had with my own fingers sewn the baby clothes and embroidered and edged with lace the little caps I am a slave my pet a slave day and night To begin with Master Armand Louis takes his meals when it pleases him and that is always then he has often to be changed washed and dressed His mother is so fond of watching him sleep of singing songs to him of walking him about in her arms on a fine day that she has little time left to attend to herself In short what society has been to you my child our child has been to me I cannot tell you how full and rich my life has become and I long for your coming that you may see for yourself The only thing is I am afraid he will soon be teething and that you will find a peevish crying baby So far he has not cried much for I am always at hand Babies only cry when their wants are not understood and I am constantly on the lookout for his Oh my sweet my heart has opened up so wide while you allow yours to shrink and shrivel at the bidding of society I look for your coming with all a hermit s longing I want so much to know what you think of l Estorade just as you no doubt are curious for my opinion of Macumer Write to me from your last resting place The gentlemen want to go and meet our distinguished guests Come Queen of Paris come to our humble grange where love at least will greet you XXXIV MME DE MACUMER TO THE VICOMTESSE DE L ESTORADE April eighteen twenty six The name on this address will tell you dear that my petition has been granted Your father in law is now Comte de l Estorade I would not leave Paris till I had obtained the gratification of your wishes and I am writing in the presence of the Keeper of the Seals who has come to tell me that the patent is signed Good bye for a short time XXXV THE SAME TO THE SAME MARSEILLES July I am ashamed to think how my sudden flight will have taken you by surprise But since I am above all honest and since I love you not one bit the less I shall tell you the truth in four words I am horribly jealous Felipe s eyes were too often on you You used to have little talks together at the foot of your rock which were a torture to me and I was fast becoming irritable and unlike myself Your truly Spanish beauty could not fail to recall to him his native land and along with it Marie Heredia and I can be jealous of the past too Your magnificent black hair your lovely dark eyes your brow where the peaceful joy of motherhood stands out radiant against the shadows which tell of past suffering the freshness of your southern skin far fairer than that of a blonde like me the splendid lines of your figure the breasts on which my godson hangs peeping through the lace like some luscious fruit all this stabbed me in the eyes and in the heart In vain did I stick cornflowers in my curls in vain set off with cherry colored ribbons the tameness of my pale locks everything looked washed out when Renee appeared a Renee so unlike the one I expected to find in your oasis Then Felipe made too much of the child whom I found myself beginning to hate Yes I confess it that exuberance of life which fills your house making it gay with shouts and laughter I wanted it for myself I read a regret in Macumer s eyes and unknown to him I cried over it two whole nights I was miserable in your house You are too beautiful as a woman too triumphant as a mother for me to endure your company Ah you complained of your lot Hypocrite What would you have L Estorade is most presentable he talks well he has fine eyes and his black hair dashed with white is very becoming his southern manners too have something attractive about them As far as I can make out he will sooner or later be elected deputy for the Bouches du Rhone in the Chamber he is sure to come to the front for you can always count on me to promote your interests The sufferings of his exile have given him that calm and dignified air which goes half way in my opinion to make a politician For the whole art of politics dear seems to me to consist in looking serious At this rate Macumer as I told him ought certainly to have a high position in the state And so having completely satisfied myself of your happiness I fly off contented to my dear Chantepleurs where Felipe must really achieve his aspirations I have made up my mind not to receive you there without a fine baby at my breast to match yours Oh I know very well I deserve all the epithets you can hurl at me I am a fool a wretch an idiot Alas that is just what jealousy means I am not vexed with you but I was miserable and you will forgive me for escaping from my misery Two days more and I should have made an exhibition of myself yes there would have been an outbreak of vulgarity But in spite of the rage gnawing at my heart I am glad to have come glad to have seen you in the pride of your beautiful motherhood my friend still as I remain yours in all the absorption of my love Why even here at Marseilles only a step from your door I begin to feel proud of you and of the splendid mother that you will make How well you judged your vocation You seem to me born for the part of mother rather than of lover exactly as the reverse is true of me There are women capable of neither hard favored or silly women A good mother and a passionately loving wife have this in common that they both need intelligence and discretion ever at hand and an unfailing command of every womanly art and grace Oh I watched you well need I add sly puss that I admired you too Your children will be happy but not spoilt with your tenderness lapping them round and the clear light of your reason playing softly on them Tell Louis the truth about my going away but find some decent excuse for your father in law who seems to act as steward for the establishment and be careful to do the same for your family a true Provencal version of the Harlowe family Felipe does not know why I left and he will never know If he asks I shall contrive to find some colorable pretext probably that you were jealous of me Forgive me this little conventional fib Good bye I write in haste as I want you to get this at lunch time and the postilion who has undertaken to convey it to you is here refreshing himself while he waits Many kisses to my dear little godson Be sure you come to Chantepleurs in October I shall be alone there all the time that Macumer is away in Sardinia where he is designing great improvements in his estate At least that is his plan for the moment and his pet vanity consists in having a plan Then he feels that he has a will of his own and this makes him very uneasy when he unfolds it to me Good bye XXXVI THE VICOMTESSE DE L ESTORADE TO THE BARONNE DE MACUMER Dear no words can express the astonishment of all our party when at luncheon we were told that you had both gone and above all when the postilion who took you to Marseilles handed me your mad letter Why naughty child it was of your happiness and nothing else that made the theme of those talks below the rock on the Louise seat and you had not the faintest justification for objecting to them Ingrata My sentence on you is that you return here at my first summons In that horrid letter scribbled on the inn paper you did not tell me what would be your next stopping place so I must address this to Chantepleurs Listen to me dear sister of my heart Know first that my mind is set on your happiness Your husband dear Louise commands respect not only by his natural gravity and dignified expression but also because he somehow impresses one with the splendid power revealed in his piquant plainness and in the fire of his velvet eyes and you will understand that it was some little time before I could meet him on those easy terms which are almost necessary for intimate conversation Further this man has been Prime Minister and he idolizes you whence it follows that he must be a profound dissembler To fish up secrets therefore from the rocky caverns of this diplomatic soul is a work demanding a skilful hand no less than a ready brain Nevertheless I succeeded at last without rousing my victim s suspicions in discovering many things of which you my pet have no conception You know that between us two my part is rather that of reason yours of imagination I personify sober duty you reckless love It has pleased fate to continue in our lives this contrast in character which was imperceptible to all except ourselves I am a simple country vicountess very ambitious and making it her task to lead her family on the road to prosperity On the other hand Macumer late Duc de Soria has a name in the world and you a duchess by right reign in Paris where reigning is no easy matter even for kings You have a considerable fortune which will be doubled if Macumer carries out his projects for developing his great estates in Sardinia the resources of which are matter of common talk at Marseilles Deny if you can that if either has the right to be jealous it is not you But thank God we have both hearts generous enough to place our friendship beyond reach of such vulgar pettiness I know you dear I know that ere now you are ashamed of having fled But don t suppose that your flight will save you from a single word of discourse which I had prepared for your benefit to day beneath the rock Read carefully then I beg of you what I say for it concerns you even more closely than Macumer though he also enters largely into my sermon Firstly my dear you do not love him Before two years are over you will be sick of adoration You will never look on Felipe as a husband to you he will always be the lover whom you can play with for that is how all women treat their lovers You do not look up to him or reverence or worship him as a woman should the god of her idolatry You see I have made a study of love my sweet and more than once have I taken soundings in the depth of my own heart Now as the result of a careful diagnosis of your case I can say with confidence this is not love Yes dear Queen of Paris you cannot escape the destiny of all queens The day will come when you long to be treated as a light o love to be mastered and swept off your feet by a strong man one who will not prostrate himself in adoration before you but will seize your arm roughly in a fit of jealousy Macumer loves you too fondly ever to be able either to resist you or find fault with you A single glance from you a single coaxing word would melt his sternest resolution Sooner or later you will learn to scorn this excessive devotion He spoils you alas just as I used to spoil you at the convent for you are a most bewitching woman and there is no escaping your siren like charms Worse than all you are candid and it often happens that our happiness depends on certain social hypocrisies to which you will never stoop For instance society will not tolerate a frank display of the wife s power over her husband The convention is that a man must no more show himself the lover of his wife however passionately he adores her than a married woman may play the part of a mistress This rule you both disregard In the first place my child from what you have yourself told me it is clear that the one unpardonable sin in society is to be happy If happiness exists no one must know of it But this is a small point What seems to me important is that the perfect equality which reigns between lovers ought never to appear in the case of husband and wife under pain of undermining the whole fabric of society and entailing terrible disasters If it is painful to see a man whom nature has made a nonentity how much worse is the spectacle of a man of parts brought to that position Before very long you will have reduced Macumer to the mere shadow of a man He will cease to have a will and character of his own and become mere clay in your hands You will have so completely moulded him to your likeness that your household will consist of only one person instead of two and that one necessarily imperfect You will regret it bitterly but when at last you deign to open your eyes the evil will be past cure Do what we will women do not and never will possess the qualities which are characteristic of men and these qualities are absolutely indispensable to family life Already Macumer blinded though he is has a dim foreshadowing of this future he feels himself less a man through his love His visit to Sardinia is a proof to me that he hopes by this temporary separation to succeed in recovering his old self You never scruple to use the power which his love has placed in your hand Your position of vantage may be read in a gesture a look a tone Oh darling how truly are you the mad wanton your mother called you You do not question I fancy that I am greatly Louis superior Well I would ask you have you ever heard me contradict him Am I not always in the presence of others the wife who respects in him the authority of the family Hypocrisy you will say Well listen to me It is true that if I want to give him any advice which I think may be of use to him I wait for the quiet and seclusion of our bedroom to explain what I think and wish but I assure you sweetheart that even there I never arrogate to myself the place of mentor If I did not remain in private the same submissive wife that I appear to others he would lose confidence in himself Dear the good we do to others is spoilt unless we efface ourselves so completely that those we help have no sense of inferiority There is a wonderful sweetness in these hidden sacrifices and what a triumph for me in your unsuspecting praises of Louis There can be no doubt also that the happiness the comfort the hope of the last two years have restored what misfortune hardship solitude and despondency has robbed him of This then is the sum total of my observations At the present moment you love in Felipe not your husband but yourself There is truth in your father s words concealed by the spring flowers of your passion lies all the great lady s selfishness Ah my child how I must love you to speak such bitter truths Let me tell you if you will promise never to breathe a word of this to the Baron the end of our talk We had been singing your praises in every key for he soon discovered that I loved you like a fondly cherished sister and having insensibly brought him to a confidential mood I ventured to say Louise has never yet had to struggle with life She has been the spoilt child of fortune and she might yet have to pay for this were you not there to act the part of father as well as lover Ah but is it possible He broke off abruptly like a man who sees himself on the edge of a precipice But the exclamation was enough for me No doubt if you had stayed he would have spoken more freely later My sweet think of the day awaiting you when your husband s strength will be exhausted when pleasure will have turned to satiety and he sees himself I will not say degraded but shorn of his proper dignity before you The stings of conscience will then waken a sort of remorse in him all the more painful for you because you will feel yourself responsible and you will end by despising the man whom you have not accustomed yourself to respect Remember too that scorn with a woman is only the earliest phase of hatred You are too noble and generous I know ever to forget the sacrifices which Felipe has made for you but what further sacrifices will be left for him to make when he has so to speak served up himself at the first banquet Woe to the man as to the woman who has left no desire unsatisfied All is over then To our shame or our glory the point is too nice for me to decide it is of love alone that women are insatiable Oh Louise change yet while there is still time If you would only adopt the same course with Macumer that I have done with l Estorade you might rouse the sleeping lion in your husband who is made of the stuff of heroes One might almost say that you grudge him his greatness Would you feel no pride in using your power for other ends than your own gratification in awakening the genius of a gifted man as I in raising to a higher level one of merely common parts Had you remained with us I should still have written this letter for in talking you might have cut me short or got the better of me with your sharp tongue But I know that you will read this thoughtfully and weigh my warnings Dear heart you have everything in life to make you happy do not spoil your chances return to Paris I entreat you as soon as Macumer comes back The engrossing claims of society of which I complained are necessary for both of you otherwise you would spend your life in mutual self absorption A married woman ought not to be too lavish of herself The mother of a family who never gives her household an opportunity of missing her runs the risk of palling on them If I have several children as I trust for my own sake I may I assure you I shall make a point of reserving to myself certain hours which shall be held sacred even to one s children one s presence should not be a matter of daily bread Farewell my dear jealous soul Do you know that many women would be highly flattered at having roused this passing pang in you Alas I can only mourn for what is not mother in me is your dear friend A thousand loves Make what excuse you will for leaving if you are not sure of Macumer I am of Louis XXXVII THE BARONNE DE MACUMER TO THE VICOMTESSE DE L ESTORADE Genoa My beloved beauty I was bitten with the fancy to see something of Italy and I am delighted at having carried off Macumer whose plans in regard to Sardinia are postponed This country is simple ravishing The churches above all the chapels have a seductive bewitching air which must make every female Protestant yearn after Catholicism Macumer has been received with acclamation and they are all delighted to have made an Italian of so distinguished a man Felipe could have the Sardinian embassy at Paris if I cared about it for I am made much of at court If you write address your letters to Florence I have not time now to go into any details but I will tell you the story of our travels whenever you come to Paris We only remain here a week and then go on to Florence taking Leghorn on the way We shall stay a month in Tuscany and a month at Naples so as to reach Rome in November Thence we return home by Venice where we shall spend the first fortnight of December and arrive in Paris via Milan and Turin for January Our journey is a perfect honeymoon the sight of new places gives fresh life to our passion Macumer did not know Italy at all and we have begun with that splendid Cornice road which might be the work of fairy architects Good bye darling Don t be angry if I don t write It is impossible to get a minute to oneself in traveling my whole time is taken up with seeing admiring and realizing my impressions But not a word to you of these till memory has given them their proper atmosphere XXXVIII THE VICOMTESSE DE L ESTORADE TO THE BARONNE DE MACUMER September My dear There is lying for you at Chantepleurs a full reply to the letter you wrote me from Marseilles This honeymoon journey so far from diminishing the fears I there expressed makes me beg of you to get my letter sent on from Nivernais The Government it is said are resolved on dissolution This is unlucky for the Crown since the last session of this loyal Parliament would have been devoted to the passing of laws essential to the consolidation of its power and it is not less so for us as Louis will not be forty till the end of eighteen twenty seven Fortunately however my father has agreed to stand and he will resign his seat when the right moment arrives Your godson has found out how to walk without his godmother s help He is altogether delicious and begins to make the prettiest little signs to me which bring home to one that here is really a thinking being not a mere animal or sucking machine His smiles are full of meaning I have been so successful in my profession of nurse that I shall wean Armand in December A year at the breast is quite enough children who are suckled longer are said to grow stupid and I am all for popular sayings You must make a tremendous sensation in Italy my fair one with the golden locks A thousand loves XXXIX THE BARONNE DE MACUMER TO THE VICOMTESSE DE L ESTORADE Your atrocious letter has reached me here the steward having forwarded it by my orders Oh Renee but I will spare you the outburst of my wounded feelings and simply tell you the effect your letter produced We had just returned from a delightful reception given in our honor by the ambassador where I appeared in all my glory and Macumer was completely carried away in a frenzy of love which I could not describe Then I read him your horrible answer to my letter and I read it sobbing at the risk of making a fright of myself My dear Arab fell at my feet declaring that you raved Then he carried me off to the balcony of the palace where we are staying from which we have a view over part of the city there he spoke to me words worthy of the magnificent moonlight scene which lay stretched before us We both speak Italian now and his love told in that voluptuous tongue so admirably adapted to the expression of passion sounded in my ears like the most exquisite poetry He swore that even were you right in your predictions he would not exchange for a lifetime a single one of our blessed nights or charming mornings At this reckoning he has already lived a thousand years He is content to have me for his mistress and would claim no other title than that of lover So proud and pleased is he to see himself every day the chosen of my heart that were Heaven to offer him the alternative between living as you would have us to for another thirty years with five children and five years spent amid the dear roses of our love he would not hesitate He would take my love such as it is and death While he was whispering this in my ear his arm round me my head resting on his shoulder the cries of a bat surprised by an owl disturbed us This death cry struck me with such terror that Felipe carried me half fainting to my bed But don t be alarmed Though this augury of evil still resounds in my soul I am quite myself this morning As soon as I was up I went to Felipe and kneeling before him my eyes fixed on his his hands clasped in mine I said to him My love I am a child and Renee may be right after all It may be only your love that I love in you but at least I can assure you that this is the one feeling of my heart and that I love you as it is given me to love But if there be aught in me in my lightest thought or deed which jars on your wishes or conception of me I implore you to tell me to say what it is It will be a joy to me to hear you and to take your eyes as the guiding stars of my life Renee has frightened me for she is a true friend Macumer could not find voice to reply tears choked him I can thank you now Renee But for your letter I should not have known the depths of love in my noble kingly Macumer Rome is the city of love it is there that passion should celebrate its feast with art and religion as confederates At Venice we shall find the Duc and Duchesse de Soria If you write address now to Paris for we shall leave Rome in three days The ambassador s was a farewell party P S Dear silly child your letter only shows that you knew nothing of love except theoretically Learn then that love is a quickening force which may produce fruits so diverse that no theory can embrace or company ordinate them A word this for my little Professor with her armor of stays XL THE COMTESSE DE L ESTORADE TO THE BARONNE DE MACUMER January eighteen twenty seven My father has been elected to the Chamber my father in law is dead and I am on the point of my second confinement these are the chief events marking the end of the year for us I mention them at once lest the sight of the black seal should frighten you My dear your letter from Rome made my flesh creep You are nothing but a pair of children Felipe is either a dissembling diplomat or else his love for you is the love a man might have for a courtesan on whom he squanders his all knowing all the time that she is false to him Enough of this You say I rave so I had better hold my tongue Only this would I say from the comparison of our two very different destinies I draw this harsh moral Love not if you would be loved My dear when Louis was elected to the provincial Council he received the cross of the Legion of Honor That is now nearly three years ago and as my father whom you will no doubt see in Paris during the course of the session has asked the rank of Officer of the Legion for his son in law I want to know if you will do me the kindness to take in hand the bigwig whoever he may be to whom this patronage belongs and to keep an eye upon the little affair But whatever you do don t get entangled in the concerns of my honored father The Comte de Maucombe is fishing for the title of Marquis for himself but keep your good services for me please When Louis is a deputy next winter that is we shall come to Paris and then we will move heaven and earth to get some Government appointment for him so that we may be able to save our income by living on his salary My father sits between the centre and the right a title will content him Our family was distinguished even in the days of King Rene and Charles X will hardly say no to a Maucombe but what I fear is that my father may take it into his head to ask some favor for my younger brother Now if the marquisate is dangled out of his reach he will have no thoughts to spare from himself January fifteenth Ah Louise I have been in hell If I can bear to tell you of my anguish it is because you are another self even so I don t know whether I shall ever be able to live again in thought those five ghastly days The mere word convulsions makes my very heart sick Five days to me they were five centuries of torture A mother who has not been through this martyrdom does not know what suffering is So frenzied was I that I even envied you who never had a child The evening before that terrible day the weather was close almost hot and I thought my little Armand was affected by it Generally so sweet and caressing he was peevish cried for nothing wanted to play and then broke his toys Perhaps this sort of fractiousness is the usual sign of approaching illness with children While I was wondering about it I noticed Armand s cheeks flush but this I set down to teething for he is cutting four large teeth at once So I put him to bed beside me and kept constantly waking through the night He was a little feverish but not enough to make me uneasy my mind being still full of the teething Towards morning he cried Mamma and asked by signs for something to drink but the cry was spasmodic and there were convulsive twitchings in the limbs which turned me to ice I jumped out of bed to fetch him a drink Imagine my horror when on my handing him the cup he remained motionless only repeating Mamma in that strange unfamiliar voice which was indeed by this time hardly a voice at all I took his hand but it did not respond to my pressure it was quite stiff I put the cup to his lips the poor little fellow gulped down three or four mouthfuls in a convulsive manner that was terrible to see and the water made a strange sound in his throat He clung to me desperately and I saw his eyes roll as though some hidden force within were pulling at them till only the whites were visible his limbs were turning rigid I screamed aloud and Louis came A doctor quick he is dying I cried Louis vanished and my poor Armand again gasped Mamma Mamma The next moment he lost all consciousness of his mother s existence The pretty veins on his forehead swelled and the convulsions began For a whole hour before the doctors came I held in my arms that merry baby all lilies and roses the blossom of my life my pride and my joy lifeless as a piece of wood and his eyes I cannot think of them without horror My pretty Armand was a mere mummy black shriveled misshapen A doctor two doctors brought from Marseilles by Louis hovered about like birds of ill omen it made me shudder to look at them One spoke of brain fever the other saw nothing but an ordinary case of convulsions in infancy Our own country doctor seemed to me to have the most sense for he offered no opinion It s teething said the second doctor Fever said the first Finally it was agreed to put leeches on his neck and ice on his head It seemed to me like death To look on to see a corpse all purple or black and not a cry not a movement from this creature but now so full of life and sound it was horrible At one moment I lost my head and gave a sort of hysterical laugh as I saw the pretty neck which I used to devour with kisses with the leeches feeding on it and his darling head in a cap of ice My dear we had to cut those lovely curls of which we were so proud and with which you used to play in order to make room for the ice The convulsions returned every ten minutes with the regularity of labor pains and then the poor baby writhed and twisted now white now violet His supple limbs clattered like wood as they struck And this unconscious flesh was the being who smiled and prattled and used to say Mamma At the thought a storm of agony swept tumultuously over my soul like the sea tossing in a hurricane It seemed as though every tie which binds a child to its mother s heart was strained to rending My mother who might have given me help advice or comfort was in Paris Mothers it is my belief know more than doctors do about convulsions After four days and nights of suspense and fear which almost killed me the doctors were unanimous in advising the application of a horrid ointment which would produce open sores Sores on my Armand who only five days before was playing about and laughing and trying to say Godmother I would not have it done preferring to trust in nature Louis who believes in doctors scolded me A man remains the same through everything But there are moments when this terrible disease takes the likeness of death and in one of these it seemed borne in upon me that this hateful remedy was the salvation of Armand Louise the skin was so dry so rough and parched that the ointment would not act Then I broke into weeping and my tears fell so long and so fast that the bedside was wet through And the doctors were at dinner Seeing myself alone with the child I stripped him of all medical appliances and seizing him like a mad woman pressed him to my bosom laying my forehead against his and beseeching God to grant him the life which I was striving to pass into his veins from mine For some minutes I held him thus longing to die with him so that neither life nor death might part us Dear I felt the limbs relaxing the writhings ceased the child stirred and the ghastly corpselike tints faded away I screamed just as I did when he was taken ill the doctors hurried up and I pointed to Armand He is saved exclaimed the oldest of them What music in those words The gates of heaven opened And in fact two hours later Armand came back to life but I was utterly crushed and it was only the healing power of joy which saved me from a serious illness My God by what tortures do you bind a mother to her child To fasten him to our heart need the nails be driven into the very quick Was I not mother enough before I who wept tears of joy over his broken syllables and tottering steps who spent hours together planning how best to perform my duty and fit myself for the sweet post of mother Why these horrors these ghastly scenes for a mother who already idolized her child As I write our little Armand is playing shouting laughing What can be the cause of this terrible disease with children Vainly do I try to puzzle it out remembering that I am again with child Is it teething Is it some peculiar process in the brain Is there something wrong with the nervous system of children who are subject to convulsions All these thoughts disquiet me in view alike of the present and the future Our country doctor holds to the theory of nervous trouble produced by teething I would give every tooth in my head to see little Armand s all through The sight of one of those little white pearls peeping out of the swollen gum brings a cold sweat over me now The heroism with which the little angel bore his sufferings proves to me that he will be his mother s son A look from him goes to my very heart Medical science can give no satisfactory explanation as to the origin of this sort of tetanus which passes off as rapidly as it comes on and can apparently be neither guarded against nor cured One thing alone as I said before is certain that it is hell for a mother to see her child in convulsions How passionately do I clasp him to my heart I could walk for ever with him in my arms To have suffered all this only six weeks before my confinement made it much worse I feared for the coming child Farewell my dear beloved Don t wish for a child there is the sum and substance of my letter XLI THE BARONNE DE MACUMER TO THE VICOMTESSE DE L ESTORADE Paris Poor sweet Macumer and I forgave you all your naughtiness when we heard of your terrible trouble I thrilled with pain as I read the details of the double agony and there seem compensations now in being childless I am writing at once to tell you that Louis has been promoted He can now wear the ribbon of an officer of the Legion You are a lucky woman Renee and you will probably have a little girl since that used to be your wish The marriage of my brother with Mlle de Mortsauf was celebrated on our return Our gracious King who really is extraordinarily kind has given my brother the reversion of the post of first gentleman of the chamber which his father in law now fills on the one condition that the scutcheon of the Mortsaufs should be placed side by side with that of the Lenoncourts The office ought to go with the title he said to the Duc de Lenoncourt Givry My father is justified a hundred fold Without the help of my fortune nothing of all this could have taken place My father and mother came from Madrid for the wedding and return there after the reception which I give to morrow for the bride and bridegroom The carnival will be a very gay one The Duc and Duchesse de Soria are in Paris and their presence makes me a little uneasy Marie Heredia is certainly one of the most beautiful women in Europe and I don t like the way Felipe looks at her Therefore I am doubly lavish of sweetness and caresses Every look and gesture speak the words which I am careful my lips should not utter She could not love like this Heaven knows how lovely and fascinating I am Yesterday Mme de Maufrigneuse said to me Dear child who can compete with you Then I keep Felipe so well amused that his sister in law must seem as lively as a Spanish cow in comparison I am the less sorry that a little Abencerrage is not on his way because the Duchess will no doubt stay in Paris over her confinement and she won t be a beauty any longer If the baby is a boy it will be called Felipe in honor of the exile An unkind chance has decreed that I shall a second time serve as godmother Good bye dear I shall go to Chantepleurs early this year for our Italian tour was shockingly expensive I shall leave about the end of March and retire to economize in Nivenais Besides I am tired of Paris Felipe sighs as I do after the beautiful quiet of the park our cool meadows and our Loire with its sparkling sands peerless among rivers Chantepleurs will seem delightful to me after the pomps and vanities of Italy for after all splendor becomes wearisome and a lover s glance has more beauty than a capo d opera or a bel quadro We shall expect you there Don t be afraid that I shall be jealous again You are free to take what soundings you please in Macumer s heart and fish up all the interjections and doubts you can I am supremely indifferent Since that day at Rome Felipe s love for me has grown He told me yesterday he is looking over my shoulder now that his sister in law the Princess Heredia his destined bride of old the dream of his youth had no brains Oh my dear I am worse than a ballet dancer If you knew what joy that slighting remark gave me I have pointed out to Felipe that she does not speak French correctly She says esemple for exemple sain for cinq cheu for je She is beautiful of course but quite without charm or the slightest scintilla of wit When a compliment is paid her she looks at you as though she didn t know what to do with such a strange thing Felipe being what he is could not have lived two months with Marie after his marriage Don Fernand the Duc de Soria suits her very well He has generous instincts but it s easy to see he has been a spoilt child I am tempted to be naughty and make you laugh but I won t draw the long bow Ever so much love darling XLII RENEE TO LOUISE My little girl is two months old She is called Jeanne Athenais and has for godmother and godfather my mother and an old grand uncle of Louis As soon as I possibly can I shall start for my visit to Chantepleurs since you are not afraid of a nursing mother Your godson can say your name now he calls it Matoumer for he can t say c properly You will be quite delighted with him He has got all his teeth and eats meat now like a big boy he is all over the place trotting about like a little mouse but I watch him all the time with anxious eyes and it makes me miserable that I cannot keep him by me when I am laid up The time is more than usually long with me as the doctors consider some special precautions necessary Alas my child habit does not inure one to child bearing There are the same old discomforts and misgivings However don t show this to Felipe this little girl takes after me and she may yet cut out your Armand My father thought Felipe looking very thin and my dear pet also not quite so blooming Yet the Duc and Duchesse de Soria have gone not a loophole for jealousy is left Is there any trouble which you are hiding from me Your letter is neither so long nor so full of loving thoughts as usual Is this only a whim of my dear whimsical friend I am running on too long My nurse is angry with me for writing and Mlle Athenais de l Estorade wants her dinner Farewell then write me some nice long letters XLIII MME DE MACUMER TO THE COMTESSE DE L ESTORADE For the first time in my life my dear Renee I have been alone and crying I was sitting under a willow on a wooden bench by the side of the long Chantepleurs marsh The view there is charming but it needs some merry children to complete it and I wait for you I have been married nearly three years and no child The thought of your quiver full drove me to explore my heart And this is what I find there Oh if I had to suffer a hundred fold what Renee suffered when my godson was born if I had to see my child in convulsions even so would to God that I might have a cherub of my own like your Athenais I can see her from here in my mind s eye and I know she is beautiful as the day for you tell me nothing about her that is just like my Renee I believe you divine my trouble Each time my hopes are disappointed I fall a prey for some days to the blackest melancholy Then I compose sad elegies When shall I embroider little caps and sew lace edgings to encircle a tiny head When choose the cambric for the baby clothes Shall I never hear baby lips shout Mamma and have my dress pulled by a teasing despot whom my heart adores Are there to be no wheelmarks of a little carriage on the gravel no broken toys littered about the courtyard Shall I never visit the toy shops as mothers do to buy swords and dolls and baby houses And will it never be mine to watch the unfolding of a precious life another Felipe only more dear I would have a son if only to learn how a lover can be more to one in his second self My park and castle are cold and desolate to me A childless woman is a monstrosity of nature we exist only to be mothers Oh my sage in woman s livery how well you have conned the book of life Everywhere too barrenness is a dismal thing My life is a little too much like one of Gessner s or Florian s sheepfolds which Rivarol longed to see invaded by a wolf I too have it in me to make sacrifices There are forces in me I feel which Felipe has no use for and if I am not to be a mother I must be allowed to indulge myself in some romantic sorrow I have just made this remark to my belated Moor and it brought tears to his eyes He cannot stand any joking on his love so I let him off easily and only called him a paladin of folly At times I am seized with a desire to go on pilgrimage to bear my longings to the shrine of some madonna or to a watering place Next winter I shall take medical advice I am too much enraged with myself to write more Good bye XLIV THE SAME TO THE SAME Paris eighteen twenty nine A whole year passed my dear without a letter What does this mean I am a little hurt Do you suppose that your Louis who comes to see me almost every alternate day makes up for you It is not enough to know that you are well and that everything prospers with you for I love you Renee and I want to know what you are feeling and thinking of just as I say everything to you at the risk of being scolded or censured or misunderstood Your silence and seclusion in the country at the time when you might be in Paris enjoying all the Parliamentary honors of the Comte de l Estorade cause me serious anxiety You know that your husband s gift of gab and unsparing zeal have won for him quite a position here and he will doubtless receive some very good post when the session is over Pray do you spend your life writing him letters of advice Numa was not so far removed from his Egeria Why did you not take this opportunity of seeing Paris I might have enjoyed your company for four months Louis told me yesterday that you were coming to fetch him and would have your third confinement in Paris you terrible mother Gigogne After bombarding Louis with queries exclamations and regrets I at last defeated his strategy so far as to discover that his grand uncle the godfather of Athenais is very ill Now I believe that you like a careful mother would be quite equal to angling with the member s speeches and fame for a fat legacy from your husband s last remaining relative on the mother s side Keep your mind easy my Renee we are all at work for Louis Lenoncourts Chaulieus and the whole band of Mme de Macumer s followers Martignac will probably put him into the audit department But if you won t tell me why you bury yourself in the country I shall be cross Tell me are you afraid that the political wisdom of the house of l Estorade should seem to centre in you Or is it the uncle s legacy Perhaps you were afraid you would be less to your children in Paris Ah what I would give to know whether after all you were not simply too vain to show yourself in Paris for the first time in your present condition Vain thing Farewell XLV RENEE TO LOUISE You complain of my silence have you forgotten then those two little brown heads at once my subjects and my tyrants And as to staying at home you have yourself hit upon several of my reasons Apart from the condition of our dear uncle I didn t want to drag with me to Paris a boy of four and a little girl who will soon be three when I am again expecting my confinement I had no intention of troubling you and upsetting your husband with such a party I did not care to appear looking my worst in the brilliant circle over which you preside and I detest life in hotels and lodgings When I come to spend the session in Paris it will be in my own house Louis uncle when he heard of the rank his grand nephew had received made me a present of two hundred thousand francs the half of his savings with which to buy a house in Paris and I have charged Louis to find one in your neighborhood My mother has given me thirty thousand francs for the furnishing and I shall do my best not to disgrace the dear sister of my election no pun intended I am grateful to you for having already done so much at Court for Louis But though M de Bourmont and M de Polignac have paid him the compliment of asking him to join their ministry I do not wish so conspicuous a place for him It would commit him too much and I prefer the Audit Office because it is permanent Our affairs here are in very good hands so you need not fear as soon as the steward has mastered the details I will come and support Louis As for writing long letters nowadays how can I This one in which I want to describe to you the daily routine of my life will be a week on the stocks Who can tell but Armand may lay hold of it to make caps for his regiments drawn up on my carpet or vessels for the fleets which sail his bath A single day will serve as a sample of the rest for they are all exactly alike and their characteristics reduce themselves to two either the children are well or they are not For me in this solitary grange it is no exaggeration to say that hours become minutes or minutes hours according to the children s health If I have some delightful hours it is when they are asleep and I am no longer needed to rock the one or soothe the other with stories When I have them sleeping by my side I say to myself Nothing can go wrong now The fact is my sweet every mother spends her time so soon as her children are out of her sight in imagining dangers for them Perhaps it is Armand seizing the razors to play with or his coat taking fire or a snake biting him or he might tumble in running and start an abscess on his head or he might drown himself in a pond A mother s life you see is one long succession of dramas now soft and tender now terrible Not an hour but has its joys and fears But at night in my room comes the hour for waking dreams when I plan out their future which shines brightly in the smile of the guardian angel watching over their beds Sometimes Armand calls me in his sleep I kiss his forehead without rousing him then his sister s feet and watch them both lying in their beauty These are my merry makings Yesterday it must have been our guardian angel who roused me in the middle of the night and summoned me in fear to Athenais cradle Her head was too low and I found Armand all uncovered his feet purple with cold Darling mother he cried rousing up and flinging his arms round me There dear is one of our night scenes for you How important it is for a mother to have her children by her side at night It is not for a nurse however careful she may be to take them up comfort them and hush them to sleep again when some horrid nightmare has disturbed them For they have their dreams and the task of explaining away one of those dread visions of the night is the more arduous because the child is scared stupid and only half awake It is a mere interlude in the unconsciousness of slumber In this way I have come to sleep so lightly that I can see my little pair and see them stirring through the veil of my eyelids A sigh or a rustle wakens me For me the demon of convulsions is ever crouching by their beds So much for the nights with the first twitter of the birds my babies begin to stir Through the mists of dispersing sleep their chatter blends with the warblings that fill the morning air or with the swallows noisy debates little cries of joy or woe which make their way to my heart rather than my ears While Nais struggles to get at me making the passage from her cradle to my bed on all fours or with staggering steps Armand climbs up with the agility of a monkey and has his arms round me Then the merry couple turn my bed into a playground where mother lies at their mercy The baby girl pulls my hair and would take to sucking again while Armand stands guard over my breast as though defending his property Their funny ways their peals of laughter are too much for me and put sleep fairly to flight Then we play the ogress game mother ogress eats up the white soft flesh with hugs and rains kisses on those rosy shoulders and eyes brimming over with saucy mischief we have little jealous tiffs too so pretty to see It has happened to me dear to take up my stockings at eight o clock and be still bare footed at nine Then comes the getting up The operation of dressing begins I slip on my dressing gown turn up my sleeves and don the mackintosh apron with Mary s assistance I wash and scrub my two little blossoms I am sole arbiter of the temperature of the bath for a good half of children s crying and whimpering comes from mistakes here The moment has arrived for paper fleets and glass ducks since the only way to get children thoroughly washed is to keep them well amused If you knew the diversions that have to be invented before these despotic sovereigns will permit a soft sponge to be passed over every nook and cranny you would be awestruck at the amount of ingenuity and intelligence demanded by the maternal profession when one takes it seriously Prayers scoldings promises are alike in requisition above all the jugglery must be so dexterous that it defies detection The case would be desperate had not Providence to the cunning of the child matched that of the mother A child is a diplomatist only to be mastered like the diplomatists of the great world through his passions Happily it takes little to make these cherubs laugh the fall of a brush a piece of soap slipping from the hand and what merry shouts And if our triumphs are dearly bought still triumphs they are though hidden from mortal eye Even the father knows nothing of it all None but God and His angels and perhaps you can fathom the glances of satisfaction which Mary and I exchange when the little creatures toilet is at last concluded and they stand spotless and shining amid a chaos of soap sponges combs basins blotting paper flannel and all the nameless litter of a true English nursery For I am so far a convert as to admit that English women have a talent for this department True they look upon the child only from the point of view of material well being but where this is concerned their arrangements are admirable My children must always be bare legged and wear woollen socks There shall be no swaddling nor bandages on the other hand they shall never be left alone The helplessness of the French infant in its swaddling bands means the liberty of the nurse that is the whole explanation A mother who is really a mother is never free There is my answer to your question why I do not write Besides the management of the estate I have the upbringing of two children on my hands The art of motherhood involves much silent unobtrusive self denial an hourly devotion which finds no detail too minute The soup warming before the fire must be watched Am I the kind of woman do you suppose to shirk such cares The humblest task may earn a rich harvest of affection How pretty is a child s laugh when he finds the food to his liking Armand has a way of nodding his head when he is pleased that is worth a lifetime of adoration How could I leave to any one else the privilege and delight as well as the responsibility of blowing on the spoonful of soup which is too hot for my little Nais my nursling of seven months ago who still remembers my breast When a nurse has allowed a child to burn its tongue and lips with scalding food she tells the mother who hurries up to see what is wrong that the child cried from hunger How could a mother sleep in peace with the thought that a breath less pure than her own has cooled her child s food the mother whom Nature has made the direct vehicle of food to infant lips To mince a chop for Nais who has just cut her last teeth and mix the meat cooked to a turn with potatoes is a work of patience and there are times indeed when none but a mother could succeed in making an impatient child go through with its meal No number of servants then and no English nurse can dispense a mother from taking the field in person in that daily contest where gentleness alone should grapple with the little griefs and pains of childhood Louise the care of these innocent darlings is a work to engage the whole soul To whose hand and eyes but one s own intrust the task of feeding dressing and putting to bed Broadly speaking a crying child is the unanswerable condemnation of mother or nurse except when the cry is the outcome of natural pain Now that I have two to look after and a third on the road they occupy all my thoughts Even you whom I love so dearly have become a memory to me My own dressing is not always completed by two o clock I have no faith in mothers whose rooms are in apple pie order and who themselves might have stepped out of a bandbox Yesterday was one of those lovely days of early April and I wanted to take my children for a walk while I was still able for the warning bell is in my ears Such an expedition is quite an epic to a mother One dreams of it the night before Armand was for the first time to put on a little black velvet jacket a new collar which I had worked a Scotch cap with the Stuart colors and cock s feathers Nais was to be in white and pink with one of those delicious little baby caps for she is a baby still though she will lose that pretty title on the arrival of the impatient youngster whom I call my beggar for he will have the portion of a younger son You see Louise the child has already appeared to me in a vision so I know it is a boy Well caps collars jackets socks dainty little shoes pink garters the muslin frock with silk embroidery all was laid out on my bed Then the little brown heads had to be brushed twittering merrily all the time like birds answering each other s call Armand s hair is in curls while Nais is brought forward softly on the forehead as a border to the pink and white cap Then the shoes are buckled and when the little bare legs and well shod feet have trotted off to the nursery while two shining faces clean Mary calls them and eyes ablaze with life petition me to start my heart beats fast To look on the children whom one s own hand has arrayed the pure skin brightly veined with blue that one has bathed laved and sponged and decked with gay colors of silk or velvet why there is no poem comes near to it With what eager covetous longing one calls them back for one more kiss on those white necks which in their simple collars the loveliest woman cannot rival Even the coarsest lithograph of such a scene makes a mother pause and I feast my eyes daily on the living picture Once out of doors triumphant in the result of my labors while I was admiring the princely air with which little Armand helped baby to totter along the path you know I saw a carriage coming and tried to get them out of the way The children tumbled into a dirty puddle and lo my works of art are ruined We had to take them back and change their things I took the little one in my arms never thinking of my own dress which was ruined while Mary seized Armand and the cavalcade re entered With a crying baby and a soaked child what mind has a mother left for herself Dinner time arrives and as a rule I have done nothing Now comes the problem which faces me twice every day how to suffice in my own person for two children put on their bibs turn up their sleeves and get them to eat In the midst of these ever recurring cares joys and catastrophes the only person neglected in the house is myself If the children have been naughty often I don t get rid of my curl papers all day Their tempers rule my toilet As the price of a few minutes in which I write you these half dozen pages I have had to let them cut pictures out of my novels build castles with books chessmen or mother of pearl counters and give Nais my silks and wools to arrange in her own fashion which I assure you is so complicated that she is entirely absorbed in it and has not uttered a word Yet I have nothing to complain of My children are both strong and independent they amuse themselves more easily then you would think They find delight in everything a guarded liberty is worth many toys A few pebbles pink yellow purple and black small shells the mysteries of sand are a world of pleasure to them Their wealth consists in possessing a multitude of small things I watch Armand and find him talking to the flowers the flies the chickens and imitating them He is on friendly terms with insects and never wearies of admiring them Everything which is on a minute scale interests them Armand is beginning to ask the why of everything he sees He has come to ask what I am saying to his godmother whom he looks on as a fairy Strange how children hit the mark Alas my sweet I would not sadden you with the tale of my joys Let me give you some notion of your godson s character The other day we were followed by a poor man begging beggars soon find out that a mother with her child at her side can t resist them Armand has no idea what hunger is and money is a sealed book to him but I have just bought him a trumpet which had long been the object of his desires He held it out to the old man with a kingly air saying Here take this What joy the world can give would compare with such a moment May I keep it said the poor man to me I too madame have had children he added hardly noticing the money I put into his hand I shudder when I think that Armand must go to school and that I have only three years and a half more to keep him by me The flowers that blossom in his sunny childhood will fall before the scythe of a public school system his gracious ways and bewitching candor will lose their spontaneity They will cut the curls that I have brushed and smoothed and kissed so often What will they do with the thinking being that is Armand And what of you You tell me nothing of your life Are you still in love with Felipe For as regards the Saracen I have no uneasiness Good bye Nais has just had a tumble and if I run on like this my letter will become a volume XLVI MME DE MACUMER TO THE COMTESSE DE L ESTORADE eighteen twenty nine My sweet tender Renee you will have learned from the papers the terrible calamity which has overwhelmed me I have not been able to write you even a word For twenty days I never left his bedside I received his last breath and closed his eyes I kept holy watch over him with the priests and repeated the prayers for the dead The cruel pangs I suffered were accepted by me as a rightful punishment and yet when I saw on his calm lips the smile which was his last farewell to me how was it possible to believe that I had caused his death Be it so or not he is gone and I am left To you who have known us both so well what more need I say These words contain all Oh I would give my share of Heaven to hear the flattering tale that my prayers have power to bring him back to life To see him again to have him once more mine were it only for a second would mean that I could draw breath again without mortal agony Will you not come soon and soothe me with such promises Is not your love strong enough to deceive me But stay it was you who told me beforehand that he would suffer through me Was it so indeed Yes it is true I had no right to his love Like a thief I took what was not mine and my frenzied grasp has crushed the life out of my bliss The madness is over now but I feel that I am alone Merciful God what torture of the damned can exceed the misery in that word When they took him away from me I lay down on the same bed and hoped to die There was but a door between us and it seemed to me I had strength to force it But alas I was too young for death and after forty days during which with cruel care and all the sorry inventions of medical science they slowly nursed me back to life I find myself in the country seated by my window surrounded with lovely flowers which he made to bloom for me gazing on the same splendid view over which his eyes have so often wandered and which he was so proud to have discovered since it gave me pleasure Ah dear Renee no words can tell how new surroundings hurt when the heart is dead I shiver at the sight of the moist earth in my garden for the earth is a vast tomb and it is almost as though I walked on him When I first went out I trembled with fear and could not move It was so sad to see his flowers and he not there My father and mother are in Spain You know what my brothers are and you yourself are detained in the country But you need not be uneasy about me two angels of mercy flew to my side The Duc and the Duchesse de Soria hastened to their brother in his illness and have been everything that heart could wish The last few nights before the end found the three of us gathered in calm and wordless grief round the bed where this great man was breathing his last a man among a thousand rare in any age head and shoulders above the rest of us in everything The patient resignation of my Felipe was angelic The sight of his brother and Marie gave him a moment s pleasure and easing of his pain Darling he said to me with the simple frankness which never deserted him I had almost gone from life without leaving to Fernand the Barony of Macumer I must make a new will My brother will forgive me he knows what it is to love I owe my life to the care of my brother in law and his wife they want to carry me off to Spain Ah Renee to no one but you can I speak freely of my grief A sense of my own faults weighs me to the ground and there is a bitter solace in pouring them out to you poor unheeded Cassandra The exactions the preposterous jealousy the nagging unrest of my passion wore him to death My love was the more fraught with danger for him because we had both the same exquisitely sensitive nature we spoke the same language nothing was lost on him and often the mocking shaft so carelessly discharged went straight to his heart You can have no idea of the point to which he carried submissiveness I had only to tell him to go and leave me alone and the caprice however wounding to him would be obeyed without a murmur His last breath was spent in blessing me and in repeating that a single morning alone with me was more precious to him than a lifetime spent with another woman were she even the Marie of his youth My tears fall as I write the words This is the manner of my life now I rise at midday and go to bed at seven I linger absurdly long over meals I saunter about slowly standing motionless an hour at a time before a single plant I gaze into the leafy trees I take a sober and serious interest in mere nothings I long for shade silence and night in a word I fight through each hour as it comes and take a gloomy pleasure in adding it to the heap of the vanquished My peaceful park gives me all the company I care for everything there is full of glorious images of my vanished joy invisible for others but eloquent to me I cannot away with you Spaniards I exclaimed one morning as my sister in law flung herself on my neck You have some nobility that we lack Ah Renee if I still live it is doubtless because Heaven tempers the sense of affliction to the strength of those who have to bear it Only a woman can know what it is to lose a love which sprang from the heart and was genuine throughout a passion which was not ephemeral and satisfied at once the spirit and the flesh How rare it is to find a man so gifted that to worship him brings no sense of degradation If such supreme fortune befall us once we cannot hope for it a second time Men of true greatness whose strength and worth are veiled by poetic grace and who charm by some high spiritual power men made to be adored beware of love Love will ruin you and ruin the woman of your heart This is the burden of my cry as I pace my woodland walks And he has left me no child That love so rich in smiles which rained perpetual flowers and joy has left no fruit I am a thing accursed Can it be that even as the two extremes of polar ice and torrid sand are alike intolerant of life so the very purity and vehemence of a single hearted passion render it barren as hate Is it only a marriage of reason such as yours which is blessed with a family Can Heaven be jealous of our passions There are wild words You are I believe the one person whose company I could endure Come to me then none but Renee should be with Louise in her sombre garb What a day when I first put on my widow s bonnet When I saw myself all arrayed in black I fell back on a seat and wept till night came and I weep again as I recall that moment of anguish Good bye Writing tires me thoughts crowd fast but I have no heart to put them into words Bring your children you can nurse baby here without making me jealous all that is gone he is not here and I shall be very glad to see my godson Felipe used to wish for a child like little Armand Come then come and help me to bear my woe XLVII RENEE TO LOUISE eighteen twenty nine My darling When you hold this letter in your hands I shall be already near for I am starting a few minutes after it We shall be alone together Louis is obliged to remain in Provence because of the approaching elections He wants to be elected again and the Liberals are already plotting against his return I don t come to comfort you I only bring you my heart to beat in sympathy with yours and help you to bear with life I come to bid you weep for only with tears can you purchase the joy of meeting him again Remember he is traveling towards Heaven and every step forward which you take brings you nearer to him Every duty done breaks a link in the chain that keeps you apart Louise in my arms you will once more raise your head and go on your way to him pure noble washed of all those errors which had no root in your heart and bearing with you the harvest of good deeds which in his name you will accomplish here I scribble these hasty lines in all the bustle of preparation and interrupted by the babies and by Armand who keeps saying Godmother godmother I want to see her till I am almost jealous He might be your child SECOND PART XLVIII THE BARONNE DE MACUMER TO THE COMTESSE DE L ESTORADE October fifteen eighteen thirty three Yes Renee it is quite true you have been correctly informed I have sold my house I have sold Chantepleurs and the farms in Seine et Marne but no more please I am neither mad nor ruined I assure you Let us go into the matter When everything was wound up there remained to me of my poor Macumer s fortune about twelve hundred thousand francs I will account as to a practical sister for every penny of this I put a million in the Three per Cents when they were at fifty and so I have got an income for myself of sixty thousand francs instead of the thirty thousand which the property yielded Then only think what my life was Six months of the year in the country renewing leases listening to the grumbles of the farmers who pay when it pleases them and getting as bored as a sportsman in wet weather There was produce to sell and I always sold it at a loss Then in Paris my house represented a rental of ten thousand francs I had to invest my money at the notaries I was kept waiting for the interest and could only get the money back by prosecuting in addition I had to study the law of mortgage In short there was business in Nivernais in Seine et Marne in Paris and what a burden what a nuisance what a vexing and losing game for a widow of twenty seven Whereas now my fortune is secured on the Budget In place of paying taxes to the State I receive from it every half year in my own person and free from cost thirty thousand francs in thirty notes handed over the counter to me by a dapper little clerk at the Treasury who smiles when he sees me coming Supposing the nation went bankrupt Well to begin with Tis not mine to see trouble so far from my door At the worst too the nation would not dock me of more than half my income so I should still be as well off as before my investment and in the meantime I shall be drawing a double income until the catastrophe arrives A nation doesn t become bankrupt more than once in a century so I shall have plenty of time to amass a little capital out of my savings And finally is not the Comte de l Estorade a peer of this July semi republic Is he not one of those pillars of royalty offered by the people to the King of the French How can I have qualms with a friend at Court a great financier head of the Audit Department I defy you to arraign my sanity I am almost as good at sums as your citizen king Do you know what inspires a woman with all this arithmetic Love my dear Alas the moment has come for unfolding to you the mysteries of my conduct the motives of which have baffled even your keen sight your prying affection and your subtlety I am to be married in a country village near Paris I love and am loved I love as much as a woman can who knows love well I am loved as much as a woman ought to be by the man she adores Forgive me Renee for keeping this a secret from you and from every one If your friend evades all spies and puts curiosity on a false track you must admit that my feeling for poor Macumer justified some dissimulation Besides de l Estorade and you would have deafened me with remonstrances and plagued me to death with your misgivings to which the facts might have lent some color You know if no one else does to what pitch my jealousy can go and all this would only have been useless torture to me I was determined to carry out on my own responsibility what you Renee will call my insane project and I would take counsel only with my own head and heart for all the world like a schoolgirl giving the slip to her watchful parents The man I love possesses nothing but thirty thousand francs worth of debts which I have paid What a theme for comment here You would have tried to make Gaston out an adventurer your husband would have set detectives on the dear boy I preferred to sift him for myself He has been wooing me now close on two years I am twenty seven he is twenty three The difference I admit is huge when it is on the wrong side Another source of lamentation Lastly he is a poet and has lived by his trade that is to say on next to nothing as you will readily understand Being a poet he has spent more time weaving day dreams and basking lizard like in the sun than scribing in his dingy garret Now practical people have a way of tarring with the same brush of inconstancy authors artists and in general all men who live by their brains Their nimble and fertile wit lays them open to the charge of a like agility in matters of the heart Spite of the debts spite of the difference in age spite of the poetry an end is to be placed in a few days to a heroic resistance of more than nine months during which he has not been allowed even to kiss my hand and so also ends the season of our sweet pure love making This is not the mere surrender of a raw ignorant and curious girl as it was eight years ago the gift is deliberate and my lover awaits it with such loyal patience that if I pleased I could postpone the marriage for a year There is no servility in this love s slave he may be but the heart is not slavish Never have I seen a man of nobler feeling or one whose tenderness was more rich in fancy whose love bore more the impress of his soul Alas my sweet one the art of love is his by heritage A few words will tell his story My friend has no other name than Marie Gaston He is the illegitimate son of the beautiful Lady Brandon whose fame must have reached you and who died broken hearted a victim to the vengeance of Lady Dudley a ghastly story of which the dear boy knows nothing Marie Gaston was placed by his brother Louis in a boarding school at Tours where he remained till eighteen twenty seven Louis after settling his brother at school sailed a few days later for foreign parts to seek his fortune to use the words of an old woman who had played the part of Providence to him This brother turned sailor used to write him at long intervals letters quite fatherly in tone and breathing a noble spirit but a struggling life never allowed him to return home His last letter told Marie that he had been appointed Captain in the navy of some American republic and exhorted him to hope for better days Alas since then three years have passed and my poor poet has never heard again So dearly did he love his brother that he would have started to look for him but for Daniel d Arthez the well known author who took a generous interest in Marie Gaston and prevented him carrying out his mad impulse Nor was this all often would he give him a crust and a corner as the poet puts it in his graphic words For in truth the poor lad was in terrible straits he was actually innocent enough to believe incredible as it seems that genius was the shortest road to fortune and from eighteen twenty eight to eighteen thirty three his one aim has been to make a name for himself in letters Naturally his life was a frightful tissue of toil and hardships alternating between hope and despair The good advice of d Arthez could not prevail against the allurements of ambition and his debts went on growing like a snowball Still he was beginning to come into notice when I happened to meet him at Mme d Espard s At first sight he inspired me unconsciously to himself with the most vivid sympathy How did it come about that this virgin heart has been left for me The fact is that my poet combines genius and cleverness passion and pride and women are always afraid of greatness which has no weak side to it How many victories were needed before Josephine could see the great Napoleon in the little Bonaparte whom she had married Poor Gaston is innocent enough to think he knows the measure of my love He simply has not an idea of it but to you I must make it clear for this letter Renee is something in the nature of a last will and testament Weigh well what I am going to say I beg of you At this moment I am confident of being loved as perhaps not another women on this earth nor have I a shadow of doubt as to the perfect happiness of our wedded life to which I bring a feeling hitherto unknown to me Yes for the first time in my life I know the delight of being swayed by passion That which every woman seeks in love will be mine in marriage As poor Felipe once adored me so do I now adore Gaston I have lost control of myself I tremble before this boy as the Arab hero used to tremble before me In a word the balance of love is now on my side and this makes me timid I am full of the most absurd terrors I am afraid of being deserted afraid of becoming old and ugly while Gaston still retains his youth and beauty afraid of coming short of his hopes And yet I believe I have it in me I believe I have sufficient devotion and ability not only to keep alive the flame of his love in our solitary life far from the world but even to make it burn stronger and brighter If I am mistaken if this splendid idyl of love in hiding must come to an end an end what am I saying if I find Gaston s love less intense any day than it was the evening before be sure of this Renee I should visit my failure only on myself no blame should attach to him I tell you now it would mean my death Not even if I had children could I live on these terms for I know myself Renee I know that my nature is the lover s rather than the mother s Therefore before taking this vow upon my soul I implore you my Renee if this disaster befall me to take the place of mother to my children let them be my legacy to you All that I know of you your blind attachment to duty your rare gifts your love of children your affection for me would help to make my death I dare not say easy but at least less bitter The compact I have thus made with myself adds a vague terror to the solemnity of my marriage ceremony For this reason I wish to have no one whom I know present and it will be performed in secret Let my heart fail me if it will at least I shall not read anxiety in your dear eyes and I alone shall know that this new marriage contract which I sign may be my death warrant I shall not refer again to this agreement entered into between my present self and the self I am to be I have confided it to you in order that you might know the full extent of your responsibilities In marrying I retain full control of my property and Gaston while aware that I have enough to secure a comfortable life for both of us is ignorant of its amount Within twenty four hours I shall dispose of it as I please and in order to save him from a humiliating position I shall have stock bringing in twelve thousand francs a year assigned to him He will find this in his desk on the eve of our wedding If he declined to accept I should break off the whole thing I had to threaten a rupture to get his permission to pay his debts This long confession has tired me I shall finish it the day after to morrow I have to spend to morrow in the country October twentieth I will tell you now the steps I have taken to insure secrecy My object has been to ward off every possible incitement to my ever wakeful jealousy in imitation of the Italian princess who like a lioness rushing on her prey carried it off to some Swiss town to devour in peace And I confide my plans to you because I have another favor to beg namely that you will respect our solitude and never come to see us uninvited Two years ago I purchased a small property overlooking the ponds of Ville d Avray on the road to Versailles It consists of twenty acres of meadow land the skirts of a wood and a fine fruit garden Below the meadows the land has been excavated so as to make a lakelet of about three acres in extent with a charming little island in the middle The small valley is shut in by two graceful thickly wooded slopes where rise delicious springs that water my park by means of channels cleverly disposed by my architect Finally they fall into the royal ponds glimpses of which can be seen here and there gleaming in the distance My little park has been admirably laid out by the architect who has surrounded it by hedges walls or ha has according to the lie of the land so that no possible point of view may be lost A chalet has been built for me half way up the hillside with a charming exposure having the woods of the Ronce on either side and in front a grassy slope running down to the lake Externally the chalet is an exact copy of those which are so much admired by travelers on the road from Sion to Brieg and which fascinated me when I was returning from Italy The internal decorations will bear comparison with those of the most celebrated buildings of the kind A hundred paces from this rustic dwelling stands a charming and ornamental house communicating with it by a subterranean passage This contains the kitchen and other servants rooms stables and coach houses Of all this series of brick buildings the facade alone is seen graceful in its simplicity against a background of shrubbery Another building serves to lodge the gardeners and masks the entrance to the orchards and kitchen gardens The entrance gate to the property is so hidden in the wall dividing the park from the wood as almost to defy detection The plantations already well grown will in two or three years completely hide the buildings so that except in winter when the trees are bare no trace of habitation will appear to the outside world save only the smoke visible from the neighboring hills The surroundings of my chalet have been modeled on what is called the King s Garden at Versailles but it has an outlook on my lakelet and island The hills on every side display their abundant foliage those splendid trees for which your new civil list has so well cared My gardeners have orders to cultivate new sweet scented flowers to any extent and no others so that our home will be a fragrant emerald The chalet adorned with a wild vine which covers the roof is literally embedded in climbing plants of all kinds hops clematis jasmine azalea copaea It will be a sharp eye which can descry our windows The chalet my dear is a good solid house with its heating system and all the conveniences of modern architecture which can raise a palace in the compass of a hundred square feet It contains a suite of rooms for Gaston and another for me The ground floor is occupied by an ante room a parlor and a dining room Above our floor again are three rooms destined for the nurseries I have five first rate horses a small light coupe and a two horse cabriolet We are only forty minutes drive from Paris so that when the spirit moves us to hear an opera or see a new play we can start after dinner and return the same night to our bower The road is a good one and passes under the shade of our green dividing wall My servants cook coachman groom and gardeners in addition to my maid are all very respectable people whom I have spent the last six months in picking up and they will be superintended by my old Philippe Although confident of their loyalty and good faith I have not neglected to cultivate self interest their wages are small but will receive an annual addition in the shape of a New Year s Day present They are all aware that the slightest fault or a mere suspicion of gossiping might lose them a capital place Lovers are never troublesome to their servants they are indulgent by disposition and therefore I feel that I can reckon on my household All that is choice pretty or decorative in my house in the Rue du Bac has been transported to the chalet The Rembrandt hangs on the staircase as though it were a mere daub the Hobbema faces the Rubens in his study the Titian which my sister in law Mary sent me from Madrid adorns the boudoir The beautiful furniture picked up by Felipe looks very well in the parlor which the architect has decorated most tastefully Everything at the chalet is charmingly simple with the simplicity which can t be got under a hundred thousand francs Our ground floor rests on cellars which are built of millstone and embedded in concrete it is almost completely buried in flowers and shrubs and is deliciously cool without a vestige of damp To complete the picture a fleet of white swans sail over my lake Oh Renee the silence which reigns in this valley would bring joy to the dead One is awakened by the birds singing or the breeze rustling in the poplars A little spring discovered by the architect in digging the foundations of the wall trickles down the hillside over silvery sand to the lake between two banks of water cress hugging the edge of the woods I know nothing that money can buy to equal it May not Gaston come to loathe this too perfect bliss I shudder to think how complete it is for the ripest fruits harbor the worms the most gorgeous flowers attract the insects Is it not ever the monarch of the forest which is eaten away by the fatal brown grub greedy as death I have learned before now that an unseen and jealous power attacks happiness which has reached perfection Besides this is the moral of all your preaching and you have been proved a prophet When I went the day before yesterday to see whether my last whim had been carried out tears rose to my eyes and to the great surprise of my architect I at once passed his account for payment But madame he exclaimed your man of business will refuse to pay this it is a matter of three hundred thousand francs My only reply was to add the words To be paid without question with the bearing of a seventeenth century Chaulieu But I said there is one condition to my gratitude No human being must hear from you of the park and buildings Promise me on your honor to observe this article in our contract not to breathe to a soul the proprietor s name Now can you understand the meaning of my sudden journeys my mysterious comings and goings Now do you know whither those beautiful things which the world supposes to be sold have flown Do you perceive the ultimate motive of my change of investment Love my dear is a vast business and they who would succeed in it should have no other Henceforth I shall have no more trouble from money matters I have taken all the thorns out of my life and done my housekeeping work once for all with a vengeance so as never to be troubled with it again except during the daily ten minutes which I shall devote to my old major domo Philippe I have made a study of life and its sharp curves there came a day when death also gave me harsh lessons Now I want to turn all this to account My one occupation will be to please him and love him to brighten with variety what to common mortals is monotonously dull Gaston is still in complete ignorance At my request he has like myself taken up his quarters at Ville d Avray to morrow we start for the chalet Our life there will cost but little but if I told you the sum I am setting aside for my toilet you would exclaim at my madness and with reason I intend to take as much trouble to make myself beautiful for him every day as other women do for society My dress in the country year in year out will cost twenty four thousand francs and the larger portion of this will not go in day costumes As for him he can wear a blouse if he pleases Don t suppose that I am going to turn our life into an amorous duel and wear myself out in devices for feeding passion all that I want is to have a conscience free from reproach Thirteen years still lie before me as a pretty woman and I am determined to be loved on the last day of the thirteenth even more fondly than on the morrow of our mysterious nuptials This time no cutting words shall mar my lowly grateful content I will take the part of servant since that of mistress throve so ill with me before Ah Renee if Gaston has sounded as I have the heights and depths of love my happiness is assured Nature at the chalet wears her fairest face The woods are charming each step opens up to you some fresh vista of cool greenery which delights the soul by the sweet thoughts it wakens They breathe of love If only this be not the gorgeous theatre dressed by my hand for my own martyrdom In two days from now I shall be Mme Gaston My God is it fitting a Christian so to love mortal man Well at least you have the law with you was the comment of my man of business who is to be one of my witnesses and who exclaimed on discovering why my property was to be realized I am losing a client And you my sweetheart whom I dare no longer call my loved one may you not cry I am losing a sister My sweet address when you write in future to Mme Gaston Poste Restante Versailles We shall send there every day for letters I don t want to be known to the country people and we shall get our provisions from Paris In this way I hope we may guard the secret of our lives Nobody has been seen in the place during the years spent in preparing our retreat and the purchase was made in the troubled period which followed the revolution of July The only person who has shown himself here is the architect he alone is known and he will not return Farewell As I write this word I know not whether my heart is fuller of grief or joy That proves does it not that the pain of losing you equals my love for Gaston XLIX MARIE GASTON TO DANIEL D ARTHEZ October eighteen thirty three My Dear Daniel I need two witnesses for my marriage I beg of you to come to morrow evening for this purpose bringing with you our worthy and honored friend Joseph Bridau She who is to be my wife with an instinctive divination of my dearest wishes has declared her intention of living far from the world in complete retirement You who have done so much to lighten my penury have been left in ignorance of my love but you will understand that absolute secrecy was essential This will explain to you why it is that for the last year we have seen so little of each other On the morrow of my wedding we shall be parted for a long time but Daniel you are of stuff to understand me Friendship can subsist in the absence of the friend There may be times when I shall want you badly but I shall not see you at least not in my own house Here again she has forestalled our wishes She has sacrificed to me her intimacy with a friend of her childhood who has been a sister to her For her sake then I also must relinquish my comrade From this fact alone you will divine that ours is no mere passing fancy but love absolute perfect godlike love based upon the fullest knowledge that can bind two hearts in sympathy To me it is a perpetual spring of purest delight Yet nature allows of no happiness without alloy and deep down in the innermost recess of my heart I am conscious of a lurking thought not shared with her the pang of which is for me alone You have too often come to the help of my inveterate poverty to be ignorant how desperate matters were with me Where should I have found courage to keep up the struggle of life after seeing my hopes so often blighted but for your cheering words your tactful aid and the knowledge of what you had come through Briefly then my friend she freed me from that crushing load of debt which was no secret to you She is wealthy I am penniless Many a time have I exclaimed in one of my fits of idleness Oh for some great heiress to cast her eye on me And now in presence of this reality the boy s careless jest the unscrupulous cynicism of the outcast have alike vanished leaving in their place only a bitter sense of humiliation which not the most considerate tenderness on her part nor my own assurance of her noble nature can remove Nay what better proof of my love could there exist for her or for myself than this shame from which I have not recoiled even when powerless to overcome it The fact remains that there is a point where far from protecting I am the protected This is my pain which I confide to you Except in this one particular dear Daniel my fondest dreams are more than realized Fairest and noblest among women such a bride might indeed raise a man to giddy heights of bliss Her gentle ways are seasoned with wit her love comes with an ever fresh grace and charm her mind is well informed and quick to understand in person she is fair and lovely with a rounded slimness as though Raphael and Rubens had conspired to create a woman I do not know whether I could have worshiped with such fervor at the shrine of a dark beauty a brunette always strikes me as an unfinished boy She is a widow childless and twenty seven years of age Though brimful of life and energy she has her moods also of dreamy melancholy These rare gifts go with a proud aristocratic bearing she has a fine presence She belongs to one of those old families who make a fetich of rank yet loves me enough to ignore the misfortune of my birth Our secret passion is now of long standing we have made trial each of the other and find that in the matter of jealousy we are twin spirits our thoughts are the reverberation of the same thunderclap We both love for the first time and this bewitching springtime has filled its days for us with all the images of delight that fancy can paint in laughing sweet or musing mood Our path has been strewn with the flowers of tender imaginings Each hour brought its own wealth and when we parted it was to put our thoughts in verse Not for a moment did I harbor the idea of sullying the brightness of such a time by giving the rein to sensual passion however it might chafe within She was a widow and free intuitively she realized all the homage implied in this constant self restraint which often moved her to tears Can you not read in this my friend a soul of noble temper In mutual fear we shunned even the first kiss of love We have each a wrong to reproach ourselves with she said one day Where is yours I asked My marriage was her reply Daniel you are a giant among us and you love one of the most gifted women of the aristocracy which has produced my Armande what need to tell you more Such an answer lays bare to you a woman s heart and all the happiness which is in store for your friend MARIE GASTON L MME DE L ESTORADE TO MME DE MACUMER Louise can it be that with all your knowledge of the deep seated mischief wrought by the indulgence of passion even within the heart of marriage you are planning a life of wedded solitude Having sacrificed your first husband in the course of a fashionable career would you now fly to the desert to consume a second What stores of misery you are laying up for yourself But I see from the way you have set about it that there is no going back The man who has overcome your aversion to a second marriage must indeed possess some magic of mind and heart and you can only be left to your illusions But have you forgotten your former criticism on young men Not one you would say but has visited haunts of shame and has besmirched his purity with the filth of the streets Where is the change pray in them or in you You are a lucky woman to be able to believe in happiness I have not the courage to blame you for it though the instinct of affection urges me to dissuade you from this marriage Yes a thousand times yes it is true that nature and society are at one in making war on absolute happiness because such a condition is opposed to the laws of both possibly also because Heaven is jealous of its privileges My love for you forebodes some disaster to which all my penetration can give no definite form I know neither whence nor from whom it will arise but one need be no prophet to foretell that the mere weight of a boundless happiness will overpower you Excess of joy is harder to bear than any amount of sorrow Against him I have not a word to say You love him and in all probability I have never seen him but some idle day I hope you will send me a sketch however slight of this rare fine animal If you see me so resigned and cheerful it is because I am convinced that once the honeymoon is over you will both with one accord fall back into the common track Some day two years hence when we are walking along this famous road you will exclaim Why there is the chalet which was to be my home for ever And you will laugh your dear old laugh which shows all your pretty teeth I have said nothing yet to Louis it would be too good an opening for his ridicule I shall tell him simply that you are going to be married and that you wish it kept secret Unluckily you need neither mother nor sister for your bridal evening We are in October now like a brave woman you are grappling with winter first If it were not a question of marriage I should say you were taking the bull by the horns In any case you will have in me the most discreet and intelligent of friends That mysterious region known as the centre of Africa has swallowed up many travelers and you seem to me to be launching on an expedition which in the domain of sentiment corresponds to those where so many explorers have perished whether in the sands or at the hands of natives Your desert is happily only two leagues from Paris so I can wish you quite cheerfully A safe journey and speedy return LI THE COMTESSE DE L ESTORADE TO MME MARIE GASTON eighteen thirty five What has come to you my dear After a silence of two years surely Renee has a right to feel anxious about Louise So this is love It brushes aside and scatters to the winds a friendship such as ours You must admit that devoted as I am to my children more even perhaps than you to your Gaston a mother s love has something expansive about it which does not allow it to steal from other affections or interfere with the claims of friendship I miss your letters I long for a sight of your dear sweet face Oh Louise my heart has only conjecture to feed upon As regards ourselves I will try and tell you everything as briefly as possible On reading your last letter but one I find some stinging comments on our political situation You mocked at us for keeping the post in the Audit Department which as well as the title of Count Louis owed to the favor of Charles X But I should like to know please how it would be possible out of an income of forty thousand livres thirty thousand of which go with the entail to give a suitable start in life to Athenais and my poor little beggar Rene Was it not a duty to live on our salary and prudently allow the income of the estate to accumulate In this way we shall in twenty years have put together about six hundred thousand francs which will provide portions for my daughter and for Rene whom I destine for the navy The poor little chap will have an income of ten thousand livres and perhaps we may contrive to leave him in cash enough to bring his portion up to the amount of his sister s When he is Captain my beggar will be able to make a wealthy marriage and take a position in society as good as his elder brother s These considerations of prudence determined the acceptance in our family of the new order of things The new dynasty as was natural raised Louis to the Peerage and made him a grand officer of the Legion of Honor The oath once taken l Estorade could not be half hearted in his services and he has since then made himself very useful in the Chamber The position he has now attained is one in which he can rest upon his oars till the end of his days He has a good deal of adroitness in business matters and though he can hardly be called an orator speaks pleasantly and fluently which is all that is necessary in politics His shrewdness and the extent of his information in all matters of government and administration are fully appreciated and all parties consider him indispensable I may tell you that he was recently offered an embassy but I would not let him accept it I am tied to Paris by the education of Armand and Athenais who are now respectively thirteen and nearly eleven and I don t intend leaving till little Rene has completed his which is just beginning We could not have remained faithful to the elder branch of the dynasty and returned to our country life without allowing the education and prospects of the three children to suffer A mother my sweet is hardly called on to be a Decius especially at a time when the type is rare In fifteen years from now l Estorade will be able to retire to La Crampade on a good pension having found a place as referendary for Armand in the Audit Department As for Rene the navy will doubtless make a diplomatist of him The little rogue at seven years old has all the cunning of an old Cardinal Oh Louise I am indeed a happy mother My children are an endless source of joy to me Senza brama sicura ricchezza Armand is a day scholar at Henry IV s school I made up my mind he should have a public school training yet could not reconcile myself to the thought of parting with him so I compromised as the Duc d Orleans did before he became or in order that he might become Louis Philippe Every morning Lucas the old servant whom you will remember takes Armand to school in time for the first lesson and brings him home again at half past four In the house we have a private tutor an admirable scholar who helps Armand with his work in the evenings and calls him in the morning at the school hour Lucas takes him some lunch during the play hour at midday In this way I am with my boy at dinner and until he goes to bed at night and I see him off in the morning Armand is the same charming little fellow full of feeling and unselfish impulse whom you loved and his tutor is quite pleased with him I still have Nais and the baby two restless little mortals but I am quite as much a child as they are I could not bring myself to lose the darlings sweet caresses I could not live without the feeling that at any moment I can fly to Armand s bedside and watch his slumbers or snatch a kiss Yet home education is not without its drawbacks to which I am fully alive Society like nature is a jealous power and will have not her rights encroached on or her system set at naught Thus children who are brought up at home are exposed too early to the fire of the world they see its passions and become at home with its subterfuges The finer distinctions which regulate the conduct of matured men and women elude their perceptions and they take feeling and passion for their guide instead of subordinating those to the code of society whilst the gay trappings and tinsel which attract so much of the world s favor blind them to the importance of the more sober virtues A child of fifteen with the assurance of a man of the world is a thing against all nature at twenty five he will be prematurely old and his precocious knowledge only unfits him for the genuine study on which all solid ability must rest Life in society is one long comedy and those who take part in it like other actors reflect back impressions which never penetrate below the surface A mother therefore who wishes not to part from her children must resolutely determine that they shall not enter the gay world she must have courage to resist their inclinations as well as her own and keep them in the background Cornelia had to keep her jewels under lock and key Shall I do less for the children who are all the world to me Now that I am thirty the heat of the day is over the hardest bit of the road lies behind me In a few years I shall be an old woman and the sense of duty done is an immense encouragement It would almost seem as though my trio can read my thoughts and shape themselves accordingly A mysterious bond of sympathy unites me to these children who have never left my side If they knew the blank in my life which they have to fill they could not be more lavish of the solace they bring Armand who was dull and dreamy during his first three years at school and caused me some uneasiness has made a sudden start Doubtless he realized in a way most children never do the aim of all this preparatory work which is to sharpen the intelligence to get them into habits of application and accustom them to that fundamental principle of all society obedience My dear a few days ago I had the proud joy of seeing Armand crowned at the great interscholastic competition in the crowded Sorbonne when your godson received the first prize for translation At the school distribution he got two first prizes one for verse and one for an essay I went quite white when his name was called out and longed to shout aloud I am his mother Little Nais squeezed my hand till it hurt if at such a moment it were possible to feel pain Ah Louise a day like this might outweigh many a dream of love His brother s triumphs have spurred on little Rene who wants to go to school too Sometimes the three children make such a racket shouting and rushing about the house that I wonder how my head stands it I am always with them no one else not even Mary is allowed to take care of my children But the calling of a mother if taxing has so many compensating joys To see a child leave its play and run to hug one out of the fulness of its heart what could be sweeter Then it is only in being constantly with them that one can study their characters It is the duty of a mother and one which she can depute to no hired teacher to decipher the tastes temper and natural aptitudes of her children from their infancy All home bred children are distinguished by ease of manner and tact two acquired qualities which may go far to supply the lack of natural ability whereas no natural ability can atone for the loss of this early training I have already learned to discriminate this difference of tone in the men whom I meet in society and to trace the hand of a woman in the formation of a young man s manners How could any woman defraud her children of such a possession You see what rewards attend the performance of my tasks Armand I feel certain will make an admirable judge the most upright of public servants the most devoted of deputies And where would you find a sailor bolder more adventurous more astute than my Rene will be a few years hence The little rascal has already an iron will whatever he wants he manages to get he will try a thousand circuitous ways to reach his end and if not successful then will devise a thousand and first Where dear Armand quietly resigns himself and tries to get at the reason of things Rene will storm and strive and puzzle chattering all the time till at last he finds some chink in the obstacle if there is room for the blade of a knife to pass his little carriage will ride through in triumph And Nais Nais is so completely a second self that I can hardly realize her as distinct from my own flesh and blood What a darling she is and how I love to make a little lady of her to dress her curly hair tender thoughts mingling the while with every touch I must have her happy I shall only give her to the man who loves her and whom she loves But Heavens when I let her put on her little ornaments or pass a cherry colored ribbon through her hair or fasten the shoes on her tiny feet a sickening thought comes over me How can one order the destiny of a girl Who can say that she will not love a scoundrel or some man who is indifferent to her Tears often spring to my eyes as I watch her This lovely creature this flower this rosebud which has blossomed in one s heart to be handed over to a man who will tear it from the stem and leave it bare Louise it is you you who in two years have not written three words to tell me of your welfare it is you who have recalled to my mind the terrible possibilities of marriage so full of anguish for a mother wrapped up as I am in her child Farewell now for in truth you don t deserve my friendship and I hardly know how to write Oh answer me dear Louise LII MME GASTON TO MME DE L ESTORADE The Chalet So after a silence of two years you are pricked by curiosity and want to know why I have not written My dear Renee there are no words no images no language to express my happiness That we have strength to bear it sums up all I could say It costs us no effort for we are in perfect sympathy The whole two years have known no note of discord in the harmony no jarring word in the interchange of feeling no shade of difference in our lightest wish Not one in this long succession of days has failed to bear its own peculiar fruit not a moment has passed without being enriched by the play of fancy So far are we from dreading the canker of monotony in our life that our only fear is lest it should not be long enough to contain all the poetic creations of a love as rich and varied in its development as Nature herself Of disappointment not a trace We find more pleasure in being together than on the first day and each hour as it goes by discloses fresh reason for our love Every day as we take our evening stroll after dinner we tell each other that we really must go and see what is doing in Paris just as one might talk of going to Switzerland Only think Gaston will exclaim such and such a boulevard is being made the Madeleine is finished We ought to see it Let us go to morrow And to morrow comes and we are in no hurry to get up and we breakfast in our bedroom Then midday is on us and it is too hot a siesta seems appropriate Then Gaston wishes to look at me and he gazes on my face as though it were a picture losing himself in this contemplation which as you may suppose is not one sided Tears rise to the eyes of both as we think of our love and tremble I am still the mistress pretending that is to give less than I receive and I revel in this deception To a woman what can be sweeter than to see passion ever held in check by tenderness and the man who is her master stayed like a timid suitor by a word from her within the limits that she chooses You asked me to describe him but Renee it is not possible to make a portrait of the man we love How could the heart be kept out of the work Besides to be frank between ourselves we may admit that one of the dire effects of civilization on our manners is to make of man in society a being so utterly different from the natural man of strong feeling that sometimes not a single point of likeness can be found between these two aspects of the same person The man who falls into the most graceful operatic poses as he pours sweet nothings into your ear by the fire at night may be entirely destitute of those more intimate charms which a woman values On the other hand an ugly boorish badly dressed figure may mark a man endowed with the very genius of love and who has a perfect mastery over situations which might baffle us with our superficial graces A man whose conventional aspect accords with his real nature who in the intimacy of wedded love possesses that inborn grace which can be neither given nor acquired but which Greek art has embodied in statuary that careless innocence of the ancient poets which even in frank undress seems to clothe the soul as with a veil of modesty this is our ideal born of our own conceptions and linked with the universal harmony which seems to be the reality underlying all created things To find this ideal in life is the problem which haunts the imagination of every woman in Gaston I have found it Ah dear I did not know what love could be united to youth talent and beauty Gaston has no affectations he moves with an instinctive and unstudied grace When we walk alone together in the woods his arm round my waist mine resting on his shoulder body fitting to body and head touching head our step is so even uniform and gentle that those who see us pass by night take the vision for a single figure gliding over the graveled walks like one of Homer s immortals A like harmony exists in our desires our thoughts our words More than once on some evening when a passing shower has left the leaves glistening and the moist grass bright with a more vivid green it has chanced that we ended our walk without uttering a word as we listened to the patter of falling drops and feasted our eyes on the scarlet sunset flaring on the hilltops or dyeing with a warmer tone the gray of the tree trunks Beyond a doubt our thoughts then rose to Heaven in silent prayer pleading as it were for our happiness At times a cry would escape us at the moment when some sudden bend on the path opened up fresh beauties What words can tell how honey sweet how full of meaning is a kiss half timidly exchanged within the sanctuary of nature it is as though God had created us to worship in this fashion And we return home each more deeply in love than ever A love so passionate between old married people would be an outrage on society in Paris only in the heart of the woods like lovers can we give scope to it To come to particulars Gaston is of middle height the height proper to all men of purpose Neither stout nor thin his figure is admirably made with ample fulness in the proportions while every motion is agile he leaps a ditch with the easy grace of a wild animal Whatever his attitude he seems to have an instinctive sense of balance and this is very rare in men who are given to thought Though a dark man he has an extraordinarily fair complexion his jet black hair contrasts finely with the lustreless tints of the neck and forehead He has the tragic head of Louis XIII His moustache and tuft have been allowed to grow but I made him shave the whiskers and beard which were getting too common An honorable poverty has been his safeguard and handed him over to me unsoiled by the loose life which ruins so many young men His teeth are magnificent and he has a constitution of iron His keen blue eyes for me full of tenderness will flash like lightning at any rousing thought Like all men of strong character and powerful mind he has an admirable temper its evenness would surprise you as it did me I have listened to the tale of many a woman s home troubles I have heard of the moods and depression of men dissatisfied with themselves who either won t get old or age ungracefully men who carry about through life the rankling memory of some youthful excess whose veins run poison and whose eyes are never frankly happy men who cloak suspicion under bad temper and make their women pay for an hour s peace by a morning of annoyance who take vengeance on us for a beauty which is hateful to them because they have ceased themselves to be attractive all these are horrors unknown to youth They are the penalty of unequal unions Oh my dear whatever you do don t marry Athenais to an old man But his smile how I feast on it A smile which is always there yet always fresh through the play of subtle fancy a speaking smile which makes of the lips a storehouse for thoughts of love and unspoken gratitude a smile which links present joys to past For nothing is allowed to drop out of our common life The smallest works of nature have become part and parcel of our joy In these delightful woods everything is alive and eloquent of ourselves An old moss grown oak near the woodsman s house on the roadside reminds us how we sat there wearied under its shade while Gaston taught me about the mosses at our feet and told me their story till gradually ascending from science to science we touched the very confines of creation There is something so kindred in our minds that they seem to me like two editions of the same book You see what a literary tendency I have developed We both have the habit or the gift of looking at every subject broadly of taking in all its points of view and the proof we are constantly giving ourselves of the singleness of our inward vision is an ever new pleasure We have actually come to look on this community of mind as a pledge of love and if it ever failed us it would mean as much to us as would a breach of fidelity in an ordinary home My life full as it is of pleasures would seem to you nevertheless extremely laborious To begin with my dear you must know that Louise Armande Marie de Chaulieu does her own room I could not bear that a hired menial some woman or girl from the outside should become initiated literary touch again into the secrets of my bedroom The veriest trifles connected with the worship of my heart partake of its sacred character This is not jealousy it is self respect Thus my room is done out with all the care a young girl in love bestows on her person and with the precision of an old maid My dressing room is no chaos of litter on the contrary it makes a charming boudoir My keen eye has foreseen all contingencies At whatever hour the lord and master enters he will find nothing to distress surprise or shock him he is greeted by flowers scents and everything that can please the eye I get up in the early dawn while he is still sleeping and without disturbing him pass into the dressing room where profiting by my mother s experience I remove the traces of sleep by bathing in cold water For during sleep the skin being less active does not perform its functions adequately it becomes warm and covered with a sort of mist or atmosphere of sticky matter visible to the eye From a sponge bath a woman issues ten years younger and this perhaps is the interpretation of the myth of Venus rising from the sea So the cold water restores to me the saucy charm of dawn and having combed and scented my hair and made a most fastidious toilet I glide back snake like in order that my master may find me dainty as a spring morning at his wakening He is charmed with this freshness as of a newly opened flower without having the least idea how it is produced The regular toilet of the day is a matter for my maid and this takes place later in a larger room set aside for the purpose As you may suppose there is also a toilet for going to bed Three times a day you see or it may be four do I array myself for the delight of my husband which again dear one is suggestive of certain ancient myths But our work is not all play We take a great deal of interest in our flowers in the beauties of the hothouse and in our trees We give ourselves in all seriousness to horticulture and embosom the chalet in flowers of which we are passionately fond Our lawns are always green our shrubberies as well tended as those of a millionaire And nothing I assure you can match the beauty of our walled garden We are regular gluttons over our fruit and watch with tender interest our Montreuil peaches our hotbeds our laden trellises and pyramidal pear trees But lest these rural pursuits should fail to satisfy my beloved s mind I have advised him to finish in the quiet of this retreat some plays which were begun in his starvation days and which are really very fine This is the only kind of literary work which can be done in odd moments for it requires long intervals of reflection and does not demand the elaborate pruning essential to a finished style One can t make a task work of dialogue there must be biting touches summings up and flashes of wit which are the blossoms of the mind and come rather by inspiration than reflection This sort of intellectual sport is very much in my line I assist Gaston in his work and in this way manage to accompany him even in the boldest flights of his imagination Do you see now how it is that my winter evenings never drag Our servants have such an easy time that never once since we were married have we had to reprimand any of them When questioned about us they have had wit enough to draw on their imaginations and have given us out as the companion and secretary of a lady and gentleman supposed to be traveling They never go out without asking permission which they know will not be refused they are contented too and see plainly that it will be their own fault if there is a change for the worse The gardeners are allowed to sell the surplus of our fruits and vegetables The dairymaid does the same with the milk the cream and the fresh butter on condition that the best of the produce is reserved for us They are well pleased with their profits and we are delighted with an abundance which no money and no ingenuity can procure in that terrible Paris where it costs a hundred francs to produce a single fine peach All this is not without its meaning my dear I wish to fill the place of society to my husband now society is amusing and therefore his solitude must not be allowed to pall on him I believed myself jealous in the old days when I merely allowed myself to be loved now I know real jealousy the jealousy of the lover A single indifferent glance unnerves me From time to time I say to myself Suppose he ceased to love me And a shudder goes through me I tremble before him as the Christian before his God Alas Renee I am still without a child The time will surely come it must come when our hermitage will need a father s and a mother s care to brighten it when we shall both pine to see the little frocks and pelisses the brown or golden heads leaping running through our shrubberies and flowery paths Oh it is a cruel jest of Nature s a flowering tree that bears no fruit The thought of your lovely children goes through me like a knife My life has grown narrower while yours has expanded and shed its rays afar The passion of love is essentially selfish while motherhood widens the circle of our feelings How well I felt this difference when I read your kind tender letter To see you thus living in three hearts roused my envy Yes you are happy you have had wisdom to obey the laws of social life whilst I stand outside an alien Children dear and loving children can alone console a woman for the loss of her beauty I shall soon be thirty and at that age the dirge within begins What though I am still beautiful the limits of my woman s reign are none the less in sight When they are reached what then I shall be forty before he is I shall be old while he is still young When this thought goes to my heart I lie at his feet for an hour at a time making him swear to tell me instantly if ever he feels his love diminishing But he is a child He swears as though the mere suggestion were an absurdity and he is so beautiful that Renee you understand I believe him Good bye sweet one Shall we ever again let years pass without writing Happiness is a monotonous theme and that is perhaps the reason why to souls who love Dante appears even greater in the Paradiso than in the Inferno I am not Dante I am only your friend and I don t want to bore you You can write for in your children you have an ever growing every varying source of happiness while mine No more of this A thousand loves LIII MME DE L ESTORADE TO MME GASTON My dear Louise I have read and re read your letter and the more deeply I enter into its spirit the clearer does it become to me that it is the letter not of a woman but of a child You are the same old Louise and you forget what I used to repeat over and over again to you that the passion of love belongs rightly to a state of nature and has only been purloined by civilization So fleeting is its character that the resources of society are powerless to modify its primitive condition and it becomes the effort of all noble minds to make a man of the infant Cupid But as you yourself admit such love ceases to be natural Society my dear abhors sterility but substituting a lasting sentiment for the mere passing frenzy of nature it has succeeded in creating that greatest of all human inventions the family which is the enduring basis of all organized society To the accomplishment of this end it has sacrificed the individual man as well as woman for we must not shut our eyes to the fact that a married man devotes his energy his power and all his possession to his wife Is it not she who reaps the benefit of all his care For whom if not for her are the luxury and wealth the position and distinction the comfort and the gaiety of the home Oh my sweet once again you have taken the wrong turning in life To be adored is a young girl s dream which may survive a few springtimes it cannot be that of the mature woman the wife and mother To a woman s vanity it is perhaps enough to know that she can command adoration if she likes If you would live the life of a wife and mother return I beg of you to Paris Let me repeat my warning It is not misfortune which you have to dread as others do it is happiness Listen to me my child It is the simple things of life bread air silence of which we do not tire they have no piquancy which can create distaste it is highly flavored dishes which irritate the palate and in the end exhaust it Were it possible that I should to day be loved by a man for whom I could conceive a passion such as yours for Gaston I would still cling to the duties and the children who are so dear to me To a woman s heart the feelings of a mother are among the simple natural fruitful and inexhaustible things of life I can recall the day now nearly fourteen years ago when I embarked on a life of self sacrifice with the despair of a shipwrecked mariner clinging to the mast of his vessel now as I invoke the memory of past years I feel that I would make the same choice again No other guiding principle is so safe or leads to such rich reward The spectacle of your life which for all the romance and poetry with which you invest it still remains based on nothing but a ruthless selfishness has helped to strengthen my convictions This is the last time I shall speak to you in this way but I could not refrain from once more pleading with you when I found that your happiness had been proof against the most searching of all trials And one more point I must urge on you suggested by my meditations on your retirement Life whether of the body or the heart consists in certain balanced movements Any excess introduced into the working of this routine gives rise either to pain or to pleasure both of which are a mere fever of the soul bound to be fugitive because nature is not so framed as to support it long But to make of life one long excess is surely to choose sickness for one s portion You are sick because you maintain at the temperature of passion a feeling which marriage ought to convert into a steadying purifying influence Yes my sweet I see it clearly now the glory of a home consists in this very calm this intimacy this sharing alike of good and evil which the vulgar ridicule How noble was the reply of the Duchesse de Sully the wife of the great Sully to some one who remarked that her husband for all his grave exterior did not scruple to keep a mistress What of that she said I represent the honor of the house and should decline to play the part of a courtesan there But you Louise who are naturally more passionate than tender would be at once the wife and the mistress With the soul of a Heloise and the passions of a Saint Theresa you slip the leash on all your impulses so long as they are sanctioned by law in a word you degrade the marriage rite Surely the tables are turned The reproaches you once heaped on me for immorally as you said seizing the means of happiness from the very outset of my wedded life might be directed against yourself for grasping at everything which may serve your passion What must nature and society alike be in bondage to your caprice You are the old Louise you have never acquired the qualities which ought to be a woman s self willed and unreasonable as a girl you introduce withal into your love the keenest and most mercenary of calculations Are you sure that after all the price you ask for your toilets is not too high All these precautions are to my mind very suggestive of mistrust Oh dear Louise if only you knew the sweetness of a mother s efforts to discipline herself in kindness and gentleness to all about her My proud self sufficing temper gradually dissolved into a soft melancholy which in turn has been swallowed up by those delights of motherhood which have been its reward If the early hours were toilsome the evening will be tranquil and clear My dread is lest the day of your life should take the opposite course When I had read your letter to a close I prayed God to send you among us for a day that you might see what family life really is and learn the nature of those joys which are lasting and sweeter than tongue can tell because they are genuine simple and natural But alas what chance have I with the best of arguments against a fallacy which makes you happy As I write these words my eyes fill with tears I had felt so sure that some months of honeymoon would prove a surfeit and restore you to reason But I see that there is no limit to your appetite and that having killed a man who loved you you will not cease till you have killed love itself Farewell dear misguided friend I am in despair that the letter which I hoped might reconcile you to society by its picture of my happiness should have brought forth only a paean of selfishness Yes your love is selfish you love Gaston far less for himself than for what he is to you LIV MME GASTON TO THE COMTESSE DE L ESTORADE May twentieth Renee calamity has come no that is no word for it it has burst like a thunderbolt over your poor Louise You know what that means calamity for me is doubt certainty would be death The day before yesterday when I had finished my first toilet I looked everywhere for Gaston to take a little turn with me before lunch but in vain I went to the stable and there I saw his mare all in a lather while the groom was removing the foam with a knife before rubbing her down Who in the world has put Fedelta in such a state I asked Master replied the lad I saw the mud of Paris on the mare s legs for country mud is quite different and at once it flashed through me He has been to Paris This thought raised a swarm of others in my heart and it seemed as though all the life in my body rushed there To go to Paris without telling me at the hour when I leave him alone to hasten there and back at such speed as to distress Fedelta Suspicion clutched me in its iron grip till I could hardly breathe I walked aside a few steps to a seat where I tried to recover my self command Here Gaston found me apparently pale and fluttered for he immediately exclaimed What is wrong in a tone of such alarm that I rose and took his arm But my muscles refused to move and I was forced to sit down again Then he took me in his arms and carried me to the parlor close by where the frightened servants pressed after us till Gaston motioned them away Once left to ourselves I refused to speak but was able to reach my room where I shut myself in to weep my fill Gaston remained something like two hours at my door listening to my sobs and questioning with angelic patience his poor darling who made no response At last I told him that I would see him when my eyes were less red and my voice was steady again My formal words drove him from the house But by the time I had bathed my eyes in iced water and cooled my face I found him in our room the door into which was open though I had heard no steps He begged me to tell him what was wrong Nothing I said I saw the mud of Paris on Fedelta s trembling legs it seemed strange that you should go there without telling me but of course you are free I shall punish you for such wicked thoughts by not giving any explanation till to morrow he replied Look at me I said My eyes met his deep answered to deep No not a trace of the cloud of disloyalty which rising from the soul must dim the clearness of the eye I feigned satisfaction though really unconvinced It is not women only who can lie and dissemble The whole of the day we spent together Ever and again as I looked at him I realized how fast my heart strings were bound to him How I trembled and fluttered within when after a moment s absence he reappeared I live in him not in myself My cruel sufferings gave the lie to your unkind letter Did I ever feel my life thus bound up in the noble Spaniard who adored me as I adore this heartless boy I hate that mare Fool that I was to keep horses But the next thing would have been to lame Gaston or imprison him in the cottage Wild thoughts like these filled my brain you see how near I was to madness If love be not the cage what power on earth can hold back the man who wants to be free I asked him point blank Do I bore you What needless torture you give yourself was his reply while he looked at me with tender pitying eyes Never have I loved you so deeply If that is true my beloved let me sell Fedelta I answered Sell her by all means The reply crushed me Was it not a covert taunt at my wealth and his own nothingness in the house This may never have occurred to him but I thought it had and once more I left him It was night and I would go to bed Oh Renee to be alone with a harrowing thought drives one to thoughts of death These charming gardens the starry night the cool air laden with incense from our wealth of flowers our valley our hills all seemed to me gloomy black and desolate It was as though I lay at the foot of a precipice surrounded by serpents and poisonous plants and saw no God in the sky Such a night ages a woman Next morning I said Take Fedelta and be off to Paris Don t sell her I love her Does she not carry you But he was not deceived my tone betrayed the storm of feeling which I strove to conceal Trust me he replied and the gesture with which he held out his hand the glance of his eye were so full of loyalty that I was overcome What petty creatures women are I exclaimed No you love me that is all he said pressing me to his heart Go to Paris without me I said and this time I made him understand that my suspicions were laid aside He went I thought he would have stayed I won t attempt to tell you what I suffered I found a second self within quite strange to me A crisis like this has for the woman who loves a tragic solemnity that baffles words the whole of life rises before you then and you search in vain for any horizon to it the veriest trifle is big with meaning a glance contains a volume icicles drift on uttered words and the death sentence is read in a movement of the lips I thought he would have paid me back in kind had I not been magnanimous I climbed to the top of the chalet and my eyes followed him on the road Ah my dear Renee he vanished from my sight with an appalling swiftness How keen he is to go was the thought that sprang of itself Once more alone I fell back into the hell of possibilities the maelstrom of mistrust There were moments when I would have welcomed any certainty even the worst as a relief from the torture of suspense Suspense is a duel carried on in the heart and we give no quarter to ourselves I paced up and down the walks I returned to the house only to tear out again like a mad woman Gaston who left at seven o clock did not return till eleven Now as it only takes half an hour to reach Paris through the park of saint Cloud and the Bois de Boulogne it is plain that he must have spent three hours in town He came back radiant with a whip in his hand for me an india rubber whip with a gold handle For a fortnight I had been without a whip my old one being worn and broken Was it for this you tortured me I said as I admired the workmanship of this beautiful ornament which contains a little scent box at one end Then it flashed on me that the present was a fresh artifice Nevertheless I threw myself at once on his neck not without reproaching him gently for having caused me so much pain for the sake of a trifle He was greatly pleased with his ingenuity his eyes and his whole bearing plainly showed the restrained triumph of the successful plotter for there is a radiance of the soul which is reflected in every feature and turn of the body While still examining the beauties of this work of art I asked him at a moment when we happened to be looking each other in the face Who is the artist A friend of mine Ah I see it has been mounted by Verdier and I read the name of the shop printed on the handle Gaston is nothing but a child yet He blushed and I made much of him as a reward for the shame he felt in deceiving me I pretended to notice nothing and he may well have thought the incident was over May twenty fifth The next morning I was in my riding habit by six o clock and by seven landed at Verdier s where several whips of the same pattern were shown to me One of the men serving recognized mine when I pointed it out to him We sold that yesterday to a young gentleman he said And from the description I gave him of my traitor Gaston not a doubt was left of his identity I will spare you the palpitations which rent my heart during that journey to Paris and the little scene there which marked the turning point of my life By half seven I was home again and Gaston found me fresh and blooming in my morning dress sauntering about with a make believe nonchalance I felt confident that old Philippe who had been taken into my confidence would not have betrayed my absence Gaston I said as we walked by the side of the lake you cannot blind me to the difference between a work of art inspired by friendship and something which has been cast in a mould He turned white and fixed his eyes on me rather than on the damaging piece of evidence I thrust before them My dear I went on this is not a whip it is a screen behind which you are hiding something from me Thereupon I gave myself the gratification of watching his hopeless entanglement in the coverts and labyrinths of deceit and the desperate efforts he made to find some wall he might scale and thus escape In vain he had perforce to remain upon the field face to face with an adversary who at last laid down her arms in a feigned complacence But it was too late The fatal mistake against which my mother had tried to warm me was made My jealousy exposed in all its nakedness had led to war and all its stratagems between Gaston and myself Jealousy dear has neither sense nor decency I made up my mind now to suffer in silence but to keep my eyes open until my doubts were resolved one way or another Then I would either break with Gaston or bow to my misfortune no middle course is possible for a woman who respects herself What can he be concealing For a secret there is and the secret has to do with a woman Is it some youthful escapade for which he still blushes But if so what The word what is written in letters of fire on all I see I read it in the glassy water of my lake in the shrubbery in the clouds on the ceilings at table in the flowers of the carpets A voice cries to me what in my sleep Dating from the morning of my discovery a cruel interest has sprung into our lives and I have become familiar with the bitterest thought that can corrode the heart the thought of treachery in him one loves Oh my dear there is heaven and hell together in such a life Never had I felt this scorching flame I to whom love had appeared only in the form of devoutest worship So you wished to know the gloomy torture chamber of pain I said to myself Good the spirits of evil have heard your prayer go on your road unhappy wretch May thirtieth Since that fatal day Gaston no longer works with the careless ease of the wealthy artist whose work is merely pastime he sets himself tasks like a professional writer Four hours a day he devotes to finishing his two plays He wants money A voice within whispered the thought But why He spends next to nothing we have absolutely no secrets from each other there is not a corner of his study which my eyes and my fingers may not explore His yearly expenditure does not amount to two thousand francs and I know that he has thirty thousand I can hardly say laid by but scattered loose in a drawer You can guess what is coming At midnight while he was sleeping I went to see if the money was still there An icy shiver ran through me The drawer was empty That same week I discovered that he went to Sevres to fetch his letters and these letters he must tear up immediately for though I am a very Figaro in contrivances I have never yet seen a trace of one Alas my sweet despite the fine promises and vows by which I bound myself after the scene of the whip an impulse which I can only call madness drove me to follow him in one of his rapid rides to the post office Gaston was appalled to be thus discovered on horseback paying the postage of a letter which he held in his hand He looked fixedly at me and then put spurs to Fedelta The pace was so hard that I felt shaken to bits when I reached the lodge gate though my mental agony was such at the time that it might well have dulled all consciousness of bodily pain Arrived at the gate Gaston said nothing he rang the bell and waited without a word I was more dead than alive I might be mistaken or I might not but in neither case was it fitting for Armande Louise Marie de Chaulieu to play the spy I had sunk to the level of the gutter by the side of courtesans opera dancers mere creatures of instinct even the vulgar shop girl or humble seamstress might look down on me What a moment At last the door opened he handed his horse to the groom and I also dismounted but into his arms which were stretched out to receive me I threw my skirt over my left arm gave him my right and we walked on still in silence The few steps we thus took might be reckoned to me for a hundred years of purgatory A swarm of thoughts beset me as I walked now seeming to take visible form in tongues of fire before my eyes now assailing my mind each with its own poisoned dart When the groom and the horses were far away I stopped Gaston and looking him in the face said as I pointed with a gesture that you should have seen to the fatal letter still in his right hand May I read it He gave it to me I opened it and found a letter from Nathan the dramatic author informing Gaston that a play of his had been accepted learned rehearsed and would be produced the following Saturday He also enclosed a box ticket Though for me this was the opening of heaven s gates to the martyr yet the fiend would not leave me in peace but kept crying Where are the thirty thousand francs It was a question which self respect dignity all my old self in fact prevented me from uttering If my thought became speech I might as well throw myself into the lake at once and yet I could hardly keep the words down Dear friend was not this a trial passing the strength of woman I returned the letter saying My poor Gaston you are getting bored down here Let us go back to Paris won t you To Paris he said But why I only wanted to find out if I had any gift to taste the flowing bowl of success Nothing would be easier than for me to ransack the drawer sometime while he is working and pretend great surprise at finding the money gone But that would be going half way to meet the answer Oh my friend So and So was hard up et cetera which a man of Gaston s quick wit would not have far to seek The moral my dear is that the brilliant success of this play which all Paris is crowding to see is due to us though the whole credit goes to Nathan I am represented by one of the two stars in the legend Et M I saw the first night from the depths of one of the stage boxes July first Gaston s work and his visits to Paris shall continue He is preparing new plays partly because he wants a pretext for going to Paris partly in order to make money Three plays have been accepted and two more are commissioned Oh my dear I am lost all is darkness around me I would set fire to the house in a moment if that would bring light What does it all mean Is he ashamed of taking money from me He is too high minded for so trumpery a matter to weigh with him Besides scruples of the kind could only be the outcome of some love affair A man would take anything from his wife but from the woman he has ceased to care for or is thinking of deserting it is different If he needs such large sums it must be to spend them on a woman For himself why should he hesitate to draw from my purse Our savings amount to one hundred thousand francs In short my sweetheart I have explored a whole continent of possibilities and after carefully weighing all the evidence am convinced I have a rival I am deserted for whom At all costs I must see the unknown July tenth Light has come and it is all over with me Yes Renee at the age of thirty in the perfection of my beauty with all the resources of a ready wit and the seductive charms of dress at my command I am betrayed and for whom A large boned Englishwoman with big feet and thick waist a regular British cow There is no longer room for doubt I will tell you the history of the last few days Worn out with suspicions which were fed by Gaston s guilty silence for if he had helped a friend why keep it a secret from me his insatiable desire for money and his frequent journeys to Paris jealous too of the work from which he seemed unable to tear himself I at last made up my mind to take certain steps of such a degrading nature that I cannot tell you about them Suffice it to say that three days ago I ascertained that Gaston when in Paris visits a house in the Rue de la Ville l Eveque where he guards his mistress with jealous mystery unexampled in Paris The porter was surly and I could get little out of him but that little was enough to put an end to any lingering hope and with hope to life On this point my mind was resolved and I only waited to learn the whole truth first With this object I went to Paris and took rooms in a house exactly opposite the one which Gaston visits Thence I saw him with my own eyes enter the courtyard on horseback Too soon a ghastly fact forced itself on me This Englishwoman who seems to me about thirty six is known as Mme Gaston This discovery was my deathblow I saw him next walking to the Tuileries with a couple of children Oh my dear two children the living images of Gaston The likeness is so strong that it bears scandal on the face of it And what pretty children in their handsome English costumes She is the mother of his children Here is the key to the whole mystery The woman herself might be a Greek statue stepped down from some monument Cold and white as marble she moves sedately with a mother s pride She is undeniably beautiful but heavy as a man of war There is no breeding or distinction about her nothing of the English lady Probably she is a farmer s daughter from some wretched and remote country village or it may be the eleventh child of some poor clergyman I reached home after a miserable journey during which all sorts of fiendish thoughts had me at their mercy with hardly any life left in me Was she married Did he know her before our marriage Had she been deserted by some rich man whose mistress she was and thus thrown back upon Gaston s hands Conjectures without end flitted through my brain as though conjecture were needed in the presence of the children The next day I returned to Paris and by a free use of my purse extracted from the porter the information that Mme Gaston was legally married His reply to my question took the form Yes Miss July fifteenth My dear my love for Gaston is stronger than ever since that morning and he has every appearance of being still more deeply in love He is so young A score of times it has been on my lips when we rise in the morning to say Then you love me better than the lady of the Rue de la Ville l Eveque But I dare not explain to myself why the words are checked on my tongue Are you very fond of children I asked Oh yes was his reply but children will come What makes you think so I have consulted the best doctors and they agree in advising me to travel for a couple of months Gaston I said if love in absence had been possible for me do you suppose I should ever have left the convent He laughed but as for me dear the word travel pierced my heart Rather far rather would I leap from the top of the house than be rolled down the staircase step by step Farewell my sweetheart I have arranged for my death to be easy and without horrors but certain I made my will yesterday You can come to me now the prohibition is removed Come then and receive my last farewell I will not die by inches my death like my life shall bear the impress of dignity and grace Good bye dear sister soul whose affection has never wavered nor grown weary but has been the constant tender moonlight of my soul If the intensity of passion has not been ours at least we have been spared its venomous bitterness How rightly you have judged of life Farewell LV THE COMTESSE DE L ESTORADE TO MME GASTON July sixteenth My dear Louise I send this letter by an express before hastening to the chalet myself Take courage Your last letter seemed to me so frantic that I thought myself justified under the circumstances in confiding all to Louis it was a question of saving you from yourself If the means we have employed have been like yours repulsive yet the result is so satisfactory that I am certain you will approve I went so far as to set the police to work but the whole thing remains a secret between the prefect ourselves and you In one word Gaston is a jewel But here are the facts His brother Louis Gaston died at Calcutta while in the service of a mercantile company when he was on the very point of returning to France a rich prosperous married man having received a very large fortune with his wife who was the widow of an English merchant For ten years he had worked hard that he might be able to send home enough to support his brother to whom he was devotedly attached and from whom his letters generously concealed all his trials and disappointments Then came the failure of the great Halmer house the widow was ruined and the sudden shock affected Louis Gaston s brain He had no mental energy left to resist the disease which attacked him and he died in Bengal whither he had gone to try and realize the remnants of his wife s property The dear good fellow had deposited with a banker a first sum of three hundred thousand francs which was to go to his brother but the banker was involved in the Halmer crash and thus their last resource failed them Louis widow the handsome woman whom you took for your rival arrived in Paris with two children your nephews and an empty purse her mother s jewels having barely sufficed to pay for bringing them over The instructions which Louis Gaston had given the banker for sending the money to his brother enabled the widow to find your husband s former home As Gaston had disappeared without leaving any address Mme Louis Gaston was directed to d Arthez the only person who could give any information about him D Arthez was the more ready to relieve the young woman s pressing needs because Louis Gaston at the time of his marriage four years before had written to make inquiries about his brother from the famous author whom he knew to be one of his friends The Captain had consulted d Arthez as to the best means of getting the money safely transferred to Marie and d Arthez had replied telling him that Gaston was now a rich man through his marriage with the Baronne de Macumer The personal beauty which was the mother s rich heritage to her sons had saved them both one in India the other in Paris from destitution A touching story is it not D Arthez naturally wrote after a time to tell your husband of the condition of his sister in law and her children informing him at the same time of the generous intentions of the Indian Gaston towards his Paris brother which an unhappy chance had frustrated Gaston as you may imagine hurried off to Paris Here is the first ride accounted for During the last five years he had saved fifty thousand francs out of the income you forced him to accept and this sum he invested in the public funds under the names of his two nephews securing them each in this way an income of twelve hundred francs Next he furnished his sister in law s rooms and promised her a quarterly allowance of three thousand francs Here you see the meaning of his dramatic labors and the pleasure caused him by the success of his first play Mme Gaston therefore is no rival of yours and has every right to your name A man of Gaston s sensitive delicacy was bound to keep the affair secret from you knowing as he did your generous nature Nor does he look on what you give him as his own D Arthez read me the letter he had from your husband asking him to be one of the witnesses at his marriage Gaston in this declares that his happiness would have been perfect but for the one drawback of his poverty and indebtedness to you A virgin soul is at the mercy of such scruples Either they make themselves felt or they do not and when they do it is easy to imagine the conflict of feeling and embarrassment to which they give rise Nothing is more natural than Gaston s wish to provide in secret a suitable maintenance for the woman who is his brother s widow and who had herself set aside one hundred thousand francs for him from her own fortune She is a handsome woman warm hearted and extremely well bred but not clever She is a mother and you may be sure I lost my heart to her at first sight when I found her with one child in her arms and the other dressed like a little lord The children first is written in every detail of her house Far from being angry therefore with your beloved husband you should find in all this fresh reason for loving him I have met him and think him the most delightful young fellow in Paris Yes dear child when I saw him I had no difficulty in understanding that a woman might lose her head about him his soul is mirrored in his countenance If I were you I should settle the widow and her children at the chalet in a pretty little cottage which you could have built for them and adopt the boys Be at peace then dear soul and plan this little surprise in your turn for Gaston LVI MME GASTON TO THE COMTESSE DE L ESTORADE Ah my dear friend what can I say in answer except the cruel It is too late of that fool Lafayette to his royal master Oh my life my sweet life what physician will give it back to me My own hand has dealt the deathblow Alas have I not been a mere will o the wisp whose twinkling spark was fated to perish before it reached a flame My eyes rain torrents of tears and yet they must not fall when I am with him I fly to him and he seeks me My despair is all within This torture Dante forgot to place in his Inferno Come to see me die LVII THE COMTESSE DE L ESTORADE TO THE COMTE DE L ESTORADE THE CHALET August seventh My love Take the children away to Provence without me I remain with Louise who has only a few days yet to live I cannot leave either her or her husband for whose reason I fear You know the scrap of letter which sent me flying to Ville d Avray picking up the doctors on my way Since then I have not left my darling friend and it has been impossible to write to you for I have sat up every night for a fortnight When I arrived I found her with Gaston in full dress beautiful laughing happy It was a heroic falsehood They were like two lovely children together in their restored confidence For a moment I was deceived like Gaston by the effrontery but Louise pressed my hand whispering He must not know I am dying An icy chill fell over me as I felt her burning hand and saw the red spots on her cheeks I congratulated myself on my prudence in leaving the doctors in the wood till they should be sent for Leave us for a little she said to Gaston Two women who have not met for five years have plenty of secrets to talk over and Renee I have no doubt has things to confide in me Directly we were alone she flung herself into my arms unable longer to restrain her tears Tell me about it I said I have brought with me in case of need the best surgeon and the best physician from the hospital and Bianchon as well there are four altogether Ah she cried have them in at once if they can save me if there is still time The passion which hurried me to death now cries for life But what have you done to yourself I have in a few days brought myself to the last stage of consumption But how I got myself into a profuse perspiration in the night and then ran out and lay down by the side of the lake in the dew Gaston thinks I have a cold and I am dying Send him to Paris I will fetch the doctors myself I said as I rushed out wildly to the spot where I had left them Alas my love after the consultation was over not one of the doctors gave me the least hope they all believe that Louise will die with the fall of the leaves The dear child s constitution has wonderfully helped the success of her plan It seems she has a predisposition to this complaint and though in the ordinary course she might have lived a long time a few days folly has made the case desperate I cannot tell you what I felt on hearing this sentence based on such clear explanations You know that I have lived in Louise as much as in my own life I was simply crushed and could not stir to escort to the door these harbingers of evil I don t know how long I remained lost in bitter thoughts the tears running down my cheeks when I was roused from my stupor by the words So there is no hope for me in a clear angelic voice It was Louise with her hand on my shoulder She made me get up and carried me off to her small drawing room With a beseeching glance she went on Stay with me to the end I won t have doleful faces round me Above all I must keep the truth from him I know that I have the strength to do it I am full of youth and spirit and can die standing For myself I have no regrets I am dying as I wished to die still young and beautiful in the perfection of my womanhood As for him I can see very well now that I should have made his life miserable Passion has me in its grips like a struggling fawn impatient of the toils My groundless jealousy has already wounded him sorely When the day came that my suspicions met only indifference which in the long run is the rightful meed of all jealousy well that would have been my death I have had my share of life There are people whose names on the muster roll of the world show sixty years of service and yet in all that time they have not had two years of real life whilst my record of thirty is doubled by the intensity of my love Thus for him as well as for me the close is a happy one But between us dear Renee it is different You lose a loving sister and that is a loss which nothing can repair You alone here have the right to mourn my death After a long pause during which I could only see her through a mist of tears she continued The moral of my death is a cruel one My dear doctor in petticoats was right marriage cannot rest upon passion as its foundation nor even upon love How fine and noble is your life keeping always to the one safe road you give your husband an ever growing affection while the passionate eagerness with which I threw myself into wedded life was bound in nature to diminish Twice have I gone astray and twice has Death stretched forth his bony hand to strike my happiness The first time he robbed me of the noblest and most devoted of men now it is my turn the grinning monster tears me from the arms of my poet husband with all his beauty and his grace Yet I would not complain Have I not known in turn two men each the very pattern of nobility one in mind the other in outward form In Felipe the soul dominated and transformed the body in Gaston one could not say which was supreme heart mind or grace of form I die adored what more could I wish for Time perhaps in which to draw near the God of whom I may have too little thought My spirit will take its flight towards Him full of love and with the prayer that some day in the world above He will unite me once more to the two who made a heaven of my life below Without them paradise would be a desert to me To others my example would be fatal for mine was no common lot To meet a Felipe or a Gaston is more than mortals can expect and therefore the doctrine of society in regard to marriage accords with the natural law Woman is weak and in marrying she ought to make an entire sacrifice of her will to the man who in return should lay his selfishness at her feet The stir which women of late years have created by their whining and insubordination is ridiculous and only shows how well we deserve the epithet of children bestowed by philosophers on our sex She continued talking thus in the gentle voice you know so well uttering the gravest truths in the prettiest manner until Gaston entered bringing with him his sister in law the two children and the English nurse whom at Louise s request he had been to fetch from Paris Here are the pretty instruments of my torture she said as her nephews approached Was not the mistake excusable What a wonderful likeness to their uncle She was most friendly to Mme Gaston the elder and begged that she would look upon the chalet as her home in short she played the hostess to her in her best de Chaulieu manner in which no one can rival her I wrote at once to the Duc and Duchesse de Chaulieu the Duc de Rhetore and the Duc de Lenoncourt Givry as well as to Madeleine It was time Next day Louise worn out with so much exertion was unable to go out indeed she only got up for dinner In the course of the evening Madeleine de Lenoncourt her two brothers and her mother arrived The coolness which Louise s second marriage had caused between herself and her family disappeared Every day since that evening Louise s father and both her brothers have ridden over in the morning and the two duchesses spend all their evenings at the chalet Death unites as well as separates it silences all paltry feeling Louise is perfection in her charm her grace her good sense her wit and her tenderness She has retained to the last that perfect tact for which she has been so famous and she lavishes on us the treasures of her brilliant mind which made her one of the queens of Paris I should like to look well even in my coffin she said with her matchless smile as she lay down on the bed where she was to linger for a fortnight Her room has nothing of the sick chamber in it medicines ointments the whole apparatus of nursing is carefully concealed Is not my deathbed pretty she said to the Sevres priest who came to confess her We gloated over her like misers All this anxiety and the terrible truths which dawned on him have prepared Gaston for the worst He is full of courage but the blow has gone home It would not surprise me to see him follow his wife in the natural course Yesterday as we were walking round the lake he said to me I must be a father to those two children and he pointed to his sister in law who was taking the boys for a walk But though I shall do nothing to hasten my end I want your promise that you will be a second mother to them and will persuade your husband to accept the office of guardian which I shall depute to him in conjunction with my sister in law He said this quite simply like a man who knows he is not long for this world He has smiles on his face to meet Louise s and it is only I whom he does not deceive He is a mate for her in courage Louise has expressed a wish to see her godson but I am not sorry he should be in Provence she might want to remember him generously and I should be in a great difficulty Good bye my love August twenty fifth her birthday Yesterday evening Louise was delirious for a short time but her delirium was the prettiest babbling which shows that even the madness of gifted people is not that of fools or nobodies In a mere thread of a voice she sang some Italian airs from I Puritani La Sonnambula Moise while we stood round the bed in silence Not one of us not even the Duc de Rhetore had dry eyes so clear was it to us all that her soul was in this fashion passing from us She could no longer see us Yet she was there still in the charm of the faint melody with its sweetness not of this earth During the night the death agony began It is now seven in the morning and I have just myself raised her from bed Some flicker of strength revived she wished to sit by her window and asked for Gaston s hand And then my love the sweetest spirit whom we shall ever see on this earth departed leaving us the empty shell The last sacrament had been administered the evening before unknown to Gaston who was taking a snatch of sleep during this agonizing ceremony and after she was moved to the window she asked me to read her the De Profundis in French while she was thus face to face with the lovely scene which was her handiwork She repeated the words after me to herself and pressed the hands of her husband who knelt on the other side of the chair August twenty sixth My heart is broken I have just seen her in her winding sheet her face is quite pale now with purple shadows Oh I want my children my children Bring me my children THE END ADDENDUM The following
