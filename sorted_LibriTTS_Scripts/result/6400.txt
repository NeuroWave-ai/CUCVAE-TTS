of a Roman knight who commanded a legion on the side of Otho at the battle which decided the fate of the empire in favour of Vitellius From incidental notices in the following History we learn that he was born towards the close of the reign of Vespasian who died in the year seventy nine of the Christian era He lived till the time of Hadrian under whose administration he filled the office of secretary until with several others he was dismissed for presuming on familiarities with the empress Sabina of which we have no further account than that they were unbecoming his position in the imperial court How long he survived this disgrace which appears to have befallen him in the year one hundred twenty one we are not informed but we find that the leisure afforded him by his retirement was employed in the composition of numerous works of which the only portions now extant are collected in the present volume Several of the younger Pliny s letters are addressed to Suetonius with whom he lived in the closest friendship They afford some brief but generally pleasant glimpses of his habits and career and in a letter in which Pliny makes application on behalf of his friend to the emperor Trajan for a mark of favour he speaks of him as a most excellent honourable and learned man whom he had the pleasure of entertaining under his own roof and with whom the nearer he was brought into communion the more he loved him one The plan adopted by Suetonius in his Lives of the Twelve Caesars led him to be more diffuse on their personal conduct and habits than on public events He writes Memoirs rather than History He neither dwells on the civil wars which sealed the fall of the Republic nor on the military expeditions which extended the frontiers of the empire nor does he attempt to develop the causes of the great political changes which marked the period of which he treats When we stop to gaze in a museum or gallery on the antique busts of the Caesars we perhaps endeavour to trace in their sculptured physiognomy the characteristics of those princes who for good or evil were in their times masters of the destinies of a large portion of the human race The pages of Suetonius will amply gratify this natural curiosity In them we find a series of individual portraits sketched to the life with perfect truth and rigorous impartiality La Harpe remarks of Suetonius He is scrupulously exact and strictly methodical He omits nothing which concerns the person whose life he is writing he relates everything but paints nothing His work is in some sense a collection of anecdotes but it is very curious to read and consult two Combining as it does amusement and information Suetonius s Lives of the Caesars was held in such estimation that so soon after the invention of printing as the year fifteen hundred no fewer than eighteen editions had been published and nearly one hundred have since been added to the number Critics of the highest rank have devoted themselves to the task of correcting and commenting on the text and the work has been translated into most European languages Of the English translations that of doctor Alexander Thomson published in seventeen ninety six has been made the basis of the present He informs us in his Preface that a version of Suetonius was with him only a secondary object his principal design being to form a just estimate of Roman literature and to elucidate the state of government and the manners of the times for which the work of Suetonius seemed a fitting vehicle doctor Thomson s remarks appended to each successive reign are reprinted nearly verbatim in the present edition His translation however was very diffuse and retained most of the inaccuracies of that of Clarke on which it was founded considerable care therefore has been bestowed in correcting it with the view of producing as far as possible a literal and faithful version To render the works of Suetonius as far as they are extant complete his Lives of eminent Grammarians Rhetoricians and Poets of which a translation has not before appeared in English are added These Lives abound with anecdote and curious information connected with learning and literary men during the period of which the author treats T F CONTENTS I LIVES OF THE TWELVE CAESARS one Julius Caesar two Augustus three Tiberius four Caligula five Claudius six Nero seven Galba

one THE TWELVE CAESARS CAIUS JULIUS CASAR I Julius Caesar the Divine three lost his father four when he was in the sixteenth year of his age five and the year following being nominated to the office of high priest of Jupiter six he repudiated Cossutia who was very wealthy although her family belonged only to the equestrian order and to whom he had been contracted when he was a mere boy He then married two Cornelia the daughter of Cinna who was four times consul and had by her shortly afterwards a daughter named Julia Resisting all the efforts of the dictator Sylla to induce him to divorce Cornelia he suffered the penalty of being stripped of his sacerdotal office his wife s dowry and his own patrimonial estates and being identified with the adverse faction seven was compelled to withdraw from Rome After changing his place of concealment nearly every night eight although he was suffering from a quartan ague and having effected his release by bribing the officers who had tracked his footsteps he at length obtained a pardon through the intercession of the vestal virgins and of Mamercus Aemilius and Aurelius Cotta his near relatives We are assured that when Sylla having withstood for a while the entreaties of his own best friends persons of distinguished rank at last yielded to their importunity he exclaimed either by a divine impulse or from a shrewd conjecture Your suit is granted and you may take him among you but know he added that this man for whose safety you are so extremely anxious will some day or other be the ruin of the party of the nobles in defence of which you are leagued with me for in this one Caesar you will find many a Marius II His first campaign was served in Asia on the staff of the praetor M Thermus and being dispatched into Bithynia nine to bring thence a fleet he loitered so long at the court of Nicomedes as to give occasion to reports of a criminal intercourse between him and that prince which received additional credit from his hasty return to Bithynia under the pretext of recovering a debt due to a freed man his client The rest of his service was more favourable to his reputation and three when Mitylene ten was taken by storm he was presented by Thermus with the civic crown eleven III He served also in Cilicia twelve under Servilius Isauricus but only for a short time as upon receiving intelligence of Sylla s death he returned with all speed to Rome in expectation of what might follow from a fresh agitation set on foot by Marcus Lepidus Distrusting however the abilities of this leader and finding the times less favourable for the execution of this project than he had at first imagined he abandoned all thoughts of joining Lepidus although he received the most tempting offers IV Soon after this civil discord was composed he preferred a charge of extortion against Cornelius Dolabella a man of consular dignity who had obtained the honour of a triumph On the acquittal of the accused he resolved to retire to Rhodes thirteen with the view not only of avoiding the public odium four which he had incurred but of prosecuting his studies with leisure and tranquillity under Apollonius the son of Molon at that time the most celebrated master of rhetoric While on his voyage thither in the winter season he was taken by pirates near the island of Pharmacusa fourteen and detained by them burning with indignation for nearly forty days his only attendants being a physician and two chamberlains For he had instantly dispatched his other servants and the friends who accompanied him to raise money for his ransom fifteen Fifty talents having been paid down he was landed on the coast when having collected some ships sixteen he lost no time in putting to sea in pursuit of the pirates and having captured them inflicted upon them the punishment with which he had often threatened them in jest At that time Mithridates was ravaging the neighbouring districts and on Caesar s arrival at Rhodes that he might not appear to lie idle while danger threatened the allies of Rome he passed over into Asia and having collected some auxiliary forces and driven the king s governor out of the province retained in their allegiance the cities which were wavering and ready to revolt V Having been elected military tribune the first honour he received from the suffrages of the people after his return to Rome he zealously assisted those who took measures for restoring the tribunitian authority which had been greatly diminished during the usurpation of Sylla He likewise by an act which Plotius at his suggestion propounded to the people obtained the recall of Lucius Cinna his wife s brother and others with him who having been the adherents of Lepidus in the civil disturbances had after that consul s death fled to Sertorius seventeen which law he supported by a speech VI During his quaestorship he pronounced funeral orations from the rostra according to custom in praise of his aunt five Julia and his wife Cornelia In the panegyric on his aunt he gives the following account of her own and his father s genealogy on both sides My aunt Julia derived her descent by the mother from a race of kings and by her father from the Immortal Gods For the Marcii Reges eighteen her mother s family deduce their pedigree from Ancus Marcius and the Julii her father s from Venus of which stock we are a branch We therefore unite in our descent the sacred majesty of kings the chiefest among men and the divine majesty of Gods to whom kings themselves are subject To supply the place of Cornelia he married Pompeia the daughter of Quintus Pompeius and grand daughter of Lucius Sylla but he afterwards divorced her upon suspicion of her having been debauched by Publius Clodius For so current was the report that Clodius had found access to her disguised as a woman during the celebration of a religious solemnity nineteen that the senate instituted an enquiry respecting the profanation of the sacred rites VII Farther Spain twenty fell to his lot as quaestor when there as he was going the circuit of the province by commission from the praetor for the administration of justice and had reached Gades seeing a statue of Alexander the Great in the temple of Hercules he sighed deeply as if weary of his sluggish life for having performed no memorable actions at an age twenty one at which Alexander had already conquered the world He therefore immediately sued for his discharge with the view of embracing the first opportunity which might present itself in The City of entering upon a more exalted career In the stillness of the night following he dreamt that he lay with his own mother but his confusion was relieved and his hopes were raised to the highest pitch by the interpreters of his dream who expounded it as an omen that he should possess universal empire for six that the mother who in his sleep he had found submissive to his embraces was no other than the earth the common parent of all mankind VIII Quitting therefore the province before the expiration of the usual term he betook himself to the Latin colonies which were then eagerly agitating the design of obtaining the freedom of Rome and he would have stirred them up to some bold attempt had not the consuls to prevent any commotion detained for some time the legions which had been raised for service in Cilicia But this did not deter him from making soon afterwards a still greater effort within the precincts of the city itself IX For only a few days before he entered upon the aedileship he incurred a suspicion of having engaged in a conspiracy with Marcus Crassus a man of consular rank to whom were joined Publius Sylla and Lucius Autronius who after they had been chosen consuls were convicted of bribery The plan of the conspirators was to fall upon the senate at the opening of the new year and murder as many of them as should be thought necessary upon which Crassus was to assume the office of dictator and appoint Caesar his master of the horse twenty two When the commonwealth had been thus ordered according to their pleasure the consulship was to have been restored to Sylla and Autronius Mention is made of this plot by Tanusius Geminus twenty three in his history by Marcus Bibulus in his edicts twenty four and by Curio the father in his orations twenty five Cicero likewise seems to hint at this in a letter to Axius where he says that Caesar seven had in his consulship secured to himself that arbitrary power twenty six to which he had aspired when he was edile Tanusius adds that Crassus from remorse or fear did not appear upon the day appointed for the massacre of the senate for which reason Caesar omitted to give the signal which according to the plan concerted between them he was to have made The agreement Curio says was that he should shake off the toga from his shoulder We have the authority of the same Curio and of M Actorius Naso for his having been likewise concerned in another conspiracy with young Cneius Piso to whom upon a suspicion of some mischief being meditated in the city the province of Spain was decreed out of the regular course twenty seven It is said to have been agreed between them that Piso should head a revolt in the provinces whilst the other should attempt to stir up an insurrection at Rome using as their instruments the Lambrani and the tribes beyond the Po But the execution of this design was frustrated in both quarters by the death of Piso X In his aedileship he not only embellished the Comitium and the rest of the Forum twenty eight with the adjoining halls twenty nine but adorned the Capitol also with temporary piazzas constructed for the purpose of displaying some part of the superabundant collections eight he had made for the amusement of the people thirty He entertained them with the hunting of wild beasts and with games both alone and in conjunction with his colleague On this account he obtained the whole credit of the expense to which they had jointly contributed insomuch that his colleague Marcus Bibulus could not forbear remarking that he was served in the manner of Pollux For as the temple thirty one erected in the Forum to the two brothers went by the name of Castor alone so his and Caesar s joint munificence was imputed to the latter only To the other public spectacles exhibited to the people Caesar added a fight of gladiators but with fewer pairs of combatants than he had intended For he had collected from all parts so great a company of them that his enemies became alarmed and a decree was made restricting the number of gladiators which any one was allowed to retain at Rome XI Having thus conciliated popular favour he endeavoured through his interest with some of the tribunes to get Egypt assigned to him as a province by an act of the people The pretext alleged for the creation of this extraordinary government was that the Alexandrians had violently expelled their king thirty two whom the senate had complimented with the title of an ally and friend of the Roman people This was generally resented but notwithstanding there was so much opposition from the faction of the nobles that he could not carry his point In order therefore to diminish their influence by every means in his power he restored the trophies erected in honour of Caius Marius on account of his victories over Jugurtha the Cimbri and the Teutoni which had been demolished by Sylla and when sitting in judgment upon murderers he treated those as assassins who in the late proscription had received money from the treasury for bringing in the heads of Roman citizens although they were expressly excepted in the Cornelian laws XII He likewise suborned some one to prefer an impeachment nine for treason against Caius Rabirius by whose especial assistance the senate had a few years before put down Lucius Saturninus the seditious tribune and being drawn by lot a judge on the trial he condemned him with so much animosity that upon his appealing to the people no circumstance availed him so much as the extraordinary bitterness of his judge XIII Having renounced all hope of obtaining Egypt for his province he stood candidate for the office of chief pontiff to secure which he had recourse to the most profuse bribery Calculating on this occasion the enormous amount of the debts he had contracted he is reported to have said to his mother when she kissed him at his going out in the morning to the assembly of the people I will never return home unless I am elected pontiff In effect he left so far behind him two most powerful competitors who were much his superiors both in age and rank that he had more votes in their own tribes than they both had in all the tribes together XIV After he was chosen praetor the conspiracy of Catiline was discovered and while every other member of the senate voted for inflicting capital punishment on the accomplices in that crime thirty three he alone proposed that the delinquents should be distributed for safe custody among the towns of Italy their property being confiscated He even struck such terror into those who were advocates for greater severity by representing to them what universal odium would be attached to their memories by the Roman people that Decius Silanus consul elect did not hesitate to qualify his proposal it not being very honourable to change it by a lenient interpretation as if it had been understood in a harsher sense than he intended and Caesar would certainly have carried his point having brought over to his side a great number of the senators among whom was Cicero the consul s brother had not a speech by Marcus Cato infused new vigour into the resolutions of the senate He persisted however in obstructing the measure until a body of the Roman knights who stood under arms as a guard threatened him with instant death if he continued his determined opposition They even thrust at him with their drawn swords so that those who sat next him moved away ten and a few friends with no small difficulty protected him by throwing their arms round him and covering him with their togas At last deterred by this violence he not only gave way but absented himself from the senate house during the remainder of that year XV Upon the first day of his praetorship he summoned Quintus Catulus to render an account to the people respecting the repairs of the Capitol thirty four proposing a decree for transferring the office of curator to another person thirty five But being unable to withstand the strong opposition made by the aristocratical party whom he perceived quitting in great numbers their attendance upon the new consuls thirty six and fully resolved to resist his proposal he dropped the design XVI He afterwards approved himself a most resolute supporter of Caecilius Metullus tribune of the people who in spite of all opposition from his colleagues had proposed some laws of a violent tendency thirty seven until they were both dismissed from office by a vote of the senate He ventured notwithstanding to retain his post and continue in the administration of justice but finding that preparations were made to obstruct him by force of arms he dismissed the lictors threw off his gown and betook himself privately to his own house with the resolution of being quiet in a time so unfavourable to his interests He likewise pacified the mob which two days afterwards flocked about him and in a riotous manner made a voluntary tender of their assistance in the vindication of his eleven honour This happening contrary to expectation the senate who met in haste on account of the tumult gave him their thanks by some of the leading members of the house and sending for him after high commendation of his conduct cancelled their former vote and restored him to his office XVII But he soon got into fresh trouble being named amongst the accomplices of Catiline both before Novius Niger the quaestor by Lucius Vettius the informer and in the senate by Quintus Curius to whom a reward had been voted for having first discovered the designs of the conspirators Curius affirmed that he had received his information from Catiline Vettius even engaged to produce in evidence against him his own hand writing given to Catiline Caesar feeling that this treatment was not to be borne appealed to Cicero himself whether he had not voluntarily made a discovery to him of some particulars of the conspiracy and so baulked Curius of his expected reward He therefore obliged Vettius to give pledges for his behaviour seized his goods and after heavily fining him and seeing him almost torn in pieces before the rostra threw him into prison to which he likewise sent Novius the quaestor for having presumed to take an information against a magistrate of superior authority XVIII At the expiration of his praetorship he obtained by lot the Farther Spain thirty eight and pacified his creditors who were for detaining him by finding sureties for his debts thirty nine Contrary however to both law and custom he took his departure before the usual equipage and outfit were prepared It is uncertain whether this precipitancy arose from the apprehension of an impeachment with which he was threatened on the expiration of his former office or from his anxiety to lose no time in relieving the allies who implored him to come to their aid He had no twelve sooner established tranquillity in the province than without waiting for the arrival of his successor he returned to Rome with equal haste to sue for a triumph forty and the consulship The day of election however being already fixed by proclamation he could not legally be admitted a candidate unless he entered the city as a private person forty one On this emergency he solicited a suspension of the laws in his favour but such an indulgence being strongly opposed he found himself under the necessity of abandoning all thoughts of a triumph lest he should be disappointed of the consulship XIX Of the two other competitors for the consulship Lucius Luceius and Marcus Bibulus he joined with the former upon condition that Luceius being a man of less interest but greater affluence should promise money to the electors in their joint names Upon which the party of the nobles dreading how far he might carry matters in that high office with a colleague disposed to concur in and second his measures advised Bibulus to promise the voters as much as the other and most of them contributed towards the expense Cato himself admitting that bribery under such circumstances was for the public good forty two He was accordingly elected consul jointly with Bibulus Actuated still by the same motives the prevailing party took care to assign provinces of small importance to the new consuls such as the care of the woods and roads Caesar incensed at this indignity endeavoured by the most assiduous and flattering attentions to gain to his side Cneius Pompey at that time dissatisfied with the senate for the backwardness they shewed to confirm his acts after his victories over Mithridates He likewise brought about a reconciliation between Pompey and Marcus Crassus who had been at variance from thirteen the time of their joint consulship in which office they were continually clashing and he entered into an agreement with both that nothing should be transacted in the government which was displeasing to any of the three XX Having entered upon his office forty three he introduced a new regulation that the daily acts both of the senate and people should be committed to writing and published forty four He also revived an old custom that an officer forty five should precede him and his lictors follow him on the alternate months when the fasces were not carried before him Upon preferring a bill to the people for the division of some public lands he was opposed by his colleague whom he violently drove out of the forum Next day the insulted consul made a complaint in the senate of this treatment but such was the consternation that no one having the courage to bring the matter forward or move a censure which had been often done under outrages of less importance he was so much dispirited that until the expiration of his office he never stirred from home and did nothing but issue edicts to obstruct his colleague s proceedings From that time therefore Caesar had the sole management of public affairs insomuch that some wags when they signed any instrument as witnesses did not add in the consulship of Caesar and Bibulus but of Julius and Caesar putting the same person down twice under his name and surname The following verses likewise were currently repeated on this occasion Non Bibulo quidquam nuper sed Caesare factum est Nam Bibulo fieri consule nil memini Nothing was done in Bibulus s year No Caesar only then was consul here fourteen The land of Stellas consecrated by our ancestors to the gods with some other lands in Campania left subject to tribute for the support of the expenses of the government he divided but not by lot among upwards of twenty thousand freemen who had each of them three or more children He eased the publicans upon their petition of a third part of the sum which they had engaged to pay into the public treasury and openly admonished them not to bid so extravagantly upon the next occasion He made various profuse grants to meet the wishes of others no one opposing him or if any such attempt was made it was soon suppressed Marcus Cato who interrupted him in his proceedings he ordered to be dragged out of the senate house by a lictor and carried to prison Lucius Lucullus likewise for opposing him with some warmth he so terrified with the apprehension of being criminated that to deprecate the consul s resentment he fell on his knees And upon Cicero s lamenting in some trial the miserable condition of the times he the very same day by nine o clock transferred his enemy Publius Clodius from a patrician to a plebeian family a change which he had long solicited in vain forty six At last effectually to intimidate all those of the opposite party he by great rewards prevailed upon Vettius to declare that he had been solicited by certain persons to assassinate Pompey and when he was brought before the rostra to name those who had been concerted between them after naming one or two to no purpose not without great suspicion of subornation Caesar despairing of success in this rash stratagem is supposed to have taken off his informer by poison XXI About the same time he married Calpurnia the daughter of Lucius Piso who was to succeed him in the consulship and gave his own daughter Julia to Cneius Pompey rejecting Servilius Caepio to whom she had been contracted and by whose means chiefly he had but a little before baffled Bibulus After this new alliance he began upon any debates in the senate to ask Pompey s opinion first whereas he used before to give that distinction to Marcus Crassus and it was fifteen the usual practice for the consul to observe throughout the year the method of consulting the senate which he had adopted on the calends the first of January XXII Being therefore now supported by the interest of his father in law and son in law of all the provinces he made choice of Gaul as most likely to furnish him with matter and occasion for triumphs At first indeed he received only Cisalpine Gaul with the addition of Illyricum by a decree proposed by Vatinius to the people but soon afterwards obtained from the senate Gallia Comata forty seven also the senators being apprehensive that if they should refuse it him that province also would be granted him by the people Elated now with his success he could not refrain from boasting a few days afterwards in a full senate house that he had in spite of his enemies and to their great mortification obtained all he desired and that for the future he would make them to their shame submissive to his pleasure One of the senators observing sarcastically That will not be very easy for a woman forty eight to do he jocosely replied Semiramis formerly reigned in Assyria and the Amazons possessed great part of Asia XXIII When the term of his consulship had expired upon a motion being made in the senate by Caius Memmius and Lucius Domitius the praetors respecting the transactions of the year past he offered to refer himself to the house but sixteen they declining the business after three days spent in vain altercation he set out for his province Immediately however his quaestor was charged with several misdemeanors for the purpose of implicating Caesar himself Indeed an accusation was soon after preferred against him by Lucius Antistius tribune of the people but by making an appeal to the tribune s colleagues he succeeded in having the prosecution suspended during his absence in the service of the state To secure himself therefore for the time to come he was particularly careful to secure the good will of the magistrates at the annual elections assisting none of the candidates with his interest nor suffering any persons to be advanced to any office who would not positively undertake to defend him in his absence for which purpose he made no scruple to require of some of them an oath and even a written obligation XXIV But when Lucius Domitius became a candidate for the consulship and openly threatened that upon his being elected consul he would effect that which he could not accomplish when he was praetor and divest him of the command of the armies he sent for Crassus and Pompey to Lucca a city in his province and pressed them for the purpose of disappointing Domitius to sue again for the consulship and to continue him in his command for five years longer with both which requisitions they complied Presumptuous now from his success he added at his own private charge more legions to those which he had received from the republic among the former of which was one levied in Transalpine Gaul and called by a Gallic name Alauda forty nine which he trained and armed in the Roman fashion and afterwards conferred on it the freedom of the city From this period he declined no occasion of war however unjust and dangerous attacking without any provocation as well the allies of Rome as the barbarous nations which were its enemies insomuch that the senate passed a decree for sending commissioners to examine into the condition of Gaul and some members even proposed that he should be delivered up to the enemy But so great had been the success of his enterprises that he had the honour of obtaining more days fifty seventeen of supplication and those more frequently than had ever before been decreed to any commander XXV During nine years in which he held the government of the province his achievements were as follows he reduced all Gaul bounded by the Pyrenean forest the Alps mount Gebenna and the two rivers the Rhine and the Rhone and being about three thousand two hundred miles in compass into the form of a province excepting only the nations in alliance with the republic and such as had merited his favour imposing upon this new acquisition an annual tribute of forty millions of sesterces He was the first of the Romans who crossing the Rhine by a bridge attacked the Germanic tribes inhabiting the country beyond that river whom he defeated in several engagements He also invaded the Britons a people formerly unknown and having vanquished them exacted from them contributions and hostages Amidst such a series of successes he experienced thrice only any signal disaster once in Britain when his fleet was nearly wrecked in a storm in Gaul at Gergovia where one of his legions was put to the rout and in the territory of the Germans his lieutenants Titurius and Aurunculeius were cut off by an ambuscade XXVI During this period fifty one he lost his mother fifty two whose death was followed by that of his daughter fifty three and not long afterwards of his granddaughter Meanwhile the republic being in consternation at the murder of Publius Clodius and the senate passing a vote that only one consul namely Cneius Pompeius should be chosen for the ensuing year he prevailed with the tribunes of the people who intended joining him in nomination with Pompey to propose to the people a bill enabling him though absent to become a candidate for his second consulship when the term of his command should be near expiring that he might not be obliged on that account to quit his province too soon and before the conclusion of the war Having attained this object carrying his views still higher and animated with the hopes of success he omitted no eighteen opportunity of gaining universal favour by acts of liberality and kindness to individuals both in public and private With money raised from the spoils of the war he began to construct a new forum the ground plot of which cost him above a hundred millions of sesterces fifty four He promised the people a public entertainment of gladiators and a feast in memory of his daughter such as no one before him had ever given The more to raise their expectations on this occasion although he had agreed with victuallers of all denominations for his feast he made yet farther preparations in private houses He issued an order that the most celebrated gladiators if at any time during the combat they incurred the displeasure of the public should be immediately carried off by force and reserved for some future occasion Young gladiators he trained up not in the school and by the masters of defence but in the houses of Roman knights and even senators skilled in the use of arms earnestly requesting them as appears from his letters to undertake the discipline of those novitiates and to give them the word during their exercises He doubled the pay of the legions in perpetuity allowing them likewise corn when it was in plenty without any restriction and sometimes distributing to every soldier in his army a slave and a portion of land XXVII To maintain his alliance and good understanding with Pompey he offered him in marriage his sister s grand daughter Octavia who had been married to Caius Marcellus and requested for himself his daughter lately contracted to Faustus Sylla Every person about him and a great part likewise of the senate he secured by loans of money at low interest or none at all and to all others who came to wait upon him either by invitation or of their own accord he made liberal presents not neglecting even the freed men and slaves who were favourites with their masters and patrons He offered also singular and ready aid to all who were under prosecution or in debt and to prodigal youths excluding from nineteen his bounty those only who were so deeply plunged in guilt poverty or luxury that it was impossible effectually to relieve them These he openly declared could derive no benefit from any other means than a civil war XXVIII He endeavoured with equal assiduity to engage in his interest princes and provinces in every part of the world presenting some with thousands of captives and sending to others the assistance of troops at whatever time and place they desired without any authority from either the senate or people of Rome He likewise embellished with magnificent public buildings the most powerful cities not only of Italy Gaul and Spain but of Greece and Asia until all people being now astonished and speculating on the obvious tendency of these proceedings Claudius Marcellus the consul declaring first by proclamation that he intended to propose a measure of the utmost importance to the state made a motion in the senate that some person should be appointed to succeed Caesar in his province before the term of his command was expired because the war being brought to a conclusion peace was restored and the victorious army ought to be disbanded He further moved that Caesar being absent his claims to be a candidate at the next election of consuls should not be admitted as Pompey himself had afterwards abrogated that privilege by a decree of the people The fact was that Pompey in his law relating to the choice of chief magistrates had forgot to except Caesar in the article in which he declared all such as were not present incapable of being candidates for any office but soon afterwards when the law was inscribed on brass and deposited in the treasury he corrected his mistake Marcellus not content with depriving Caesar of his provinces and the privilege intended him by Pompey likewise moved the senate that the freedom of the city should be taken from those colonists whom by the Vatinian law he had settled at New Como fifty five because it had been conferred upon them with ambitious views and by a stretch of the laws twenty XXIX Roused by these proceedings and thinking as he was often heard to say that it would be a more difficult enterprise to reduce him now that he was the chief man in the state from the first rank of citizens to the second than from the second to the lowest of all Caesar made a vigorous opposition to the measure partly by means of the tribunes who interposed in his behalf and partly through Servius Sulpicius the other consul The following year likewise when Caius Marcellus who succeeded his cousin Marcus in the consulship pursued the same course Caesar by means of an immense bribe engaged in his defence Aemilius Paulus the other consul and Caius Curio the most violent of the tribunes But finding the opposition obstinately bent against him and that the consuls elect were also of that party he wrote a letter to the senate requesting that they would not deprive him of the privilege kindly granted him by the people or else that the other generals should resign the command of their armies as well as himself fully persuaded as it is thought that he could more easily collect his veteran soldiers whenever he pleased than Pompey could his new raised troops At the same time he made his adversaries an offer to disband eight of his legions and give up Transalpine Gaul upon condition that he might retain two legions with the Cisalpine province or but one legion with Illyricum until he should be elected consul XXX But as the senate declined to interpose in the business and his enemies declared that they would enter into no compromise where the safety of the republic was at stake he advanced into Hither Gaul fifty six and having gone the circuit for the administration of justice made a halt at Ravenna resolved to have recourse to arms if the senate should proceed to extremity against the tribunes of the people who had espoused his cause This was indeed his pretext for the civil war but it is supposed that there were other motives for his conduct Cneius Pompey used frequently to say that he sought to throw every thing into confusion because he was unable with all his private wealth to complete the works he had begun and answer at his return the vast expectations which he had excited in the people Others pretend that he was apprehensive of being twenty one called to account for what he had done in his first consulship contrary to the auspices laws and the protests of the tribunes Marcus Cato having sometimes declared and that too with an oath that he would prefer an impeachment against him as soon as he disbanded his army A report likewise prevailed that if he returned as a private person he would like Milo have to plead his cause before the judges surrounded by armed men This conjecture is rendered highly probable by Asinius Pollio who informs us that Caesar upon viewing the vanquished and slaughtered enemy in the field of Pharsalia expressed himself in these very words This was their intention I Caius Caesar after all the great achievements I had performed must have been condemned had I not summoned the army to my aid Some think that having contracted from long habit an extraordinary love of power and having weighed his own and his enemies strength he embraced that occasion of usurping the supreme power which indeed he had coveted from the time of his youth This seems to have been the opinion entertained by Cicero who tells us in the third book of his Offices that Caesar used to have frequently in his mouth two verses of Euripides which he thus translates Nam si violandum est jus regnandi gratia Violandum est aliis rebus pietatem colas Be just unless a kingdom tempts to break the laws For sovereign power alone can justify the cause fifty seven XXXI When intelligence therefore was received that the interposition of the tribunes in his favour had been utterly rejected and that they themselves had fled from the city he immediately sent forward some cohorts but privately to prevent any suspicion of his design and to keep up appearances attended at a public spectacle examined the model of a fencing school which he proposed to build and as usual sat down to table with a numerous party of his friends But after sun set mules being put to his carriage from a neighbouring mill he set forward on his journey with all possible privacy and a small retinue The lights going out he lost his way and twenty two wandered about a long time until at length by the help of a guide whom he found towards day break he proceeded on foot through some narrow paths and again reached the road Coming up with his troops on the banks of the Rubicon which was the boundary of his province fifty eight he halted for a while and revolving in his mind the importance of the step he was on the point of taking he turned to those about him and said We may still retreat but if we pass this little bridge nothing is left for us but to fight it out in arms XXXII While he was thus hesitating the following incident occurred A person remarkable for his noble mien and graceful aspect appeared close at hand sitting and playing upon a pipe When not only the shepherds but a number of soldiers also flocked from their posts to listen to him and some trumpeters among them he snatched a trumpet from one of them ran to the river with it and sounding the advance with a piercing blast crossed to the other side Upon this Caesar exclaimed Let us go whither the omens of the Gods and the iniquity of our enemies call us The die is now cast XXXIII Accordingly having marched his army over the river he shewed them the tribunes of the people who upon their being driven from the city had come to meet him and in the presence of that assembly called upon the troops to pledge him their fidelity with tears in his eyes and his garment rent from his bosom It has been supposed that upon this occasion he promised to every soldier a knight s estate but that opinion is founded on a mistake For when in his harangue to them he frequently held out a finger of his left hand and declared that to recompense those who should support him in the defence of his honour he would willingly part even with his ring the soldiers at a distance who could more easily see than hear him while he spoke formed their conception of what he said by the eye not by the ear and accordingly gave out that he had promised to each of them the privilege twenty three of wearing the gold ring and an estate of four hundred thousand sesterces sixty XXXIV Of his subsequent proceedings I shall give a cursory detail in the order in which they occurred sixty one He took possession of Picenum Umbria and Etruria and having obliged Lucius Domitius who had been tumultuously nominated his successor and held Corsinium with a garrison to surrender and dismissed him he marched along the coast of the Upper Sea to Brundusium to which place the consuls and Pompey were fled with the intention of crossing the sea as soon as possible After vain attempts by all the obstacles he could oppose to prevent their leaving the harbour he turned his steps towards Rome where he appealed to the senate on the present state of public affairs and then set out for Spain in which province Pompey had a numerous army under the command of three lieutenants Marcus Petreius Lucius Afranius and Marcus Varro declaring amongst his friends before he set forward That he was going against an army without a general and should return thence against a general without an army Though his progress was retarded both by the siege of Marseilles which shut her gates against him and a very great scarcity of corn yet in a short time he bore down all before him XXXV Thence he returned to Rome and crossing the sea to Macedonia blocked up Pompey during almost four months within a line of ramparts of prodigious extent and at last defeated him in the battle of Pharsalia Pursuing him in his flight to Alexandria where he was informed of his murder he presently found himself also engaged under all the disadvantages of time and place in a very dangerous war with king Ptolemy who he saw had treacherous designs upon his life It was winter and he within the walls of a well provided and subtle enemy was destitute of every thing and wholly unprepared twenty four for such a conflict He succeeded however in his enterprise and put the kingdom of Egypt into the hands of Cleopatra and her younger brother being afraid to make it a province lest under an aspiring prefect it might become the centre of revolt From Alexandria he went into Syria and thence to Pontus induced by intelligence which he had received respecting Pharnaces This prince who was son of the great Mithridates had seized the opportunity which the distraction of the times offered for making war upon his neighbours and his insolence and fierceness had grown with his success Caesar however within five days after entering his country and four hours after coming in sight of him overthrew him in one decisive battle Upon which he frequently remarked to those about him the good fortune of Pompey who had obtained his military reputation chiefly by victory over so feeble an enemy He afterwards defeated Scipio and Juba who were rallying the remains of the party in Africa and Pompey s sons in Spain XXXVI During the whole course of the civil war he never once suffered any defeat except in the case of his lieutenants of whom Caius Curio fell in Africa Caius Antonius was made prisoner in Illyricum Publius Dolabella lost a fleet in the same Illyricum and Cneius Domitius Culvinus an army in Pontus In every encounter with the enemy where he himself commanded he came off with complete success nor was the issue ever doubtful except on two occasions once at Dyrrachium when being obliged to give ground and Pompey not pursuing his advantage he said that Pompey knew not how to conquer the other instance occurred in his last battle in Spain when despairing of the event he even had thoughts of killing himself XXXVII For the victories obtained in the several wars he triumphed five different times after the defeat of Scipio four times in one month each triumph succeeding the former by an interval of a few days and once again after the conquest of Pompey s sons His first and most glorious triumph was for the victories he gained in Gaul the next for that of Alexandria the third for the reduction of Pontus the fourth for his African victory and the last for that in Spain and twenty five they all differed from each other in their varied pomp and pageantry On the day of the Gallic triumph as he was proceeding along the street called Velabrum after narrowly escaping a fall from his chariot by the breaking of the axle tree he ascended the Capitol by torch light forty elephants sixty two carrying torches on his right and left Amongst the pageantry of the Pontic triumph a tablet with this inscription was carried before him I CAME I SAW I CONQUERED sixty three not signifying as other mottos on the like occasion what was done so much as the dispatch with which it was done XXXVIII To every foot soldier in his veteran legions besides the two thousand sesterces paid him in the beginning of the civil war he gave twenty thousand more in the shape of prize money He likewise allotted them lands but not in contiguity that the former owners might not be entirely dispossessed To the people of Rome besides ten modii of corn and as many pounds of oil he gave three hundred sesterces a man which he had formerly promised them and a hundred more to each for the delay in fulfilling his engagement He likewise remitted a year s rent due to the treasury for such houses in Rome as did not pay above two thousand sesterces a year and through the rest of Italy for all such as did not exceed in yearly rent five hundred sesterces To all this he added a public entertainment and a distribution of meat and after his Spanish victory sixty four two public dinners For considering the first he had given as too sparing and unsuited to his profuse liberality he five days afterwards added another which was most plentiful XXXIX The spectacles he exhibited to the people were of various kinds namely a combat of gladiators sixty five and stage plays in the several wards of the city and in different languages likewise Circensian games sixty six wrestlers and the representation of a sea fight In the conflict of gladiators presented in the Forum Furius Leptinus a man of praetorian family entered the lists as a combatant as did also Quintus Calpenus formerly a senator and a pleader of causes The Pyrrhic dance was performed by some youths who were sons to persons of the first distinction in Asia and Bithynia In the plays Decimus Laberius who had been a Roman knight acted in his own piece and being presented on the spot with five hundred thousand sesterces and a gold ring he went from the stage through the orchestra and resumed his place in the seats twenty seven allotted for the equestrian order In the Circensisn games the circus being enlarged at each end and a canal sunk round it several of the young nobility drove chariots drawn some by four and others by two horses and likewise rode races on single horses The Trojan game was acted by two distinct companies of boys one differing from the other in age and rank The hunting of wild beasts was presented for five days successively and on the last day a battle was fought by five hundred foot twenty elephants and thirty horse on each side To afford room for this engagement the goals were removed and in their space two camps were pitched directly opposite to each other Wrestlers likewise performed for three days successively in a stadium provided for the purpose in the Campus Martius A lake having been dug in the little Codeta sixty seven ships of the Tyrian and Egyptian fleets containing two three and four banks of oars with a number of men on board afforded an animated representation of a sea fight To these various diversions there flocked such crowds of spectators from all parts that most of the strangers were obliged to lodge in tents erected in the streets or along the roads near the city Several in the throng were squeezed to death amongst whom were two senators XL Turning afterwards his attention to the regulation of the commonwealth he corrected the calendar sixty eight which had for twenty eight some time become extremely confused through the unwarrantable liberty which the pontiffs had taken in the article of intercalation To such a height had this abuse proceeded that neither the festivals designed for the harvest fell in summer nor those for the vintage in autumn He accommodated the year to the course of the sun ordaining that in future it should consist of three hundred and sixty five days without any intercalary month and that every fourth year an intercalary day should be inserted That the year might thenceforth commence regularly with the calends or first of January he inserted two months between November and December so that the year in which this regulation was made consisted of fifteen months including the month of intercalation which according to the division of time then in use happened that year XLI He filled up the vacancies in the senate by advancing several plebeians to the rank of patricians and also increased the number of praetors aediles quaestors and inferior magistrates restoring at the same time such as had been degraded by the censors or convicted of bribery at elections The choice of magistrates he so divided with the people that excepting only the candidates for the consulship they nominated one half of them and he the other The method which he practised in those cases was to recommend such persons as he had pitched upon by bills dispersed through the several tribes to this effect Caesar the dictator to such a tribe naming it I recommend to you naming likewise the persons that by the favour of your votes they may attain to the honours for which they sue He likewise admitted to offices the sons of those who had been proscribed The trial of causes he restricted to two orders of judges the equestrian and senatorial excluding the tribunes of the treasury who had before made a third class The revised census of the people he ordered to be taken neither in the usual manner or place but street by street by the principal inhabitants of the several quarters of the city and he reduced the number of those who received corn at the public cost from three hundred and twenty to a hundred and fifty thousand To prevent any tumults on account of the census he ordered that the praetor should every year fill up by lot the vacancies occasioned by death from those who were not enrolled for the receipt of corn twenty nine XLII Eighty thousand citizens having been distributed into foreign colonies sixty nine he enacted in order to stop the drain on the population that no freeman of the city above twenty and under forty years of age who was not in the military service should absent himself from Italy for more than three years at a time that no senator s son should go abroad unless in the retinue of some high officer and as to those whose pursuit was tending flocks and herds that no less than a third of the number of their shepherds free born should be youths He likewise made all those who practised physic in Rome and all teachers of the liberal arts free of the city in order to fix them in it and induce others to settle there With respect to debts he disappointed the expectation which was generally entertained that they would be totally cancelled and ordered that the debtors should satisfy their creditors according to the valuation of their estates at the rate at which they were purchased before the commencement of the civil war deducting from the debt what had been paid for interest either in money or by bonds by virtue of which provision about a fourth part of the debt was lost He dissolved all the guilds except such as were of ancient foundation Crimes were punished with greater severity and the rich being more easily induced to commit them because they were only liable to banishment without the forfeiture of their property he stripped murderers as Cicero observes of their whole estates and other offenders of one half XLIII He was extremely assiduous and strict in the administration of justice He expelled from the senate such members as were convicted of bribery and he dissolved the marriage of a man of pretorian rank who had married a lady two days after her divorce from a former husband although there was no suspicion that they had been guilty of any illicit connection He imposed duties on the importation of foreign goods The use of litters for travelling purple robes and jewels he permitted only to persons of a certain age and station and on particular days He enforced a rigid execution of the sumptuary laws placing officers about the markets to seize upon all meats exposed to sale contrary to the rules and bring them to him sometimes sending his lictors and soldiers to thirty carry away such victuals as had escaped the notice of the officers even when they were upon the table XLIV His thoughts were now fully employed from day to day on a variety of great projects for the embellishment and improvement of the city as well as for guarding and extending the bounds of the empire In the first place he meditated the construction of a temple to Mars which should exceed in grandeur every thing of that kind in the world For this purpose he intended to fill up the lake on which he had entertained the people with the spectacle of a sea fight He also projected a most spacious theatre adjacent to the Tarpeian mount and also proposed to reduce the civil law to a reasonable compass and out of that immense and undigested mass of statutes to extract the best and most necessary parts into a few books to make as large a collection as possible of works in the Greek and Latin languages for the public use the province of providing and putting them in proper order being assigned to Marcus Varro He intended likewise to drain the Pomptine marshes to cut a channel for the discharge of the waters of the lake Fucinus to form a road from the Upper Sea through the ridge of the Appenine to the Tiber to make a cut through the isthmus of Corinth to reduce the Dacians who had over run Pontus and Thrace within their proper limits and then to make war upon the Parthians through the Lesser Armenia but not to risk a general engagement with them until he had made some trial of their prowess in war But in the midst of all his undertakings and projects he was carried off by death before I speak of which it may not be improper to give an account of his person dress and manners together with what relates to his pursuits both civil and military XLV It is said that he was tall of a fair complexion round limbed rather full faced with eyes black and piercing and that he enjoyed excellent health except towards the close of his life when he was subject to sudden fainting fits and disturbance in his sleep He was likewise twice seized with the falling sickness while engaged in active service He was so nice in the care of his person that he not only kept the hair of his head closely cut and had his face smoothly shaved but thirty one even caused the hair on other parts of the body to be plucked out by the roots a practice for which some persons rallied him His baldness gave him much uneasiness having often found himself upon that account exposed to the jibes of his enemies He therefore used to bring forward the hair from the crown of his head and of all the honours conferred upon him by the senate and people there was none which he either accepted or used with greater pleasure than the right of wearing constantly a laurel crown It is said that he was particular in his dress For he used the Latus Clavus seventy with fringes about the wrists and always had it girded about him but rather loosely This circumstance gave origin to the expression of Sylla who often advised the nobles to beware of the ill girt boy XLVI He first inhabited a small house in the Suburra seventy one but after his advancement to the pontificate he occupied a palace belonging to the state in the Via Sacra Many writers say that he liked his residence to be elegant and his entertainments sumptuous and that he entirely took down a villa near the grove of Aricia which he had built from the foundation and finished at a vast expense because it did not exactly suit his taste although he had at that time but slender means and was in debt and that he carried about in his expeditions tesselated and marble slabs for the floor of his tent XLVII They likewise report that he invaded Britain in hopes of finding pearls seventy two the size of which he would compare together and ascertain the weight by poising them in his hand that he would purchase at any cost gems carved works statues and pictures executed by the eminent masters of antiquity and that he would give for young and handy slaves a price so extravagant that he forbad its being entered in the diary of his expenses XLVIII We are also told that in the provinces he constantly maintained two tables one for the officers of the army and the gentry of the country and the other for Romans of the highest rank and provincials of the first distinction He was so very exact in the management of his domestic affairs both little and great that he once threw a baker into prison for serving him with a finer sort of bread than his guests and put to death a freed man who was a particular favourite for debauching the lady of a Roman knight although no complaint had been made to him of the affair XLIX The only stain upon his chastity was his having cohabited with Nicomedes and that indeed stuck to him all the days of his life and exposed him to much bitter raillery I will not dwell upon those well known verses of Calvus Licinius Whate er Bithynia and her lord possess d Her lord who Caesar in his lust caress d seventy three I pass over the speeches of Dolabella and Curio the father in which the former calls him the queen s rival and the inner side of the royal couch and the latter the brothel of Nicomedes and the Bithynian stew I would likewise say nothing of the edicts of Bibulus in which he proclaimed his colleague under the name of the queen of Bithynia adding that he had formerly been in love with a king but now coveted a kingdom At which time as Marcus Brutus relates one Octavius a man of a crazy brain and therefore the more free in his raillery after he had in a crowded assembly saluted Pompey by the title of king addressed Caesar by that of queen Caius Memmius likewise upbraided him with serving the king at table among the rest of his catamites in the presence of a large company in which were some merchants from Rome the names of whom he mentions But Cicero was not content with writing in some of his letters that he was conducted by the royal attendants into the king s bed chamber lay upon a bed of gold with a covering of purple and that the youthful bloom of this scion of Venus had been tainted in Bithynia but upon Caesar s pleading the cause of Nysa the daughter of thirty two Nicomedes before the senate and recounting the king s kindnesses to him replied Pray tell us no more of that for it is well known what he gave you and you gave him To conclude his soldiers in the Gallic triumph amongst other verses such as they jocularly sung on those occasions following the general s chariot recited these which since that time have become extremely common The Gauls to Caesar yield Caesar to Nicomede Lo Caesar triumphs for his glorious deed But Caesar s conqueror gains no victor s meed seventy four L It is admitted by all that he was much addicted to women as well as very expensive in his intrigues with them and that he debauched many ladies of the highest quality among whom were Posthumia the wife of Servius Sulpicius Lollia the wife of Aulus Gabinius Tertulla the wife of Marcus Crassus and Mucia the wife of Cneius Pompey For it is certain that the Curios both father and son and many others made it a reproach to Pompey That to gratify his ambition he married the daughter of a man upon whose account he had divorced his wife after having had three children by her and whom he used with a deep sigh to call Aegisthus seventy five But the mistress he most loved was Servilia the mother of Marcus Brutus for whom he purchased in his first consulship after the commencement of their intrigue a pearl which cost him six millions of sesterces and in the civil war besides other presents assigned to her for a trifling consideration some valuable farms when they were exposed to public auction Many persons expressing their surprise at the lowness of the price Cicero wittily remarked To let you know the real value of the purchase between ourselves Tertia was deducted for Servilia was supposed to have prostituted her daughter Tertia to Caesar seventy six thirty four LI That he had intrigues likewise with married women in the provinces appears from this distich which was as much repeated in the Gallic Triumph as the former Watch well your wives ye cits we bring a blade A bald pate master of the wenching trade Thy gold was spent on many a Gallic w e Exhausted now thou com saint to borrow more seventy seven LII In the number of his mistresses were also some queens such as Eunoe a Moor the wife of Bogudes to whom and her husband he made as Naso reports many large presents But his greatest favourite was Cleopatra with whom he often revelled all night until the dawn of day and would have gone with her through Egypt in dalliance as far as Aethiopia in her luxurious yacht had not the army refused to follow him He afterwards invited her to Rome whence he sent her back loaded with honours and presents and gave her permission to call by his name a son who according to the testimony of some Greek historians resembled Caesar both in person and gait Mark Antony declared in the senate that Caesar had acknowledged the child as his own and that Caius Matias Caius Oppius and the rest of Caesar s friends knew it to be true On which occasion Oppius as if it had been an imputation which he was called upon to refute published a book to shew that the child which Cleopatra fathered upon Caesar was not his Helvius Cinna tribune of the people admitted to several persons the fact that he had a bill ready drawn which Caesar had ordered him to get enacted in his absence allowing him with the hope of leaving issue to take any wife he chose and as many of them as he pleased and to leave no room for doubt of his infamous character for unnatural lewdness and adultery Curio the father says in one of his speeches He was every woman s man and every man s woman LIII It is acknowledged even by his enemies that in regard to wine he was abstemious A remark is ascribed to Marcus Cato that Caesar was the only sober man amongst all those who were engaged in the design to subvert thirty five the government In the matter of diet Caius Oppius informs us that he was so indifferent that when a person in whose house he was entertained had served him with stale instead of fresh oil seventy eight and the rest of the company would not touch it he alone ate very heartily of it that he might not seem to tax the master of the house with rusticity or want of attention LIV But his abstinence did not extend to pecuniary advantages either in his military commands or civil offices for we have the testimony of some writers that he took money from the proconsul who was his predecessor in Spain and from the Roman allies in that quarter for the discharge of his debts and plundered at the point of the sword some towns of the Lusitanians notwithstanding they attempted no resistance and opened their gates to him upon his arrival before them In Gaul he rifled the chapels and temples of the gods which were filled with rich offerings and demolished cities oftener for the sake of their spoil than for any ill they had done By this means gold became so plentiful with him that he exchanged it through Italy and the provinces of the empire for three thousand sesterces the pound In his first consulship he purloined from the Capitol three thousand pounds weight of gold and substituted for it the same quantity of gilt brass He bartered likewise to foreign nations and princes for gold the titles of allies and kings and squeezed out of Ptolemy alone near six thousand talents in the name of himself and Pompey He afterwards supported the expense of the civil wars and of his triumphs and public spectacles by the most flagrant rapine and sacrilege LV In eloquence and warlike achievements he equalled at least if he did not surpass the greatest of men After his prosecution of Dolabella he was indisputably reckoned one of the most distinguished advocates Cicero in recounting to Brutus the famous orators declares that he does not see that Caesar was inferior to any one of them and says that he thirty six had an elegant splendid noble and magnificent vein of eloquence And in a letter to Cornelius Nepos he writes of him in the following terms What Of all the orators who during the whole course of their lives have done nothing else which can you prefer to him Which of them is more pointed or terse in his periods or employs more polished and elegant language In his youth he seems to have chosen Strabo Caesar for his model from whose oration in behalf of the Sardinians he has transcribed some passages literally into his Divination In his delivery he is said to have had a shrill voice and his action was animated but not ungraceful He has left behind him some speeches among which are ranked a few that are not genuine such as that on behalf of Quintus Metellus These Augustus supposes with reason to be rather the production of blundering short hand writers who were not able to keep pace with him in the delivery than publications of his own For I find in some copies that the title is not For Metellus but What he wrote to Metellus whereas the speech is delivered in the name of Caesar vindicating Metellus and himself from the aspersions cast upon them by their common defamers The speech addressed To his soldiers in Spain Augustus considers likewise as spurious We meet with two under this title one made as is pretended in the first battle and the other in the last at which time Asinius Pollio says he had not leisure to address the soldiers on account of the suddenness of the enemy s attack LVI He has likewise left Commentaries of his own actions both in the war in Gaul and in the civil war with Pompey for the author of the Alexandrian African and Spanish wars is not known with any certainty Some think they are the production of Oppius and some of Hirtius the latter of whom composed the last book which is imperfect of the Gallic war Of Caesar s Commentaries Cicero in his Brutus speaks thus He wrote his Commentaries in a manner deserving of great approbation they are plain precise and elegant without any affectation of rhetorical ornament In having thus prepared materials for others who might be inclined to write his history he may perhaps have encouraged some silly creatures to enter upon such a work who will needs be dressing up his actions in all the extravagance a thirty seven bombast but he has discouraged wise men from ever attempting the subject Hirtius delivers his opinion of these Commentaries in the following terms So great is the approbation with which they are universally perused that instead of rousing he seems to have precluded the efforts of any future historian Yet with respect to this work we have more reason to admire him than others for they only know how well and correctly he has written but we know likewise how easily and quickly he did it Pollio Asinius thinks that they were not drawn up with much care or with a due regard to truth for he insinuates that Caesar was too hasty of belief in regard to what was performed by others under his orders and that he has not given a very faithful account of his own acts either by design or through defect of memory expressing at the same time an opinion that Caesar intended a new and more correct edition He has left behind him likewise two books on Analogy with the same number under the title of Anti Cato and a poem entitled The Itinerary Of these books he composed the first two in his passage over the Alps as he was returning to the army after making his circuit in Hither Gaul the second work about the time of the battle of Munda and the last during the four and twenty days he employed in his journey from Rome to Farther Spain There are extant some letters of his to the senate written in a manner never practised by any before him for they are distinguished into pages in the form of a memorandum book whereas the consuls and commanders till then used constantly in their letters to continue the line quite across the sheet without any folding or distinction of pages There are extant likewise some letters from him to Cicero and others to his friends concerning his domestic affairs in which if there was occasion for secrecy he wrote in cyphers that is he used the alphabet in such a manner that not a single word could be made out The way to decipher those epistles was to substitute the fourth for the first letter as d for a and so for the other letters respectively Some things likewise pass under his name said to have been written by him when a boy or a very young man as the Encomium of Hercules a tragedy entitled Oedipus and a collection of Apophthegms all which Augustus forbad to be published in a short and plain letter to Pompeius Macer who was employed by him in the arrangement of his libraries thirty eight LVII He was perfect in the use of arms an accomplished rider and able to endure fatigue beyond all belief On a march he used to go at the head of his troops sometimes on horseback but oftener on foot with his head bare in all kinds of weather He would travel post in a light carriage seventy nine without baggage at the rate of a hundred miles a day and if he was stopped by floods in the rivers he swam across or floated on skins inflated with wind so that he often anticipated intelligence of his movements eighty LVIII In his expeditions it is difficult to say whether his caution or his daring was most conspicuous He never marched his army by roads which were exposed to ambuscades without having previously examined the nature of the ground by his scouts Nor did he cross over to Britain before he had carefully examined in person eighty one the navigation the harbours and the most convenient point of landing in the island When intelligence was brought to him of the siege of his camp in Germany he made his way to his troops through the enemy s stations in a Gaulish dress He crossed the sea from Brundisium and Dyrrachium in the winter through the midst of the enemy s fleets and the troops under orders to join him being slow in their movements notwithstanding repeated messages to hurry them but to no purpose he at last went privately and alone aboard a small vessel in the night time with his head muffled up nor did he make himself known or suffer the master to put about although the wind blew strong against them until they were ready to sink LIX He was never deterred from any enterprise nor retarded in the prosecution of it by superstition eighty two When a victim which he was about to offer in sacrifice made its thirty nine escape he did not therefore defer his expedition against Scipio and Juba And happening to fall upon stepping out of the ship he gave a lucky turn to the omen by exclaiming I hold thee fast Africa To chide the prophecies which were spread abroad that the name of the Scipios was by the decrees of fate fortunate and invincible in that province he retained in the camp a profligate wretch of the family of the Cornelii who on account of his scandalous life was surnamed Salutio LX He not only fought pitched battles but made sudden attacks when an opportunity offered often at the end of a march and sometimes during the most violent storms when nobody could imagine he would stir Nor was he ever backward in fighting until towards the end of his life He then was of opinion that the oftener he had been crowned with success the less he ought to expose himself to new hazards and that nothing he could gain by a victory would compensate for what he might lose by a miscarriage He never defeated the enemy without driving them from their camp and giving them no time to rally their forces When the issue of a battle was doubtful he sent away all the horses and his own first that having no means of flight they might be under the greater necessity of standing their ground LXI He rode a very remarkable horse with feet almost like those of a man the hoofs being divided in such a manner as to have some resemblance to toes This horse he had bred himself and the soothsayers having interpreted these circumstances into an omen that its owner would be master of the world he brought him up with particular care and broke him in himself as the horse would suffer no one else to mount him A statue of this horse was afterwards erected by Caesar s order before the temple of Venus Genitrix LXII He often rallied his troops when they were giving way by his personal efforts stopping those who fled keeping others in their ranks and seizing them by their throat turned them towards the enemy although numbers were so terrified that an eagle bearer eighty three thus stopped made a thrust at him with forty the spear head and another upon a similar occasion left the standard in his hand LXIII The following instances of his resolution are equally and even more remarkable After the battle of Pharsalia having sent his troops before him into Asia as he was passing the straits of the Hellespont in a ferry boat he met with Lucius Cassius one of the opposite party with ten ships of war and so far from endeavouring to escape he went alongside his ship and calling upon him to surrender Cassius humbly gave him his submission LXIV At Alexandria in the attack of a bridge being forced by a sudden sally of the enemy into a boat and several others hurrying in with him he leaped into the sea and saved himself by swimming to the next ship which lay at the distance of two hundred paces holding up his left hand out of the water for fear of wetting some papers which he held in it and pulling his general s cloak after him with his teeth lest it should fall into the hands of the enemy LXV He never valued a soldier for his moral conduct or his means but for his courage only and treated his troops with a mixture of severity and indulgence for he did not always keep a strict hand over them but only when the enemy was near Then indeed he was so strict a disciplinarian that he would give no notice of a march or a battle until the moment of action in order that the troops might hold themselves in readiness for any sudden movement and he would frequently draw them out of the camp without any necessity for it especially in rainy weather and upon holy days Sometimes giving them orders not to lose sight of him he would suddenly depart by day or by night and lengthen the marches in order to tire them out as they followed him at a distance LXVI When at any time his troops were dispirited by reports of the great force of the enemy he rallied their courage not by denying the truth of what was said or by diminishing the facts but on the contrary by exaggerating every particular forty one Accordingly when his troops were in great alarm at the expected arrival of king Juba he called them together and said I have to inform you that in a very few days the king will be here with ten legions thirty thousand horse a hundred thousand light armed foot and three hundred elephants Let none of you therefore presume to make further enquiry or indulge in conjectures but take my word for what I tell you which I have from undoubted intelligence otherwise I shall put them aboard an old crazy vessel and leave them exposed to the mercy of the winds to be transported to some other country LXVII He neither noticed all their transgressions nor punished them according to strict rule But for deserters and mutineers he made the most diligent enquiry and their punishment was most severe other delinquencies he would connive at Sometimes after a great battle ending in victory he would grant them a relaxation from all kinds of duty and leave them to revel at pleasure being used to boast that his soldiers fought nothing the worse for being well oiled In his speeches he never addressed them by the title of Soldiers but by the kinder phrase of Fellow soldiers and kept them in such splendid order that their arms were ornamented with silver and gold not merely for parade but to render the soldiers more resolute to save them in battle and fearful of losing them He loved his troops to such a degree that when he heard of the defeat of those under Titurius he neither cut his hair nor shaved his beard until he had revenged it upon the enemy by which means he engaged their devoted affection and raised their valour to the highest pitch LXVIII Upon his entering on the civil war the centurions of every legion offered each of them to maintain a horseman at his own expense and the whole army agreed to serve gratis without either corn or pay those amongst them who were rich charging themselves with the maintenance of the poor No one of them during the whole course of the war deserted to the enemy and many of those who were made prisoners though they were offered their lives upon condition of bearing arms against him refused to accept the terms They endured want and other hardships not only forty two when they were besieged themselves but when they besieged others to such a degree that Pompey when blocked up in the neighbourhood of Dyrrachium upon seeing a sort of bread made of an herb which they lived upon said I have to do with wild beasts and ordered it immediately to be taken away because if his troops should see it their spirit might be broken by perceiving the endurance and determined resolution of the enemy With what bravery they fought one instance affords sufficient proof which is that after an unsuccessful engagement at Dyrrachium they called for punishment insomuch that their general found it more necessary to comfort than to punish them In other battles in different quarters they defeated with ease immense armies of the enemy although they were much inferior to them in number In short one cohort of the sixth legion held out a fort against four legions belonging to Pompey during several hours being almost every one of them wounded by the vast number of arrows discharged against them and of which there were found within the ramparts a hundred and thirty thousand This is no way surprising when we consider the conduct of some individuals amongst them such as that of Cassius Scaeva a centurion or Caius Acilius a common soldier not to speak of others Scaeva after having an eye struck out being run through the thigh and the shoulder and having his shield pierced in an hundred and twenty places maintained obstinately the guard of the gate of a fort with the command of which he was intrusted Acilius in the sea fight at Marseilles having seized a ship of the enemy s with his right hand and that being cut off in imitation of that memorable instance of resolution in Cynaegirus amongst the Greeks boarded the enemy s ship bearing down all before him with the boss of his shield LXIX They never once mutinied during all the ten years of the Gallic war but were sometimes refractory in the course of the civil war However they always returned quickly to their duty and that not through the indulgence but in submission to the authority of their general for he never yielded to them when they were insubordinate but constantly resisted their demands He disbanded the whole ninth legion with ignominy at Placentia although Pompey was still in arms and would forty three not receive them again into his service until they had not only made repeated and humble entreaties but until the ringleaders in the mutiny were punished LXX When the soldiers of the tenth legion at Rome demanded their discharge and rewards for their service with violent threats and no small danger to the city although the war was then raging in Africa he did not hesitate contrary to the advice of his friends to meet the legion and disband it But addressing them by the title of Quirites instead of Soldiers he by this single word so thoroughly brought them round and changed their determination that they immediately cried out they were his soldiers and followed him to Africa although he had refused their service He nevertheless punished the most mutinous among them with the loss of a third of their share in the plunder and the land destined for them LXXI In the service of his clients while yet a young man he evinced great zeal and fidelity He defended the cause of a noble youth Masintha against king Hiempsal so strenuously that in a scuffle which took place upon the occasion he seized by the beard the son of king Juba and upon Masintha s being declared tributary to Hiempsal while the friends of the adverse party were violently carrying him off he immediately rescued him by force kept him concealed in his house a long time and when at the expiration of his praetorship he went to Spain he took him away in his litter in the midst of his lictors bearing the fasces and others who had come to attend and take leave of him LXXII He always treated his friends with such kindness and good nature that when Caius Oppius in travelling with him through a forest was suddenly taken ill he resigned to him the only place there was to shelter them at night and lay upon the ground in the open air When he had placed himself at the head of affairs he advanced some of his faithful adherents though of mean extraction to the highest offices and when he was censured for this partiality he openly said Had I been assisted by robbers and cut throats in the defence of my honour I should have made them the same recompense forty four LXXIII The resentment he entertained against any one was never so implacable that he did not very willingly renounce it when opportunity offered Although Caius Memmius had published some extremely virulent speeches against him and he had answered him with equal acrimony yet he afterwards assisted him with his vote and interest when he stood candidate for the consulship When C Calvus after publishing some scandalous epigrams upon him endeavoured to effect a reconciliation by the intercession of friends he wrote to him of his own accord the first letter And when Valerius Catullus who had as he himself observed fixed such a stain upon his character in his verses upon Mamurra as never could be obliterated he begged his pardon invited him to supper the same day and continued to take up his lodging with his father occasionally as he had been accustomed to do LXXIV His temper was also naturally averse to severity in retaliation After he had captured the pirates by whom he had been taken having sworn that he would crucify them he did so indeed but he first ordered their throats to be cut eighty four He could never bear the thought of doing any harm to Cornelius Phagitas who had dogged him in the night when he was sick and a fugitive with the design of carrying him to Sylla and from whose hands he had escaped with some difficulty by giving him a bribe Philemon his amanuensis who had promised his enemies to poison him he put to death without torture When he was summoned as a witness against Publicus Clodius his wife Pompeia s gallant who was prosecuted for the profanation of religious ceremonies he declared he knew nothing of the affair although his mother Aurelia and his sister Julia gave the court an exact and full account of the circumstances And being asked why then he had divorced his wife Because he said my family should not only be free from guilt but even from the suspicion of it LXXV Both in his administration and his conduct towards the vanquished party in the civil war he showed a wonderful moderation and clemency For while Pompey declared that he would consider those as enemies who did not take arms in defence of the republic he desired it to be understood that he forty five should regard those who remained neuter as his friends With regard to all those to whom he had on Pompey s recommendation given any command in the army he left them at perfect liberty to go over to him if they pleased When some proposals were made at Ileria eighty five for a surrender which gave rise to a free communication between the two camps and Afranius and Petreius upon a sudden change of resolution had put to the sword all Caesar s men who were found in the camp he scorned to imitate the base treachery which they had practised against himself On the field of Pharsalia he called out to the soldiers to spare their fellow citizens and afterwards gave permission to every man in his army to save an enemy None of them so far as appears lost their lives but in battle excepting only Afranius Faustus and young Lucius Caesar and it is thought that even they were put to death without his consent Afranius and Faustus had borne arms against him after obtaining their pardon and Lucius Caesar had not only in the most cruel manner destroyed with fire and sword his freed men and slaves but cut to pieces the wild beasts which he had prepared for the entertainment of the people And finally a little before his death he permitted all whom he had not before pardoned to return into Italy and to bear offices both civil and military He even replaced the statues of Sylla and Pompey which had been thrown down by the populace And after this whatever was devised or uttered he chose rather to check than to punish it Accordingly having detected certain conspiracies and nocturnal assemblies he went no farther than to intimate by a proclamation that he knew of them and as to those who indulged themselves in the liberty of reflecting severely upon him he only warned them in a public speech not to persist in their offence He bore with great moderation a virulent libel written against him by Aulus Caecinna and the abusive lampoons of Pitholaus most highly reflecting on his reputation LXXVI His other words and actions however so far outweigh all his good qualities that it is thought he abused his power and was justly cut off For he not only obtained excessive honours such as the consulship every year the dictatorship for life and the censorship but also the title of emperor eighty six forty six and the surname of FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY eighty seven besides having his statue amongst the kings eighty eight and a lofty couch in the theatre He even suffered some honours to be decreed to him which were unbefitting the most exalted of mankind such as a gilded chair of state in the senate house and on his tribunal a consecrated chariot and banners in the Circensian procession temples altars statues among the gods a bed of state in the temples a priest and a college of priests dedicated to himself like those of Pan and that one of the months should be called by his name There were indeed no honours which he did not either assume himself or grant to others at his will and pleasure In his third and fourth consulship he used only the title of the office being content with the power of dictator which was conferred upon him with the consulship and in both years he substituted other consuls in his room during the three last months so that in the intervals he held no assemblies of the people for the election of magistrates excepting only tribunes and ediles of the people and appointed officers under the name of praefects instead of the praetors to administer the affairs of the city during his absence The office of consul having become vacant by the sudden death of one of the consuls the day before the calends of January the first Jan he conferred it on a person who requested it of him for a few hours Assuming the same licence and regardless of the customs of his country he appointed magistrates to hold their offices for terms of years He granted the insignia of the consular dignity to ten persons of pretorian rank He admitted into the senate some men who had been made free of the city and even natives of Gaul who were semi barbarians forty seven He likewise appointed to the management of the mint and the public revenue of the state some servants of his own household and entrusted the command of three legions which he left at Alexandria to an old catamite of his the son of his freed man Rufinus LXXVII He was guilty of the same extravagance in the language he publicly used as Titus Ampius informs us according to whom he said The republic is nothing but a name without substance or reality Sylla was an ignorant fellow to abdicate the dictatorship Men ought to consider what is becoming when they talk with me and look upon what I say as a law To such a pitch of arrogance did he proceed that when a soothsayer announced to him the unfavourable omen that the entrails of a victim offered for sacrifice were without a heart he said The entrails will be more favourable when I please and it ought not to be regarded as a prodigy that a beast should be found wanting a heart LXXVIII But what brought upon him the greatest odium and was thought an unpardonable insult was his receiving the whole body of the conscript fathers sitting before the temple of Venus Genitrix when they waited upon him with a number of decrees conferring on him the highest dignities Some say that on his attempting to rise he was held down by Cornelius Balbus others that he did not attempt to rise at all but frowned on Caius Trebatius who suggested to him that he should stand up to receive the senate This behaviour appeared the more intolerable in him because when one of the tribunes of the people Pontius Aquila would not rise up to him as he passed by the tribunes seat during his triumph he was so much offended that he cried out Well then you tribune Aquila oust me from the government And for some days afterwards he never promised a favour to any person without this proviso if Pontus Aquila will give me leave LXXIX To this extraordinary mark of contempt for the senate he added another affront still more outrageous For when after the sacred rites of the Latin festival he was returning home amidst the immoderate and unusual acclamations forty eight of the people a man in the crowd put a laurel crown encircled with a white fillet eighty nine on one of his statues upon which the tribunes of the people Epidius Marullus and Caesetius Flavus ordered the fillet to be removed from the crown and the man to be taken to prison Caesar being much concerned either that the idea of royalty had been suggested to so little purpose or as was said that he was thus deprived of the merit of refusing it reprimanded the tribunes very severely and dismissed them from their office From that day forward he was never able to wipe off the scandal of affecting the name of king although he replied to the populace when they saluted him by that title I am Caesar and no king And at the feast of the Lupercalia ninety when the consul Antony placed a crown upon his head in the rostra several times he as often put it away and sent it to the Capitol for Jupiter the Best and the Greatest A report was very current that he had a design of withdrawing to Alexandria or Ilium whither he proposed to transfer the imperial power to drain Italy by new levies and to leave the government of the city to be administered by his friends To this report it was added that in the next meeting of the senate Lucius Cotta one of the fifteen ninety one would make a motion that as there was in the Sibylline books a prophecy that the Parthians would never be subdued but by a king Caesar should have that title conferred upon him LXXX For this reason the conspirators precipitated the execution of their design ninety two that they might not be obliged to give their assent to the proposal Instead therefore of caballing any longer separately in small parties they now united their counsels the people themselves being dissatisfied with the present state of affairs both privately and publicly forty nine condemning the tyranny under which they lived and calling on patriots to assert their cause against the usurper Upon the admission of foreigners into the senate a hand bill was posted up in these words A good deed let no one shew a new senator the way to the house These verses were likewise currently repeated The Gauls he dragged in triumph through the town Caesar has brought into the senate house And changed their plaids ninety three for the patrician gown Gallos Caesar in triumphum ducit iidem in curiam Galli braccas deposuerunt latum clavum sumpserunt When Quintus Maximus who had been his deputy in the consulship for the last three months entered the theatre and the lictor according to custom bid the people take notice who was coming they all cried out He is no consul After the removal of Caesetius and Marullus from their office they were found to have a great many votes at the next election of consuls Some one wrote under the statue of Lucius Brutus Would you were now alive and under the statue of Caesar himself these lines Because he drove from Rome the royal race Brutus was first made consul in their place This man because he put the consuls down Has been rewarded with a royal crown Brutus quia reges ejecit consul primus factus est Hic quia consules ejecit rex postremo factus est About sixty persons were engaged in the conspiracy against him of whom Caius Cassius and Marcus and Decimus Brutus were the chief It was at first debated amongst them whether they should attack him in the Campus Martius when he was taking the votes of the tribes and some of them should throw him off the bridge whilst others should be ready to stab him upon his fall or else in the Via Sacra or at the entrance of the theatre But after public notice had been given by proclamation for the senate to assemble upon the ides of March fifteenth March in the senate house built by Pompey they approved both of the time and place as most fitting for their purpose LXXXI Caesar had warning given him of his fate by indubitable fifty omens A few months before when the colonists settled at Capua by virtue of the Julian law were demolishing some old sepulchres in building country houses and were the more eager at the work because they discovered certain vessels of antique workmanship a tablet of brass was found in a tomb in which Capys the founder of Capua was said to have been buried with an inscription in the Greek language to this effect Whenever the bones of Capys come to be discovered a descendant of Iulus will be slain by the hands of his kinsmen and his death revenged by fearful disasters throughout Italy Lest any person should regard this anecdote as a fabulous or silly invention it was circulated upon the authority of Caius Balbus an intimate friend of Caesar s A few days likewise before his death he was informed that the horses which upon his crossing the Rubicon he had consecrated and turned loose to graze without a keeper abstained entirely from eating and shed floods of tears The soothsayer Spurinna observing certain ominous appearances in a sacrifice which he was offering advised him to beware of some danger which threatened to befall him before the ides of March were past The day before the ides birds of various kinds from a neighbouring grove pursuing a wren which flew into Pompey s senate house ninety four with a sprig of laurel in its beak tore it in pieces Also in the night on which the day of his murder dawned he dreamt at one time that he was soaring above the clouds and at another that he had joined hands with Jupiter His wife Calpurnia fancied in her sleep that the pediment of the house was falling down and her husband stabbed on her bosom immediately upon which the chamber doors flew open On account of these omens as well as his infirm health he was in some doubt whether he should not remain at home and defer to some other opportunity the business which he intended to propose to the senate but Decimus Brutus advising him not to disappoint the senators who were numerously assembled and waited his coming he was prevailed upon to go and accordingly fifty one set forward about the fifth hour In his way some person having thrust into his hand a paper warning him against the plot he mixed it with some other documents which he held in his left hand intending to read it at leisure Victim after victim was slain without any favourable appearances in the entrails but still disregarding all omens he entered the senate house laughing at Spurinna as a false prophet because the ides of March were come without any mischief having befallen him To which the soothsayer replied They are come indeed but not past LXXXII When he had taken his seat the conspirators stood round him under colour of paying their compliments and immediately Tullius Cimber who had engaged to commence the assault advancing nearer than the rest as if he had some favour to request Caesar made signs that he should defer his petition to some other time Tullius immediately seized him by the toga on both shoulders at which Caesar crying out Violence is meant one of the Cassii wounded him a little below the throat Caesar seized him by the arm and ran it through with his style ninety five and endeavouring to rush forward was stopped by another wound Finding himself now attacked on all hands with naked poniards he wrapped the toga ninety six about his head and at the same moment drew the skirt round his legs with his left hand that he might fall more decently with the lower part of his body covered He was stabbed with three and twenty wounds uttering a groan only but no cry at the first wound although some authors relate that when Marcus Brutus fell upon him he exclaimed What art thou too one of them Thou my son ninety seven The whole assembly instantly fifty two dispersing he lay for some time after he expired until three of his slaves laid the body on a litter and carried it home with one arm hanging down over the side Among so many wounds there was none that was mortal in the opinion of the surgeon Antistius except the second which he received in the breast The conspirators meant to drag his body into the Tiber as soon as they had killed him to confiscate his estate and rescind all his enactments but they were deterred by fear of Mark Antony and Lepidus Caesar s master of the horse and abandoned their intentions LXXXIII At the instance of Lucius Piso his father in law his will was opened and read in Mark Antony s house He had made it on the ides thirteenth of the preceding September at his Lavican villa and committed it to the custody of the chief of the Vestal Virgins Quintus Tubero informs us that in all the wills he had signed from the time of his first consulship to the breaking out of the civil war Cneius Pompey was appointed his heir and that this had been publicly notified to the army But in his last will he named three heirs the grandsons of his sisters namely Caius Octavius for three fourths of his estate and Lucius Pinarius and Quintus Pedius for the remaining fourth Other heirs in remainder were named at the close of the will in which he also adopted Caius Octavius who was to assume his name into his family and nominated most of those who were concerned in his death among the guardians of his son if he should have any as well as Decimus Brutus amongst his heirs of the second order Be bequeathed to the Roman people his gardens near the Tiber and three hundred sesterces each man LXXXIV Notice of his funeral having been solemnly proclaimed a pile was erected in the Campus Martius near the tomb of his daughter Julia and before the Rostra was placed a gilded tabernacle on the model of the temple of Venus Genitrix within which was an ivory bed covered with purple and cloth of gold At the head was a trophy with the bloodstained robe in which he was slain It being considered that the whole day would not suffice for carrying the funeral oblations in solemn procession before the corpse directions were given for every one without regard to order to carry them from the city into the Campus Martius by what way they pleased To raise pity and indignation for his murder in the plays acted at the funeral a passage was sung from Pacuvius s tragedy entitled The Trial for Arms That ever I unhappy man should save Wretches who thus have brought me to the grave ninety eight And some lines also from Attilius s tragedy of Electra to the same effect Instead of a funeral panegyric the consul Antony ordered a herald to proclaim to the people the decree of the senate in which they had bestowed upon him all honours divine and human with the oath by which they had engaged themselves for the defence of his person and to these he added only a few words of his own The magistrates and others who had formerly filled the highest offices carried the bier from the Rostra into the Forum While some proposed that the body should be burnt in the sanctuary of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus and others in Pompey s senate house on a sudden two men with swords by their sides and spears in their hands set fire to the bier with lighted torches The throng around immediately heaped upon it dry faggots the tribunals and benches of the adjoining courts and whatever else came to hand Then the musicians and players stripped off the dresses they wore on the present occasion taken from the wardrobe of his triumph at spectacles rent them and threw them into the flames The legionaries also of his fifty four veteran bands cast in their armour which they had put on in honour of his funeral Most of the ladies did the same by their ornaments with the bullae ninety nine and mantles of their children In this public mourning there joined a multitude of foreigners expressing their sorrow according to the fashion of their respective countries but especially the Jews one hundred who for several nights together frequented the spot where the body was burnt LXXXV The populace ran from the funeral with torches in their hands to the houses of Brutus and Cassius and were repelled with difficulty Going in quest of Cornelius Cinna who had in a speech the day before reflected severely upon Caesar and mistaking for him Helvius Cinna who happened to fall into their hands they murdered the latter and carried his head about the city on the point of a spear They afterwards erected in the Forum a column of Numidian marble formed of one stone nearly twenty feet high and inscribed upon it these words TO THE FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY At this column they continued for a long time to offer sacrifices make vows and decide controversies in which they swore by Caesar LXXXVI Some of Caesar s friends entertained a suspicion that he neither desired nor cared to live any longer on account of his declining health and for that reason slighted all the omens of religion and the warnings of his friends Others are of opinion that thinking himself secure in the late decree of the senate and their oaths he dismissed his Spanish guards who attended him with drawn swords Others again suppose that he chose rather to face at once the dangers which threatened him on all sides than to be for ever on the watch against them Some tell us that he used to say the commonwealth was more interested in the safety of his person than himself for that he had for some time been satiated with power and glory but that the commonwealth if any thing should befall him would have no rest and involved in another civil war would be in a worse state than before fifty five LXXXVII This however was generally admitted that his death was in many respects such as he would have chosen For upon reading the account delivered by Xenophon how Cyrus in his last illness gave instructions respecting his funeral Caesar deprecated a lingering death and wished that his own might be sudden and speedy And the day before he died the conversation at supper in the house of Marcus Lepidus turning upon what was the most eligible way of dying he gave his opinion in favour of a death that is sudden and unexpected LXXXVIII He died in the fifty sixth year of his age and was ranked amongst the Gods not only by a formal decree but in the belief of the vulgar For during the first games which Augustus his heir consecrated to his memory a comet blazed for seven days together rising always about eleven o clock and it was supposed to be the soul of Caesar now received into heaven for which reason likewise he is represented on his statue with a star on his brow The senate house in which he was slain was ordered to be shut up one hundred one and a decree made that the ides of March should be called parricidal and the senate should never more assemble on that day LXXXIX Scarcely any of those who were accessary to his murder survived him more than three years or died a natural death one hundred two They were all condemned by the senate some were taken off by one accident some by another Part of them perished at sea others fell in battle and some slew themselves with the same poniard with which they had stabbed Caesar one hundred three fifty six one hundred four The termination of the civil war between Caesar and Pompey forms a new epoch in the Roman History at which a Republic which had subsisted with unrivalled glory during a period of about four hundred and sixty years relapsed into a state of despotism whence it never more could emerge So sudden a transition from prosperity to the ruin of public freedom without the intervention of any foreign enemy excites a reasonable conjecture that the constitution in which it could take place however vigorous in appearance must have lost that soundness of political health which had enabled it to endure through so many ages A short view of its preceding state and of that in which it was at the time of the revolution now mentioned will best ascertain the foundation of such a conjecture Though the Romans upon the expulsion of Tarquin made an essential change in the political form of the state they did not carry their detestation of regal authority so far as to abolish the religious institutions of Numa Pompilius the second of their kings according to which the priesthood with all the influence annexed to that order was placed in the hands of the aristocracy By this wise policy a restraint was put upon the fickleness and violence of the people in matters of government and a decided superiority given to the Senate both in the deliberative and executive parts of administration This advantage was afterwards indeed diminished by the creation of Tribunes of the people a set of men whose ambition often embroiled the Republic in civil dissensions and who at last abused their authority to such a degree that they became instruments of aggrandizement to any leading men in the state who could purchase their friendship In general however the majority of the Tribunes being actuated by views which comprehended the interests of the multitude rather than those of individuals they did not so much endanger the liberty as they interrupted the tranquillity of the public and when the occasional commotions subsided there remained no permanent ground for the establishment of personal usurpation In every government an object of the last importance to the peace and welfare of society is the morals of the people and in proportion as a community is enlarged by propagation or the accession of a multitude of new members a more strict attention is requisite to guard against that dissolution of manners to which a crowded and extensive capital has a natural tendency Of this fifty seven the Romans became sensible in the growing state of the Republic In the year of the City three hundred twelve two magistrates were first created for taking an account of the number of the people and the value of their estates and soon after they were invested with the authority not only of inspecting the morals of individuals but of inflicting public censure for any licentiousness of conduct or violation of decency Thus both the civil and religious institutions concurred to restrain the people within the bounds of good order and obedience to the laws at the same time that the frugal life of the ancient Romans proved a strong security against those vices which operate most effectually towards sapping the foundations of a state But in the time of Julius Caesar the barriers of public liberty were become too weak to restrain the audacious efforts of ambitious and desperate men The veneration for the constitution usually a powerful check to treasonable designs had been lately violated by the usurpations of Marius and Sylla The salutary terrors of religion no longer predominated over the consciences of men The shame of public censure was extinguished in general depravity An eminent historian who lived at that time informs us that venality universally prevailed amongst the Romans and a writer who flourished soon after observes that luxury and dissipation had encumbered almost all so much with debt that they beheld with a degree of complacency the prospect of civil war and confusion The extreme degree of profligacy at which the Romans were now arrived is in nothing more evident than that this age gave birth to the most horrible conspiracy which occurs in the annals of humankind viz that of Catiline This was not the project of a few desperate and abandoned individuals but of a number of men of the most illustrious rank in the state and it appears beyond doubt that Julius Caesar was accessary to the design which was no less than to extirpate the Senate divide amongst themselves both the public and private treasures and set Rome on fire The causes which prompted to this tremendous project it is generally admitted were luxury prodigality irreligion a total corruption of manners and above all as the immediate cause the pressing necessity in which the conspirators were involved by their extreme dissipation The enormous debt in which Caesar himself was early involved countenances an opinion that his anxiety to procure the province of Gaul proceeded chiefly from this cause But during nine years in which he held that province he acquired such riches as must have rendered him without competition the most opulent person in the state If nothing more therefore than a fifty eight splendid establishment had been the object of his pursuit he had attained to the summit of his wishes But when we find him persevering in a plan of aggrandizement beyond this period of his fortunes we can ascribe his conduct to no other motive than that of outrageous ambition He projected the building of a new Forum at Rome for the ground only of which he was to pay eight hundred thousand pounds he raised legions in Gaul at his own charges he promised such entertainments to the people as had never been known at Rome from the foundation of the city All these circumstances evince some latent design of procuring such a popularity as might give him an uncontrolled influence in the management of public affairs Pompey we are told was wont to say that Caesar not being able with all his riches to fulfil the promises which he had made wished to throw everything into confusion There may have been some foundation for this remark but the opinion of Cicero is more probable that Caesar s mind was seduced with the temptations of chimerical glory It is observable that neither Cicero nor Pompey intimates any suspicion that Caesar was apprehensive of being impeached for his conduct had he returned to Rome in a private station Yet that there was reason for such an apprehension the positive declaration of L Domitius leaves little room to doubt especially when we consider the number of enemies that Caesar had in the Senate and the coolness of his former friend Pompey ever after the death of Julia The proposed impeachment was founded upon a notorious charge of prosecuting measures destructive of the interests of the commonwealth and tending ultimately to an object incompatible with public freedom Indeed considering the extreme corruption which prevailed amongst the Romans at this time it is more than probable that Caesar would have been acquitted of the charge but at such an expense as must have stripped him of all his riches and placed him again in a situation ready to attempt a disturbance of the public tranquillity For it is said that he purchased the friendship of Curio at the commencement of the civil war with a bribe little short of half a million sterling Whatever Caesar s private motive may have been for taking arms against his country he embarked in an enterprise of a nature the most dangerous and had Pompey conducted himself in any degree suitable to the reputation which he had formerly acquired the contest would in all probability have terminated in favour of public freedom But by dilatory measures in the beginning by imprudently withdrawing his army from Italy into a distant province and by not pursuing the advantage he had gained by the vigorous repulse of Caesar s troops in their attack upon his camp this commander lost every opportunity of extinguishing a war which was to determine the fate and even the existence of the Republic It was accordingly determined on the plains of Pharsalia where Caesar obtained a victory which was not more decisive than unexpected He was now no longer amenable either to the tribunal of the Senate or the power of the laws but triumphed at once over his enemies and the constitution of his country It is to the honour of Caesar that when he had obtained the supreme power he exercised it with a degree of moderation beyond what was generally expected by those who had fought on the side of the Republic Of his private life either before or after this period little is transmitted in history Henceforth however he seems to have lived chiefly at Rome near which he had a small villa upon an eminence commanding a beautiful prospect His time was almost entirely occupied with public affairs in the management of which though he employed many agents he appears to have had none in the character of actual minister He was in general easy of access but Cicero in a letter to a friend complains of having been treated with the indignity of waiting a considerable time amongst a crowd in an anti chamber before he could have an audience The elevation of Caesar placed him not above discharging reciprocally the social duties in the intercourse of life He returned the visits of those who waited upon him and would sup at their houses At table and in the use of wine he was habitually temperate Upon the whole he added nothing to his own happiness by all the dangers the fatigues and the perpetual anxiety which he had incurred in the pursuit of unlimited power His health was greatly impaired his former cheerfulness of temper though not his magnanimity appears to have forsaken him and we behold in his fate a memorable example of illustrious talents rendered by inordinate ambition destructive to himself and irretrievably pernicious to his country From beholding the ruin of the Roman Republic after intestine divisions and the distractions of civil war it will afford some relief to take a view of the progress of literature which flourished even during those calamities The commencement of literature in Rome is to be dated from the reduction of the Grecian States when the conquerors imported into their own country the valuable productions of the Greek language and the first essay of Roman genius was in dramatic composition Livius Andronicus who flourished about two hundred forty years before the Christian aera formed the Fescennine verses into a kind of regular drama upon the model of the Greeks He was followed some time after by Ennius who besides dramatic and other compositions sixty wrote the annals of the Roman Republic in heroic verse His style like that of Andronicus was rough and unpolished in conformity to the language of those times but for grandeur of sentiment and energy of expression he was admired by the greatest poets in the subsequent ages Other writers of distinguished reputation in the dramatic department were Naevius Pacuvius Plautus Afranius Caecilius Terence Accius et cetera Accius and Pacuvius are mentioned by Quintilian as writers of extraordinary merit Of twenty five comedies written by Plautus the number transmitted to posterity is nineteen and of a hundred and eight which Terence is said to have translated from Menander there now remain only six Excepting a few inconsiderable fragments the writings of all the other authors have perished The early period of Roman literature was distinguished for the introduction of satire by Lucilius an author celebrated for writing with remarkable ease but whose compositions in the opinion of Horace though Quintilian thinks otherwise were debased with a mixture of feculency Whatever may have been their merit they also have perished with the works of a number of orators who adorned the advancing state of letters in the Roman Republic It is observable that during this whole period of near two centuries and a half there appeared not one historian of eminence sufficient to preserve his name from oblivion Julius Caesar himself is one of the most eminent writers of the age in which he lived His commentaries on the Gallic and Civil Wars are written with a purity precision and perspicuity which command approbation They are elegant without affectation and beautiful without ornament Of the two books which he composed on Analogy and those under the title of Anti Cato scarcely any fragment is preserved but we may be assured of the justness of the observations on language which were made by an author so much distinguished by the excellence of his own compositions His poem entitled The Journey which was probably an entertaining narrative is likewise totally lost The most illustrious prose writer of this or any other age is M Tullius Cicero and as his life is copiously related in biographical works it will be sufficient to mention his writings From his earliest years he applied himself with unremitting assiduity to the cultivation of literature and whilst he was yet a boy wrote a poem called Glaucus Pontius which was extant in Plutarch s time Amongst his juvenile productions was a translation into Latin verse of Aratus on the Phaenomena of the Heavens of which many fragments are still extant He also published a poem of the heroic kind in honour of his countryman C Marius who was born at Arpinum the birth place of Cicero sixty one This production was greatly admired by Atticus and old Scaevola was so much pleased with it that in an epigram written on the subject he declares that it would live as long as the Roman name and learning subsisted From a little specimen which remains of it describing a memorable omen given to Marina from an oak at Arpinum there is reason to believe that his poetical genius was scarcely inferior to his oratorical had it been cultivated with equal industry He published another poem called Limon of which Donatus has preserved four lines in the life of Terence in praise of the elegance and purity of that poet s style He composed in the Greek language and in the style and manner of Isocrates a Commentary or Memoirs of the Transactions of his Consulship This he sent to Atticus with a desire if he approved it to publish it in Athens and the cities of Greece He sent a copy of it likewise to Posidonius of Rhodes and requested of him to undertake the same subject in a more elegant and masterly manner But the latter returned for answer that instead of being encouraged to write by the perusal of his tract he was quite deterred from attempting it Upon the plan of those Memoirs he afterwards composed a Latin poem in three books in which he carried down the history to the end of his exile but did not publish it for several years from motives of delicacy The three books were severally inscribed to the three Muses but of this work there now remain only a few fragments scattered in different parts of his other writings He published about the same time a collection of the principal speeches which he had made in his consulship under the title of his Consular Orations They consisted originally of twelve but four are entirely lost and some of the rest are imperfect He now published also in Latin verse a translation of the Prognostics of Aratus of which work no more than two or three small fragments now remain A few years after he put the last hand to his Dialogues upon the Character and Idea of the perfect Orator This admirable work remains entire a monument both of the astonishing industry and transcendent abilities of its author At his Cuman villa he next began a Treatise on Politics or on the best State of a City and the Duties of a Citizen He calls it a great and a laborious work yet worthy of his pains if he could succeed in it This likewise was written in the form of a dialogue in which the speakers were Scipio Laelius Philus Manilius and other great persons in the former times of the Republic It was comprised in six books and survived him for several ages though it is now unfortunately lost From the fragments which remain it appears to have been a masterly production in which all the important questions in politics and morality were discussed with elegance and accuracy sixty two Amidst all the anxiety for the interests of the Republic which occupied the thoughts of this celebrated personage he yet found leisure to write several philosophical tracts which still subsist to the gratification of the literary world He composed a treatise on the Nature of the Gods in three books containing a comprehensive view of religion faith oaths ceremonies et cetera In elucidating this important subject he not only delivers the opinions of all the philosophers who had written anything concerning it but weighs and compares attentively all the arguments with each other forming upon the whole such a rational and perfect system of natural religion as never before was presented to the consideration of mankind and approaching nearly to revelation He now likewise composed in two books a discourse on Divination in which he discusses at large all the arguments that may be advanced for and against the actual existence of such a species of knowledge Like the preceding works it is written in the form of dialogue and in which the chief speaker is Laelius The same period gave birth to his treatise on Old Age called Cato Major and to that on Friendship written also in dialogue and in which the chief speaker is Laelius This book considered merely as an essay is one of the most entertaining productions of ancient times but beheld as a picture drawn from life exhibiting the real characters and sentiments of men of the first distinction for virtue and wisdom in the Roman Republic it becomes doubly interesting to every reader of observation and taste Cicero now also wrote his discourse on Fate which was the subject of a conversation with Hirtius in his villa near Puteoli and he executed about the same time a translation of Plato s celebrated Dialogue called Timaeus on the nature and origin of the universe He was employing himself also on a history of his own times or rather of his own conduct full of free and severe reflections on those who had abused their power to the oppression of the Republic Dion Cassius says that he delivered this book sealed up to his son with strict orders not to read or publish it till after his death but from this time he never saw his son and it is probable that he left the work unfinished Afterwards however some copies of it were circulated from which his commentator Asconius has quoted several particulars During a voyage which he undertook to Sicily he wrote his treatise on Topics or the Art of finding Arguments on any Question This was an abstract from Aristotle s treatise on the same subject and though he had neither Aristotle nor any other book to assist him he drew it up from his memory and finished it as he sailed along the coast of Calabria The last sixty three work composed by Cicero appears to have been his Offices written for the use of his son to whom it is addressed This treatise contains a system of moral conduct founded upon the noblest principles of human action and recommended by arguments drawn from the purest sources of philosophy Such are the literary productions of this extraordinary man whose comprehensive understanding enabled him to conduct with superior ability the most abstruse disquisitions into moral and metaphysical science Born in an age posterior to Socrates and Plato he could not anticipate the principles inculcated by those divine philosophers but he is justly entitled to the praise not only of having prosecuted with unerring judgment the steps which they trod before him but of carrying his researches to greater extent into the most difficult regions of philosophy This too he had the merit to perform neither in the station of a private citizen nor in the leisure of academic retirement but in the bustle of public life amidst the almost constant exertions of the bar the employment of the magistrate the duty of the senator and the incessant cares of the statesman through a period likewise chequered with domestic afflictions and fatal commotions in the Republic As a philosopher his mind appears to have been clear capacious penetrating and insatiable of knowledge As a writer he was endowed with every talent that could captivate either the judgment or taste His researches were continually employed on subjects of the greatest utility to mankind and those often such as extended beyond the narrow bounds of temporal existence The being of a God the immortality of the soul a future state of rewards and punishments and the eternal distinction of good and evil these were in general the great objects of his philosophical enquiries and he has placed them in a more convincing point of view than they ever were before exhibited to the pagan world The variety and force of the arguments which he advances the splendour of his diction and the zeal with which he endeavours to excite the love and admiration of virtue all conspire to place his character as a philosophical writer including likewise his incomparable eloquence on the summit of human celebrity The form of dialogue so much used by Cicero he doubtless adopted in imitation of Plato who probably took the hint of it from the colloquial method of instruction practised by Socrates In the early stage of philosophical enquiry this mode of composition was well adapted if not to the discovery at least to the confirmation of moral truth especially as the practice was then not uncommon for speculative men to converse together on important subjects for mutual information In treating of any subject respecting which the different sects of philosophers differed sixty four from each other in point of sentiment no kind of composition could be more happily suited than dialogue as it gave alternately full scope to the arguments of the various disputants It required however that the writer should exert his understanding with equal impartiality and acuteness on the different sides of the question as otherwise he might betray a cause under the appearance of defending it In all the dialogues of Cicero he manages the arguments of the several disputants in a manner not only the most fair and interesting but also such as leads to the most probable and rational conclusion After enumerating the various tracts composed and published by Cicero we have now to mention his Letters which though not written for publication deserve to be ranked among the most interesting remains of Roman literature The number of such as are addressed to different correspondents is considerable but those to Atticus alone his confidential friend amount to upwards of four hundred among which are many of great length They are all written in the genuine spirit of the most approved epistolary composition uniting familiarity with elevation and ease with elegance They display in a beautiful light the author s character in the social relations of life as a warm friend a zealous patron a tender husband an affectionate brother an indulgent father and a kind master Beholding them in a more extensive view they exhibit an ardent love of liberty and the constitution of his country they discover a mind strongly actuated with the principles of virtue and reason and while they abound in sentiments the most judicious and philosophical they are occasionally blended with the charms of wit and agreeable effusions of pleasantry What is likewise no small addition to their merit they contain much interesting description of private life with a variety of information relative to public transactions and characters of that age It appears from Cicero s correspondence that there was at that time such a number of illustrious Romans as never before existed in any one period of the Republic If ever therefore the authority of men the most respectable for virtue rank and abilities could have availed to overawe the first attempts at a violation of public liberty it must have been at this period for the dignity of the Roman senate was now in the zenith of its splendour Cicero has been accused of excessive vanity and of arrogating to himself an invidious superiority from his extraordinary talents but whoever peruses his letters to Atticus must readily acknowledge that this imputation appears to be destitute of truth In those excellent productions though he adduces the strongest arguments for and against any object of consideration that the sixty five most penetrating understanding can suggest weighs them with each other and draws from them the most rational conclusions he yet discovers such a diffidence in his own opinion that he resigns himself implicitly to the judgment and direction of his friend a modesty not very compatible with the disposition of the arrogant who are commonly tenacious of their own opinion particularly in what relates to any decision of the understanding It is difficult to say whether Cicero appears in his letters more great or amiable but that he was regarded by his contemporaries in both these lights and that too in the highest degree is sufficiently evident We may thence infer that the great poets in the subsequent age must have done violence to their own liberality and discernment when in compliment to Augustus whose sensibility would have been wounded by the praises of Cicero and even by the mention of his name they have so industriously avoided the subject as not to afford the most distant intimation that this immortal orator and philosopher had ever existed Livy however there is reason to think did some justice to his memory but it was not until the race of the Caesars had become extinct that he received the free and unanimous applause of impartial posterity Such was the admiration which Quintilian entertained of his writings that he considered the circumstance or being delighted with them as an indubitable proof of judgment and taste in literature Ille se profecisse sciat cui Cicero valde placebit one hundred five In this period is likewise to be placed M Terentius Varro the celebrated Roman grammarian and the Nestor of ancient learning The first mention made of him is that he was lieutenant to Pompey in his piratical wars and obtained in that service a naval crown In the civil wars he joined the side of the Republic and was taken by Caesar by whom he was likewise proscribed but obtained a remission of the sentence Of all the ancients he has acquired the greatest fame for his extensive erudition and we may add that he displayed the same industry in communicating as he had done in collecting it His works originally amounted to no less than five hundred volumes which have all perished except a treatise De Lingua Latina and one De Re Rustica Of the former of these which is addressed to Cicero three books at the beginning are also lost It appears from the introduction of the fourth book that they all related to etymology The first contained such observations as might be made against it the second such as might be made in its favour and the third observations upon it He next proceeds to investigate the origin of sixty six Latin words In the fourth book he traces those which relate to place in the fifth those connected with the idea of time and in the sixth the origin of both these classes as they appear in the writings of the poets The seventh book is employed on declension in which the author enters upon a minute and extensive enquiry comprehending a variety of acute and profound observations on the formation of Latin nouns and their respective natural declinations from the nominative case In the eighth he examines the nature and limits of usage and analogy in language and in the ninth and last book on the subject takes a general view of what is the reverse of analogy viz anomaly The precision and perspicuity which Varro displays in this work merit the highest encomiums and justify the character given him in his own time of being the most learned of the Latin grammarians To the loss of the first three books are to be added several chasms in the others but fortunately they happen in such places as not to affect the coherency of the author s doctrine though they interrupt the illustration of it It is observable that this great grammarian makes use of quom for quum heis for his and generally queis for quibus This practice having become rather obsolete at the time in which he wrote we must impute his continuance of it to his opinion of its propriety upon its established principles of grammar and not to any prejudice of education or an affectation of singularity As Varro makes no mention of Caesar s treatise on Analogy and had commenced author long before him it is probable that Caesar s production was of a much later date and thence we may infer that those two writers differed from each other at least with respect to some particulars on that subject This author s treatise De Re Rustica was undertaken at the desire of a friend who having purchased some lands requested of Varro the favour of his instructions relative to farming and the economy of a country life in its various departments Though Varro was at this time in his eightieth year he writes with all the vivacity though without the levity of youth and sets out with invoking not the Muses like Homer and Ennius as he observes but the twelve deities supposed to be chiefly concerned in the operations of agriculture It appears from the account which he gives that upwards of fifty Greek authors had treated of this subject in prose besides Hesiod and Menecrates the Ephesian who both wrote in verse exclusive likewise of many Roman writers and of Mago the Carthaginian who wrote in the Punic language Varro s work is divided into three books the first of which treats of agriculture the second of rearing of cattle and the third of feeding animals for the use of the table sixty seven In the last of these we meet with a remarkable instance of the prevalence of habit and fashion over human sentiment where the author delivers instructions relative to the best method of fattening rats We find from Quintilian that Varro likewise composed satires in various kinds of verse It is impossible to behold the numerous fragments of this venerable author without feeling the strongest regret for the loss of that vast collection of information which he had compiled and of judicious observations which he had made on a variety of subjects during a life of eighty eight years almost entirely devoted to literature The remark of saint Augustine is well founded That it is astonishing how Varro who read such a number of books could find time to compose so many volumes and how he who composed so many volumes could be at leisure to peruse such a variety of books and to gain so much literary information Catullus is said to have been born at Verona of respectable parents his father and himself being in the habit of intimacy with Julius Caesar He was brought to Rome by Mallius to whom several of his epigrams are addressed The gentleness of his manners and his application to study we are told recommended him to general esteem and he had the good fortune to obtain the patronage of Cicero When he came to be known as a poet all these circumstances would naturally contribute to increase his reputation for ingenuity and accordingly we find his genius applauded by several of his contemporaries It appears that his works are not transmitted entire to posterity but there remain sufficient specimens by which we may be enabled to appreciate his poetical talents Quintilian and Diomed the grammarian have ranked Catullus amongst the iambic writers while others have placed him amongst the lyric He has properly a claim to each of these stations but his versification being chiefly iambic the former of the arrangements seems to be the most suitable The principal merit of Catullus s Iambics consists in a simplicity of thought and expression The thoughts however are often frivolous and what is yet more reprehensible the author gives way to gross obscenity in vindication of which he produces the following couplet declaring that a good poet ought to be chaste in his own person but that his verses need not be so Nam castum esse decet pium poetam Ipsum versiculos nihil necesse est This sentiment has been frequently cited by those who were inclined to follow the example of Catullus but if such a practice be in any case admissible it is only where the poet personates sixty eight a profligate character and the instances in which it is adopted by Catullus are not of that description It had perhaps been a better apology to have pleaded the manners of the times for even Horace who wrote only a few years after has suffered his compositions to be occasionally debased by the same kind of blemish Much has been said of this poet s invective against Caesar which produced no other effect than an invitation to sup at the dictator s house It was indeed scarcely entitled to the honour of the smallest resentment If any could be shewn it must have been for the freedom used by the author and not for any novelty in his lampoon There are two poems on this subject viz the twenty ninth and fifty seventh in each of which Caesar is joined with Mamurra a Roman knight who had acquired great riches in the Gallic war For the honour of Catullus s gratitude we should suppose that the latter is the one to which historians allude but as poetical compositions they are equally unworthy of regard The fifty seventh is nothing more than a broad repetition of the raillery whether well or ill founded with which Caesar was attacked on various occasions and even in the senate after his return from Bithynia Caesar had been taunted with this subject for upwards of thirty years and after so long a familiarity with reproach his sensibility to the scandalous imputation must now have been much diminished if not entirely extinguished The other poem is partly in the same strain but extended to greater length by a mixture of common jocular ribaldry of the Roman soldiers expressed nearly in the same terms which Caesar s legions though strongly attached to his person scrupled not to sport publicly in the streets of Rome against their general during the celebration of his triumph In a word it deserves to be regarded as an effusion of Saturnalian licentiousness rather than of poetry With respect to the Iambics of Catullus we may observe in general that the sarcasm is indebted for its force not so much to ingenuity of sentiment as to the indelicate nature of the subject or coarseness of expression The descriptive poems of Catullus are superior to the others and discover a lively imagination Amongst the best of his productions is a translation of the celebrated ode of Sappho Ille mi par esse Deo videtur me et cetera This ode is executed both with spirit and elegance it is however imperfect and the last stanza seems to be spurious Catullus s epigrams are entitled to little praise with regard either to sentiment or point and on the whole his merit as a poet appears to have been magnified beyond its real extent He is said to have died about the thirtieth year of his age sixty nine Lucretius is the author of a celebrated poem in six books De Rerum Natura a subject which had been treated many ages before by Empedocles a philosopher and poet of Agrigentum Lucretius was a zealous partizan of Democritus and the sect of Epicurus whose principles concerning the eternity of matter the materiality of the soul and the non existence of a future state of rewards and punishments he affects to maintain with a certainty equal to that of mathematical demonstration Strongly prepossessed with the hypothetical doctrines of his master and ignorant of the physical system of the universe he endeavours to deduce from the phenomena of the material world conclusions not only unsupported by legitimate theory but repugnant to the principles of the highest authority in metaphysical disquisition But while we condemn his speculative notions as degrading to human nature and subversive of the most important interests of mankind we must admit that he has prosecuted his visionary hypothesis with uncommon ingenuity Abstracting from it the rhapsodical nature of this production and its obscurity in some parts it has great merit as a poem The style is elevated and the versification in general harmonious By the mixture of obsolete words it possesses an air of solemnity well adapted to abstruse researches at the same time that by the frequent resolution of diphthongs it instils into the Latin the sonorous and melodious powers of the Greek language While Lucretius was engaged in this work he fell into a state of insanity occasioned as is supposed by a philtre or love potion given him by his wife Lucilia The complaint however having lucid intervals he employed them in the execution of his plan and soon after it was finished laid violent hands upon himself in the forty third year of his age This fatal termination of his life which perhaps proceeded from insanity was ascribed by his friends and admirers to his concern for the banishment of one Memmius with whom he was intimately connected and for the distracted state of the republic It was however a catastrophe which the principles of Epicurus equally erroneous and irreconcilable to resignation and fortitude authorized in particular circumstances Even Atticus the celebrated correspondent of Cicero a few years after this period had recourse to the same desperate expedient by refusing all sustenance while he laboured under a lingering disease It is said that Cicero revised the poem of Lucretius after the death of the author and this circumstance is urged by the abettors of atheism as a proof that the principles contained in the work had the sanction of his authority But no inference in favour of Lucretius s doctrine can justly be drawn from this circumstance seventy Cicero though already sufficiently acquainted with the principles of the Epicurean sect might not be averse to the perusal of a production which collected and enforced them in a nervous strain of poetry especially as the work was likely to prove interesting to his friend Atticus and would perhaps afford subject for some letters or conversation between them It can have been only with reference to composition that the poem was submitted to Cicero s revisal for had he been required to exercise his judgment upon its principles he must undoubtedly have so much mutilated the work as to destroy the coherency of the system He might be gratified with the shew of elaborate research and confident declamation which it exhibited but he must have utterly disapproved of the conclusions which the author endeavoured to establish According to the best information Lucretius died in the year from the building of Rome seven hundred one when Pompey was the third time consul Cicero lived several years beyond this period and in the two last years of his life he composed those valuable works which contain sentiments diametrically repugnant to the visionary system of Epicurus The argument therefore drawn from Cicero s revisal so far from confirming the principle of Lucretius affords the strongest tacit declaration against their validity because a period sufficient for mature consideration had elapsed before Cicero published his own admirable system of philosophy The poem of Lucretius nevertheless has been regarded as the bulwark of atheism of atheism which while it impiously arrogates the support of reason both reason and nature disclaim Many more writers flourished in this period but their works have totally perished Sallust was now engaged in historical productions but as they were not yet completed they will be noticed in the next division of the review D OCTAVIUS CAESAR AUGUSTUS seventy one I That the family of the Octavii was of the first distinction in Velitrae one hundred six is rendered evident by many circumstances For in the most frequented part of the town there was not long since a street named the Octavian and an altar was to be seen consecrated to one Octavius who being chosen general in a war with some neighbouring people the enemy making a sudden attack while he was sacrificing to Mars he immediately snatched the entrails of the victim from off the fire and offered them half raw upon the altar after which marching out to battle he returned victorious This incident gave rise to a law by which it was enacted that in all future times the entrails should be offered to Mars in the same manner and the rest of the victim be carried to the Octavii II This family as well as several in Rome was admitted into the senate by Tarquinius Priscus and soon afterwards placed by Servius Tullius among the patricians but in process of time it transferred itself to the plebeian order and after the lapse of a long interval was restored by Julius Caesar to the rank of patricians The first person of the family raised by the suffrages of the people to the magistracy was Caius Rufus He obtained the quaestorship and had two sons Cneius and Caius from whom are descended the two branches of the Octavian family which have had very different fortunes For Cneius and his descendants in uninterrupted succession held all the highest offices of the state whilst Caius and his posterity whether from their circumstances or their choice remained in the equestrian order until the father of Augustus The great grandfather of Augustus served as a military tribune in the second Punic war in Sicily under the command of Aemilius Pappus His grandfather contented himself with bearing the public offices of his own municipality and grew old in the tranquil enjoyment of an ample patrimony Such is the account given seventy two by different authors Augustus himself however tells us nothing more than that he was descended of an equestrian family both ancient and rich of which his father was the first who obtained the rank of senator Mark Antony upbraidingly tells him that his great grandfather was a freedman of the territory of Thurium one hundred seven and a rope maker and his grandfather a usurer This is all the information I have any where met with respecting the ancestors of Augustus by the father s side III His father Caius Octavius was from his earliest years a person both of opulence and distinction for which reason I am surprised at those who say that he was a money dealer one hundred eight and was employed in scattering bribes and canvassing for the candidates at elections in the Campus Martius For being bred up in all the affluence of a great estate he attained with ease to honourable posts and discharged the duties of them with much distinction After his praetorship he obtained by lot the province of Macedonia in his way to which he cut off some banditti the relics of the armies of Spartacus and Catiline who had possessed themselves of the territory of Thurium having received from the senate an extraordinary commission for that purpose In his government of the province he conducted himself with equal justice and resolution for he defeated the Bessians and Thracians in a great battle and treated the allies of the republic in such a manner that there are extant letters from M Tullius Cicero in which he advises and exhorts his brother Quintus who then held the proconsulship of Asia with no great reputation to imitate the example of his neighbour Octavius in gaining the affections of the allies of Rome IV After quitting Macedonia before he could declare himself a candidate for the consulship he died suddenly leaving behind him a daughter the elder Octavia by Ancharia and another daughter Octavia the younger as well as Augustus by Atia who was the daughter of Marcus Atius Balbus and Julia sister to Caius Julius Caesar Balbus was by the father s seventy three side of a family who were natives of Aricia one hundred nine and many of whom had been in the senate By the mother s side he was nearly related to Pompey the Great and after he had borne the office of praetor was one of the twenty commissioners appointed by the Julian law to divide the land in Campania among the people But Mark Antony treating with contempt Augustus s descent even by the mother s side says that his great grand father was of African descent and at one time kept a perfumer s shop and at another a bake house in Aricia And Cassius of Parma in a letter taxes Augustus with being the son not only of a baker but a usurer These are his words Thou art a lump of thy mother s meal which a money changer of Nerulum taking from the newest bake house of Aricia kneaded into some shape with his hands all discoloured by the fingering of money V Augustus was born in the consulship of Marcus Tullius Cicero and Caius Antonius one hundred ten upon the ninth of the calends of October the twenty third September a little before sunrise in the quarter of the Palatine Hill one hundred eleven and the street called The Ox Heads one hundred twelve where now stands a chapel dedicated to him and built a little after his death For as it is recorded in the proceedings of the senate when Caius Laetorius a young man of a patrician family in pleading before the senators for a lighter sentence upon his being convicted of adultery alleged besides his youth and quality that he was the possessor and as it were the guardian of the ground which the Divine Augustus first touched upon his coming into the world and entreated that seventy four he might find favour for the sake of that deity who was in a peculiar manner his an act of the senate was passed for the consecration of that part of his house in which Augustus was born VI His nursery is shewn to this day in a villa belonging to the family in the suburbs of Velitrae being a very small place and much like a pantry An opinion prevails in the neighbourhood that he was also born there Into this place no person presumes to enter unless upon necessity and with great devotion from a belief for a long time prevalent that such as rashly enter it are seized with great horror and consternation which a short while since was confirmed by a remarkable incident For when a new inhabitant of the house had either by mere chance or to try the truth of the report taken up his lodging in that apartment in the course of the night a few hours afterwards he was thrown out by some sudden violence he knew not how and was found in a state of stupefaction with the coverlid of his bed before the door of the chamber VII While he was yet an infant the surname of Thurinus was given him in memory of the birth place of his family or because soon after he was born his father Octavius had been successful against the fugitive slaves in the country near Thurium That he was surnamed Thurinus I can affirm upon good foundation for when a boy I had a small bronze statue of him with that name upon it in iron letters nearly effaced by age which I presented to the emperor one hundred thirteen by whom it is now revered amongst the other tutelary deities in his chamber He is also often called Thurinus contemptuously by Mark Antony in his letters to which he makes only this reply I am surprised that my former name should be made a subject of reproach He afterwards assumed the name of Caius Caesar and then of Augustus the former in compliance with the will of his great uncle and the latter upon a motion of Munatius Plancus in the senate For when some proposed to confer upon him the name of Romulus as being in a manner a second founder of the city it was resolved that he should rather be called Augustus a surname not only new but of more dignity because places devoted to religion and those in which anything seventy five is consecrated by augury are denominated august either from the word auctus signifying augmentation or ab avium gestu gustuve from the flight and feeding of birds as appears from this verse of Ennius When glorious Rome by august augury was built one hundred fourteen VIII He lost his father when he was only four years of age and in his twelfth year pronounced a funeral oration in praise of his grand mother Julia Four years afterwards having assumed the robe of manhood he was honoured with several military rewards by Caesar in his African triumph although he took no part in the war on account of his youth Upon his uncle s expedition to Spain against the sons of Pompey he was followed by his nephew although he was scarcely recovered from a dangerous sickness and after being shipwrecked at sea and travelling with very few attendants through roads that were infested with the enemy he at last came up with him This activity gave great satisfaction to his uncle who soon conceived an increasing affection for him on account of such indications of character After the subjugation of Spain while Caesar was meditating an expedition against the Dacians and Parthians he was sent before him to Apollonia where he applied himself to his studies until receiving intelligence that his uncle was murdered and that he was appointed his heir he hesitated for some time whether he should call to his aid the legions stationed in the neighbourhood but he abandoned the design as rash and premature However returning to Rome he took possession of his inheritance although his mother was apprehensive that such a measure might be attended with danger and his step father Marcius Philippus a man of consular rank very earnestly dissuaded him from it From this time collecting together a strong military force he first held the government in conjunction with Mark Antony and Marcus Lepidus then with Antony only for nearly twelve years and at last in his own hands during a period of four and forty IX Having thus given a very short summary of his life I shall prosecute the several parts of it not in order of time but arranging his acts into distinct classes for the sake of seventy six perspicuity He was engaged in five civil wars namely those of Modena Philippi Perugia Sicily and Actium the first and last of which were against Antony and the second against Brutus and Cassius the third against Lucius Antonius the triumvir s brother and the fourth against Sextus Pompeius the son of Cneius Pompeius X The motive which gave rise to all these wars was the opinion he entertained that both his honour and interest were concerned in revenging the murder of his uncle and maintaining the state of affairs he had established Immediately after his return from Apollonia he formed the design of taking forcible and unexpected measures against Brutus and Cassius but they having foreseen the danger and made their escape he resolved to proceed against them by an appeal to the laws in their absence and impeach them for the murder In the mean time those whose province it was to prepare the sports in honour of Caesar s last victory in the civil war not daring to do it he undertook it himself And that he might carry into effect his other designs with greater authority he declared himself a candidate in the room of a tribune of the people who happened to die at that time although he was of a patrician family and had not yet been in the senate But the consul Mark Antony from whom he had expected the greatest assistance opposing him in his suit and even refusing to do him so much as common justice unless gratified with a large bribe he went over to the party of the nobles to whom he perceived Sylla to be odious chiefly for endeavouring to drive Decius Brutus whom he besieged in the town of Modena out of the province which had been given him by Caesar and confirmed to him by the senate At the instigation of persons about him he engaged some ruffians to murder his antagonist but the plot being discovered and dreading a similar attempt upon himself he gained over Caesar s veteran soldiers by distributing among them all the money he could collect Being now commissioned by the senate to command the troops he had gathered with the rank of praetor and in conjunction with Hirtius and Pansa who had accepted the consulship to carry assistance to Decius Brutus he put an end to the war by two battles in three months Antony writes that in the former of these he ran away and two days afterwards made his appearance seventy seven without his general s cloak and his horse In the last battle however it is certain that he performed the part not only of a general but a soldier for in the heat of the battle when the standard bearer of his legion was severely wounded he took the eagle upon his shoulders and carried it a long time XI In this war one hundred fifteen Hirtius being slain in battle and Pansa dying a short time afterwards of a wound a report was circulated that they both were killed through his means in order that when Antony fled the republic having lost its consuls he might have the victorious armies entirely at his own command The death of Pansa was so fully believed to have been caused by undue means that Glyco his surgeon was placed in custody on a suspicion of having poisoned his wound And to this Aquilius Niger adds that he killed Hirtius the other consul in the confusion of the battle with his own hands XII But upon intelligence that Antony after his defeat had been received by Marcus Lepidus and that the rest of the generals and armies had all declared for the senate he without any hesitation deserted from the party of the nobles alleging as an excuse for his conduct the actions and sayings of several amongst them for some said he was a mere boy and others threw out that he ought to be promoted to honours and cut off to avoid the making any suitable acknowledgment either to him or the veteran legions And the more to testify his regret for having before attached himself to the other faction he fined the Nursini in a large sum of money which they were unable to pay and then expelled them from the town for having inscribed upon a monument erected at the public charge to their countrymen who were slain in the battle of Modena That they fell in the cause of liberty XIII Having entered into a confederacy with Antony and Lepidus he brought the war at Philippi to an end in two battles although he was at that time weak and suffering from sickness one hundred sixteen In the first battle he was driven from his camp seventy eight and with some difficulty made his escape to the wing of the army commanded by Antony And now intoxicated with success he sent the head of Brutus one hundred seventeen to be cast at the foot of Caesar s statue and treated the most illustrious of the prisoners not only with cruelty but with abusive language insomuch that he is said to have answered one of them who humbly intreated that at least he might not remain unburied That will be in the power of the birds Two others father and son who begged for their lives he ordered to cast lots which of them should live or settle it between themselves by the sword and was a spectator of both their deaths for the father offering his life to save his son and being accordingly executed the son likewise killed himself upon the spot On this account the rest of the prisoners and amongst them Marcus Favonius Cato s rival being led up in fetters after they had saluted Antony the general with much respect reviled Octavius in the foulest language After this victory dividing between them the offices of the state Mark Antony one hundred eighteen undertook to restore order in the east while Caesar conducted the veteran soldiers back to Italy and settled them in colonies on the lands belonging to the municipalities But he had the misfortune to please neither the soldiers nor the owners of the lands one party complaining of the injustice done them in being violently ejected from their possessions and the other that they were not rewarded according to their merit one hundred nineteen XIV At this time he obliged Lucius Antony who presuming upon his own authority as consul and his brother s power was raising new commotions to fly to Perugia and forced him by famine to surrender at last although not without having been exposed to great hazards both before the war and during its continuance For a common soldier having got into the seats of the equestrian order in the theatre at the public spectacles Caesar ordered him to be removed by an officer and a rumour being thence spread by his enemies that he had seventy nine put the man to death by torture the soldiers flocked together so much enraged that he narrowly escaped with his life The only thing that saved him was the sudden appearance of the man safe and sound no violence having been offered him And whilst he was sacrificing under the walls of Perugia he nearly fell into the hands of a body of gladiators who sallied out of the town XV After the taking of Perugia one hundred twenty he sentenced a great number of the prisoners to death making only one reply to all who implored pardon or endeavoured to excuse themselves You must die Some authors write that three hundred of the two orders selected from the rest were slaughtered like victims before an altar raised to Julius Caesar upon the ides of March fifteenth April one hundred twenty one Nay there are some who relate that he entered upon the war with no other view than that his secret enemies and those whom fear more than affection kept quiet might be detected by declaring themselves now they had an opportunity with Lucius Antony at their head and that having defeated them and confiscated their estates he might be enabled to fulfil his promises to the veteran soldiers XVI He soon commenced the Sicilian war but it was protracted by various delays during a long period one hundred twenty two at one time for the purpose of repairing his fleets which he lost twice by storm even in the summer at another while patching up a peace to which he was forced by the clamours of the people in consequence of a famine occasioned by Pompey s cutting off the supply of corn by sea But at last having built a new fleet and obtained twenty thousand manumitted slaves one hundred twenty three who were given him for the oar he formed the Julian harbour at Baiae by letting the sea into the Lucrine and Avernian lakes and having exercised his forces there during the whole winter he defeated Pompey betwixt Mylae and Naulochus although eighty just as the engagement commenced he suddenly fell into such a profound sleep that his friends were obliged to wake him to give the signal This I suppose gave occasion for Antony s reproach You were not able to take a clear view of the fleet when drawn up in line of battle but lay stupidly upon your back gazing at the sky nor did you get up and let your men see you until Marcus Agrippa had forced the enemies ships to sheer off Others imputed to him both a saying and an action which were indefensible for upon the loss of his fleets by storm he is reported to have said I will conquer in spite of Neptune and at the next Circensian games he would not suffer the statue of that God to be carried in procession as usual Indeed he scarcely ever ran more or greater risks in any of his wars than in this Having transported part of his army to Sicily and being on his return for the rest he was unexpectedly attacked by Demochares and Apollophanes Pompey s admirals from whom he escaped with great difficulty and with one ship only Likewise as he was travelling on foot through the Locrian territory to Rhegium seeing two of Pompey s vessels passing by that coast and supposing them to be his own he went down to the shore and was very nearly taken prisoner On this occasion as he was making his escape by some bye ways a slave belonging to Aemilius Paulus who accompanied him owing him a grudge for the proscription of Paulus the father of Aemilius and thinking he had now an opportunity of revenging it attempted to assassinate him After the defeat of Pompey one of his colleagues one hundred twenty four Marcus Lepidus whom he had summoned to his aid from Africa affecting great superiority because he was at the head of twenty legions and claiming for himself the principal management of affairs in a threatening manner he divested him of his command but upon his humble submission granted him his life but banished him for life to Circeii XVII The alliance between him and Antony which had always been precarious often interrupted and ill cemented by repeated reconciliations he at last entirely dissolved And to make it known to the world how far Antony had degenerated from patriotic feelings he caused a will of his which had been left at Rome and in which he had nominated Cleopatra s children amongst others as his heirs to be opened and read in an assembly of the people Yet upon his being declared an enemy he sent to him all his relations and friends among whom were Caius Sosius and Titus Domitius at that time consuls He likewise spoke favourably in public of the people of Bologna for joining in the association with the rest of Italy to support his cause because they had in former times been under the protection of the family of the Antonii And not long afterwards he defeated him in a naval engagement near Actium which was prolonged to so late an hour that after the victory he was obliged to sleep on board his ship From Actium he went to the isle of Samoa to winter but being alarmed with the accounts of a mutiny amongst the soldiers he had selected from the main body of his army sent to Brundisium after the victory who insisted on their being rewarded for their service and discharged he returned to Italy In his passage thither he encountered two violent storms the first between the promontories of Peloponnesus and Aetolia and the other about the Ceraunian mountains in both which a part of his Liburnian squadron was sunk the spars and rigging of his own ship carried away and the rudder broken in pieces He remained only twenty seven days at Brundisium until the demands of the soldiers were settled and then went by way of Asia and Syria to Egypt where laying siege to Alexandria whither Antony had fled with Cleopatra he made himself master of it in a short time He drove Antony to kill himself after he had used every effort to obtain conditions of peace and he saw his corpse one hundred twenty six Cleopatra he anxiously wished to save for his triumph and when she was supposed to have been bit to death by an asp he sent for the Psylli one hundred twenty seven to eighty two endeavour to suck out the poison He allowed them to be buried together in the same grave and ordered a mausoleum begun by themselves to be completed The eldest of Antony s two sons by Fulvia he commanded to be taken by force from the statue of Julius Caesar to which he had fled after many fruitless supplications for his life and put him to death The same fate attended Caesario Cleopatra s son by Caesar as he pretended who had fled for his life but was retaken The children which Antony had by Cleopatra he saved and brought up and cherished in a manner suitable to their rank just as if they had been his own relations XVIII At this time he had a desire to see the sarcophagus and body of Alexander the Great which for that purpose were taken out of the cell in which they rested one hundred twenty eight and after viewing them for some time he paid honours to the memory of that prince by offering a golden crown and scattering flowers upon the body one hundred twenty nine Being asked if he wished to see the tombs of the Ptolemies also he replied I wish to see a king not dead men one hundred thirty He reduced Egypt into the form of a province and to render it more fertile and more capable of supplying Rome with corn he employed his army to scour the canals into which the Nile upon its rise discharges itself but which during a long series of years had become nearly choked up with mud To perpetuate the glory of his victory at Actium he built the city of Nicopolis on that part of the coast and established games to be celebrated there every five years enlarging likewise an old temple of Apollo he ornamented with naval trophies one hundred thirty one the spot on which he had pitched his camp and consecrated it to Neptune and Mars eighty three XIX He afterwards one hundred thirty two quashed several tumults and insurrections as well as several conspiracies against his life which were discovered by the confession of accomplices before they were ripe for execution and others subsequently Such were those of the younger Lepidus of Varro Muraena and Fannius Caepio then that of Marcus Egnatius afterwards that of Plautius Rufus and of Lucius Paulus his grand daughter s husband and besides these another of Lucius Audasius an old feeble man who was under prosecution for forgery as also of Asinius Epicadus a Parthinian mongrel one hundred thirty three and at last that of Telephus a lady s prompter one hundred thirty four for he was in danger of his life from the plots and conspiracies of some of the lowest of the people against him Audasius and Epicadus had formed the design of carrying off to the armies his daughter Julia and his grandson Agrippa from the islands in which they were confined Telephus wildly dreaming that the government was destined to him by the fates proposed to fall both upon Octavius and the senate Nay once a soldier s servant belonging to the army in Illyricum having passed the porters unobserved was found in the night time standing before his chamber door armed with a hunting dagger Whether the person was really disordered in the head or only counterfeited madness is uncertain for no confession was obtained from him by torture XX He conducted in person only two foreign wars the Dalmatian whilst he was yet but a youth and after Antony s final defeat the Cantabrian He was wounded in the former of these wars in one battle he received a contusion in the right knee from a stone and in another he was much hurt in eighty four one leg and both arms by the fall of a fridge one hundred thirty five His other wars he carried on by his lieutenants but occasionally visited the army in some of the wars of Pannonia and Germany or remained at no great distance proceeding from Rome as far as Ravenna Milan or Aquileia XXI He conquered however partly in person and partly by his lieutenants Cantabria one hundred thirty six Aquitania and Pannonia one hundred thirty seven Dalmatia with all Illyricum and Rhaetia one hundred thirty eight besides the two Alpine nations the Vindelici and the Salassii one hundred thirty nine He also checked the incursions of the Dacians by cutting off three of their generals with vast armies and drove the Germans beyond the river Elbe removing two other tribes who submitted the Ubii and Sicambri into Gaul and settling them in the country bordering on the Rhine Other nations also which broke into revolt he reduced to submission But he never made war upon any nation without just and necessary cause and was so far from being ambitious either to extend the empire or advance his own military glory that he obliged the chiefs of some barbarous tribes to swear in the temple of Mars the Avenger one hundred forty that they would faithfully observe their engagements and not violate the peace which they had implored Of some he demanded a new description of hostages their women having found from experience that they cared little for their men when given as hostages but he always afforded them the means of getting back their hostages whenever they wished it Even those who engaged most frequently and with the greatest perfidy in their rebellion he never punished more severely than by selling their captives on the terms eighty five of their not serving in any neighbouring country nor being released from their slavery before the expiration of thirty years By the character which he thus acquired for virtue and moderation he induced even the Indians and Scythians nations before known to the Romans by report only to solicit his friendship and that of the Roman people by ambassadors The Parthians readily allowed his claim to Armenia restoring at his demand the standards which they had taken from Marcus Crassus and Mark Antony and offering him hostages besides Afterwards when a contest arose between several pretenders to the crown of that kingdom they refused to acknowledge any one who was not chosen by him XXII The temple of Janus Quirinus which had been shut twice only from the era of the building of the city to his own time he closed thrice in a much shorter period having established universal peace both by sea and land He twice entered the city with the honours of an Ovation one hundred forty one namely after the war of Philippi and again after that of Sicily He had also three curule triumphs one hundred forty two for his several victories in eighty six Dalmatia at Actium and Alexandria each of which lasted three days XXIII In all his wars he never received any signal or ignominious defeat except twice in Germany under his lieutenants Lollius and Varus The former indeed had in it more of dishonour than disaster but that of Varus threatened the security of the empire itself three legions with the commander his lieutenants and all the auxiliaries being cut off Upon receiving intelligence of this disaster he gave orders for keeping a strict watch over the city to prevent any public disturbance and prolonged the appointments of the prefects in the provinces that the allies might be kept in order by experience of persons to whom they were used He made a vow to celebrate the great games in honour of Jupiter Optimus Maximus if he would be pleased to restore the state to more prosperous circumstances This had formerly been resorted to in the Cimbrian and Marsian wars In short we are informed that he was in such consternation at this event that he let the hair of his head and beard grow for several months and sometimes knocked his head against the door posts crying out O Quintilius Varus Give me back my legions And eighty seven ever after he observed the anniversary of this calamity as a day of sorrow and mourning XXIV In military affairs he made many alterations introducing some practices entirely new and reviving others which had become obsolete He maintained the strictest discipline among the troops and would not allow even his lieutenants the liberty to visit their wives except reluctantly and in the winter season only A Roman knight having cut off the thumbs of his two young sons to render them incapable of serving in the wars he exposed both him and his estate to public sale But upon observing the farmers of the revenue very greedy for the purchase he assigned him to a freedman of his own that he might send him into the country and suffer him to retain his freedom The tenth legion becoming mutinous he disbanded it with ignominy and did the same by some others which petulantly demanded their discharge withholding from them the rewards usually bestowed on those who had served their stated time in the wars The cohorts which yielded their ground in time of action he decimated and fed with barley Centurions as well as common sentinels who deserted their posts when on guard he punished with death For other misdemeanors he inflicted upon them various kinds of disgrace such as obliging them to stand all day before the praetorium sometimes in their tunics only and without their belts sometimes to carry poles ten feet long or sods of turf XXV After the conclusion of the civil wars he never in any of his military harangues or proclamations addressed them by the title of Fellow soldiers but as Soldiers only Nor would he suffer them to be otherwise called by his sons or step sons when they were in command judging the former epithet to convey the idea of a degree of condescension inconsistent with military discipline the maintenance of order and his own majesty and that of his house Unless at Rome in case of incendiary fires or under the apprehension of public disturbances during a scarcity of provisions he never employed in his army slaves who had been made freedmen except upon two occasions on one for the security of the colonies bordering upon Illyricum and on the other to guard eighty eight the banks of the river Rhine Although he obliged persons of fortune both male and female to give up their slaves and they received their manumission at once yet he kept them together under their own standard unmixed with soldiers who were better born and armed likewise after different fashion Military rewards such as trappings collars and other decorations of gold and silver he distributed more readily than camp or mural crowns which were reckoned more honourable than the former These he bestowed sparingly without partiality and frequently even on common soldiers He presented M Agrippa after the naval engagement in the Sicilian war with a sea green banner Those who shared in the honours of a triumph although they had attended him in his expeditions and taken part in his victories he judged it improper to distinguish by the usual rewards for service because they had a right themselves to grant such rewards to whom they pleased He thought nothing more derogatory to the character of an accomplished general than precipitancy and rashness on which account he had frequently in his mouth those proverbs Speude bradeos Hasten slowly And Asphalaes gar est ameinon hae erasus strataelataes The cautious captain s better than the bold And That is done fast enough which is done well enough He was wont to say also that a battle or a war ought never to be undertaken unless the prospect of gain overbalanced the fear of loss For said he men who pursue small advantages with no small hazard resemble those who fish with a golden hook the loss of which if the line should happen to break could never be compensated by all the fish they might take XXVI He was advanced to public offices before the age at which he was legally qualified for them and to some also of a new kind and for life He seized the consulship in the twentieth year of his age quartering his legions in a threatening manner near the city and sending deputies to demand it for him in the name of the army When the senate demurred eighty nine a centurion named Cornelius who was at the head of the chief deputation throwing back his cloak and shewing the hilt of his sword had the presumption to say in the senate house This will make him consul if ye will not His second consulship he filled nine years afterwards his third after the interval of only one year and held the same office every year successively until the eleventh From this period although the consulship was frequently offered him he always declined it until after a long interval not less than seventeen years he voluntarily stood for the twelfth and two years after that for a thirteenth that he might successively introduce into the forum on their entering public life his two sons Caius and Lucius while he was invested with the highest office in the state In his five consulships from the sixth to the eleventh he continued in office throughout the year but in the rest during only nine six four or three months and in his second no more than a few hours For having sat for a short time in the morning upon the calends of January first January in his curule chair one hundred forty three before the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus he abdicated the office and substituted another in his room Nor did he enter upon them all at Rome but upon the fourth in Asia the fifth in the Isle of Samos and the eighth and ninth at Tarragona one hundred forty four XXVII During ten years he acted as one of the triumvirate for settling the commonwealth in which office he for some time opposed his colleagues in their design of a proscription but after it was begun he prosecuted it with more determined rigour than either of them For whilst they were often prevailed upon by the interest and intercession of friends to shew mercy he alone strongly insisted that no one should be spared and even proscribed Caius Toranius one hundred forty five his guardian who had ninety been formerly the colleague of his father Octavius in the aedileship Junius Saturnius adds this farther account of him that when after the proscription was over Marcus Lepidus made an apology in the senate for their past proceedings and gave them hopes of a more mild administration for the future because they had now sufficiently crushed their enemies he on the other hand declared that the only limit he had fixed to the proscription was that he should be free to act as he pleased Afterwards however repenting of his severity he advanced T Vinius Philopoemen to the equestrian rank for having concealed his patron at the time he was proscribed In this same office he incurred great odium upon many accounts For as he was one day making an harangue observing among the soldiers Pinarius a Roman knight admit some private citizens and engaged in taking notes he ordered him to be stabbed before his eyes as a busy body and a spy upon him He so terrified with his menaces Tedius Afer the consul elect one hundred forty six for having reflected upon some action of his that he threw himself from a great height and died on the spot And when Quintus Gallius the praetor came to compliment him with a double tablet under his cloak suspecting that it was a sword he had concealed and yet not venturing to make a search lest it should be found to be something else he caused him to be dragged from his tribunal by centurions and soldiers and tortured like a slave and although he made no confession ordered him to be put to death after he had with his own hands plucked out his eyes His own account of the matter however is that Quintus Gallius sought a private conference with him for the purpose of assassinating him that he therefore put him in prison but afterwards released him and banished him the city when he perished either in a storm at sea or by falling into the hands of robbers He accepted of the tribunitian power for life but more than once chose a colleague in that office for two lustra one hundred forty seven successively He also had the supervision of morality and observance of the laws for life but without the title of censor yet he thrice ninety one took a census of the people the first and third time with a colleague but the second by himself XXVIII He twice entertained thoughts of restoring the republic one hundred forty eight first immediately after he had crushed Antony remembering that he had often charged him with being the obstacle to its restoration The second time was in consequence of a long illness when he sent for the magistrates and the senate to his own house and delivered them a particular account of the state of the empire But reflecting at the same time that it would be both hazardous to himself to return to the condition of a private person and might be dangerous to the public to have the government placed again under the control of the people he resolved to keep it in his own hands whether with the better event or intention is hard to say His good intentions he often affirmed in private discourse and also published an edict in which it was declared in the following terms May it be permitted me to have the happiness of establishing the commonwealth on a safe and sound basis and thus enjoy the reward of which I am ambitious that of being celebrated for moulding it into the form best adapted to present circumstances so that on my leaving the world I may carry with me the hope that the foundations which I have laid for its future government will stand firm and stable XXIX The city which was not built in a manner suitable to the grandeur of the empire and was liable to inundations of the Tiber one hundred forty nine as well as to fires was so much improved under his administration that he boasted not without reason that he found it of brick but left it of marble one hundred fifty He also rendered ninety two it secure for the time to come against such disasters as far as could be effected by human foresight A great number of public buildings were erected by him the most considerable of which were a forum one hundred fifty one containing the temple of Mars the Avenger the temple of Apollo on the Palatine hill and the temple of Jupiter Tonans in the Capitol The reason of his building a new forum was the vast increase in the population and the number of causes to be tried in the courts for which the two already existing not affording sufficient space it was thought necessary to have a third It was therefore opened for public use before the temple of Mars was completely finished and a law was passed that causes should be tried and judges chosen by lot in that place The temple of Mars was built in fulfilment of a vow made during the war of Philippi undertaken by him to avenge his father s murder He ordained that the senate should always assemble there when they met to deliberate respecting wars and triumphs that thence should be despatched all those who were sent into the provinces in the command of armies and that in it those who returned victorious from the wars should lodge the trophies of their triumphs He erected the temple of Apollo one hundred fifty two in that part of his house on the Palatine hill which had been struck with lightning and which on that account the soothsayers declared the God to have chosen He added porticos to it with a library of Latin and Greek authors one hundred fifty three and when advanced in years ninety three used frequently there to hold the senate and examine the rolls of the judges He dedicated the temple to Apollo Tonans one hundred fifty four in acknowledgment of his escape from a great danger in his Cantabrian expedition when as he was travelling in the night his litter was struck by lightning which killed the slave who carried a torch before him He likewise constructed some public buildings in the name of others for instance his grandsons his wife and sister Thus he built the portico and basilica of Lucius and Caius and the porticos of Livia and Octavia one hundred fifty five and the theatre of Marcellus one hundred fifty six He also often exhorted other persons of rank to embellish the city by new buildings or repairing and improving the old according to their means In consequence of this recommendation many were raised such as the temple of Hercules and the Muses by Marcius Philippus a temple of Diana by Lucius Cornificius the Court of Freedom by Asinius Pollio a temple of Saturn by Munatius Plancus a theatre by Cornelius Balbus one hundred fifty seven an amphitheatre by Statilius Taurus and several other noble edifices by Marcus Agrippa one hundred fifty eight ninety four XXX He divided the city into regions and districts ordaining that the annual magistrates should take by lot the charge of the former and that the latter should be superintended by wardens chosen out of the people of each neighbourhood He appointed a nightly watch to be on their guard against accidents from fire and to prevent the frequent inundations he widened and cleansed the bed of the Tiber which had in the course of years been almost dammed up with rubbish and the channel narrowed by the ruins of houses one hundred fifty nine To render the approaches to the city more commodious he took upon himself the charge of repairing the Flaminian way as far as Ariminum one hundred sixty and distributed the repairs of the other roads amongst several persons who had obtained the honour of a triumph to be defrayed out of the money arising from the spoils of war Temples decayed by time or destroyed by fire he either repaired or rebuilt and enriched them as well as many others with splendid offerings On a single occasion he deposited in the cell of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus sixteen thousand pounds of gold with jewels and pearls to the amount of fifty millions of sesterces XXXI The office of Pontifex Maximus of which he could ninety five not decently deprive Lepidus as long as he lived one hundred sixty one he assumed as soon as he was dead He then caused all prophetical books both in Latin and Greek the authors of which were either unknown or of no great authority to be brought in and the whole collection amounting to upwards of two thousand volumes he committed to the flames preserving only the Sibylline oracles but not even those without a strict examination to ascertain which were genuine This being done he deposited them in two gilt coffers under the pedestal of the statue of the Palatine Apollo He restored the calendar which had been corrected by Julius Caesar but through negligence was again fallen into confusion one hundred sixty two to its former regularity and upon that occasion called the month Sextilis one hundred sixty three by his own name August rather than September in which he was born because in it he had obtained his first consulship and all his most considerable victories one hundred sixty four He increased the number dignity and revenues of the priests and especially those of the Vestal Virgins And when upon the death of one of them a new one was to be taken one hundred sixty five and many persons made interest that their daughters names might be omitted in the lists for election he replied with an oath If either of my own grand daughters were old enough I would have proposed her He likewise revived some old religious customs which had become obsolete as the augury of public health one hundred sixty six the office of ninety six high priest of Jupiter the religious solemnity of the Lupercalia with the Secular and Compitalian games He prohibited young boys from running in the Lupercalia and in respect of the Secular games issued an order that no young persons of either sex should appear at any public diversions in the night time unless in the company of some elderly relation He ordered the household gods to be decked twice a year with spring and summer flowers one hundred sixty seven in the Compitalian festival Next to the immortal gods he paid the highest honours to the memory of those generals who had raised the Roman state from its low origin to the highest pitch of grandeur He accordingly repaired or rebuilt the public edifices erected by them preserving the former inscriptions and placing statues of them all with triumphal emblems in both the porticos of his forum issuing an edict on the occasion in which he made the following declaration My design in so doing is that the Roman people may require from me and all succeeding princes a conformity to those illustrious examples He likewise removed the statue of Pompey from the senate house in which Caius Caesar had been killed and placed it under a marble arch fronting the palace attached to Pompey s theatre XXXII He corrected many ill practices which to the detriment of the public had either survived the licentious habits of the late civil wars or else originated in the long peace Bands of robbers showed themselves openly completely armed under colour of self defence and in different parts of the country travellers freemen and slaves without distinction were forcibly carried off and kept to work in the houses of correction one hundred sixty eight Several associations were formed under the specious ninety seven name of a new college which banded together for the perpetration of all kinds of villany The banditti he quelled by establishing posts of soldiers in suitable stations for the purpose the houses of correction were subjected to a strict superintendence all associations those only excepted which were of ancient standing and recognised by the laws were dissolved He burnt all the notes of those who had been a long time in arrear with the treasury as being the principal source of vexatious suits and prosecutions Places in the city claimed by the public where the right was doubtful he adjudged to the actual possessors He struck out of the list of criminals the names of those over whom prosecutions had been long impending where nothing further was intended by the informers than to gratify their own malice by seeing their enemies humiliated laying it down as a rule that if any one chose to renew a prosecution he should incur the risk of the punishment which he sought to inflict And that crimes might not escape punishment nor business be neglected by delay he ordered the courts to sit during the thirty days which were spent in celebrating honorary games To the three classes of judges then existing he added a fourth consisting of persons of inferior order who were called Ducenarii and decided all litigations about trifling sums He chose judges from the age of thirty years and upwards that is five years younger than had been usual before And a great many declining the office he was with much difficulty prevailed upon to allow each class of judges a twelve month s vacation in turn and the courts to be shut during the months of November and December one hundred sixty nine XXXIII He was himself assiduous in his functions as a judge and would sometimes prolong his sittings even into the night one hundred seventy if he were indisposed his litter was placed before ninety eight the tribunal or he administered justice reclining on his couch at home displaying always not only the greatest attention but extreme lenity To save a culprit who evidently appeared guilty of parricide from the extreme penalty of being sewn up in a sack because none were punished in that manner but such as confessed the fact he is said to have interrogated him thus Surely you did not kill your father did you And when in a trial of a cause about a forged will all those who had signed it were liable to the penalty of the Cornelian law he ordered that his colleagues on the tribunal should not only be furnished with the two tablets by which they decided guilty or not guilty but with a third likewise ignoring the offence of those who should appear to have given their signatures through any deception or mistake All appeals in causes between inhabitants of Rome he assigned every year to the praetor of the city and where provincials were concerned to men of consular rank to one of whom the business of each province was referred XXXIV Some laws he abrogated and he made some new ones such as the sumptuary law that relating to adultery and the violation of chastity the law against bribery in elections and likewise that for the encouragement of marriage Having been more severe in his reform of this law than the rest he found the people utterly averse to submit to it unless the penalties were abolished or mitigated besides allowing an interval of three years after a wife s death and increasing the premiums on marriage The equestrian order clamoured loudly at a spectacle in the theatre for its total repeal whereupon he sent for the children of Germanicus and shewed them partly sitting upon his own lap and partly on their father s intimating by his looks and gestures that they ought not to think it a grievance to follow the example of that young man But finding that the force of the law was eluded by marrying girls under the age of puberty and by frequent change of wives he limited the time for consummation after espousals and imposed restrictions on divorce XXXV By two separate scrutinies he reduced to their former number and splendour the senate which had been swamped by a disorderly crowd for they were now more than a ninety nine thousand and some of them very mean persons who after Caesar s death had been chosen by dint of interest and bribery so that they had the nickname of Orcini among the people one hundred seventy one The first of these scrutinies was left to themselves each senator naming another but the last was conducted by himself and Agrippa On this occasion he is believed to have taken his seat as he presided with a coat of mail under his tunic and a sword by his side and with ten of the stoutest men of senatorial rank who were his friends standing round his chair Cordus Cremutius one hundred seventy two relates that no senator was suffered to approach him except singly and after having his bosom searched for secreted daggers Some he obliged to have the grace of declining the office these he allowed to retain the privileges of wearing the distinguishing dress occupying the seats at the solemn spectacles and of feasting publicly reserved to the senatorial order one hundred seventy three That those who were chosen and approved of might perform their functions under more solemn obligations and with less inconvenience he ordered that every senator before he took his seat in the house should pay his devotions with an offering of frankincense and wine at the altar of that God in whose temple the senate then assembled one hundred seventy four and that their stated meetings should be only twice in the month namely on the calends and ides and that in the months of September and October one hundred seventy five a certain number only chosen by lot such as the law required to give validity to a decree should be required to attend For himself he resolved to choose every six one hundred months a new council with whom he might consult previously upon such affairs as he judged proper at any time to lay before the full senate He also took the votes of the senators upon any subject of importance not according to custom nor in regular order but as he pleased that every one might hold himself ready to give his opinion rather than a mere vote of assent XXXVI He also made several other alterations in the management of public affairs among which were these following that the acts of the senate should not be published one hundred seventy six that the magistrates should not be sent into the provinces immediately after the expiration of their office that the proconsuls should have a certain sum assigned them out of the treasury for mules and tents which used before to be contracted for by the government with private persons that the management of the treasury should be transferred from the city quaestors to the praetors or those who had already served in the latter office and that the decemviri should call together the court of One hundred which had been formerly summoned by those who had filled the office of quaestor XXXVII To augment the number of persons employed in the administration of the state he devised several new offices such as surveyors of the public buildings of the roads the aqueducts and the bed of the Tiber for the distribution of corn to the people the praefecture of the city a triumvirate for the election of the senators and another for inspecting the several troops of the equestrian order as often as it was necessary He revived the office of censor one hundred seventy seven which had been long disused and increased the number of praetors He likewise required that whenever the consulship was conferred on him he should have two colleagues instead of one but his proposal one hundred one was rejected all the senators declaring by acclamation that he abated his high majesty quite enough in not filling the office alone and consenting to share it with another XXXVIII He was unsparing in the reward of military merit having granted to above thirty generals the honour of the greater triumph besides which he took care to have triamphal decorations voted by the senate for more than that number That the sons of senators might become early acquainted with the administration of affairs he permitted them at the age when they took the garb of manhood one hundred seventy eight to assume also the distinction of the senatorian robe with its broad border and to be present at the debates in the senate house When they entered the military service he not only gave them the rank of military tribunes in the legions but likewise the command of the auxiliary horse And that all might have an opportunity of acquiring military experience he commonly joined two sons of senators in command of each troop of horse He frequently reviewed the troops of the equestrian order reviving the ancient custom of a cavalcade one hundred seventy nine which had been long laid aside But he did not suffer any one to be obliged by an accuser to dismount while he passed in review as had formerly been the practice As for such as were infirm with age or one hundred two any way deformed he allowed them to send their horses before them coming on foot to answer to their names when the muster roll was called over soon afterwards He permitted those who had attained the age of thirty five years and desired not to keep their horse any longer to have the privilege of giving it up XXXIX With the assistance of ten senators he obliged each of the Roman knights to give an account of his life in regard to those who fell under his displeasure some were punished others had a mark of infamy set against their names The most part he only reprimanded but not in the same terms The mildest mode of reproof was by delivering them tablets one hundred eighty the contents of which confined to themselves they were to read on the spot Some he disgraced for borrowing money at low interest and letting it out again upon usurious profit XL In the election of tribunes of the people if there was not a sufficient number of senatorian candidates he nominated others from the equestrian order granting them the liberty after the expiration of their office to continue in whichsoever of the two orders they pleased As most of the knights had been much reduced in their estates by the civil wars and therefore durst not sit to see the public games in the theatre in the seats allotted to their order for fear of the penalty provided by the law in that case he enacted that none were liable to it who had themselves or whose parents had ever possessed a knight s estate He took the census of the Roman people street by street and that the people might not be too often taken from their business to receive the distribution of corn it was his intention to deliver tickets three times a year for four months respectively but at their request he continued the former regulation that they should receive their one hundred three share monthly He revived the former law of elections endeavouring by various penalties to suppress the practice of bribery Upon the day of election he distributed to the freemen of the Fabian and Scaptian tribes in which he himself was enrolled a thousand sesterces each that they might look for nothing from any of the candidates Considering it of extreme importance to preserve the Roman people pure and untainted with a mixture of foreign or servile blood he not only bestowed the freedom of the city with a sparing hand but laid some restriction upon the practice of manumitting slaves When Tiberius interceded with him for the freedom of Rome in behalf of a Greek client of his he wrote to him for answer I shall not grant it unless he comes himself and satisfies me that he has just grounds for the application And when Livia begged the freedom of the city for a tributary Gaul he refused it but offered to release him from payment of taxes saying I shall sooner suffer some loss in my exchequer than that the citizenship of Rome be rendered too common Not content with interposing many obstacles to either the partial or complete emancipation of slaves by quibbles respecting the number condition and difference of those who were to be manumitted he likewise enacted that none who had been put in chains or tortured should ever obtain the freedom of the city in any degree He endeavoured also to restore the old habit and dress of the Romans and upon seeing once in an assembly of the people a crowd in grey cloaks one hundred eighty one he exclaimed with indignation See there Romanos rerum dominos gentemque togatem one hundred eighty two Rome s conquering sons lords of the wide spread globe Stalk proudly in the toga s graceful robe And he gave orders to the ediles not to permit in future any Roman to be present in the forum or circus unless they took off their short coats and wore the toga one hundred four XLI He displayed his munificence to all ranks of the people on various occasions Moreover upon his bringing the treasure belonging to the kings of Egypt into the city in his Alexandrian triumph he made money so plentiful that interest fell and the price of land rose considerably And afterwards as often as large sums of money came into his possession by means of confiscations he would lend it free of interest for a fixed term to such as could give security for the double of what was borrowed The estate necessary to qualify a senator instead of eight hundred thousand sesterces the former standard he ordered for the future to be twelve hundred thousand and to those who had not so much he made good the deficiency He often made donations to the people but generally of different sums sometimes four hundred sometimes three hundred or two hundred and fifty sesterces upon which occasions he extended his bounty even to young boys who before were not used to receive anything until they arrived at eleven years of age In a scarcity of corn he would frequently let them have it at a very low price or none at all and doubled the number of the money tickets XLII But to show that he was a prince who regarded more the good of his people than their applause he reprimanded them very severely upon their complaining of the scarcity and dearness of wine My son in law Agrippa he said has sufficiently provided for quenching your thirst by the great plenty of water with which he has supplied the town Upon their demanding a gift which he had promised them he said I am a man of my word But upon their importuning him for one which he had not promised he issued a proclamation upbraiding them for their scandalous impudence at the same time telling them I shall now give you nothing whatever I may have intended to do With the same strict firmness when upon a promise he had made of a donative he found many slaves had been emancipated and enrolled amongst the citizens he declared that no one should receive anything who was not included in the promise and he gave the rest less than he had promised them in order that the amount he had set apart might hold out On one occasion in a season of great scarcity which it was difficult to remedy he ordered out of the city the troops of slaves brought for sale the gladiators one hundred five belonging to the masters of defence and all foreigners excepting physicians and the teachers of the liberal sciences Part of the domestic slaves were likewise ordered to be dismissed When at last plenty was restored he writes thus I was much inclined to abolish for ever the practice of allowing the people corn at the public expense because they trust so much to it that they are too lazy to till their lands but I did not persevere in my design as I felt sure that the practice would some time or other be revived by some one ambitious of popular favour However he so managed the affair ever afterwards that as much account was taken of husbandmen and traders as of the idle populace one hundred eighty three XLIII In the number variety and magnificence of his public spectacles he surpassed all former example Four and twenty times he says he treated the people with games upon his own account and three and twenty times for such magistrates as were either absent or not able to afford the expense The performances took place sometimes in the different streets of the city and upon several stages by players in all languages The same he did not only in the forum and amphitheatre but in the circus likewise and in the septa one hundred eighty four and sometimes he exhibited only the hunting of wild beasts He entertained the people with wrestlers in the Campus Martius where wooden seats were erected for the purpose and also with a naval fight for which he excavated the ground near the Tiber where there is now the grove of the Caesars During these two entertainments he stationed guards in the city lest by robbers taking advantage of the small number of people left at home it might be exposed to depredations In the circus he exhibited chariot and foot races and combats with wild beasts in which the performers were often youths of the highest rank His favourite spectacle was the Trojan game acted by a select number of boys in parties differing in age and station thinking one hundred six that it was a practice both excellent in itself and sanctioned by ancient usage that the spirit of the young nobles should be displayed in such exercises Caius Nonius Asprenas who was lamed by a fall in this diversion he presented with a gold collar and allowed him and his posterity to bear the surname of Torquati But soon afterwards he gave up the exhibition of this game in consequence of a severe and bitter speech made in the senate by Asinius Pollio the orator in which he complained bitterly of the misfortune of Aeserninus his grandson who likewise broke his leg in the same diversion Sometimes he engaged Roman knights to act upon the stage or to fight as gladiators but only before the practice was prohibited by a decree of the senate Thenceforth the only exhibition he made of that kind was that of a young man named Lucius of a good family who was not quite two feet in height and weighed only seventeen pounds but had a stentorian voice In one of his public spectacles he brought the hostages of the Parthians the first ever sent to Rome from that nation through the middle of the amphitheatre and placed them in the second tier of seats above him He used likewise at times when there were no public entertainments if any thing was brought to Rome which was uncommon and might gratify curiosity to expose it to public view in any place whatever as he did a rhinoceros in the Septa a tiger upon a stage and a snake fifty cubits lung in the Comitium It happened in the Circensian games which he performed in consequence of a vow that he was taken ill and obliged to attend the Thensae one hundred eighty five reclining on a litter Another time in the games celebrated for the opening of the theatre of Marcellus the joints of his curule chair happening to give way he fell on his back And in the games exhibited by his one hundred seven grandsons when the people were in such consternation by an alarm raised that the theatre was falling that all his efforts to re assure them and keep them quiet failed he moved from his place and seated himself in that part of the theatre which was thought to be exposed to most danger XLIV He corrected the confusion and disorder with which the spectators took their seats at the public games after an affront which was offered to a senator at Puteoli for whom in a crowded theatre no one would make room He therefore procured a decree of the senate that in all public spectacles of any sort and in any place whatever the first tier of benches should be left empty for the accommodation of senators He would not even permit the ambassadors of free nations nor of those which were allies of Rome to sit in the orchestra having found that some manumitted slaves had been sent under that character He separated the soldiery from the rest of the people and assigned to married plebeians their particular rows of seats To the boys he assigned their own benches and to their tutors the seats which were nearest it ordering that none clothed in black should sit in the centre of the circle one hundred eighty six Nor would he allow any women to witness the combats of gladiators except from the upper part of the theatre although they formerly used to take their places promiscuously with the rest of the spectators To the vestal virgins he granted seats in the theatre reserved for them only opposite the praetor s bench He excluded however the whole female sex from seeing the wrestlers so that in the games which he exhibited upon his accession to the office of high priest he deferred producing a pair of combatants which the people called for until the next morning and intimated by proclamation his pleasure that no woman should appear in the theatre before five o clock XLV He generally viewed the Circensian games himself from the upper rooms of the houses of his friends or freedmen sometimes from the place appointed for the statues of the gods and sitting in company with his wife and children He one hundred eight occasionally absented himself from the spectacles for several hours and sometimes for whole days but not without first making an apology and appointing substitutes to preside in his stead When present he never attended to anything else either to avoid the reflections which he used to say were commonly made upon his father Caesar for perusing letters and memorials and making rescripts during the spectacles or from the real pleasure he took in attending those exhibitions of which he made no secret he often candidly owning it This he manifested frequently by presenting honorary crowns and handsome rewards to the best performers in the games exhibited by others and he never was present at any performance of the Greeks without rewarding the most deserving according to their merit He took particular pleasure in witnessing pugilistic contests especially those of the Latins not only between combatants who had been trained scientifically whom he used often to match with the Greek champions but even between mobs of the lower classes fighting in streets and tilting at random without any knowledge of the art In short he honoured with his patronage all sorts of people who contributed in any way to the success of the public entertainments He not only maintained but enlarged the privileges of the wrestlers He prohibited combats of gladiators where no quarter was given He deprived the magistrates of the power of correcting the stage players which by an ancient law was allowed them at all times and in all places restricting their jurisdiction entirely to the time of performance and misdemeanours in the theatres He would however admit of no abatement and exacted with the utmost rigour the greatest exertions of the wrestlers and gladiators in their several encounters He went so far in restraining the licentiousness of stage players that upon discovering that Stephanio a performer of the highest class had a married woman with her hair cropped and dressed in boy s clothes to wait upon him at table he ordered him to be whipped through all the three theatres and then banished him Hylas an actor of pantomimes upon a complaint against him by the praetor he commanded to be scourged in the court of his own house which however was open to the public And Pylades he not only banished from the city but from Italy also for pointing with his finger at a spectator by whom he was hissed and turning the eyes of the audience upon him one hundred nine XLVI Having thus regulated the city and its concerns he augmented the population of Italy by planting in it no less than twenty eight colonies one hundred eighty seven and greatly improved it by public works and a beneficial application of the revenues In rights and privileges he rendered it in a measure equal to the city itself by inventing a new kind of suffrage which the principal officers and magistrates of the colonies might take at home and forward under seal to the city against the time of the elections To increase the number of persons of condition and of children among the lower ranks he granted the petitions of all those who requested the honour of doing military service on horseback as knights provided their demands were seconded by the recommendation of the town in which they lived and when he visited the several districts of Italy he distributed a thousand sesterces a head to such of the lower class as presented him with sons or daughters XLVII The more important provinces which could not with ease or safety be entrusted to the government of annual magistrates he reserved for his own administration the rest he distributed by lot amongst the proconsuls but sometimes he made exchanges and frequently visited most of both kinds in person Some cities in alliance with Rome but which by their great licentiousness were hastening to ruin he deprived of their independence Others which were much in debt he relieved and rebuilt such as had been destroyed by earthquakes To those that could produce any instance of their having deserved well of the Roman people he presented the freedom of Latium or even that of the City There is not I believe a province except Africa and Sardinia which he did not visit After forcing Sextus Pompeius to take refuge in those provinces he was indeed preparing to cross over from Sicily to them but was prevented by continual and violent storms and afterwards there was no occasion or call for such a voyage XLVIII Kingdoms of which he had made himself master by the right of conquest a few only excepted he either restored to their former possessors one hundred eighty eight or conferred upon aliens Between one hundred ten kings of alliance with Rome he encouraged most intimate union being always ready to promote or favour any proposal of marriage or friendship amongst them and indeed treated them all with the same consideration as if they were members and parts of the empire To such of them as were minors or lunatics he appointed guardians until they arrived at age or recovered their senses and the sons of many of them he brought up and educated with his own XLIX With respect to the army he distributed the legions and auxiliary troops throughout the several provinces he stationed a fleet at Misenum and another at Ravenna for the protection of the Upper and Lower Seas one hundred eighty nine A certain number of the forces were selected to occupy the posts in the city and partly for his own body guard but he dismissed the Spanish guard which he retained about him till the fall of Antony and also the Germans whom he had amongst his guards until the defeat of Varus Yet he never permitted a greater force than three cohorts in the city and had no pretorian camps one hundred ninety The rest he quartered in the neighbourhood of the nearest towns in winter and summer camps All the troops throughout the empire he reduced to one fixed model with regard to their pay and their pensions determining these according to their rank in the army the time they had served and their private means so that after their discharge they might not be tempted by age or necessities to join the agitators for a revolution For the purpose of providing a fund always ready to meet their pay and pensions he instituted a military exchequer and appropriated new taxes to that object In order to obtain the earliest intelligence of what was passing in the provinces he established posts consisting at first of young men stationed at moderate distances along the military roads and afterwards of regular couriers with fast vehicles which appeared to him the most commodious because the persons who were the bearers of dispatches written on the spot might then be questioned about the business as occasion occurred L In sealing letters patent rescripts or epistles he at first used the figure of a sphinx afterwards the head of Alexander one hundred eleven the Great and at last his own engraved by the hand of Dioscorides which practice was retained by the succeeding emperors He was extremely precise in dating his letters putting down exactly the time of the day or night at which they were dispatched LI Of his clemency and moderation there are abundant and signal instances For not to enumerate how many and what persons of the adverse party he pardoned received into favour and suffered to rise to the highest eminence in the state he thought it sufficient to punish Junius Novatus and Cassius Patavinus who were both plebeians one of them with a fine and the other with an easy banishment although the former had published in the name of young Agrippa a very scurrilous letter against him and the other declared openly at an entertainment where there was a great deal of company that he neither wanted inclination nor courage to stab him In the trial of Aemilius Aelianus of Cordova when among other charges exhibited against him it was particularly insisted upon that he used to calumniate Caesar he turned round to the accuser and said with an air and tone of passion I wish you could make that appear I shall let Aelianus know that I have a tongue too and shall speak sharper of him than he ever did of me Nor did he either then or afterwards make any farther inquiry into the affair And when Tiberius in a letter complained of the affront with great earnestness he returned him an answer in the following terms Do not my dear Tiberius give way to the ardour of youth in this affair nor be so indignant that any person should speak ill of me It is enough for us if we can prevent any one from really doing us mischief LII Although he knew that it had been customary to decree temples in honour of the proconsuls yet he would not permit them to be erected in any of the provinces unless in the joint names of himself and Rome Within the limits of the city he positively refused any honour of that kind He melted down all the silver statues which had been erected to him and converted the whole into tripods which he consecrated to the Palatine Apollo And when the people importuned him to accept the dictatorship he bent down on one knee with his toga thrown over his shoulders and his breast exposed to view begging to be excused one hundred twelve LIII He always abhorred the title of Lord one hundred ninety one as ill omened and offensive And when in a play performed at the theatre at which he was present these words were introduced O just and gracious lord and the whole company with joyful acclamations testified their approbation of them as applied to him he instantly put a stop to their indecent flattery by waving his hand and frowning sternly and next day publicly declared his displeasure in a proclamation He never afterwards would suffer himself to be addressed in that manner even by his own children or grand children either in jest or earnest and forbad them the use of all such complimentary expressions to one another He rarely entered any city or town or departed from it except in the evening or the night to avoid giving any person the trouble of complimenting him During his consulships he commonly walked the streets on foot but at other times rode in a close carriage He admitted to court even plebeians in common with people of the higher ranks receiving the petitions of those who approached him with so much affability that he once jocosely rebuked a man by telling him You present your memorial with as much hesitation as if you were offering money to an elephant On senate days he used to pay his respects to the Conscript Fathers only in the house addressing them each by name as they sat without any prompter and on his departure he bade each of them farewell while they retained their seats In the same manner he maintained with many of them a constant intercourse of mutual civilities giving them his company upon occasions of any particular festivity in their families until he became advanced in years and was incommoded by the crowd at a wedding Being informed that Gallus Terrinius a senator with whom he had only a slight acquaintance had suddenly lost his sight and under that privation had resolved to starve himself to death he paid him a visit and by his consolatory admonitions diverted him from his purpose LIV On his speaking in the senate he has been told by one hundred thirteen one of the members I did not understand you and by another I would contradict you could I do it with safety And sometimes upon his being so much offended at the heat with which the debates were conducted in the senate as to quit the house in anger some of the members have repeatedly exclaimed Surely the senators ought to have liberty of speech on matters of government Antistius Labeo in the election of a new senate when each as he was named chose another nominated Marcus Lepidus who had formerly been Augustus s enemy and was then in banishment and being asked by the latter Is there no other person more deserving he replied Every man has his own opinion Nor was any one ever molested for his freedom of speech although it was carried to the extent of insolence LV Even when some infamous libels against him were dispersed in the senate house he was neither disturbed nor did he give himself much trouble to refute them He would not so much as order an enquiry to be made after the authors but only proposed that for the future those who published libels or lampoons in a borrowed name against any person should be called to account LVI Being provoked by some petulant jests which were designed to render him odious he answered them by a proclamation and yet he prevented the senate from passing an act to restrain the liberties which were taken with others in people s wills Whenever he attended at the election of magistrates he went round the tribes with the candidates of his nomination and begged the votes of the people in the usual manner He likewise gave his own vote in his tribe as one of the people He suffered himself to be summoned as a witness upon trials and not only to be questioned but to be cross examined with the utmost patience In building his Forum he restricted himself in the site not presuming to compel the owners of the neighbouring houses to give up their property He never recommended his sons to the people without adding these words If they deserve it And upon the audience rising on their entering the theatre while they were yet minors and giving them applause in a standing position he made it a matter of serious complaint one hundred fourteen He was desirous that his friends should be great and powerful in the state but have no exclusive privileges or be exempt from the laws which governed others When Asprenas Nonius an intimate friend of his was tried upon a charge of administering poison at the instance of Cassius Severus he consulted the senate for their opinion what was his duty under the circumstances For said he I am afraid lest if I should stand by him in the cause I may be supposed to screen a guilty man and if I do not to desert and prejudge a friend With the unanimous concurrence therefore of the senate he took his seat amongst his advocates for several hours but without giving him the benefit of speaking to character as was usual He likewise appeared for his clients as on behalf of Scutarius an old soldier of his who brought an action for slander He never relieved any one from prosecution but in a single instance in the case of a man who had given information of the conspiracy of Muraena and that he did only by prevailing upon the accuser in open court to drop his prosecution LVII How much he was beloved for his worthy conduct in all these respects it is easy to imagine I say nothing of the decrees of the senate in his honour which may seem to have resulted from compulsion or deference The Roman knights voluntarily and with one accord always celebrated his birth for two days together and all ranks of the people yearly in performance of a vow they had made threw a piece of money into the Curtian lake one hundred ninety two as an offering for his welfare They likewise on the calends first of January presented for his acceptance new year s gifts in the Capitol though he was not present with which donations he purchased some costly images of the Gods which he erected in several streets of the city as that of Apollo Sandaliarius Jupiter Tragoedus one hundred ninety three and others When his house on the Palatine hill was accidentally destroyed by fire the veteran soldiers the judges the tribes and even the people individually contributed according to the ability of each for rebuilding it but he would one hundred fifteen accept only of some small portion out of the several sums collected and refused to take from any one person more than a single denarius one hundred ninety four Upon his return home from any of the provinces they attended him not only with joyful acclamations but with songs It is also remarked that as often as he entered the city the infliction of punishment was suspended for the time LVIII The whole body of the people upon a sudden impulse and with unanimous consent offered him the title of FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY It was announced to him first at Antium by a deputation from the people and upon his declining the honour they repeated their offer on his return to Rome in a full theatre when they were crowned with laurel The senate soon afterwards adopted the proposal not in the way of acclamation or decree but by commissioning M Messala in an unanimous vote to compliment him with it in the following terms With hearty wishes for the happiness and prosperity of yourself and your family Caesar Augustus for we think we thus most effectually pray for the lasting welfare of the state the senate in agreement with the Roman people salute you by the title of FATHER OF YOUR COUNTRY To this compliment Augustus replied with tears in his eyes in these words for I give them exactly as I have done those of Messala Having now arrived at the summit of my wishes O Conscript Fathers one hundred ninety five what else have I to beg of the Immortal one hundred sixteen Gods but the continuance of this your affection for me to the last moments of my life LIX To the physician Antonius Musa one hundred ninety six who had cured him of a dangerous illness they erected a statue near that of Aesculapius by a general subscription Some heads of families ordered in their wills that their heirs should lead victims to the Capitol with a tablet carried before them and pay their vows Because Augustus still survived Some Italian cities appointed the day upon which he first visited them to be thenceforth the beginning of their year And most of the provinces besides erecting temples and altars instituted games to be celebrated to his honour in most towns every five years LX The kings his friends and allies built cities in their respective kingdoms to which they gave the name of Caesarea and all with one consent resolved to finish at their common expense the temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens which had been begun long before and consecrate it to his Genius They frequently also left their kingdoms laid aside the badges of royalty and assuming the toga attended and paid their respects to him daily in the manner of clients to their patrons not only at Rome but when he was travelling through the provinces LXI Having thus given an account of the manner in which he filled his public offices both civil and military and his conduct in the government of the empire both in peace and war I shall now describe his private and domestic life his habits at home and among his friends and dependents and the fortune attending him in those scenes of retirement from his youth to the day of his death He lost his mother in his first consulship and his sister Octavia when he was in the fifty fourth year of his age one hundred ninety seven He behaved towards them both with the utmost kindness whilst living and after their decease paid the highest honours to their memory one hundred seventeen LXII He was contracted when very young to the daughter of Publius Servilius Isauricus but upon his reconciliation with Antony after their first rupture one hundred ninety eight the armies on both sides insisting on a family alliance between them he married Antony s step daughter Claudia the daughter of Fulvia by Publius Claudius although at that time she was scarcely marriageable and upon a difference arising with his mother in law Fulvia he divorced her untouched and a pure virgin Soon afterwards he took to wife Scribonia who had before been twice married to men of consular rank one hundred ninety nine and was a mother by one of them With her likewise he parted two hundred being quite tired out as he himself writes with the perverseness of her temper and immediately took Livia Drusilla though then pregnant from her husband Tiberius Nero and she had never any rival in his love and esteem LXIII By Scribonia he had a daughter named Julia but no children by Livia although extremely desirous of issue She indeed conceived once but miscarried He gave his daughter Julia in the first instance to Marcellus his sister s son who had just completed his minority and after his death to Marcus Agrippa having prevailed with his sister to yield her son in law to his wishes for at that time Agrippa was married to one of the Marcellas and had children by her Agrippa dying also he for a long time thought of several matches for Julia in even the equestrian order and at last resolved upon selecting Tiberius for his step son and he obliged him to part with his wife at that time pregnant and who had already brought him a child Mark Antony writes That he first contracted Julia to his son and afterwards to Cotiso king of the Getae two hundred one demanding at the same time the king s daughter in marriage for himself one hundred eighteen LXIV He had three grandsons by Agrippa and Julia namely Caius Lucius and Agrippa and two grand daughters Julia and Agrippina Julia he married to Lucius Paulus the censor s son and Agrippina to Germanicus his sister s grandson Caius and Lucius he adopted at home by the ceremony of purchase two hundred two from their father advanced them while yet very young to offices in the state and when they were consuls elect sent them to visit the provinces and armies In bringing up his daughter and grand daughters he accustomed them to domestic employments and even spinning and obliged them to speak and act every thing openly before the family that it might be put down in the diary He so strictly prohibited them from all converse with strangers that he once wrote a letter to Lucius Vinicius a handsome young man of a good family in which he told him You have not behaved very modestly in making a visit to my daughter at Baiae He usually instructed his grandsons himself in reading swimming and other rudiments of knowledge and he laboured nothing more than to perfect them in the imitation of his hand writing He never supped but he had them sitting at the foot of his couch nor ever travelled but with them in a chariot before him or riding beside him LXV But in the midst of all his joy and hopes in his numerous and well regulated family his fortune failed him The two Julias his daughter and grand daughter abandoned themselves to such courses of lewdness and debauchery that he banished them both Caius and Lucius he lost within the space of eighteen months the former dying in Lycia and the latter at Marseilles His third grandson Agrippa with his step son Tiberius he adopted in the forum by a law passed for the purpose by the Sections two hundred three but he soon afterwards discarded Agrippa for his coarse and unruly temper and confined him at Surrentum He bore the death of his relations with more patience than he did their disgrace for he was not overwhelmed by the loss of Caius and Lucius but in the case of his daughter he stated the facts to the senate in a message read to them by one hundred nineteen the quaestor not having the heart to be present himself indeed he was so much ashamed of her infamous conduct that for some time he avoided all company and had thoughts of putting her to death It is certain that when one Phoebe a freed woman and confidant of hers hanged herself about the same time he said I had rather be the father of Phoebe than of Julia In her banishment he would not allow her the use of wine nor any luxury in dress nor would he suffer her to be waited upon by any male servant either freeman or slave without his permission and having received an exact account of his age stature complexion and what marks or scars he had about him At the end of five years he removed her from the island where she was confined to the continent two hundred four and treated her with less severity but could never be prevailed upon to recall her When the Roman people interposed on her behalf several times with much importunity all the reply he gave was I wish you had all such daughters and wives as she is He likewise forbad a child of which his grand daughter Julia was delivered after sentence had passed against her to be either owned as a relation or brought up Agrippa who was equally intractable and whose folly increased every day he transported to an island two hundred five and placed a guard of soldiers about him procuring at the same time an act of the senate for his confinement there during life Upon any mention of him and the two Julias he would say with a heavy sigh Aith ophelon agamos t emenai agonos t apoletai Would I were wifeless or had childless died two hundred six nor did he usually call them by any other name than that of his three imposthumes or cancers LXVI He was cautious in forming friendships but clung to them with great constancy not only rewarding the virtues and merits of his friends according to their deserts but bearing likewise with their faults and vices provided that they were one hundred twenty of a venial kind For amongst all his friends we scarcely find any who fell into disgrace with him except Salvidienus Rufus whom he raised to the consulship and Cornelius Gallus whom he made prefect of Egypt both of them men of the lowest extraction One of these being engaged in plotting a rebellion he delivered over to the senate for condemnation and the other on account of his ungrateful and malicious temper he forbad his house and his living in any of the provinces When however Gallus being denounced by his accusers and sentenced by the senate was driven to the desperate extremity of laying violent hands upon himself he commended indeed the attachment to his person of those who manifested so much indignation but he shed tears and lamented his unhappy condition That I alone said he cannot be allowed to resent the misconduct of my friends in such a way only as I would wish The rest of his friends of all orders flourished during their whole lives both in power and wealth in the highest ranks of their several orders notwithstanding some occasional lapses For to say nothing of others he sometimes complained that Agrippa was hasty and Mecaenas a tattler the former having thrown up all his employments and retired to Mitylene on suspicion of some slight coolness and from jealousy that Marcellus received greater marks of favour and the latter having confidentially imparted to his wife Terentia the discovery of Muraena s conspiracy He likewise expected from his friends at their deaths as well as during their lives some proofs of their reciprocal attachment For though he was far from coveting their property and indeed would never accept of any legacy left him by a stranger yet he pondered in a melancholy mood over their last words not being able to conceal his chagrin if in their wills they made but a slight or no very honourable mention of him nor his joy on the other hand if they expressed a grateful sense of his favours and a hearty affection for him And whatever legacies or shares of their property were left him by such as were parents he used to restore to their children either immediately or if they were under age upon the day of their assuming the manly dress or of their marriage with interest LXVII As a patron and master his behaviour in general was mild and conciliating but when occasion required it he one hundred twenty one could be severe He advanced many of his freedmen to posts of honour and great importance as Licinus Enceladus and others and when his slave Cosmus had reflected bitterly upon him he resented the injury no further than by putting him in fetters When his steward Diomedes left him to the mercy of a wild boar which suddenly attacked them while they were walking together he considered it rather a cowardice than a breach of duty and turned an occurrence of no small hazard into a jest because there was no knavery in his steward s conduct He put to death Proculus one of his most favourite freedmen for maintaining a criminal commerce with other men s wives He broke the legs of his secretary Thallus for taking a bribe of five hundred denarii to discover the contents of one of his letters And the tutor and other attendants of his son Caius having taken advantage of his sickness and death to give loose to their insolence and rapacity in the province he governed he caused heavy weights to be tied about their necks and had them thrown into a river LXVIII In his early youth various aspersions of an infamous character were heaped upon him Sextus Pompey reproached him with being an effeminate fellow and M Antony with earning his adoption from his uncle by prostitution Lucius Antony likewise Mark s brother charges him with pollution by Caesar and that for a gratification of three hundred thousand sesterces he had submitted to Aulus Hirtius in the same way in Spain adding that he used to singe his legs with burnt nut shells to make the hair become softer two hundred seven Nay the whole concourse of the people at some public diversions in the theatre when the following sentence was recited alluding to the Gallic priest of the mother of the gods two hundred eight beating a drum two hundred nine Videsne ut cinaedus orbem digito temperet See with his orb the wanton s finger play applied the passage to him with great applause one hundred twenty two LXIX That he was guilty of various acts of adultery is not denied even by his friends but they allege in excuse for it that he engaged in those intrigues not from lewdness but from policy in order to discover more easily the designs of his enemies through their wives Mark Antony besides the precipitate marriage of Livia charges him with taking the wife of a man of consular rank from table in the presence of her husband into a bed chamber and bringing her again to the entertainment with her ears very red and her hair in great disorder that he had divorced Scribonia for resenting too freely the excessive influence which one of his mistresses had gained over him that his friends were employed to pimp for him and accordingly obliged both matrons and ripe virgins to strip for a complete examination of their persons in the same manner as if Thoranius the dealer in slaves had them under sale And before they came to an open rupture he writes to him in a familiar manner thus Why are you changed towards me Because I lie with a queen She is my wife Is this a new thing with me or have I not done so for these nine years And do you take freedoms with Drusilla only May health and happiness so attend you as when you read this letter you are not in dalliance with Tertulla Terentilla Rufilla two hundred ten or Salvia Titiscenia or all of them What matters it to you where or upon whom you spend your manly vigour LXX A private entertainment which he gave commonly called the Supper of the Twelve Gods two hundred eleven and at which the guests one hundred twenty three were dressed in the habit of gods and goddesses while he personated Apollo himself afforded subject of much conversation and was imputed to him not only by Antony in his letters who likewise names all the parties concerned but in the following well known anonymous verses Cum primum istorum conduxit mensa choragum Sexque deos vidit Mallia sexque deas Impia dum Phoebi Caesar mendacia ludit Dum nova divorum coenat adulteria Omnia se a terris tunc numina declinarunt Fugit et auratos Jupiter ipse thronos When Mallia late beheld in mingled train Twelve mortals ape twelve deities in vain Caesar assumed what was Apollo s due And wine and lust inflamed the motley crew At the foul sight the gods avert their eyes And from his throne great Jove indignant flies What rendered this supper more obnoxious to public censure was that it happened at a time when there was a great scarcity and almost a famine in the city The day after there was a cry current among the people that the gods had eaten up all the corn and that Caesar was indeed Apollo but Apollo the Tormentor under which title that god was worshipped in some quarter of the city two hundred twelve He was likewise charged with being excessively fond of fine furniture and Corinthian vessels as well as with being addicted to gaming For during the time of the proscription the following line was written upon his statue Pater argentarius ego Corinthiarius My father was a silversmith two hundred thirteen my dealings are in brass because it was believed that he had put some persons upon the list of the proscribed only to obtain the Corinthian vessels in one hundred twenty four their possession And afterwards in the Sicilian war the following epigram was published Postquam bis classe victus naves perdidit Aliquando ut vincat ludit assidue aleam Twice having lost a fleet in luckless fight To win at last he games both day and night LXXI With respect to the charge or imputation of loathsome impurity before mentioned he very easily refuted it by the chastity of his life at the very time when it was made as well as ever afterwards His conduct likewise gave the lie to that of luxurious extravagance in his furniture when upon the taking of Alexandria he reserved for himself nothing of the royal treasures but a porcelain cup and soon afterwards melted down all the vessels of gold even such as were intended for common use But his amorous propensities never left him and as he grew older as is reported he was in the habit of debauching young girls who were procured for him from all quarters even by his own wife To the observations on his gaming he paid not the smallest regard but played in public but purely for his diversion even when he was advanced in years and not only in the month of December two hundred fourteen but at other times and upon all days whether festivals or not This evidently appears from a letter under his own hand in which he says I supped my dear Tiberius with the same company We had besides Vinicius and Silvius the father We gamed at supper like old fellows both yesterday and today And as any one threw upon the tali two hundred fifteen aces or sixes he put down for every talus a denarius all which was gained by him who threw a Venus two hundred sixteen In another letter he says We had my dear Tiberius a pleasant time of it during the festival of Minerva for we played every day and kept the gaming board warm Your brother uttered many exclamations at a desperate run of ill fortune but recovering by degrees and unexpectedly he in the end lost not much I lost twenty thousand sesterces for my part but then I was profusely one hundred twenty five generous in my play as I commonly am for had I insisted upon the stakes which I declined or kept what I gave away I should have won about fifty thousand But this I like better for it will raise my character for generosity to the skies In a letter to his daughter he writes thus I have sent you two hundred and fifty denarii which I gave to every one of my guests in case they were inclined at supper to divert themselves with the Tali or at the game of Even or Odd LXXII In other matters it appears that he was moderate in his habits and free from suspicion of any kind of vice He lived at first near the Roman Forum above the Ring maker s Stairs in a house which had once been occupied by Calvus the orator He afterwards moved to the Palatine Hill where he resided in a small house two hundred seventeen belonging to Hortensius no way remarkable either for size or ornament the piazzas being but small the pillars of Alban stone two hundred eighteen and the rooms without any thing of marble or fine paving He continued to use the same bed chamber both winter and summer during forty years two hundred nineteen for though he was sensible that the city did not agree with his health in the winter he nevertheless resided constantly in it during that season If at any time he wished to be perfectly retired and secure from interruption he shut himself up in an apartment at the top of his house which he called his Syracuse or Technophuon two hundred twenty or he went to some villa belonging to his freedmen near the city But when he was indisposed he commonly took up his residence in the house of Mecaenas two hundred twenty one Of all the places of retirement from the city he one hundred twenty six chiefly frequented those upon the sea coast and the islands of Campania two hundred twenty two or the towns nearest the city such as Lanuvium Praeneste and Tibur two hundred twenty three where he often used to sit for the administration of justice in the porticos of the temple of Hercules He had a particular aversion to large and sumptuous palaces and some which had been raised at a vast expense by his grand daughter Julia he levelled to the ground Those of his own which were far from being spacious he adorned not so much with statues and pictures as with walks and groves and things which were curious either for their antiquity or rarity such as at Capri the huge limbs of sea monsters and wild beasts which some affect to call the bones of giants and also the arms of ancient heroes LXXIII His frugality in the furniture of his house appears even at this day from some beds and tables still remaining most of which are scarcely elegant enough for a private family It is reported that he never lay upon a bed but such as was low and meanly furnished He seldom wore any garment but what was made by the hands of his wife sister daughter and grand daughters His togas two hundred twenty four were neither scanty nor full one hundred twenty seven and the clavus was neither remarkably broad or narrow His shoes were a little higher than common to make him appear taller than he was He had always clothes and shoes fit to appear in public ready in his bed chamber for any sudden occasion LXXIV At his table which was always plentiful and elegant he constantly entertained company but was very scrupulous in the choice of them both as to rank and character Valerius Messala informs us that he never admitted any freedman to his table except Menas when rewarded with the privilege of citizenship for betraying Pompey s fleet He writes himself that he invited to his table a person in whose villa he lodged and who had formerly been employed by him as a spy He often came late to table and withdrew early so that the company began supper before his arrival and continued at table after his departure His entertainments consisted of three entries or at most of only six But if his fare was moderate his courtesy was extreme For those who were silent or talked in whispers he encouraged to join in the general conversation and introduced buffoons and stage players or even low performers from the circus and very often itinerant humourists to enliven the company LXXV Festivals and holidays he usually celebrated very expensively but sometimes only with merriment In the Saturnalia or at any other time when the fancy took him he distributed to his company clothes gold and silver sometimes coins of all sorts even of the ancient kings of Rome and of foreign nations sometimes nothing but towels sponges rakes and tweezers and other things of that kind with tickets on them which were enigmatical and had a double meaning two hundred twenty five He used likewise to sell by lot among his guests articles of very unequal value and pictures with their fronts reversed and so by the unknown quality of the lot disappoint or gratify the expectation of the purchasers This sort of traffic one hundred twenty eight went round the whole company every one being obliged to buy something and to run the chance of loss or gain wits the rest LXXVI He ate sparingly for I must not omit even this and commonly used a plain diet He was particularly fond of coarse bread small fishes new cheese made of cow s milk two hundred twenty six and green figs of the sort which bear fruit twice a year two hundred twenty seven He did not wait for supper but took food at any time and in any place when he had an appetite The following passages relative to this subject I have transcribed from his letters I ate a little bread and some small dates in my carriage Again In returning home from the palace in my litter I ate an ounce of bread and a few raisins Again No Jew my dear Tiberius ever keeps such strict fast upon the Sabbath two hundred twenty eight as I have to day for while in the bath and after the first hour of the night I only ate two biscuits before I began to be rubbed with oil From this great indifference about his diet he sometimes supped by himself before his company began or after they had finished and would not touch a morsel at table with his guests LXXVII He was by nature extremely sparing in the use of wine Cornelius Nepos says that he used to drink only three times at supper in the camp at Modena and when he indulged himself the most he never exceeded a pint or if he did his stomach rejected it Of all wines he gave the one hundred twenty nine preference to the Rhaetian two hundred twenty nine but scarcely ever drank any in the day time Instead of drinking he used to take a piece of bread dipped in cold water or a slice of cucumber or some leaves of lettuce or a green sharp juicy apple LXXVIII After a slight repast at noon he used to seek repose two hundred thirty dressed as he was and with his shoes on his feet covered and his hand held before his eyes After supper he commonly withdrew to his study a small closet where he sat late until he had put down in his diary all or most of the remaining transactions of the day which he had not before registered He would then go to bed but never slept above seven hours at most and that not without interruption for he would wake three or four times during that time If he could not again fall asleep as sometimes happened he called for some one to read or tell stories to him until he became drowsy and then his sleep was usually protracted till after day break He never liked to lie awake in the dark without somebody to sit by him Very early rising was apt to disagree with him On which account if he was obliged to rise betimes for any civil or religious functions in order to guard as much as possible against the inconvenience resulting from it he used to lodge in some apartment near the spot belonging to any of his attendants If at any time a fit of drowsiness seized him in passing along the streets his litter was set down while he snatched a few moments sleep LXXIX In person he was handsome and graceful through every period of his life But he was negligent in his dress and so careless about dressing his hair that he usually had it done in great haste by several barbers at a time His beard he sometimes clipped and sometimes shaved and either read or wrote during the operation His countenance either when discoursing or silent was so calm and serene that a one hundred thirty Gaul of the first rank declared amongst his friends that he was so softened by it as to be restrained from throwing him down a precipice in his passage over the Alps when he had been admitted to approach him under pretence of conferring with him His eyes were bright and piercing and he was willing it should be thought that there was something of a divine vigour in them He was likewise not a little pleased to see people upon his looking steadfastly at them lower their countenances as if the sun shone in their eyes But in his old age he saw very imperfectly with his left eye His teeth were thin set small and scaly his hair a little curled and inclining to a yellow colour His eye brows met his ears were small and he had an aquiline nose His complexion was betwixt brown and fair his stature but low though Julius Marathus his freedman says he was five feet and nine inches in height This however was so much concealed by the just proportion of his limbs that it was only perceivable upon comparison with some taller person standing by him LXXX He is said to have been born with many spots upon his breast and belly answering to the figure order and number of the stars in the constellation of the Bear He had besides several callosities resembling scars occasioned by an itching in his body and the constant and violent use of the strigil two hundred thirty one in being rubbed He had a weakness in his left hip thigh and leg insomuch that he often halted on that side but he received much benefit from the use of sand and reeds He likewise sometimes found the fore finger of his right hand so weak that when it was benumbed and contracted with cold to use it in writing he was obliged to have recourse to a circular piece of horn He had occasionally a complaint in the bladder but upon voiding some stones in his urine he was relieved from that pain LXXXI During the whole course of his life he suffered at times dangerous fits of sickness especially after the conquest of Cantabria when his liver being injured by a defluxion one hundred thirty one upon it he was reduced to such a condition that he was obliged to undergo a desperate and doubtful method of cure for warm applications having no effect Antonius Musa two hundred thirty two directed the use of those which were cold He was likewise subject to fits of sickness at stated times every year for about his birth day two hundred thirty three he was commonly a little indisposed In the beginning of spring he was attacked with an inflation of the midriff and when the wind was southerly with a cold in his head By all these complaints his constitution was so shattered that he could not easily bear either heat or cold LXXXII In winter he was protected against the inclemency of the weather by a thick toga four tunics a shirt a flannel stomacher and swathings upon his legs and thighs two hundred thirty four In summer he lay with the doors of his bedchamber open and frequently in a piazza refreshed by a bubbling fountain and a person standing by to fan him He could not bear even the winter s sun and at home never walked in the open air without a broad brimmed hat on his head He usually travelled in a litter and by night and so slow that he was two days in going to Praeneste or Tibur And if he could go to any place by sea he preferred that mode of travelling He carefully nourished his health against his many infirmities avoiding chiefly the free use of the bath but he was often rubbed with oil and sweated in a stove after which he was washed with tepid water warmed either by a fire or by being exposed to the heat of the sun When upon account of his nerves he was obliged to have recourse to sea water or the waters of Albula two hundred thirty five he was contented with sitting over a wooden tub which he called by a Spanish name one hundred thirty two Dureta and plunging his hands and feet in the water by turns LXXXIII As soon as the civil wars were ended he gave up riding and other military exercises in the Campus Martius and took to playing at ball or foot ball but soon afterwards used no other exercise than that of going abroad in his litter or walking Towards the end of his walk he would run leaping wrapped up in a short cloak or cape For amusement he would sometimes angle or play with dice pebbles or nuts with little boys collected from various countries and particularly Moors and Syrians for their beauty or amusing talk But dwarfs and such as were in any way deformed he held in abhorrence as lusus naturae nature s abortions and of evil omen LXXXIV From early youth he devoted himself with great diligence and application to the study of eloquence and the other liberal arts In the war of Modena notwithstanding the weighty affairs in which he was engaged he is said to have read written and declaimed every day He never addressed the senate the people or the army but in a premeditated speech though he did not want the talent of speaking extempore on the spur of the occasion And lest his memory should fail him as well as to prevent the loss of time in getting up his speeches it was his general practice to recite them In his intercourse with individuals and even with his wife Livia upon subjects of importance he wrote on his tablets all he wished to express lest if he spoke extempore he should say more or less than was proper He delivered himself in a sweet and peculiar tone in which he was diligently instructed by a master of elocution But when he had a cold he sometimes employed a herald to deliver his speeches to the people LXXXV He composed many tracts in prose on various subjects some of which he read occasionally in the circle of his friends as to an auditory Among these was his Rescript to Brutus respecting Cato Most of the pages he read himself although he was advanced in years but becoming fatigued he gave the rest to Tiberius to finish He likewise read over to one hundred thirty three his friends his Exhortations to Philosophy and the History of his own Life which he continued in thirteen books as far as the Cantabrian war but no farther He likewise made some attempts at poetry There is extant one book written by him in hexameter verse of which both the subject and title is Sicily There is also a book of Epigrams no larger than the last which he composed almost entirely while he was in the bath These are all his poetical compositions for though he begun a tragedy with great zest becoming dissatisfied with the style he obliterated the whole and his friends saying to him What is your Ajax doing he answered My Ajax has met with a sponge two hundred thirty six LXXXVI He cultivated a style which was neat and chaste avoiding frivolous or harsh language as well as obsolete words which he calls disgusting His chief object was to deliver his thoughts with all possible perspicuity To attain this end and that he might nowhere perplex or retard the reader or hearer he made no scruple to add prepositions to his verbs or to repeat the same conjunction several times which when omitted occasion some little obscurity but give a grace to the style Those who used affected language or adopted obsolete words he despised as equally faulty though in different ways He sometimes indulged himself in jesting particularly with his friend Mecaenas whom he rallied upon all occasions for his fine phrases two hundred thirty seven and bantered by imitating his way of talking Nor did he spare Tiberius who was fond of obsolete and far fetched expressions He charges Mark Antony with insanity writing rather to make men stare than to be understood and by way of sarcasm upon his depraved and fickle taste in the choice of words he writes to him thus And are you yet in doubt whether Cimber Annius or Veranius Flaccus be more proper for your imitation Whether you will adopt words which Sallustius Crispus has borrowed from the Origines of Cato Or do you think that the verbose empty bombast of Asiatic orators is fit to be transfused into one hundred thirty four our language And in a letter where he commends the talent of his grand daughter Agrippina he says But you must be particularly careful both in writing and speaking to avoid affectation LXXXVII In ordinary conversation he made use of several peculiar expressions as appears from letters in his own hand writing in which now and then when he means to intimate that some persons would never pay their debts he says They will pay at the Greek Calends And when he advised patience in the present posture of affairs he would say Let us be content with our Cato To describe anything in haste he said It was sooner done than asparagus is cooked He constantly puts baceolus for stultus pullejaceus for pullus vacerrosus for cerritus vapide se habere for male and betizare for languere which is commonly called lachanizare Likewise simus for sumus domos for domus in the genitive singular two hundred thirty eight With respect to the last two peculiarities lest any person should imagine that they were only slips of his pen and not customary with him he never varies I have likewise remarked this singularity in his hand writing he never divides his words so as to carry the letters which cannot be inserted at the end of a line to the next but puts them below the other enclosed by a bracket LXXXVIII He did not adhere strictly to orthography as laid down by the grammarians but seems to have been of the opinion of those who think that we ought to write as we speak for as to his changing and omitting not only letters but whole syllables it is a vulgar mistake Nor should I have taken notice of it but that it appears strange to me that any person should have told us that he sent a successor to a consular lieutenant of a province as an ignorant illiterate fellow upon his observing that he had written ixi for ipsi When he had occasion to write in cypher he put b for a c for b and so forth and instead of z aa LXXXIX He was no less fond of the Greek literature in which he made considerable proficiency having had Apollodorus one hundred thirty five of Pergamus for his master in rhetoric whom though much advanced in years he took with him from The City when he was himself very young to Apollonia Afterwards being instructed in philology by Sephaerus he received into his family Areus the philosopher and his sons Dionysius and Nicanor but he never could speak the Greek tongue readily nor ever ventured to compose in it For if there was occasion for him to deliver his sentiments in that language he always expressed what he had to say in Latin and gave it another to translate He was evidently not unacquainted with the poetry of the Greeks and had a great taste for the ancient comedy which he often brought upon the stage in his public spectacles In reading the Greek and Latin authors he paid particular attention to precepts and examples which might be useful in public or private life Those he used to extract verbatim and gave to his domestics or send to the commanders of the armies the governors of the provinces or the magistrates of the city when any of them seemed to stand in need of admonition He likewise read whole books to the senate and frequently made them known to the people by his edicts such as the orations of Quintus Metellus for the Encouragement of Marriage and those of Rutilius On the Style of Building two hundred thirty nine to shew the people that he was not the first who had promoted those objects but that the ancients likewise had thought them worthy their attention He patronised the men of genius of that age in every possible way He would hear them read their works with a great deal of patience and good nature and not only poetry two hundred forty and history but orations and dialogues He was displeased however that anything should be written upon himself except in a grave manner and by men of the most eminent abilities and he enjoined the praetors not to suffer his name to be made too common in the contests amongst orators and poets in the theatres XC We have the following account of him respecting his one hundred thirty six belief in omens and such like He had so great a dread of thunder and lightning that he always carried about him a seal s skin by way of preservation And upon any apprehension of a violent storm he would retire to some place of concealment in a vault under ground having formerly been terrified by a flash of lightning while travelling in the night as we have already mentioned two hundred forty one XCI He neither slighted his own dreams nor those of other people relating to himself At the battle of Philippi although he had resolved not to stir out of his tent on account of his being indisposed yet being warned by a dream of one of his friends he changed his mind and well it was that he did so for in the enemy s attack his couch was pierced and cut to pieces on the supposition of his being in it He had many frivolous and frightful dreams during the spring but in the other parts of the year they were less frequent and more significative Upon his frequently visiting a temple near the Capitol which he had dedicated to Jupiter Tonans he dreamt that Jupiter Capitolinus complained that his worshippers were taken from him and that upon this he replied he had only given him The Thunderer for his porter two hundred forty two He therefore immediately suspended little bells round the summit of the temple because such commonly hung at the gates of great houses In consequence of a dream too he always on a certain day of the year begged alms of the people reaching out his hand to receive the dole which they offered him XCII Some signs and omens he regarded as infallible If in the morning his shoe was put on wrong the left instead of the right that boded some disaster If when he commenced a long journey by sea or land there happened to fall a mizzling rain he held it to be a good sign of a speedy and happy return He was much affected likewise with any thing out of the common course of nature A palm tree two hundred forty three which one hundred thirty seven chanced to grow up between some stone s in the court of his house he transplanted into a court where the images of the Household Gods were placed and took all possible care to make it thrive in the island of Capri some decayed branches of an old ilex which hung drooping to the ground recovered themselves upon his arrival at which he was so delighted that he made an exchange with the Republic two hundred forty four of Naples of the island of Oenaria Ischia for that of Capri He likewise observed certain days as never to go from home the day after the Nundiae two hundred forty five nor to begin any serious business upon the nones two hundred forty six avoiding nothing else in it as he writes to Tiberius than its unlucky name XCIII With regard to the religious ceremonies of foreign nations he was a strict observer of those which had been established by ancient custom but others he held in no esteem For having been initiated at Athens and coming afterwards to hear a cause at Rome relative to the privileges of the priests of the Attic Ceres when some of the mysteries of their sacred rites were to be introduced in the pleadings he dismissed those who sat upon the bench as judges with him as well as the by standers and beard the argument upon those points himself But on the other hand he not only declined in his progress through Egypt to go out of his way to pay a visit to Apis but he likewise commended his grandson Caius one hundred thirty eight for not paying his devotions at Jerusalem in his passage through Judaea two hundred forty seven XCIV Since we are upon this subject it may not be improper to give an account of the omens before and at his birth as well as afterwards which gave hopes of his future greatness and the good fortune that constantly attended him A part of the wall of Velletri having in former times been struck with thunder the response of the soothsayers was that a native of that town would some time or other arrive at supreme power relying on which prediction the Velletrians both then and several times afterwards made war upon the Roman people to their own ruin At last it appeared by the event that the omen had portended the elevation of Augustus Julius Marathus informs us that a few months before his birth there happened at Rome a prodigy by which was signified that Nature was in travail with a king for the Roman people and that the senate in alarm came to the resolution that no child born that year should be brought up but that those amongst them whose wives were pregnant to secure to themselves a chance of that dignity took care that the decree of the senate should not be registered in the treasury I find in the theological books of Asclepiades the Mendesian two hundred forty eight that Atia upon attending at midnight a religious solemnity in honour of Apollo when the rest of the matrons retired home fell asleep on her couch in the temple and that a serpent immediately crept to her and soon after withdrew She awaking upon it purified herself as usual after the embraces of her husband and instantly there appeared upon her body a mark in the form of a serpent which she never after could efface and which obliged her during the subsequent part of her life to decline the use of the public baths Augustus it was added was born in the tenth month after and for that reason was thought to be the son of Apollo The one hundred thirty nine same Atia before her delivery dreamed that her bowels stretched to the stars and expanded through the whole circuit of heaven and earth His father Octavius likewise dreamt that a sun beam issued from his wife s womb Upon the day he was born the senate being engaged in a debate on Catiline s conspiracy and Octavius in consequence of his wife s being in childbirth coming late into the house it is a well known fact that Publius Nigidius upon hearing the occasion of his coming so late and the hour of his wife s delivery declared that the world had got a master Afterwards when Octavius upon marching with his army through the deserts of Thrace consulted the oracle in the grove of father Bacchus with barbarous rites concerning his son he received from the priests an answer to the same purpose because when they poured wine upon the altar there burst out so prodigious a flame that it ascended above the roof of the temple and reached up to the heavens a circumstance which had never happened to any one but Alexander the Great upon his sacrificing at the same altars And next night he dreamt that he saw his son under a more than human appearance with thunder and a sceptre and the other insignia of Jupiter Optimus Maximus having on his head a radiant crown mounted upon a chariot decked with laurel and drawn by six pair of milk white horses Whilst he was yet an infant as Caius Drusus relates being laid in his cradle by his nurse and in a low place the next day he was not to be found and after he had been sought for a long time he was at last discovered upon a lofty tower lying with his face towards the rising sun two hundred forty nine When he first began to speak he ordered the frogs that happened to make a troublesome noise upon an estate belonging to the family near the town to be silent and there goes a report that frogs never croaked there since that time As he was dining in a grove at the fourth mile stone on the Campanian road an eagle suddenly snatched a piece of bread out of his hand and soaring to a prodigious height after hovering came down most unexpectedly and returned it to him Quintus Catulus had a dream for two nights successively after his dedication of the Capitol The first night he dreamt one hundred forty that Jupiter out of several boys of the order of the nobility who were playing about his altar selected one into whose bosom he put the public seal of the commonwealth which he held in his hand but in his vision the next night he saw in the bosom of Jupiter Capitolinus the same boy whom he ordered to be removed but it was forbidden by the God who declared that it must be brought up to become the guardian of the state The next day meeting Augustus with whom till that hour he had not the least acquaintance and looking at him with admiration he said he was extremely like the boy he had seen in his dream Some give a different account of Catulus s first dream namely that Jupiter upon several noble lads requesting of him that they might have a guardian had pointed to one amongst them to whom they were to prefer their requests and putting his fingers to the boy s mouth to kiss he afterwards applied them to his own Marcus Cicero as he was attending Caius Caesar to the Capitol happened to be telling some of his friends a dream which he had the preceding night in which he saw a comely youth let down from heaven by a golden chain who stood at the door of the Capitol and had a whip put into his hands by Jupiter And immediately upon sight of Augustus who had been sent for by his uncle Caesar to the sacrifice and was as yet perfectly unknown to most of the company he affirmed that it was the very boy he had seen in his dream When he assumed the manly toga his senatorian tunic becoming loose in the seam on each side fell at his feet Some would have this to forbode that the order of which that was the badge of distinction would some time or other be subject to him Julius Caesar in cutting down a wood to make room for his camp near Munda two hundred fifty happened to light upon a palm tree and ordered it to be preserved as an omen of victory From the root of this tree there put out immediately a sucker which in a few days grew to such a height as not only to equal but overshadow it and afford room for many nests of wild pigeons which built in it though that species of bird particularly avoids a hard and rough leaf It is likewise reported that Caesar was chiefly influenced by this prodigy to prefer his sister s grandson before all others for his successor one hundred forty one In his retirement at Apollonia he went with his friend Agrippa to visit Theogenes the astrologer in his gallery on the roof Agrippa who first consulted the fates having great and almost incredible fortunes predicted of him Augustus did not choose to make known his nativity and persisted for some time in the refusal from a mixture of shame and fear lest his fortunes should be predicted as inferior to those of Agrippa Being persuaded however after much importunity to declare it Theogenes started up from his seat and paid him adoration Not long afterwards Augustus was so confident of the greatness of his destiny that he published his horoscope and struck a silver coin bearing upon it the sign of Capricorn under the influence of which he was born XCV After the death of Caesar upon his return from Apollonia as he was entering the city on a sudden in a clear and bright sky a circle resembling the rainbow surrounded the body of the sun and immediately afterwards the tomb of Julia Caesar s daughter was struck by lightning In his first consulship whilst he was observing the auguries twelve vultures presented themselves as they had done to Romulus And when he offered sacrifice the livers of all the victims were folded inward in the lower part a circumstance which was regarded by those present who had skill in things of that nature as an indubitable prognostic of great and wonderful fortune XCVI He certainly had a presentiment of the issue of all his wars When the troops of the Triumviri were collected about Bolognia an eagle which sat upon his tent and was attacked by two crows beat them both and struck them to the ground in the view of the whole army who thence inferred that discord would arise between the three colleagues which would be attended with the like event and it accordingly happened At Philippi he was assured of success by a Thessalian upon the authority as he pretended of the Divine Caesar himself who had appeared to him while he was travelling in a bye road At Perugia the sacrifice not presenting any favourable intimations but the contrary he ordered fresh victims the enemy however carrying off the sacred things in a sudden sally it was agreed amongst the augurs that all the one hundred forty two dangers and misfortunes which had threatened the sacrificer would fall upon the heads of those who had got possession of the entrails And accordingly so it happened The day before the sea fight near Sicily as he was walking upon the shore a fish leaped out of the sea and laid itself at his feet At Actium while he was going down to his fleet to engage the enemy he was met by an ass with a fellow driving it The name of the man was Eutychus and that of the animal Nichon two hundred fifty one After the victory he erected a brazen statue to each in a temple built upon the spot where he had encamped XCVII His death of which I shall now speak and his subsequent deification were intimated by divers manifest prodigies As he was finishing the census amidst a great crowd of people in the Campus Martius an eagle hovered round him several times and then directed its course to a neighbouring temple where it settled upon the name of Agrippa and at the first letter Upon observing this he ordered his colleague Tiberius to put up the vows which it is usual to make on such occasions for the succeeding Lustrum For he declared he would not meddle with what it was probable he should never accomplish though the tables were ready drawn for it About the same time the first letter of his name in an inscription upon one of his statues was struck out by lightning which was interpreted as a presage that he would live only a hundred days longer the letter C denoting that number and that he would be placed amongst the Gods as Aesar which is the remaining part of the word Caesar signifies in the Tuscan language a God two hundred fifty two Being therefore about dispatching Tiberius to Illyricum and designing to go with him as far as Beneventum but being detained by several persons who applied to him respecting causes they had depending he cried out and it was afterwards regarded as an omen of his death Not all the business in the world shall detain me at home one moment longer and setting out upon his journey he went one hundred forty three as far as Astura two hundred fifty three whence contrary to his custom he put to sea in the night time as there was a favourable wind XCVIII His malady proceeded from diarrhoea notwithstanding which he went round the coast of Campania and the adjacent islands and spent four days in that of Capri where he gave himself up entirely to repose and relaxation Happening to sail by the bay of Puteoli the passengers and mariners aboard a ship of Alexandria two hundred fifty four just then arrived clad all in white with chaplets upon their heads and offering incense loaded him with praises and joyful acclamations crying out By you we live by you we sail securely by you enjoy our liberty and our fortunes At which being greatly pleased he distributed to each of those who attended him forty gold pieces requiring from them an assurance on oath not to employ the sum given them in any other way than the purchase of Alexandrian merchandize And during several days afterwards he distributed Togae two hundred fifty five and Pallia among other gifts on condition that the Romans should use the Greek and the Greeks the Roman dress and language He likewise constantly attended to see the boys perform their exercises according to an ancient custom still continued at Capri He gave them likewise an entertainment in his presence and not only permitted but required from them the utmost freedom in jesting and scrambling for fruit victuals and other things which he threw amongst them In a word he indulged himself in all the ways of amusement he could contrive He called an island near Capri Apragopolis The City of the Do littles from the indolent life which several of his party led there A favourite of his one Masgabas two hundred fifty six he used one hundred forty four to call Ktistaes as if he had been the planter of the island And observing from his room a great company of people with torches assembled at the tomb of this Masgabas who died the year before he uttered very distinctly this verse which he made extempore Ktistou de tumbo eisoro pyroumenon Blazing with lights I see the founder s tomb Then turning to Thrasyllus a companion of Tiberius who reclined on the other side of the table he asked him who knew nothing about the matter what poet he thought was the author of that verse and on his hesitating to reply he added another Oras phaessi Masgaban timomenon Honor d with torches Masgabas you see and put the same question to him concerning that likewise The latter replying that whoever might be the author they were excellent verses two hundred fifty seven he set up a great laugh and fell into an extraordinary vein of jesting upon it Soon afterwards passing over to Naples although at that time greatly disordered in his bowels by the frequent returns of his disease he sat out the exhibition of the gymnastic games which were performed in his honour every five years and proceeded with Tiberius to the place intended But on his return his disorder increasing he stopped at Nola sent for Tiberius back again and had a long discourse with him in private after which he gave no further attention to business of any importance XCIX Upon the day of his death he now and then enquired if there was any disturbance in the town on his account and calling for a mirror he ordered his hair to be combed and his shrunk cheeks to be adjusted Then asking his friends who were admitted into the room Do ye think that I have acted my part on the stage of life well he immediately subjoined Ei de pan echei kalos to paignio Dote kroton kai pantes umeis meta charas ktupaesate If all be right with joy your voices raise In loud applauses to the actor s praise one hundred forty five After which having dismissed them all whilst he was inquiring of some persons who were just arrived from Rome concerning Drusus s daughter who was in a bad state of health he expired suddenly amidst the kisses of Livia and with these words Livia live mindful of our union and now farewell dying a very easy death and such as he himself had always wished for For as often as he heard that any person had died quickly and without pain he wished for himself and his friends the like euthanasian an easy death for that was the word he made use of He betrayed but one symptom before he breathed his last of being delirious which was this he was all on a sudden much frightened and complained that he was carried away by forty men But this was rather a presage than any delirium for precisely that number of soldiers belonging to the pretorian cohort carried out his corpse C He expired in the same room in which his father Octavius had died when the two Sextus s Pompey and Apuleius were consuls upon the fourteenth of the calends of September the nineteenth August at the ninth hour of the day being seventy six years of age wanting only thirty five days two hundred fifty eight His remains were carried by the magistrates of the municipal two hundred fifty nine towns and colonies from Nola to Bovillae two hundred sixty and in the nighttime because of the season of the year During the intervals the body lay in some basilica or great temple of each town At Bovillae it was met by the Equestrian Order who carried it to the city and deposited it in the vestibule of his own house The senate proceeded with so much zeal in the arrangement of his funeral and paying honour to his memory that amongst several other proposals some were for having the funeral procession made through the triumphal gate preceded by the image of Victory which is in the senate house and the children of highest rank and of both sexes singing the funeral one hundred forty six dirge Others proposed that on the day of the funeral they should lay aside their gold rings and wear rings of iron and others that his bones should be collected by the priests of the principal colleges One likewise proposed to transfer the name of August to September because he was born in the latter but died in the former Another moved that the whole period of time from his birth to his death should be called the Augustan age and be inserted in the calendar under that title But at last it was judged proper to be moderate in the honours paid to his memory Two funeral orations were pronounced in his praise one before the temple of Julius by Tiberius and the other before the rostra under the old shops by Drusus Tiberius s son The body was then carried upon the shoulders of senators into the Campus Martius and there burnt A man of pretorian rank affirmed upon oath that he saw his spirit ascend from the funeral pile to heaven The most distinguished persons of the equestrian order bare footed and with their tunics loose gathered up his relics two hundred sixty one and deposited them in the mausoleum which had been built in his sixth consulship between the Flaminian Way and the bank of the Tiber two hundred sixty two at which time likewise he gave the groves and walks about it for the use of the people CI He had made a will a year and four months before his death upon the third of the nones of April the eleventh of April in the consulship of Lucius Plancus and Caius Silius It consisted of two skins of parchment written partly in his own hand and partly by his freedmen Polybius and Hilarian and had been committed to the custody of the Vestal Virgins by whom it was now produced with three codicils under seal as well as the will all these were opened and read in the senate He appointed as his direct heirs Tiberius for two one hundred forty seven thirds of his estate and Livia for the other third both of whom he desired to assume his name The heirs in remainder were Drusus Tiberius s son for one third and Germanicus with his three sons for the residue In the third place failing them were his relations and several of his friends He left in legacies to the Roman people forty millions of sesterces to the tribes two hundred sixty three three millions five hundred thousand to the pretorian troops a thousand each man to the city cohorts five hundred and to the legions and soldiers three hundred each which several sums he ordered to be paid immediately after his death having taken due care that the money should be ready in his exchequer For the rest he ordered different times of payment In some of his bequests he went as far as twenty thousand sesterces for the payment of which he allowed a twelvemonth alleging for this procrastination the scantiness of his estate and declaring that not more than a hundred and fifty millions of sesterces would come to his heirs notwithstanding that during the twenty preceding years he had received in legacies from his friends the sum of fourteen hundred millions almost the whole of which with his two paternal estates two hundred sixty four and others which had been left him he had spent in the service of the state He left orders that the two Julias his daughter and grand daughter if anything happened to them should not be buried in his tomb two hundred sixty five With regard to the three codicils before mentioned in one of them he gave orders about his funeral another contained a summary of his acts which he intended should be inscribed on brazen plates and placed in front of his mausoleum in the third he had drawn up a concise account of the state of the empire the number of troops enrolled what money there was in the treasury the revenue and arrears of taxes to which were added the names of the freedmen and slaves from whom the several accounts might be taken one hundred forty eight OCTAVIUS CAESAR afterwards Augustus had now attained to the same position in the state which had formerly been occupied by Julius Caesar and though he entered upon it by violence he continued to enjoy it through life with almost uninterrupted tranquillity By the long duration of the late civil war with its concomitant train of public calamities the minds of men were become less averse to the prospect of an absolute government at the same time that the new emperor naturally prudent and politic had learned from the fate of Julius the art of preserving supreme power without arrogating to himself any invidious mark of distinction He affected to decline public honours disclaimed every idea of personal superiority and in all his behaviour displayed a degree of moderation which prognosticated the most happy effects in restoring peace and prosperity to the harassed empire The tenor of his future conduct was suitable to this auspicious commencement While he endeavoured to conciliate the affections of the people by lending money to those who stood in need of it at low interest or without any at all and by the exhibition of public shows of which the Romans were remarkably fond he was attentive to the preservation of a becoming dignity in the government and to the correction of morals The senate which in the time of Sylla had increased to upwards of four hundred and during the civil war to a thousand members by the admission of improper persons he reduced to six hundred and being invested with the ancient office of censor which had for some time been disused he exercised an arbitrary but legal authority over the conduct of every rank in the state by which he could degrade senators and knights and inflict upon all citizens an ignominious sentence for any immoral or indecent behaviour But nothing contributed more to render the new form of government acceptable to the people than the frequent distribution of corn and sometimes largesses amongst the commonalty for an occasional scarcity of provisions had always been the chief cause of discontents and tumults in the capital To the interests of the army he likewise paid particular attention It was by the assistance of the legions that he had risen to power and they were the men who in the last resort if such an emergency should ever occur could alone enable him to preserve it History relates that after the overthrow of Antony Augustus held a consultation with Agrippa and Mecaenas about restoring the republican form of government when Agrippa gave his opinion in favour of that measure and Mecaenas opposed it one hundred forty nine The object of this consultation in respect to its future consequences on society is perhaps the most important ever agitated in any cabinet and required for the mature discussion of it the whole collective wisdom of the ablest men in the empire But this was a resource which could scarcely be adopted either with security to the public quiet or with unbiassed judgment in the determination of the question The bare agitation of such a point would have excited immediate and strong anxiety for its final result while the friends of a republican government who were still far more numerous than those of the other party would have strained every nerve to procure a determination in their own favour and the pretorian guards the surest protection of Augustus finding their situation rendered precarious by such an unexpected occurrence would have readily listened to the secret propositions and intrigues of the republicans for securing their acquiescence to the decision on the popular side If when the subject came into debate Augustus should be sincere in the declaration to abide by the resolution of the council it is beyond all doubt that the restoration of a republican government would have been voted by a great majority of the assembly If on the contrary he should not be sincere which is the more probable supposition and should incur the suspicion of practising secretly with members for a decision according to his wish he would have rendered himself obnoxious to the public odium and given rise to discontents which might have endangered his future security But to submit this important question to the free and unbiassed decision of a numerous assembly it is probable neither suited the inclination of Augustus nor perhaps in his opinion consisted with his personal safety With a view to the attainment of unconstitutional power he had formerly deserted the cause of the republic when its affairs were in a prosperous situation and now when his end was accomplished there could be little ground to expect that he should voluntarily relinquish the prize for which he had spilt the best blood of Rome and contended for so many years Ever since the final defeat of Antony in the battle of Actium he had governed the Roman state with uncontrolled authority and though there is in the nature of unlimited power an intoxicating quality injurious both to public and private virtue yet all history contradicts the supposition of its being endued with any which is unpalatable to the general taste of mankind There were two chief motives by which Augustus would naturally be influenced in a deliberation on this important subject namely the love of power and the personal danger which one hundred fifty he might incur from relinquishing it Either of these motives might have been a sufficient inducement for retaining his authority but when they both concurred as they seem to have done upon this occasion their united force was irresistible The argument so far as relates to the love of power rests upon a ground concerning the solidity of which little doubt can be entertained but it may be proper to inquire in a few words into the foundation of that personal danger which he dreaded to incur on returning to the station of a private citizen Augustus as has been already observed had formerly sided with the party which had attempted to restore public liberty after the death of Julius Caesar but he afterwards abandoned the popular cause and joined in the ambitious plans of Antony and Lepidus to usurp amongst themselves the entire dominion of the state By this change of conduct he turned his arms against the supporters of a form of government which he had virtually recognized as the legal constitution of Rome and it involved a direct implication of treason against the sacred representatives of that government the consuls formally and duly elected Upon such a charge he might be amenable to the capital laws of his country This however was a danger which might be fully obviated by procuring from the senate and people an act of oblivion previously to his abdication of the supreme power and this was a preliminary which doubtless they would have admitted and ratified with unanimous approbation It therefore appears that he could be exposed to no inevitable danger on this account but there was another quarter where his person was vulnerable and where even the laws might not be sufficient to protect him against the efforts of private resentment The bloody proscription of the Triumvirate no act of amnesty could ever erase from the minds of those who had been deprived by it of their nearest and dearest relations and amidst the numerous connections of the illustrious men sacrificed on that horrible occasion there might arise some desperate avenger whose indelible resentment nothing less would satisfy than the blood of the surviving delinquent Though Augustus therefore might not like his great predecessor be stabbed in the senate house he might perish by the sword or the poniard in a less conspicuous situation After all there seems to have been little danger from this quarter likewise for Sylla who in the preceding age had been guilty of equal enormities was permitted on relinquishing the place of perpetual dictator to end his days in quiet retirement and the undisturbed security which Augustus ever afterwards enjoyed affords sufficient proof that all apprehension of danger to his person was merely chimerical one hundred fifty one We have hitherto considered this grand consultation as it might be influenced by the passions or prejudices of the emperor we shall now take a short view of the subject in the light in which it is connected with considerations of a political nature and with public utility The arguments handed down by history respecting this consultation are few and imperfectly delivered but they may be extended upon the general principles maintained on each side of the question For the restoration of the republican government it might be contended that from the expulsion of the kings to the dictatorship of Julius Caesar through a period of upwards of four hundred and sixty years the Roman state with the exception only of a short interval had flourished and increased with a degree of prosperity unexampled in the annals of humankind that the republican form of government was not only best adapted to the improvement of national grandeur but to the security of general freedom the great object of all political association that public virtue by which alone nations could subsist in vigour was cherished and protected by no mode of administration so much as by that which connected in the strongest bonds of union the private interests of individuals with those of the community that the habits and prejudices of the Roman people were unalterably attached to the form of government established by so long a prescription and they would never submit for any length of time to the rule of one person without making every possible effort to recover their liberty that though despotism under a mild and wise prince might in some respects be regarded as preferable to a constitution which was occasionally exposed to the inconvenience of faction and popular tumults yet it was a dangerous experiment to abandon the government of the nation to the contingency of such a variety of characters as usually occurs in the succession of princes and upon the whole that the interests of the people were more safely entrusted in the hands of annual magistrates elected by themselves than in those of any individual whose power was permanent and subject to no legal control In favour of despotic government it might be urged that though Rome had subsisted long and gloriously under a republican form of government yet she had often experienced such violent shocks from popular tumults or the factions of the great as had threatened her with imminent destruction that a republican government was only accommodated to a people amongst whom the division of property gave to no class of citizens such a degree of pre eminence as might prove dangerous to public freedom that there was required in that form of political constitution a simplicity one hundred fifty two of life and strictness of manners which are never observed to accompany a high degree of public prosperity that in respect of all these considerations such a form of government was utterly incompatible with the present circumstances of the Romans that by the conquest of so many foreign nations by the lucrative governments of provinces the spoils of the enemy in war and the rapine too often practised in time of peace so great had been the aggrandizement of particular families in the preceding age that though the form of the ancient constitution should still remain inviolate the people would no longer live under a free republic but an aristocratical usurpation which was always productive of tyranny that nothing could preserve the commonwealth from becoming a prey to some daring confederacy but the firm and vigorous administration of one person invested with the whole executive power of the state unlimited and uncontrolled in fine that as Rome had been nursed to maturity by the government of six princes successively so it was only by a similar form of political constitution that she could now be saved from aristocratical tyranny on one hand or on the other from absolute anarchy On whichever side of the question the force of argument may be thought to preponderate there is reason to believe that Augustus was guided in his resolution more by inclination and prejudice than by reason It is related however that hesitating between the opposite opinions of his two counsellors he had recourse to that of Virgil who joined with Mecaenas in advising him to retain the imperial power as being the form of government most suitable to the circumstances of the times It is proper in this place to give some account of the two ministers above mentioned Agrippa and Mecaenas who composed the cabinet of Augustus at the settlement of his government and seem to be the only persons employed by him in a ministerial capacity during his whole reign M Vipsanius Agrippa was of obscure extraction but rendered himself conspicuous by his military talents He obtained a victory over Sextus Pompey and in the battles of Philippi and Actium where he displayed great valour he contributed not a little to establish the subsequent power of Augustus In his expeditions afterwards into Gaul and Germany he performed many signal achievements for which he refused the honours of a triumph The expenses which others would have lavished on that frivolous spectacle he applied to the more laudable purpose of embellishing Rome with magnificent buildings one of which the Pantheon still remains In consequence of a dispute with Marcellus the nephew of Augustus he retired to Mitylene one hundred fifty three whence after an absence of two years he was recalled by the emperor He first married Pomponia the daughter of the celebrated Atticus and afterwards one of the Marcellas the nieces of Augustus While this lady by whom he had children was still living the emperor prevailed upon his sister Octavia to resign to him her son in law and gave him in marriage his own daughter Julia so strong was the desire of Augustus to be united with him in the closest alliance The high degree of favour in which he stood with the emperor was soon after evinced by a farther mark of esteem for during a visit to the Roman provinces of Greece and Asia in which Augustus was absent two years he left the government of the empire to the care of Agrippa While this minister enjoyed and indeed seems to have merited all the partiality of Augustus he was likewise a favourite with the people He died at Rome in the sixty first year of his age universally lamented and his remains were deposited in the tomb which Augustus had prepared for himself Agrippa left by Julia three sons Caius Lucius and Posthumus Agrippa with two daughters Agrippina and Julia C Cilnius Mecaenas was of Tuscan extraction and derived his descent from the ancient kings of that country Though in the highest degree of favour with Augustus he never aspired beyond the rank of the equestrian order and though he might have held the government of extensive provinces by deputies he was content with enjoying the praefecture of the city and Italy a situation however which must have been attended with extensive patronage He was of a gay and social disposition In principle he is said to have been of the Epicurean sect and in his dress and manners to have bordered on effeminacy With respect to his political talents we can only speak from conjecture but from his being the confidential minister of a prince of so much discernment as Augustus during the infancy of a new form of government in an extensive empire we may presume that he was endowed with no common abilities for that important station The liberal patronage which he displayed towards men of genius and talents will render his name for ever celebrated in the annals of learning It is to be regretted that history has transmitted no particulars of this extraordinary personage of whom all we know is derived chiefly from the writings of Virgil and Horace but from the manner in which they address him amidst the familiarity of their intercourse there is the strongest reason to suppose that he was not less amiable and respectable in private life than illustrious in public situation O my glory is the emphatic expression employed by them both one hundred fifty four O decus O famae merito pars maxima nostrae Vir Georg ii Light of my life my glory and my guide O et praesidium et dulce decus meum Hor Ode I My glory and my patron thou One would be inclined to think that there was a nicety in the sense and application of the word decus amongst the Romans with which we are unacquainted and that in the passages now adduced it was understood to refer to the honour of the emperor s patronage obtained through the means of Mecaenas otherwise such language to the minister might have excited the jealousy of Augustus But whatever foundation there may be for this conjecture the compliment was compensated by the superior adulation which the poets appropriated to the emperor whose deification is more than insinuated in sublime intimations by Virgil Tuque adeo quem mox quae sint habitura deorum Concilia incertum est urbisne invisere Caesar Terrarumque velis curam et te maximus orbis Auctorem frugum tempestatumque potentem Accipiat cingens materna tempora myrto An Deus immensi venias maris ac tua nautae Numina sola colant tibi serviat ultima Thule Teque sibi generum Tethys emat omnibus undis Geor i one twenty five vi Thou Caesar chief where er thy voice ordain To fix midst gods thy yet unchosen reign Wilt thou o er cities fix thy guardian sway While earth and all her realms thy nod obey The world s vast orb shall own thy genial power Giver of fruits fair sun and favouring shower Before thy altar grateful nations bow And with maternal myrtle wreathe thy brow O er boundless ocean shall thy power prevail Thee her sole lord the world of waters hail Rule where the sea remotest Thule laves While Tethys dowers thy bride with all her waves Sotheby Horace has elegantly adopted the same strain of compliment Te multa prece te prosequitur mero Defuso pateris et Laribus tuum Miscet numen uti Graecia Castoris Et magni memor Herculis Carm IV five To thee he chants the sacred song To thee the rich libation pours Thee placed his household gods among With solemn daily prayer adores So Castor and great Hercules of old Were with her gods by grateful Greece enrolled one hundred fifty five The panegyric bestowed upon Augustus by the great poets of that time appears to have had a farther object than the mere gratification of vanity It was the ambition of this emperor to reign in the hearts as well as over the persons of his subjects and with this view he was desirous of endearing himself to their imagination Both he and Mecaenas had a delicate sensibility to the beauties of poetical composition and judging from their own feelings they attached a high degree of influence to the charms of poetry Impressed with these sentiments it became an object of importance in their opinion to engage the Muses in the service of the imperial authority on which account we find Mecaenas tampering with Propertius and we may presume likewise with every other rising genius in poetry to undertake an heroic poem of which Augustus should be the hero As the application to Propertius cannot have taken place until after Augustus had been amply celebrated by the superior abilities of Virgil and Horace there seems to be some reason for ascribing Mecaenas s request to a political motive Caius and Lucius the emperor s grandsons by his daughter Julia were still living and both young As one of them doubtless was intended to succeed to the government of the empire prudence justified the adoption of every expedient that might tend to secure a quiet succession to the heir upon the demise of Augustus As a subsidiary resource therefore the expedient above mentioned was judged highly plausible and the Roman cabinet indulged the idea of endeavouring to confirm imperial authority by the support of poetical renown Lampoons against the government were not uncommon even in the time of Augustus and elegant panegyric on the emperor served to counteract their influence upon the minds of the people The idea was perhaps novel in the time of Augustus but the history of later ages affords examples of its having been adopted under different forms of government with success The Roman empire in the time of Augustus had attained to a prodigious magnitude and in his testament he recommended to his successors never to exceed the limits which he had prescribed to its extent On the East it stretched to the Euphrates on the South to the cataracts of the Nile the deserts of Africa and Mount Atlas on the West to the Atlantic Ocean and on the North to the Danube and the Rhine including the best part of the then known world The Romans therefore were not improperly called rerum domini two hundred sixty six and Rome pulcherrima rerum two hundred sixty seven maxima rerum two hundred sixty eight Even the historians Livy and Tacitus one hundred fifty six actuated likewise with admiration bestow magnificent epithets on the capital of their country The succeeding emperors in conformity to the advice of Augustus made few additions to the empire Trajan however subdued Mesopotamia and Armenia east of the Euphrates with Dacia north of the Danube and after this period the Roman dominion was extended over Britain as far as the Frith of Forth and the Clyde It would be an object of curiosity to ascertain the amount of the Roman revenue in the reign of Augustus but such a problem even with respect to contemporary nations cannot be elucidated without access to the public registers of their governments and in regard to an ancient monarchy the investigation is impracticable We can only be assured that the revenue must have been immense which arose from the accumulated contribution of such a number of nations that had supported their own civil establishments with great splendour and many of which were celebrated for their extraordinary riches and commerce The tribute paid by the Romans themselves towards the support of the government was very considerable during the latter ages of the republic and it received an increase after the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa The establishments both civil and military in the different provinces were supported at their own expense the emperor required but a small naval force an arm which adds much to the public expenditure of maritime nations in modern times and the state was burdened with no diplomatic charges The vast treasure accruing from the various taxes centered in Rome and the whole was at the disposal of the emperor without any control We may therefore justly conclude that in the amount of taxes customs and every kind of financial resources Augustus exceeded all sovereigns who had hitherto ever swayed the sceptre of imperial dominion a noble acquisition had it been judiciously employed by his successors in promoting public happiness with half the profusion in which it was lavished in disgracing human nature and violating the rights of mankind The reign of Augustus is distinguished by the most extraordinary event recorded in history either sacred or profane the nativity of the Saviour of mankind which has since introduced a new epoch into the chronology of all Christian nations The commencement of the new aera being the most flourishing period of the Roman empire a general view of the state of knowledge and taste at this period may here not be improper Civilization was at this time extended farther over the world than it had ever been in any preceding period but polytheism rather increased than diminished with the advancement of commercial one hundred fifty seven intercourse between the nations of Europe Asia and Africa and though philosophy had been cultivated during several ages at Athens Cyrene Rome and other seats of learning yet the morals of mankind were little improved by the diffusion of speculative knowledge Socrates had laid an admirable foundation for the improvement of human nature by the exertion of reason through the whole economy of life but succeeding inquirers forsaking the true path of ethic investigation deviated into specious discussions rather ingenious than useful and some of them by gratuitously adopting principles which so far from being supported by reason were repugnant to its dictates endeavoured to erect upon the basis of their respective doctrines a system peculiar to themselves The doctrines of the Stoics and Epicureans were in fact pernicious to society and those of the different academies though more intimately connected with reason than the two former were of a nature too abstract to have any immediate or useful influence on life and manners General discussions of truth and probability with magnificent declamations on the to kalon and the summum bonum constituted the chief objects of attention amongst those who cultivated moral science in the shades of academical retirement Cicero endeavoured to bring back philosophy from speculation to practice and clearly evinced the social duties to be founded in the unalterable dictates of virtue but it was easier to demonstrate the truth of the principles which he maintained than to enforce their observance while the morals of mankind were little actuated by the exercise of reason alone The science chiefly cultivated at this period was rhetoric which appears to have differed considerably from what now passes under the same name The object of it was not so much justness of sentiment and propriety of expression as the art of declaiming or speaking copiously upon any subject It is mentioned by Varro as the reverse of logic and they are distinguished from each other by a simile that the former resembles the palm of the hand expanded and the latter contracted into the fist It is observable that logic though a part of education in modern times seems not to have been cultivated amongst the Romans Perhaps they were apprehensive lest a science which concentered the force of argument might obstruct the cultivation of that which was meant to dilate it Astronomy was long before known in the eastern nations but there is reason to believe from a passage in Virgil two hundred sixty nine that it was little cultivated by the Romans and it is certain that in the reformation of the calendar Julius Caesar was chiefly indebted to the scientific knowledge of one hundred fifty eight Sosigenes a mathematician of Alexandria The laws of the solar system were still but imperfectly known the popular belief that the sun moved round the earth was universally maintained and continued until the sixteenth century when the contrary was proved by Copernicus There existed many celebrated tracts on mathematics and several of the mechanical powers particularly that of the lever were cultivated with success The more necessary and useful rules of arithmetic were generally known The use of the load stone not being as yet discovered navigation was conducted in the day time by the sun and in the night by the observation of certain stars Geography was cultivated during the present period by Strabo and Mela In natural philosophy little progress was made but a strong desire of its improvement was entertained particularly by Virgil Human anatomy being not yet introduced physiology was imperfect Chemistry as a science was utterly unknown In medicine the writings of Hippocrates and other Greek physicians were in general the standard of practice but the Materia Medica contained few remedies of approved quality and abounded with useless substances as well as with many which stood upon no other foundation than the whimsical notions of those who first introduced them Architecture flourished through the elegant taste of Vitruvius and the patronage of the emperor Painting statuary and music were cultivated but not with that degree of perfection which they had obtained in the Grecian states The musical instruments of this period were the flute and the lyre to which may be added the sistrum lately imported from Egypt But the chief glory of the period is its literature of which we proceed to give some account At the head of the writers of this age stands the emperor himself with his minister Mecaenas but the works of both have almost totally perished It appears from the historian now translated that Augustus was the author of several productions in prose besides some in verse He wrote Answers to Brutus in relation to Cato Exhortations to Philosophy and the History of his own Life which he continued in thirteen books down to the war of Cantabria A book of his written in hexameter verse under the title of Sicily was extant in the time of Suetonius as was likewise a book of Epigrams He began a tragedy on the subject of Ajax but being dissatisfied with the composition destroyed it Whatever the merits of Augustus may have been as an author of which no judgment can be formed his attachment to learning and eminent writers affords a strong presumption that he was not destitute of taste Mecaenas is said to have written two tragedies Octavia and Prometheus a History of one hundred fifty nine Animals a Treatise on Precious Stones a Journal of the Life of Augustus and other productions Curiosity is strongly interested to discover the literary talents of a man so much distinguished for the esteem and patronage of them in others but while we regret the impossibility of such a development we scarcely can suppose the proficiency to have been small where the love and admiration were so great History was cultivated amongst the Romans during the present period with uncommon success This species of composition is calculated both for information and entertainment but the chief design of it is to record all transactions relative to the public for the purpose of enabling mankind to draw from past events a probable conjecture concerning the future and by knowing the steps which have led either to prosperity or misfortune to ascertain the best means of promoting the former and avoiding the latter of those objects This useful kind of narrative was introduced about five hundred years before by Herodotus who has thence received the appellation of the Father of History His style in conformity to the habits of thinking and the simplicity of language in an uncultivated age is plain and unadorned yet by the happy modulation of the Ionic dialect it gratified the ear and afforded to the states of Greece a pleasing mixture of entertainment enriched not only with various information often indeed fabulous or unauthentic but with the rudiments indirectly interspersed of political wisdom This writer after a long interval was succeeded by Thucydides and Xenophon the former of whom carried historical narrative to the highest degree of improvement it ever attained among the States of Greece The plan of Thucydides seems to have continued to be the model of historical narrative to the writers of Rome but the circumstances of the times aided perhaps by the splendid exertion of genius in other departments of literature suggested a new resource which promised not only to animate but embellish the future productions of the historic Muse This innovation consisted in an attempt to penetrate the human heart and explore in its innermost recesses the sentiments and secret motives which actuate the conduct of men By connecting moral effects with their probable internal and external causes it tended to establish a systematic consistency in the concatenation of transactions apparently anomalous accidental or totally independent of each other The author of this improvement in history was SALLUST who likewise introduced the method of enlivening narrative with the occasional aid of rhetorical declamation particularly in his account of the Catilinian conspiracy The notorious one hundred sixty characters and motives of the principal persons concerned in that horrible plot afforded the most favourable opportunity for exemplifying the former while the latter there is reason to infer from the facts which must have been at that time publicly known were founded upon documents of unquestionable authority Nay it is probable that Sallust was present in the senate during the debate respecting the punishment of the Catilinian conspirators his detail of which is agreeable to the characters of the several speakers but in detracting by invidious silence or too faint representation from the merits of Cicero on that important occasion he exhibits a glaring instance of the partiality which too often debases the narratives of those who record the transactions of their own time He had married Terentia the divorced wife of Cicero and there subsisted between the two husbands a kind of rivalship from that cause to which was probably added some degree of animosity on account of their difference in politics during the late dictatorship of Julius Caesar by whom Sallust was restored to the senate whence he had been expelled for licentiousness and was appointed governor of Numidia Excepting the injustice with which Sallust treats Cicero he is entitled to high commendation In both his remaining works the Conspiracy of Catiline and the War of Jugurtha there is a peculiar air of philosophical sentiment which joined to the elegant conciseness of style and animated description of characters gives to his writings a degree of interest superior to that which is excited in any preceding work of the historical kind In the occasional use of obsolete words and in laboured exordiums to both his histories he is liable to the charge of affectation but it is an affectation of language which supports solemnity without exciting disgust and of sentiment which not only exalts human nature but animates to virtuous exertions It seems to be the desire of Sallust to atone for the dissipation of his youth by a total change of conduct and whoever peruses his exordiums with the attention which they deserve must feel a strong persuasion of the justness of his remarks if not the incentives of a resolution to be governed by his example It seems to be certain that from the first moment of his reformation he incessantly practised the industry which he so warmly recommends He composed a History of Rome of which nothing remains but a few fragments Sallust during his administration of Numidia is said to have exercised great oppression On his return to Rome he built a magnificent house and bought delightful gardens the name of which with his own is to this day perpetuated on the spot which they formerly occupied Sallust was born at Amiternum in the country of the Sabines and one hundred sixty one received his education at Rome He incurred great scandal by an amour with Fausta the daughter of Sylla and wife of Milo who detecting the criminal intercourse is said to have beat him with stripes and extorted from him a large sum of money He died according to tradition in the fifty first year of his age CORNELIUS NEPOS was born at Hostilia near the banks of the Po Of his parentage we meet with no account but from his respectable connections early in life it is probable that he was of good extraction Among his most intimate friends were Cicero and Atticus Some authors relate that he composed three books of Chronicles with a biographical account of all the most celebrated sovereigns generals and writers of antiquity The language of Cornelius Nepos is pure his style perspicuous and he holds a middle and agreeable course between diffuseness and brevity He has not observed the same rule with respect to the treatment of every subject for the account of some of the lives is so short that we might suspect them to be mutilated did they not contain evident marks of their being completed in miniature The great extent of his plan induced him as he informs us to adopt this expedient Sed plura persequi tum magnitudo voluminis prohibet tum festinatio ut ea explicem quae exorsus sum two hundred seventy Of his numerous biographical works twenty two lives only remain which are all of Greeks except two Carthaginians Hamilcar and Hannibal and two Romans M Porcius Cato and T Pomponius Atticus Of his own life of him who had written the lives of so many no account is transmitted but from the multiplicity of his productions we may conclude that it was devoted to literature TITUS LIVIUS may be ranked among the most celebrated historians the world has ever produced He composed a history of Rome from the foundation of the city to the conclusion of the German war conducted by Drusus in the time of the emperor Augustus This great work consisted originally of one hundred and forty books of which there now remain only thirty five viz the first decade and the whole from book twenty one to book forty five both inclusive Of the other hundred and five books nothing more has survived the ravages of time and barbarians than their general contents In a perspicuous arrangement of his subject in a full and circumstantial account of transactions in the delineation of characters and other objects of description to justness and aptitude of sentiment and in an air of majesty one hundred sixty two pervading the whole composition this author may be regarded as one of the best models extant of historical narrative His style is splendid without meretricious ornament and copious without being redundant a fluency to which Quintilian gives the expressive appellation of lactea ubertas Amongst the beauties which we admire in his writings besides the animated speeches frequently interspersed are those concise and peculiarly applicable eulogiums with which he characterises every eminent person mentioned at the close of their life Of his industry in collating and his judgment in deciding upon the preference due to dissentient authorities in matters of testimony the work affords numberless proofs Of the freedom and impartiality with which he treated even of the recent periods of history there cannot be more convincing evidence than that he was rallied by Augustus as a favourer of Pompey and that under the same emperor he not only bestowed upon Cicero the tribute of warm approbation but dared to ascribe in an age when their names were obnoxious even to Brutus and Cassius the virtues of consistency and patriotism If in any thing the conduct of Livy violates our sentiments of historical dignity it is the apparent complacency and reverence with which he every where mentions the popular belief in omens and prodigies but this was the general superstition of the times and totally to renounce the prejudices of superstitious education is the last heroic sacrifice to philosophical scepticism In general however the credulity of Livy appears to be rather affected than real and his account of the exit of Romulus in the following passage may be adduced as an instance in confirmation of this remark His immortalibus editis operibus quum ad exercitum recensendum concionem in campo ad Caprae paludem haberet subita coorta tempestate cum magno fragore tonitribusque tam denso regem operuit nimbo ut conspectum ejus concioni abstulerit nec deinde in terris Romulus fuit Romana pubes sedato tandem pavore postquam ex tam turbido die serena et tranquilla lux rediit ubi vacuam sedem regiam vidit etsi satis credebat Patribus qui proximi steterant sublimem raptum procella tamen veluti orbitatis metu icta maestum aliquamdiu silentium obtinuit Deinde a paucis initio facto Deum Deo natum regem parentemque urbis Romanae salvere universi Romulum jubent pacem precibus exposcunt uti volens propitius suam semper sospitet progeniem Fuisse credo tum quoque aliquos qui discerptum regem Patrum manibus taciti arguerent manavit enim haec quoque et perobscura fama Illam alteram admiratio viri et pavor praesens nobilitavit Consilio etiam unius hominis addita rei dicitur fides namque Proculus Julius sollicita civitate desiderio one hundred sixty three regis et infensa Patribus gravis ut traditur quamvis magnae rei auctor in concionem prodit Romulus inquit Quirites parens urbis hujus prima hodierna luce coelo repente delapsus se mihi obvium dedit quam profusus horrore venerabundusque astitissem petens precibus ut contra intueri fas esset Abi nuncia inquit Romanis Coelestes ita velle ut mea Roma caput orbis terrarum sit proinde rem militarem colant sciantque et ita posteris tradant nullas opes humanas armis Romanis resistere posse Haec inquit locutus sublimis abiit Mirum quantum illi viro nuncianti haec fidei fuerit quamque desiderium Romuli apud plebem exercitumque facta fide immortalitatis lenitum sit two hundred seventy one Scarcely any incident in ancient history savours more of the one hundred sixty four marvellous than the account above delivered respecting the first Roman king and amidst all the solemnity with which it is related we may perceive that the historian was not the dupe of credulity There is more implied than the author thought proper to avow in the sentence Fuisse credo et cetera In whatever light this anecdote be viewed it is involved in perplexity That Romulus affected a despotic power is not only highly probable from his aspiring disposition but seems to be confirmed by his recent appointment of the Celeres as a guard to his person He might therefore naturally incur the odium of the patricians whose importance was diminished and their institution rendered abortive by the increase of his power But that they should choose the opportunity of a military review for the purpose of removing the tyrant by a violent death seems not very consistent with the dictates even of common prudence and it is the more incredible as the circumstance which favoured the execution of the plot is represented to have been entirely a fortuitous occurrence The tempest which is said to have happened is not easily reconcilable with our knowledge of that phenomenon Such a cloud or mist as could have enveloped Romulus from the eyes of the assembly is not a natural concomitant of a thunder storm There is some reason to suspect that both the noise and cloud if they actually existed were artificial the former intended to divert the attention of the spectators and the latter to conceal the transaction The word fragor a noise or crash appears to be an unnecessary addition where thunder is expressed though sometimes so used by the poets and may therefore perhaps imply such a noise from some other cause If Romulus was killed by any pointed or sharp edged weapon his blood might have been discovered on the spot or if by other means still the body was equally an object for public observation If the people suspected the patricians to be guilty of murder why did they not endeavour to trace the fact by this evidence And if the patricians were really innocent why did they not urge the examination But the body without doubt was secreted to favour the imposture The whole narrative is strongly marked with circumstances calculated to affect credulity with ideas of national importance and to countenance the design there is evidently a chasm in the Roman history immediately preceding this transaction and intimately connected with it Livy was born at Patavium two hundred seventy two and has been charged by Asinius Pollio and others with the provincial dialect of his country The objections to his Pativinity as it is called relate chiefly to the one hundred sixty five spelling of some words in which however there seems to be nothing so peculiar as either to occasion any obscurity or merit reprehension Livy and Sallust being the only two existing rivals in Roman history it may not be improper to draw a short comparison between them in respect of their principal qualities as writers With regard to language there is less apparent affectation in Livy than in Sallust The narrative of both is distinguished by an elevation of style the elevation of Sallust seems to be often supported by the dignity of assumed virtue that of Livy by a majestic air of historical and sometimes national importance In delineating characters Sallust infuses more expression and Livy more fulness into the features In the speeches ascribed to particular persons these writers are equally elegant and animated So great was the fame of Livy in his own life time that people came from the extremity of Spain and Gaul for the purpose only of beholding so celebrated a historian who was regarded for his abilities as a prodigy This affords a strong proof not only of the literary taste which then prevailed over the most extensive of the Roman provinces but of the extraordinary pains with which so great a work must have been propagated when the art of printing was unknown In the fifteenth century on the revival of learning in Europe the name of this great writer recovered its ancient veneration and Alphonso of Arragon with a superstition characteristic of that age requested of the people of Padua where Livy was born and is said to have been buried to be favoured by them with the hand which had written so admirable a work The celebrity of VIRGIL has proved the means of ascertaining his birth with more exactness than is common in the biographical memoirs of ancient writers He was born at Andes a village in the neighbourhood of Mantua on the fifteenth of October seventy years before the Christian aera His parents were of moderate condition but by their industry acquired some territorial possessions which descended to their son The first seven years of his life was spent at Cremona whence he went to Mediolanum now Milan at that time the seat of the liberal arts denominated as we learn from Pliny the younger Novae Athenae From this place he afterwards moved to Naples where he applied himself with great assiduity to Greek and Roman literature particularly to the physical and mathematical sciences for which he expressed a strong predilection in the second book of his Georgics Me vero primum dulces ante omnia Musae Quarum sacra fero ingenti perculsus amore one hundred sixty six Accipiant coelique vias et sidera monstrent Defectus Solis varios Lunaeque labores Unde tremor terris qua vi maria alta tumescant Obicibus ruptis rursusque in seipsa residant Quid tantum Oceano properent se tingere soles Hiberni vel quae tardis mora noctibus obstet Geor ii one five hundred ninety one et cetera But most beloved ye Muses at whose fane Led by pure zeal I consecrate my strain Me first accept And to my search unfold Heaven and her host in beauteous order rolled The eclipse that dims the golden orb of day And changeful labour of the lunar ray Whence rocks the earth by what vast force the main Now bursts its barriers now subsides again Why wintry suns in ocean swiftly fade Or what delays night s slow descending shade Sotheby When by a proscription of the Triumvirate the lands of Cremona and Mantua were distributed amongst the veteran soldiers Virgil had the good fortune to recover his possessions through the favour of Asinius Pollio the deputy of Augustus in those parts to whom as well as to the emperor he has testified his gratitude in beautiful eclogues The first production of Virgil was his Bucolics consisting of ten eclogues written in imitation of the Idyllia or pastoral poems of Theocritus It may be questioned whether any language which has its provincial dialects but is brought to perfection can ever be well adapted in that state to the use of pastoral poetry There is such an apparent incongruity between the simple ideas of the rural swain and the polished language of the courtier that it seems impossible to reconcile them together by the utmost art of composition The Doric dialect of Theocritus therefore abstractedly from all consideration of simplicity of sentiment must ever give to the Sicilian bard a pre eminence in this species of poetry The greater part of the Bucolics of Virgil may be regarded as poems of a peculiar nature into which the author has happily transfused in elegant versification the native manners and ideas without any mixture of the rusticity of pastoral life With respect to the fourth eclogue addressed to Pollio it is avowedly of a nature superior to that of pastoral subjects Sicelides Musae paullo majora canamus Sicilian Muse be ours a loftier strain Virgil engaged in bucolic poetry at the request of Asinius Pollio whom he highly esteemed and for one of whose sons in particular one hundred sixty seven with Cornelius Gallus a poet likewise he entertained the warmest affection He has celebrated them all in these poems which were begun we are told in the twenty ninth year of his age and completed in three years They were held in so great esteem amongst the Romans immediately after their publication that it is said they were frequently recited upon the stage for the entertainment of the audience Cicero upon hearing some lines of them perceived that they were written in no common strain of poetry and desired that the whole eclogue might be recited which being done he exclaimed Magnae spes altera Romae Another hope of mighty Rome two hundred seventy three Virgil s next work was the Georgics the idea of which is taken from the Erga kai Hmerai the Works and Days of Hesiod the poet of Ascra But between the productions of the two poets there is no other similarity than that of their common subject The precepts of Hesiod in respect of agriculture are delivered with all the simplicity of an unlettered cultivator of the fields intermixed with plain moral reflections natural and apposite while those of Virgil equally precise and important are embellished with all the dignity of sublime versification The work is addressed to Mecaenas at whose request it appears to have been undertaken It is divided into four books The first treats of ploughing the second of planting the third of cattle horses sheep goats dogs and of things which are hurtful to cattle the fourth is employed on bees their proper habitations food polity the diseases to which they are liable and the remedies of them with the method of making honey and a variety of other considerations connected with the subject The Georgics one hundred sixty eight were written at Naples and employed the author during a period of seven years It is said that Virgil had concluded the Georgics with a laboured eulogium on his poetical friend Gallus but the latter incurring about this time the displeasure of Augustus he was induced to cancel it and substitute the charming episode of Astaeus and Eurydice These beautiful poems considered merely as didactic have the justest claim to utility In what relates to agriculture in particular the precepts were judiciously adapted to the climate of Italy and must have conveyed much valuable information to those who were desirous of cultivating that important art which was held in great honour amongst the Romans The same remark may be made with greater latitude of application in respect of the other subjects But when we examine the Georgics as poetical compositions when we attend to the elevated style in which they are written the beauty of the similes the emphatic sentiments interspersed the elegance of diction the animated strain of the whole and the harmony of the versification our admiration is excited at beholding subjects so common in their nature embellished with the most magnificent decorations of poetry During four days which Augustus passed at Atella to refresh himself from fatigue in his return to Rome after the battle of Actium the Georgics just then finished were read to him by the author who was occasionally relieved in the task by his friend Mecaenas We may easily conceive the satisfaction enjoyed by the emperor at finding that while he himself had been gathering laurels in the achievements of war another glorious wreath was prepared by the Muses to adorn his temples and that an intimation was given of his being afterwards celebrated in a work more congenial to the subject of heroic renown It is generally supposed that the Aeneid was written at the particular desire of Augustus who was ambitious of having the Julian family represented as lineal descendants of the Trojan Aeneas In this celebrated poem Virgil has happily united the characteristics of the Iliad and Odyssey and blended them so judiciously together that they mutually contribute to the general effect of the whole By the esteem and sympathy excited for the filial piety and misfortunes of Aeneas at the catastrophe of Troy the reader is strongly interested in his subsequent adventures and every obstacle to the establishment of the Trojans in the promised land of Hesperia produces fresh sensations of increased admiration and attachment The episodes characters and incidents all concur to give beauty or grandeur to the poem The picture of Troy in flames can never be sufficiently one hundred sixty nine admired The incomparable portrait of Priam in Homer is admirably accommodated to a different situation in the character of Anchises in the Aeneid The prophetic rage of the Cumaean Sibyl displays in the strongest colours the enthusiasm of the poet For sentiment passion and interesting description the episode of Dido is a master piece in poetry But Virgil is not more conspicuous for strength of description than propriety of sentiment and wherever he takes a hint from the Grecian bard he prosecutes the idea with a judgment peculiar to himself It may be sufficient to mention one instance In the sixth book of the Iliad while the Greeks are making great slaughter amongst the Trojans Hector by the advice of Helenus retires into the city to desire that his mother would offer up prayers to the goddess Pallas and vow to her a noble sacrifice if she would drive Diomede from the walls of Troy Immediately before his return to the field of battle he has his last interview with Andromache whom he meets with his infant son Astyanax carried by a nurse There occurs upon this occasion one of the most beautiful scenes in the Iliad where Hector dandles the boy in his arms and pours forth a prayer that he may one day be superior in fame to his father In the same manner Aeneas having armed himself for the decisive combat with Turnus addresses his son Ascanius in a beautiful speech which while expressive of the strongest paternal affection contains instead of a prayer a noble and emphatic admonition suitable to a youth who had nearly attained the period of adult age It is as follows Disce puer virtutem ex me verumque laborem Fortunam ex aliis nunc te mea dextera bello Defensum dabit et magna inter praemia ducet Tu facito mox cum matura adoleverit aetas Sis memor et te animo repetentem exempla tuorum Et pater Aeneas et avunculus excitet Hector Aeneid xii My son from my example learn the war In camps to suffer and in feuds to dare But happier chance than mine attend thy care This day my hand thy tender age shall shield And crown with honours of the conquered field Thou when thy riper years shall send thee forth To toils of war be mindful of my worth Assert thy birthright and in arms be known For Hector s nephew and Aeneas son Virgil though born to shine by his own intrinsic powers certainly owed much of his excellence to the wonderful merits of Homer His susceptible imagination vivid and correct was one hundred seventy impregnated by the Odyssey and warmed with the fire of the Iliad Rivalling or rather on some occasions surpassing his glorious predecessor in the characters of heroes and of gods he sustains their dignity with so uniform a lustre that they seem indeed more than mortal Whether the Iliad or the Aeneid be the more perfect composition is a question which has often been agitated but perhaps will never be determined to general satisfaction In comparing the genius of the two poets however allowance ought to be made for the difference of circumstances under which they composed their respective works Homer wrote in an age when mankind had not as yet made any great progress in the exertion of either intellect or imagination and he was therefore indebted for big resources to the vast capacity of his own mind To this we must add that he composed both his poems in a situation of life extremely unfavourable to the cultivation of poetry Virgil on the contrary lived at a period when literature had attained to a high state of improvement He had likewise not only the advantage of finding a model in the works of Homer but of perusing the laws of epic poetry which had been digested by Aristotle and the various observations made on the writings of the Greek bard by critics of acuteness and taste amongst the chief of whom was his friend Horace who remarks that quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus De Arte Poet E en sometimes the good Homer naps Virgil besides composed his poem in a state remote from indigence where he was roused to exertion by the example of several contemporary poets and what must have animated him beyond every other consideration he wrote both at the desire and under the patronage of the emperor and his minister Mecaenas In what time Homer composed either of his poems we know not but the Aeneid we are informed was the employment of Virgil during eleven years For some years the repeated entreaties of Augustus could not extort from him the smallest specimen of the work but at length when considerably advanced in it he condescended to recite three books the second the fourth and the sixth in the presence of the emperor and his sister Octavia to gratify the latter of whom in particular the recital of the last book now mentioned was intended When the poet came to the words Tu Marcellus eris alluding to Octavia s son a youth of great hopes who had lately died the mother fainted After she had recovered from this fit by the care of her attendants she ordered ten sesterces to be given to Virgil for every line relating one hundred seventy one to that subject a gratuity which amounted to about two thousand pounds sterling In the composition of the Aeneid Virgil scrupled not to introduce whole lines of Homer and of the Latin poet Ennius many of whose sentences he admired In a few instances he has borrowed from Lucretius He is said to have been at extraordinary pains in polishing his numbers and when he was doubtful of any passage he would read it to some of his friends that he might have their opinion On such occasions it was usual with him to consult in particular his freedman and librarian Erotes an old domestic who it is related supplied extempore a deficiency in two lines and was desired by his master to write them in the manuscript When this immortal work was completed Virgil resolved on retiring into Greece and Asia for three years that he might devote himself entirely to polishing it and have leisure afterwards to pass the remainder of his life in the cultivation of philosophy But meeting at Athens with Augustus who was on his return from the East he determined on accompanying the emperor back to Rome Upon a visit to Megara a town in the neighbourhood of Athens he was seized with a languor which increased during the ensuing voyage and he expired a few days after landing at Brundisium on the twenty second of September in the fifty second year of his age He desired that his body might be carried to Naples where he had passed many happy years and that the following distich written in his last sickness should be inscribed upon his tomb Mantua me genuit Calabri rapuere tenet nunc Parthenope cecini pascua rura duces two hundred seventy four He was accordingly interred by the order of Augustus with great funeral pomp within two miles of Naples near the road to Puteoli where his tomb still exists Of his estate which was very considerable by the liberality of his friends he left the greater part to Valerius Proculus and his brother a fourth to Augustus a twelfth to Mecaenas besides legacies to L Varius and Plotius Tucca who in consequence of his own request and the command of Augustus revised and corrected the Aeneid after his death Their instructions from the emperor were to expunge whatever they thought improper but upon no account to make any addition This restriction is supposed to be the cause that many lines in the Aeneid are imperfect Virgil was of large stature had a dark complexion and his one hundred seventy two features are said to have been such as expressed no uncommon abilities He was subject to complaints of the stomach and throat as well as to head ache and had frequent discharges of blood upwards but from what part we are not informed He was very temperate both in food and wine His modesty was so great that at Naples they commonly gave him the name of Parthenias the modest man On the subject of his modesty the following anecdote is related Having written a distich in which he compared Augustus to Jupiter he placed it in the night time over the gate of the emperor s palace It was in these words Nocte pluit tota redeunt spectacula mane Divisum imperium cum Jove Caesar habet All night it rained with morn the sports appear Caesar and Jove between them rule the year By order of Augustus an inquiry was made after the author and Virgil not declaring himself the verses were claimed by Bathyllus a contemptible poet but who was liberally rewarded on the occasion Virgil provoked at the falsehood of the impostor again wrote the verses on some conspicuous part of the palace and under them the following line Hos ego versiculos feci tulit alter honorem I wrote the verse another filched the praise with the beginning of another line in these words Sic vos non vobis Not for yourselves you repeated four times Augustus expressing a desire that the lines should be finished and Bathyllus proving unequal to the task Virgil at last filled up the blanks in this manner Sic vos non vobis nidificatis aves Sic vos non vobis vellera fertis oves Sic vos non vobis mellificatis apes Sic vos non vobis fertis aratra boves Not for yourselves ye birds your nests ye build Not for yourselves ye sheep your fleece ye yield Not for yourselves ye bees your cells ye fill Not for yourselves ye beeves ye plough and till The expedient immediately evinced him to be the author of the distich and Bathyllus became the theme of public ridicule When at any time Virgil came to Rome if the people as was commonly the case crowded to gaze upon him or pointed at him with the finger in admiration he blushed and stole away one hundred seventy three from them frequently taking refuge in some shop When he went to the theatre the audience universally rose up at his entrance as they did to Augustus and received him with the loudest plaudits a compliment which however highly honourable he would gladly have declined When such was the just respect which they paid to the author of the Bucolics and Georgics how would they have expressed their esteem had they beheld him in the effulgence of epic renown In the beautiful episode of the Elysian fields in the Aeneid where he dexterously introduced a glorious display of their country he had touched the most elastic springs of Roman enthusiasm The passion would have rebounded upon himself and they would in the heat of admiration have idolized him HORACE was born at Venusia on the tenth of December in the consulship of L Cotta and L Torquatus According to his own acknowledgment his father was a freedman by some it is said that he was a collector of the revenue and by others a fishmonger or a dealer in salted meat Whatever he was he paid particular attention to the education of his son for after receiving instruction from the best masters in Rome he sent him to Athens to study philosophy From this place Horace followed Brutus in the quality of a military tribune to the battle of Philippi where by his own confession being seized with timidity he abandoned the profession of a soldier and returning to Rome applied himself to the cultivation of poetry In a short time he acquired the friendship of Virgil and Valerius whom he mentions in his Satires in terms of the most tender affection Postera lux oritur multo gratissima namque Plotius et Varius Sinuessae Virgiliusque Occurrunt animae quales neque candidiores Terra tulit neque queis me sit devinctior alter O qui complexus et gaudia quanta fuerunt Nil ego contulerim jucundo sanus amico Sat I five Next rising morn with double joy we greet For Plotius Varius Virgil here we meet Pure spirits these the world no purer knows For none my heart with more affection glows How oft did we embrace our joys how great For sure no blessing in the power of fate Can be compared in sanity of mind To friends of such companionable kind Francis By the two friends above mentioned he was recommended to the patronage not only of Mecaenas but of Augustus with whom he as well as Virgil lived on a footing of the greatest intimacy Satisfied with the luxury which he enjoyed at the first tables in one hundred seventy four Rome he was so unambitious of any public employment that when the emperor offered him the place of his secretary he declined it But as he lived in an elegant manner having besides his house in town a cottage on his Sabine farm and a villa at Tibur near the falls of the Anio he enjoyed beyond all doubt a handsome establishment from the liberality of Augustus He indulged himself in indolence and social pleasure but was at the same time much devoted to reading and enjoyed a tolerable good state of health although often incommoded with a fluxion of rheum upon the eyes Horace in the ardour of youth and when his bosom beat high with the raptures of fancy had in the pursuit of Grecian literature drunk largely at the source of the delicious springs of Castalia and it seems to have been ever after his chief ambition to transplant into the plains of Latium the palm of lyric poetry Nor did he

this department among the Greeks nine eminent poets viz Alcaeus Alcman Anacreon Bacchylides Ibicus Sappho Stesichorus Simonides and Pindar The greater number of this distinguished class are now known only by name They seem all to have differed from one another no less in the kind of measure which they chiefly or solely employed than in the strength or softness the beauty or grandeur the animated rapidity or the graceful ease of their various compositions Of the amorous effusions of the lyre we yet have examples in the odes of Anacreon and the incomparable ode of Sappho the lyric strains which animated to battle have sunk into oblivion but the victors in the public games of Greece have their fame perpetuated in the admirable productions of Pindar Horace by adopting in the multiplicity of his subjects almost all the various measures of the different Greek poets and frequently combining different measures in the same composition has compensated for the dialects of that tongue so happily suited to poetry and given to a language less distinguished for soft inflexions all the tender and delicate modulations of the Eastern song While he moves in the measures of the Greeks with an ease and gracefulness which rivals their own acknowledged excellence he has enriched the fund of lyric harmony with a stanza peculiar to himself In the artificial construction of the Ode he may justly be regarded as the first of lyric poets In beautiful imagery he is inferior to none in variety of sentiment and felicity of expression superior to every existing competitor in Greek or Roman poetry He is elegant without affectation and what is more remarkable in the midst of gaiety he is moral We seldom meet in his Odes with the abrupt apostrophes of passionate excursion but his transitions are conducted with ease and every subject introduced with propriety The Carmen Seculare was written at the express desire of Augustus for the celebration of the Secular Games performed once in a hundred years and which continued during three days and three nights whilst all Rome resounded with the mingled effusions of choral addresses to gods and goddesses and of festive joy An occasion which so much interested the ambition of the poet called into exertion the most vigorous efforts of his genius More concise in mythological attributes than the hymns ascribed to Homer this beautiful production in variety and grandeur of invocation and in pomp of numbers surpasses all that Greece one hundred seventy six melodious but simple in the service of the altar ever poured forth from her vocal groves in solemn adoration By the force of native genius the ancients elevated their heroes to a pitch of sublimity that excites admiration but to soar beyond which they could derive no aid from mythology and it was reserved for a bard inspired with nobler sentiments than the Muses could supply to sing the praises of that Being whose ineffable perfections transcend all human imagination Of the praises of gods and heroes there is not now extant a more beautiful composition than the twelfth Ode of the first book of Horace Quem virum aut heroa lyra vel acri Tibia sumes celebrare Clio Quem Deum cujus

The sportive image of the voice Shall in the shades of Helicon repeat et cetera The Satires of Horace are far from being remarkable for poetical harmony as he himself acknowledges Indeed according to the plan upon which several of them are written it could scarcely be otherwise They are frequently colloquial sometimes interrogatory the transitions quick and the apostrophes abrupt It was not his object in those compositions to soothe the ear with the melody of polished numbers but to rally the frailties of the heart to convince the understanding by argument and thence to put to shame both the vices and follies of mankind Satire is a species of composition of which the Greeks furnished no model and the preceding Roman writers of this class though they had much improved it from its original rudeness and licentiousness had still not brought it to that degree of perfection which might answer the purpose of moral reform in a polished state of society It received the most essential improvement from Horace who has dexterously combined wit and argument raillery and sarcasm on the side of morality and virtue of happiness and truth The Epistles of this author may be reckoned amongst the most valuable productions of antiquity Except those of the second book and one or two in the first they are in general of the familiar kind abounding in moral sentiments and judicious observations on life and manners The poem De Arte Poetica comprises a system of criticism in justness of principle and extent of application correspondent to the various exertions of genius on subjects of invention and taste one hundred seventy seven That in composing this excellent production he availed himself of the most approved works of Grecian original we may conclude from the advice which he there recommends Vos exemplaria Graeca Nocturna versate manu versate diurna Make the Greek authors your supreme delight Read them by day and study them by night Francis In the writings of Horace there appears a fund of good sense enlivened with pleasantry and refined by philosophical reflection He had cultivated his judgment with great application and his taste was guided by intuitive perception of moral beauty aptitude and propriety The few instances of indelicacy which occur in his compositions we may ascribe rather to the manners of the times than to any blameable propensity in the author Horace died in the fifty seventh year of his age surviving his beloved Mecaenas only three weeks a circumstance which added to the declaration in an ode two hundred seventy six to that personage supposed to have been written in Mecaenas s last illness has given rise to a conjecture that Horace ended his days by a violent death to accompany his friend But it is more natural to conclude that he died of excessive grief as had he literally adhered to the affirmation contained in the ode he would have followed his patron more closely This seems to be confirmed by a fact immediately preceding his death for though he declared Augustus heir to his whole estate he was not able on account of weakness to put his signature to the will a failure which it is probable that he would have taken care to obviate had his death been premeditated He was interred at his own desire near the tomb of Mecaenas OVID was born of an equestrian family at Sulmo a town of the Peligni on the twenty first of March in the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa His father intended him for the bar and after passing him through the usual course of instruction at Rome he was sent to Athens the emporium of learning to complete his education On his return to Rome in obedience to the desire of his father he entered upon the offices of public life in the forum and declaimed with great applause But this was the effect of paternal authority not of choice for from his earliest years he discovered an extreme attachment to poetry and no sooner was his father dead than renouncing the bar he devoted himself entirely to the cultivation of that fascinating art his propensity to which was invincible His productions all written either in heroic or pentameter verse are numerous and on various subjects It will be sufficient to mention them briefly one hundred seventy eight The Heroides consist of twenty one Epistles all which except three are feigned to be written from celebrated women of antiquity to their husbands or lovers such as Penelope to Ulysses Dido to Aeneas Sappho to Phaon et cetera These compositions are nervous animated and elegant they discover a high degree of poetic enthusiasm but blended with that lascivious turn of thought which pervades all the amorous productions of this celebrated author The elegies on subjects of love particularly the Ars Amandi or Ars Amatoria though not all uniform in versification possess the same general character of warmth of passion and luscious description as the epistles The Fasti were divided into twelve books of which only the first six now remain The design of them was to deliver an account of the Roman festivals in every month of the year with a description of the rites and ceremonies as well as the sacrifices on those occasions It is to be regretted that on a subject so interesting this valuable work should not have been transmitted entire but in the part which remains we are furnished with a beautiful description of the ceremonial transactions in the Roman calendar from the first of January to the end of June The versification as in all the compositions of this author is easy and harmonious The most popular production of this poet is his Metamorphoses not less extraordinary for the nature of the subject than for the admirable art with which the whole is conducted The work is founded upon the traditions and theogony of the ancients which consisted of various detached fables Those Ovid has not only so happily arranged that they form a coherent series of narratives one rising out of another but he describes the different changes with such an imposing plausibility as to give a natural appearance to the most incredible fictions This ingenious production however perfect it may appear we are told by himself had not received his last corrections when he was ordered into banishment In the Ibis the author imitates a poem of the same name written by Callimachus It is an invective against some person who publicly traduced his character at Rome after his banishment A strong sensibility indignation and implacable resentment are conspicuous through the whole The Tristia were composed in his exile in which though his vivacity forsook him he still retained a genius prolific in versification In these poems as well as in many epistles to different persons he bewails his unhappy situation and deprecates in the strongest terms the inexorable displeasure of Augustus Several other productions written by Ovid are now lost and one hundred seventy nine amongst them a tragedy called Medea of which Quintilian expresses a high opinion Ovidii Medea videtur mihi ostendere quantum vir ille praestare potuerit si ingenio suo temperare quam indulgere maluisset two hundred seventy seven Lib x c one It is a peculiarity in the productions of this author that on whatever he employs his pen he exhausts the subject not with any prolixity that fatigues the attention but by a quick succession of new ideas equally brilliant and apposite often expressed in antitheses Void of obscenity in expression but lascivious in sentiment he may be said rather to stimulate immorally the natural passions than to corrupt the imagination No poet is more guided in versification by the nature of his subject than Ovid In common narrative his ideas are expressed with almost colloquial simplicity but when his fancy glows with sentiment or is animated by objects of grandeur his style is proportionably elevated and he rises to a pitch of sublimity No point in ancient history has excited more variety of conjectures than the banishment of Ovid but after all the efforts of different writers to elucidate the subject the cause of this extraordinary transaction remains involved in obscurity It may therefore not be improper in this place to examine the foundation of the several conjectures which have been formed and if they appear to be utterly imadmissible to attempt a solution of the question upon principles more conformable to probability and countenanced by historical evidence The ostensible reason assigned by Augustus for banishing Ovid was his corrupting the Roman youth by lascivious publications but it is evident from various passages in the poet s productions after this period that there was besides some secret reason which would not admit of being divulged He says in his Tristia Lib ii one Perdiderent cum me duo crimina carmen et errors two hundred seventy eight It appears from another passage in the same work that this inviolable arcanum was something which Ovid had seen and as he insinuates through his own ignorance and mistake Cur aliquid vidi cur conscia lumina feci Cur imprudenti cognita culpa mihi est Ibid one hundred eighty Inscia quod crimen viderunt lumina plector Peccatumque oculos est habuisse meum two hundred seventy nine De Trist iii five It seems therefore to be a fact sufficiently established that Ovid had seen something of a very indecent nature in which Augustus was concerned What this was is the question Some authors conceiving it to have been of a kind extremely atrocious have gone so far as to suppose that it must have been an act of criminality between Augustus and his own daughter Julia who notwithstanding the strict attention paid to her education by her father became a woman of the most infamous character suspected of incontinence during her marriage with Agrippa and openly profligate after her union with her next husband Tiberius This supposition however rests entirely upon conjecture and is not only discredited by its own improbability but by a yet more forcible argument It is certain that Julia was at this time in banishment for her scandalous life She was about the same age with Tiberius who was now forty seven and they had not cohabited for many years We know not exactly the year in which Augustus sent her into exile but we may conclude with confidence that it happened soon after her separation from Tiberius whose own interest with the emperor as well as that of his mother Livia could not fail of being exerted if any such application was necessary towards removing from the capital a woman who by the notoriety of her prostitution reflected disgrace upon all with whom she was connected either by blood or alliance But no application from Tiberius or his mother could be necessary when we are assured that Augustus even presented to the senate a narrative respecting the infamous behaviour of his daughter which was read by the quaestor He was so much ashamed of her profligacy that he for a long time declined all company and had thoughts of putting her to death She was banished to an island on the coast of Campania for five years at the expiration of which period she was removed to the continent and the severity of her treatment a little mitigated but though frequent applications were made in her behalf by the people Augustus never could be prevailed upon to permit her return one hundred eighty one Other writers have conjectured that instead of Julia the daughter of Augustus the person seen with him by Ovid may have been Julia his grand daughter who inherited the vicious disposition of her mother and was on that account likewise banished by Augustus The epoch of this lady s banishment it is impossible to ascertain and therefore no argument can be drawn from that source to invalidate the present conjecture But Augustus had shown the same solicitude for her being trained up in virtuous habits as he had done in respect of her mother though in both cases unsuccessfully and this consideration joined to the enormity of the supposed crime and the great sensibility which Augustus had discovered with regard to the infamy of his daughter seems sufficient to exonerate his memory from so odious a charge Besides is it possible that he could have sent her into banishment for the infamy of her prostitution while upon the supposition of incest she was mistress of so important a secret as that he himself had been more criminal with her than any other man in the empire Some writers giving a wider scope to conjecture have supposed the transaction to be of a nature still more detestable and have even dragged Mecaenas the minister into a participation of the crime Fortunately however for the reputation of the illustrious patron of polite learning as well as for that of the emperor this crude conjecture may be refuted upon the evidence of chronology The commencement of Ovid s exile happened in the ninth year of the Christian aera and the death of Mecaenas eight years before that period Between this and other calculations we find a difference of three or four years but allowing the utmost latitude of variation there intervened from the death of Mecaenas to the banishment of Ovid a period of eleven years an observation which fully invalidates the conjecture above mentioned Having now refuted as it is presumed the opinions of the different commentators on this subject we shall proceed to offer a new conjecture which seems to have a greater claim to probability than any that has hitherto been suggested Suetonius informs us that Augustus in the latter part of his life contracted a vicious inclination for the enjoyment of young virgins who were procured for him from all parts not only with the connivance but by the clandestine management of his consort Livia It was therefore probably with one of those victims that he was discovered by Ovid Augustus had for many years affected a decency of behaviour and he would therefore naturally be not a little disconcerted at the unseasonable intrusion of the poet That Ovid knew not of Augustus s being in the place is beyond all doubt and Augustus s consciousness one hundred eighty two of this circumstance together with the character of Ovid would suggest an unfavourable suspicion of the motive which had brought the latter thither Abstracted from the immorality of the emperor s own conduct the incident might be regarded as ludicrous and certainly was more fit to excite the shame than the indignation of Augustus But the purpose of Ovid s visit appears from his own acknowledgment to have been not entirely free from blame though of what nature we know not Non equidem totam possum defendere culpam Sed partem nostri criminis error habet De Trist Lib iii Eleg five I know I cannot wholly be defended Yet plead twas chance no ill was then intended Catlin Ovid was at this time turned of fifty and though by a much younger man he would not have been regarded as any object of jealousy in love yet by Augustus now in his sixty ninth year he might be deemed a formidable rival This passion therefore concurring with that which arose from the interruption or disappointment of gratification inflamed the emperor s resentment and he resolved on banishing to a distant country a man whom he considered as his rival and whose presence from what had happened he never more could endure Augustus having determined on the banishment of Ovid could find little difficulty in accommodating the ostensible to the secret and real cause of this resolution No argument to establish the date of publication can be drawn from the order in which the various productions of Ovid are placed in the collection of his works but reasoning from probability we should suppose that the Ars Amandi was written during the period of his youth and this seems to be confirmed by the following passage in the second book of the Fasti Certe ego vos habui faciles in amore ministros Cum lusit numeris prima juventa suis two hundred eighty That many years must have elapsed since its original publication is evident from the subsequent lines in the second book of the Tristia Nos quoque jam pridem scripto peccavimus uno Supplicium patitur non nova culpa novum Carminaque edideram cum te delicta notantem Praeterii toties jure quietus eques one hundred eighty three Ergo quae juveni mihi non nocitura putavi Scripta parum prudens nunc nocuere seni two hundred eighty one With what show then of justice it may be asked could Augustus now punish a fault which in his solemn capacity of censor he had so long and repeatedly overlooked The answer is obvious in a production so popular as we may be assured the Ars Amandi was amongst the Roman youth it must have passed through several editions in the course of some years and one of those coinciding with the fatal discovery afforded the emperor a specious pretext for the execution of his purpose The severity exercised on this occasion however when the poet was suddenly driven into exile unaccompanied even by the partner of his bed who had been his companion for many years was an act so inconsistent with the usual moderation of Augustus that we cannot justly ascribe it to any other motive than personal resentment especially as this arbitrary punishment of the author could answer no end of public utility while the obnoxious production remained to affect if it really ever did essentially affect the morals of society If the sensibility of Augustus could not thenceforth admit of any personal intercourse with Ovid or even of his living within the limits of Italy there would have been little danger from the example in sending into honourable exile with every indulgence which could alleviate so distressful a necessity a man of respectable rank in the state who was charged with no actual offence against the laws and whose genius with all its indiscretion did immortal honour to his country It may perhaps be urged that considering the predicament in which Augustus stood he discovered a forbearance greater than might have been expected from an absolute prince in sparing the life of Ovid It will readily be granted that Ovid in the same circumstances under any one of the four subsequent emperors would have expiated the incident with his blood Augustus upon a late occasion had shown himself equally sanguinary for he put to death by the hand of Varus a poet of Parma named Cassius on account of his having written some satirical verses against him By that recent example therefore and the power of pardoning which the emperor still retained there was sufficient hold of the poet s secrecy respecting the fatal transaction which if divulged one hundred eighty four to the world Augustus would reprobate as a false and infamous libel and punish the author accordingly Ovid on his part was sensible that should he dare to violate the important but tacit injunction the imperial vengeance would reach him even on the shores of the Euxine It appears however from a passage in the Ibis which can apply to no other than Augustus that Ovid was not sent into banishment destitute of pecuniary provision Di melius quorum longe mihi maximus ille Qui nostras inopes noluit esse vias Huic igitur meritas grates ubicumque licebit Pro tam mansueto pectore semper agam The gods defend of whom he s far the chief Who lets me not though banished want relief For this his favour therefore whilst I live Where er I am deserved thanks I ll give What sum the emperor bestowed for the support of a banishment which he was resolved should be perpetual it is impossible to ascertain but he had formerly been liberal to Ovid as well as to other poets If we might hazard a conjecture respecting the scene of the intrigue which occasioned the banishment of Ovid we should place it in some recess in the emperor s gardens His house though called Palatium the palace as being built on the Palatine hill and inhabited by the sovereign was only a small mansion which had formerly belonged to Hortensius the orator Adjoining to this place Augustus had built the temple of Apollo which he endowed with a public library and allotted for the use of poets to recite their compositions to each other Ovid was particularly intimate with Hyginus one of Augustus s freedmen who was librarian of the temple He might therefore have been in the library and spying from the window a young female secreting herself in the gardens he had the curiosity to follow her The place of Ovid s banishment was Tomi two hundred eighty two now said to be Baba a town of Bulgaria towards the mouth of the Ister where is a lake still called by the natives Ouvidouve Jesero the lake of Ovid In this retirement and the Euxine Pontus he passed the remainder of his life a melancholy period of seven years Notwithstanding the lascivious writings of Ovid it does not appear that he was in his conduct a libertine He was three times married his first wife who was of mean extraction and one hundred eighty five whom he had married when he was very young he divorced the second he dismissed on account of her immodest behaviour and the third appears to have survived him He had a number of respectable friends and seems to have been much beloved by them TIBULLUS was descended of an equestrian family and is said but erroneously as will afterwards appear to have been born on the same day with Ovid His amiable accomplishments procured him the friendship of Messala Corvinus whom he accompanied in a military expedition to the island of Corcyra But an indisposition with which he was seized and a natural aversion to the toils of war induced him to return to Rome where he seems to have resigned himself to a life of indolence and pleasure amidst which he devoted a part of his time to the composition of elegies Elegiac poetry had been cultivated by several Greek writers particularly Callimachus Mimnermus and Philetas but so far as we can find had until the present age been unknown to the Romans in their own tongue It consisted of a heroic and pentameter line alternately and was not like the elegy of the moderns usually appropriated to the lamentation of the deceased but employed chiefly in compositions relative to love or friendship and might indeed be used upon almost any subject though from the limp in the pentameter line it is not suitable to sublime subjects which require a fulness of expression and an expansion of sound To this species of poetry Tibullus restricted his application by which he cultivated that simplicity and tenderness and agreeable ease of sentiment which constitute the characteristic perfections of the elegiac muse In the description of rural scenes the peaceful occupations of the field the charms of domestic happiness and the joys of reciprocal love scarcely any poet surpasses Tibullus His luxuriant imagination collects the most beautiful flowers of nature and he displays them with all the delicate attraction of soft and harmonious numbers With a dexterity peculiar to himself in whatever subject he engages he leads his readers imperceptibly through devious paths of pleasure of which at the outset of the poem they could form no conception He seems to have often written without any previous meditation or design Several of his elegies may be said to have neither middle nor end yet the transitions are so natural and the gradations so easy that though we wander through Elysian scenes of fancy the most heterogeneous in their nature we are sensible of no defect in the concatenation which has joined them together It is however to be regretted that in some instances Tibullus betrays that licentiousness of manners which one hundred eighty six formed too general a characteristic even of this refined age His elegies addressed to Messala contain a beautiful amplification of sentiments founded in friendship and esteem in which it is difficult to say whether the virtues of the patron or the genius of the poet be more conspicuous Valerius Messala Corvinus whom he celebrates was descended of a very ancient family In the civil wars which followed the death of Julius Caesar he joined the republican party and made himself master of the camp of Octavius at Philippi but he was afterwards reconciled to his opponent and lived to an advanced age in favour and esteem with Augustus He was distinguished not only by his military talents but by his eloquence integrity and patriotism From the following passage in the writings of Tibullus commentators have conjectured that he was deprived of his lands by the same proscription in which those of Virgil had been involved Cui fuerant flavi ditantes ordine sulci Horrea faecundas ad deficientia messes Cuique pecus denso pascebant agmine colles Et domino satis et nimium furique lupoque Nunc desiderium superest nam cura novatur Cum memor anteactos semper dolor admovet annos Lib iv El one But this seems not very probable when we consider that Horace several years after that period represents him as opulent Dii tibi divitias dederant artemque fruendi Epist Lib i four To thee the gods a fair estate In bounty gave with heart to know How to enjoy what they bestow Francis We know not the age of Tibullus at the time of his death but in an elegy written by Ovid upon that occasion he is spoken of as a young man Were it true as is said by biographers that he was born the same day with Ovid we must indeed assign the event to an early period for Ovid cannot have written the elegy after the forty third year of his own life and how long before is uncertain In the tenth elegy of the fourth book De Tristibus he observes that the fates had allowed little time for the cultivation of his friendship with Tibullus Virgilium vidi tantum nec avara Tibullo Tempus amicitiae fata dedere meae Successor fuit hic tibi Galle Propertius illi Quartus ab his serie temporis ipse fui Utque ego majores sic me coluere minores one hundred eighty seven Virgil I only saw and envious fate Did soon my friend Tibullus hence translate He followed Gallus and Propertius him And I myself was fourth in course of time Catlin As both Ovid and Tibullus lived at Rome were both of the equestrian order and of congenial dispositions it is natural to suppose that their acquaintance commenced at an early period and if after all it was of short duration there would be no improbability in concluding that Tibullus died at the age of some years under thirty It is evident however that biographers have committed a mistake with regard to the birth of this poet for in the passage above cited of the Tristia Ovid mentions Tibullus as a writer who though his contemporary was much older than himself From this passage we should be justified in placing the death of Tibullus between the fortieth and fiftieth year of his age and rather nearer to the latter period for otherwise Horace would scarcely have mentioned him in the manner he does in one of his epistles Albi nostrorum sermonum candide judex Quid nunc te dicam facere in regione Pedana Scribere quod Cassi Parmensis opuscula vincat An tacitum silvas inter reptare salubres Curantem quicquid dignam sapiente bonoque est Epist i four Albius in whom my satires find A critic candid just and kind Do you while at your country seat Some rhyming labours meditate That shall in volumed bulk arise And e en from Cassius bear the prize Or saunter through the silent wood Musing on what befits the good Francis This supposition is in no degree inconsistent with the authority of Ovid where he mentions him as a young man for the Romans extended the period of youth to the fiftieth year PROPERTIUS was born at Mevania a town of Umbria seated at the confluence of the Tina and Clitumnus This place was famous for its herds of white cattle brought up there for sacrifice and supposed to be impregnated with that colour by the waters of the river last mentioned Hinc albi Clitumne greges et maxima taurus Victima saepe tuo perfusi fluorine sacro Romanos ad templa Deum duxere triumphos Georg ii And where thy sacred streams Clitumnus flow White herds and stateliest bulls that oft have led Triumphant Rome and on her altars bled Sotheby one hundred eighty eight His father is said by some to have been a Roman knight and they add that he was one of those who when L Antony was starved out of Perasia were by the order of Octavius led to the altar of Julius Caesar and there slain Nothing more is known with certainty than that Propertius lost his father at an early age and being deprived of a great part of his patrimony betook himself to Rome where his genius soon recommended him to public notice and he obtained the patronage of Mecaenas From his frequent introduction of historical and mythological subjects into his poems he received the appellation of the learned Of all the Latin elegiac poets Propertius has the justest claim to purity of thought and expression He often draws his imagery from reading more than from the imagination and abounds less in description than sentiment For warmth of passion he is not conspicuous and his tenderness is seldom marked with a great degree of sensibility but without rapture he is animated and like Horace in the midst of gaiety he is moral The stores with which learning supplies him diversify as well as illustrate his subject while delicacy every where discovers a taste refined by the habit of reflection His versification in general is elegant but not uniformly harmonious Tibullus and Propertius have each written four books of Elegies and it has been disputed which of them is superior in this department of poetry Quintilian has given his suffrage in favour of Tibullus who so far as poetical merit alone is the object of consideration seems entitled to the preference GALLUS was a Roman knight distinguished not only for poetical but military talents Of his poetry we have only six elegies written in the person of an old man on the subject of old age but which there is reason to think were composed at an earlier part of the author s life Except the fifth elegy which is tainted with immodesty the others particularly the first are highly beautiful and may be placed in competition with any other productions of the elegiac kind Gallus was for some time in great favour with Augustus who appointed him governor of Egypt It is said however that he not only oppressed the province by extortion but entered into a conspiracy against his benefactor for which he was banished Unable to sustain such a reverse of fortune he fell into despair and laid violent hands on himself This is the Gallus in honour of whom Virgil composed his tenth eclogue Such are the celebrated productions of the Augustan age which have been happily preserved for the delight and admiration of mankind and will survive to the latest posterity Many one hundred eighty nine more once existed of various merit and of different authors which have left few or no memorials behind them but have perished promiscuously amidst the indiscriminate ravages of time of accidents and of barbarians Amongst the principal authors whose works are lost are Varius and Valgius the former of whom besides a panegyric upon Augustus composed some tragedies According to Quintilian his Thyestes was equal to any composition of the Greek tragic poets The great number of eminent writers poets in particular who adorned this age has excited general admiration and the phenomenon is usually ascribed to a fortuitous occurrence which baffles all inquiry but we shall endeavour to develop the various causes which seem to have produced this effect and should the explanation appear satisfactory it may favour an opinion that under similar circumstances if ever they should again be combined a period of equal glory might arise in other ages and nations The Romans whether from the influence of climate or their mode of living which in general was temperate were endowed with a lively imagination and as we before observed a spirit of enterprise Upon the final termination of the Punic war and the conquest of Greece their ardour which had hitherto been exercised in military achievements was diverted into the channel of literature and the civil commotions which followed having now ceased a fresh impulse was given to activity in the ambitious pursuit of the laurel which was now only to be obtained by glorious exertions of intellect The beautiful productions of Greece operating strongly upon their minds excited them to imitation imitation when roused amongst a number produced emulation and emulation cherished an extraordinary thirst of fame which in every exertion of the human mind is the parent of excellence This liberal contention was not a little promoted by the fashion introduced at Rome for poets to recite their compositions in public a practice which seems to have been carried even to a ridiculous excess Such was now the rage for poetical composition in the Roman capital that Horace describes it in the following terms Mutavit mentem populus levis et calet uno Scribendi studio pueri patresque severi Fronde comas vincti coenant et carmina dictant Epist ii one Now the light people bend to other aims A lust of scribbling every breast inflames Our youth our senators with bays are crowned And rhymes eternal as our feasts go round one hundred ninety Scribimus indocti doctique poemata passim Hor Epeat ii one But every desperate blockhead dares to write Verse is the trade of every living wight Francis The thirst of fame above mentioned was a powerful incentive and is avowed both by Virgil and Horace The former in the third book of his Georgics announces a resolution of rendering himself celebrated if possible tentanda via est qua me quoque possim Tollere humo victorque virum volitare per ora I too will strive o er earth my flight to raise And wing d by victory catch the gale of praise Sotheby And Horace in the conclusion of his first Ode expresses himself in terms which indicate a similar purpose Quad si me lyricis vatibis inseres Sublimi feriam sidera vertice But if you rank me with the choir Who tuned with art the Grecian lyre Swift to the noblest heights of fame Shall rise thy poet s deathless name Francis Even Sallust a historian in his introduction to Catiline s Conspiracy scruples not to insinuate the same kind of ambition Quo mihi rectius videtur ingenii quam virium opibus gloriam quaerere et quoniam vita ipsa qua fruimur brevis est memoriam nostri quam maxume longam efficere two hundred eighty three Another circumstance of great importance towards the production of such poetry as might live through every age was the extreme attention which the great poets of this period displayed both in the composition and the polishing of their works Virgil when employed upon the Georgics usually wrote in the morning and applied much of the subsequent part of the day to correction and improvement He compared himself to a bear that licks her cub into form If this was his regular practice in the Georgics we may justly suppose that it was the same in the Aeneid Yet after all this labour he intended to devote three years entirely to its farther amendment Horace has gone so far in recommending careful correction that he figuratively mentions nine years as an adequate period for that purpose But whatever may be the time there is no precept which he urges either oftener or more forcibly than a due attention to this important subject one hundred ninety one Saepe stylum vertas iterum quae digna legi sint Scripturus Sat i x Would you a reader s just esteem engage Correct with frequent care the blotted page Francis Vos O Pompilius sanguis carmen reprehendite quod non Multa dies et multa litura coercuit atque Perfectum decies non castigavit ad uuguem De Art Poet Sons of Pompilius with contempt receive Nor let the hardy poem hope to live Where time and full correction don t refine The finished work and polish every line Francis To the several causes above enumerated as concurring to form the great superiority of the Augustan age as respects the productions of literature one more is to be subjoined of a nature the most essential the liberal and unparalleled encouragement given to distinguished talents by the emperor and his minister This was a principle of the most powerful energy it fanned the flame of genius invigorated every exertion and the poets who basked in the rays of imperial favour and the animating patronage of Mecaenas experienced a poetic enthusiasm which approached to real inspiration Having now finished the proposed explanation relative to the celebrity of the Augustan age we shall conclude with recapitulating in a few words the causes of this extraordinary occurrence The models then which the Romans derived from Grecian poetry were the finest productions of human genius their incentives to emulation were the strongest that could actuate the heart With ardour therefore and industry in composing and with unwearied patience in polishing their compositions they attained to that glorious distinction in literature which no succeeding age has ever rivalled TIBERIUS NERO CAESAR one hundred ninety two I The patrician family of the Claudii for there was a plebeian family of the same name no way inferior to the other either in power or dignity came originally from Regilli a town of the Sabines They removed thence to Rome soon after the building of the city with a great body of their dependants under Titus Tatius who reigned jointly with Romulus in the kingdom or perhaps what is related upon better authority under Atta Claudius the head of the family who was admitted by the senate into the patrician order six years after the expulsion of the Tarquins They likewise received from the state lands beyond the Anio for their followers and a burying place for themselves near the capitol two hundred eighty four After this period in process of time the family had the honour of twenty eight consulships five dictatorships seven censorships seven triumphs and two ovations Their descendants were distinguished by various praenomina and cognomina two hundred eighty five but rejected by common consent the praenomen of one hundred ninety three Lucius when of the two races who bore it one individual had been convicted of robbery and another of murder Amongst other cognomina they assumed that of Nero which in the Sabine language signifies strong and valiant II It appears from record that many of the Claudii have performed signal services to the state as well as committed acts of delinquency To mention the most remarkable only Appius Caecus dissuaded the senate from agreeing to an alliance with Pyrrhus as prejudicial to the republic two hundred eighty six Claudius Candex first passed the straits of Sicily with a fleet and drove the Carthaginians out of the island two hundred eighty seven Claudius Nero cut off Hasdrubal with a vast army upon his arrival in Italy from Spain before he could form a junction with his brother Hannibal two hundred eighty eight On the other hand Claudius Appius Regillanus one of the Decemvirs made a violent attempt to have a free virgin of whom he was enamoured adjudged a slave which caused the people to secede a second time from the senate two hundred eighty nine Claudius Drusus erected a statue of himself wearing a crown at Appii Forum two hundred ninety and endeavoured by means of his dependants to make himself master of Italy Claudius Pulcher when off the coast of Sicily two hundred ninety one the pullets used for taking augury would not eat in contempt of the omen threw them overboard as if they should drink at least if they would not eat and then engaging the enemy was routed After his defeat when he one hundred ninety four was ordered by the senate to name a dictator making a sort of jest of the public disaster he named Glycias his apparitor The women of this family likewise exhibited characters equally opposed to each other For both the Claudias belonged to it she who when the ship freighted with things sacred to the Idaean Mother of the Gods two hundred ninety two stuck fast in the shallows of the Tiber got it off by praying to the Goddess with a loud voice Follow me if I am chaste and she also who contrary to the usual practice in the case of women was brought to trial by the people for treason because when her litter was stopped by a great crowd in the streets she openly exclaimed I wish my brother Pulcher was alive now to lose another fleet that Rome might be less thronged Besides it is well known that all the Claudii except Publius Claudius who to effect the banishment of Cicero procured himself to be adopted by a plebeian two hundred ninety three and one younger than himself were always of the patrician party as well as great sticklers for the honour and power of that order and so violent and obstinate in their opposition to the plebeians that not one of them even in the case of a trial for life by the people would ever condescend to put on mourning according to custom or make any supplication to them for favour and some of them in their contests have even proceeded to lay hands on the tribunes of the people A Vestal Virgin likewise of the family when her brother was resolved to have the honour of a triumph contrary to the will of the people mounted the chariot with him and attended him into the Capitol that it might not be lawful for any of the tribunes to interfere and forbid it two hundred ninety four III From this family Tiberius Caesar is descended indeed both by the father and mother s side by the former from Tiberius Nero and by the latter from Appius Pulcher who were both sons of Appius Caecus He likewise belonged to the family of the Livii by the adoption of his mother s grandfather into it which family although plebeian made a one hundred ninety five distinguished figure having had the honour of eight consulships two censorships three triumphs one dictatorship and the office of master of the horse and was famous for eminent men particularly Salinator and the Drusi Salinator in his censorship two hundred ninety five branded all the tribes for their inconstancy in having made him consul a second time as well as censor although they had condemned him to a heavy fine after his first consulship Drusus procured for himself and his posterity a new surname by killing in single combat Drausus the enemy s chief He is likewise said to have recovered when pro praetor in the province of Gaul the gold which was formerly given to the Senones at the siege of the Capitol and had not as is reported been forced from them by Camillus His great great grandson who for his extraordinary services against the Gracchi was styled the Patron of the Senate left a son who while plotting in a sedition of the same description was treacherously murdered by the opposite party two hundred ninety six IV But the father of Tiberius Caesar being quaestor to Caius Caesar and commander of his fleet in the war of Alexandria contributed greatly to its success He was therefore made one of the high priests in the room of Publius Scipio two hundred ninety seven and was sent to settle some colonies in Gaul and amongst the rest those of Narbonne and Arles two hundred ninety eight After the assassination of Caesar however when the rest of the senators for fear of public disturbances were for having the affair buried in oblivion he proposed a resolution for rewarding those who had killed the tyrant Having filled the office of praetor two hundred ninety nine and at the end of the year a disturbance breaking out amongst the triumviri he kept the badges of his office beyond the legal time and following Lucius Antonius the consul brother of the triumvir to Perusia three hundred though the rest submitted yet he himself continued firm to the party and escaped first to Praeneste and then to Naples whence having in vain invited the slaves to liberty he fled over to Sicily But resenting one hundred ninety six his not being immediately admitted into the presence of Sextus Pompey and being also prohibited the use of the fasces he went over into Achaia to Mark Antony with whom upon a reconciliation soon after brought about amongst the several contending parties he returned to Rome and at the request of Augustus gave up to him his wife Livia Drusilla although she was then big with child and had before borne him a son He died not long after leaving behind him two sons Tiberius and Drusus Nero V Some have imagined that Tiberius was born at Fundi but there is only this trifling foundation for the conjecture that his mother s grandmother was of Fundi and that the image of Good Fortune was by a decree of the senate erected in a public place in that town But according to the greatest number of writers and those too of the best authority he was born at Rome in the Palatine quarter upon the sixteenth of the calends of December sixteenth Nov when Marcus Aemilius Lepidus was second time consul with Lucius Munatius Plancus three hundred one after the battle of Philippi for so it is registered in the calendar and the public acts According to some however he was born the preceding year in the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa and others say in the year following during the consulship of Servilius Isauricus and Antony VI His infancy and childhood were spent in the midst of danger and trouble for he accompanied his parents everywhere in their flight and twice at Naples nearly betrayed them by his crying when they were privately hastening to a ship as the enemy rushed into the town once when he was snatched from his nurse s breast and again from his mother s bosom by some of the company who on the sudden emergency wished to relieve the women of their burden Being carried through Sicily and Achaia and entrusted for some time to the care of the Lacedaemonians who were under the protection of the Claudian family upon his departure thence when travelling by night he ran the hazard of his life by a fire which suddenly bursting out of a wood on all sides surrounded the whole party so closely that part of Livia s dress and hair was burnt The presents which were made him one hundred ninety seven by Pompeia sister to Sextus Pompey in Sicily namely a cloak with a clasp and bullae of gold are still in existence and shewn at Baiae to this day After his return to the city being adopted by Marcus Gallius a senator in his will he took possession of the estate but soon afterwards declined the use of his name because Gallius had been of the party opposed to Augustus When only nine years of age he pronounced a funeral oration in praise of his father upon the rostra and afterwards when he had nearly attained the age of manhood he attended the chariot of Augustus in his triumph for the victory at Actium riding on the left hand horse whilst Marcellus Octavia s son rode that on the right He likewise presided at the games celebrated on account of that victory and in the Trojan games intermixed with the Circensian he commanded a troop of the biggest boys VII After assuming the manly habit he spent his youth and the rest of his life until he succeeded to the government in the following manner he gave the people an entertainment of gladiators in memory of his father and another for his grandfather Drusus at different times and in different places the first in the forum the second in the amphitheatre some gladiators who had been honourably discharged being induced to engage again by a reward of a hundred thousand sesterces He likewise exhibited public sports at which he was not present himself All these he performed with great magnificence at the expense of his mother and father in law He married Agrippina the daughter of Marcus Agrippa and grand daughter of Caecilius Atticus a Roman knight the same person to whom Cicero has addressed so many epistles After having by her his son Drusus he was obliged to part with her three hundred two though she retained his affection and was again pregnant to make way for marrying Augustus s daughter Julia But this he did with extreme reluctance for besides having the warmest attachment to Agrippina he was disgusted with the conduct of Julia who had made indecent advances to him during the lifetime of her former husband and that she was a woman of loose character was the general opinion At divorcing Agrippina he felt the deepest regret and upon meeting her afterwards one hundred ninety eight he looked after her with eyes so passionately expressive of affection that care was taken she should never again come in his sight At first however he lived quietly and happily with Julia but a rupture soon ensued which became so violent that after the loss of their son the pledge of their union who was born at Aquileia and died in infancy three hundred three he never would sleep with her more He lost his brother Drusus in Germany and brought his body to Rome travelling all the way on foot before it VIII When he first applied himself to civil affairs he defended the several causes of king Archelaus the Trallians and the Thessalians before Augustus who sat as judge at the trials He addressed the senate on behalf of the Laodiceans the Thyatireans and Chians who had suffered greatly by an earthquake and implored relief from Rome He prosecuted Fannius Caepio who had been engaged in a conspiracy with Varro Muraena against Augustus and procured sentence of condemnation against him Amidst all this he had besides to superintend two departments of the administration that of supplying the city with corn which was then very scarce and that of clearing the houses of correction three hundred four throughout Italy the masters of which had fallen under the odious suspicion of seizing and keeping confined not only travellers but those whom the fear of being obliged to serve in the army had driven to seek refuge in such places IX He made his first campaign as a military tribune in the Cantabrian war three hundred five Afterwards he led an army into the East three hundred six where he restored the kingdom of Armenia to Tigranes and seated on a tribunal put a crown upon his head He likewise recovered from the Parthians the standards which they had taken from Crassus He next governed for nearly a year the province of Gallia Comata which was then in great disorder on account of the incursions of the barbarians and the feuds of the chiefs He afterwards commanded in the several wars against the Rhaetians Vindelicians Pannonians and Germans In the Rhaetian and Vindelician wars he subdued the nations in the Alps and in the Pannonian wars the Bruci and one hundred ninety nine the Dalmatians In the German war he transplanted into Gaul forty thousand of the enemy who had submitted and assigned them lands near the banks of the Rhine For these actions he entered the city with an ovation but riding in a chariot and is said by some to have been the first that ever was honoured with this distinction He filled early the principal offices of state and passed through the quaestorship three hundred seven praetorship three hundred eight and consulate three hundred nine almost successively After some interval he was chosen consul a second time and held the tribunitian authority during five years X Surrounded by all this prosperity in the prime of life and in excellent health he suddenly formed the resolution of withdrawing to a greater distance from Rome three hundred ten It is uncertain whether this was the result of disgust for his wife whom he neither durst accuse nor divorce and the connection with whom became every day more intolerable or to prevent that indifference towards him which his constant residence in the city might produce or in the hope of supporting and improving by absence his authority in the state if the public should have occasion for his service Some are of opinion that as Augustus s sons were now grown up to years of maturity he voluntarily relinquished the possession he had long enjoyed of the second place in the government as Agrippa had done before him who when M Marcellus was advanced to public offices retired to Mitylene that he might not seem to stand in the way of his promotion or in any respect lessen him by his presence The same reason likewise Tiberius gave afterwards for his retirement but his pretext at this time was that he was satiated with honours and desirous of being relieved from the fatigue of business requesting therefore that he might have leave to withdraw And neither the earnest entreaties of his mother nor the complaint of his father in law made even in the senate that he was deserted by him could prevail upon him to alter his resolution Upon their persisting in the design of detaining him he refused to take any sustenance for four days together At last having obtained permission leaving his wife and son at Rome he proceeded two hundred to Ostia three hundred eleven without exchanging a word with those who attended him and having embraced but very few persons at parting XI From Ostia journeying along the coast of Campania he halted awhile on receiving intelligence of Augustus s being taken ill but this giving rise to a rumour that he stayed with a view to something extraordinary he sailed with the wind almost full against him and arrived at Rhodes having been struck with the pleasantness and healthiness of the island at the time of his landing therein his return from Armenia Here contenting himself with a small house and a villa not much larger near the town he led entirely a private life taking his walks sometimes about the Gymnasia three hundred twelve without any lictor or other attendant and returning the civilities of the Greeks with almost as much complaisance as if he had been upon a level with them One morning in settling the course of his daily excursion he happened to say that he should visit all the sick people in the town This being not rightly understood by those about him the sick were brought into a public portico and ranged in order according to their several distempers Being extremely embarrassed by this unexpected occurrence he was for some time irresolute how he should act but at last he determined to go round them all and make an apology for the mistake even to the meanest amongst them and such as were entirely unknown to him One instance only is mentioned in which he appeared to exercise his tribunitian authority Being a constant attendant upon the schools and lecture rooms of the professors of the liberal arts on occasion of a quarrel amongst the wrangling two hundred one sophists in which he interposed to reconcile them some person took the liberty to abuse him as an intruder and partial in the affair Upon this withdrawing privately home he suddenly returned attended by his officers and summoning his accuser before his tribunal by a public crier ordered him to be taken to prison Afterwards he received tidings that his wife Julia had been condemned for her lewdness and adultery and that a bill of divorce had been sent to her in his name by the authority of Augustus Though he secretly rejoiced at this intelligence he thought it incumbent upon him in point of decency to interpose in her behalf by frequent letters to Augustus and to allow her to retain the presents which he had made her notwithstanding the little regard she merited from him When the period of his tribunitian authority expired three hundred thirteen declaring at last that he had no other object in his retirement than to avoid all suspicion of rivalship with Caius and Lucius he petitioned that since he was now secure in that respect as they were come to the age of manhood and would easily maintain themselves in possession of the second place in the state he might be permitted to visit his friends whom he was very desirous of seeing But his request was denied and he was advised to lay aside all concern for his friends whom he had been so eager to greet XII He therefore continued at Rhodes much against his will obtaining with difficulty through his mother the title of Augustus s lieutenant to cover his disgrace He thenceforth lived however not only as a private person but as one suspected and under apprehension retiring into the interior of the country and avoiding the visits of those who sailed that way which were very frequent for no one passed to take command of an army or the government of a province without touching at Rhodes But there were fresh reasons for increased anxiety For crossing over to Samos on a visit to his step son Caius who had been appointed governor of the East he found him prepossessed against him by the insinuations of Marcus Lollius his companion and director He likewise fell under suspicion of sending by some centurions who had been promoted by himself upon their return to the camp after a furlough mysterious messages to several persons there intended apparently to two hundred two tamper with them for a revolt This jealousy respecting his designs being intimated to him by Augustus he begged repeatedly that some person of any of the three Orders might be placed as a spy upon him in every thing he either said or did XIII He laid aside likewise his usual exercises of riding and arms and quitting the Roman habit made use of the Pallium and Crepida three hundred fourteen In this condition he continued almost two years becoming daily an object of increasing contempt and odium insomuch that the people of Nismes pulled down all the images and statues of him in their town and upon mention being made of him at table one of the company said to Caius I will sail over to Rhodes immediately if you desire me and bring you the head of the exile for that was the appellation now given him Thus alarmed not only by apprehensions but real danger he renewed his solicitations for leave to return and seconded by the most urgent supplications of his mother he at last obtained his request to which an accident somewhat contributed Augustus had resolved to determine nothing in the affair but with the consent of his eldest son The latter was at that time out of humour with Marcus Lollius and therefore easily disposed to be favourable to his father in law Caius thus acquiescing he was recalled but upon condition that he should take no concern whatever in the administration of affairs XIV He returned to Rome after an absence of nearly eight years three hundred fifteen with great and confident hopes of his future elevation which he had entertained from his youth in consequence of various prodigies and predictions For Livia when pregnant with him being anxious to discover by different modes of divination whether her offspring would be a son amongst others took an egg from a hen that was sitting and kept it warm with her own hands and those of her maids by turns until a fine cock chicken with a large comb was hatched Scribonius the astrologer predicted great things of him when he was a mere child He will come in time said the prophet to be even a king but without the usual badge of royal dignity the rule of the Caesars being as yet unknown When he was two hundred three making his first expedition and leading his army through Macedonia into Syria the altars which had been formerly consecrated at Philippi by the victorious legions blazed suddenly with spontaneous fires Soon after as he was marching to Illyricum he stopped to consult the oracle of Geryon near Padua and having drawn a lot by which he was desired to throw golden tali into the fountain of Aponus three hundred sixteen for an answer to his inquiries he did so and the highest numbers came up And those very tali are still to be seen at the bottom of the fountain A few days before his leaving Rhodes an eagle a bird never before seen in that island perched on the top of his house And the day before he received intelligence of the permission granted him to return as he was changing his dress his tunic appeared to be all on fire He then likewise had a remarkable proof of the skill of Thrasyllus the astrologer whom for his proficiency in philosophical researches he had taken into his family For upon sight of the ship which brought the intelligence he said good news was coming whereas every thing going wrong before and quite contrary to his predictions Tiberius had intended that very moment when they were walking together to throw him into the sea as an impostor and one to whom he had too hastily entrusted his secrets XV Upon his return to Rome having introduced his son Drusus into the forum he immediately removed from Pompey s house in the Carinae to the gardens of Mecaenas on the Esquiline three hundred seventeen and resigned himself entirely to his ease performing only the common offices of civility in private life without any preferment in the government But Caius and Lucius being both carried off in the space of three years he was adopted by Augustus along with their brother Agrippa being obliged in the first place to adopt Germanicus his brother s son After his adoption he never more acted as master of a two hundred four family nor exercised in the smallest degree the rights which he had lost by it For he neither disposed of anything in the way of gift nor manumitted a slave nor so much as received any estate left him by will nor any legacy without reckoning it as a part of his peculium or property held under his father From that day forward nothing was omitted that might contribute to the advancement of his grandeur and much more when upon Agrippa being discarded and banished it was evident that the hope of succession rested upon him alone XVI The tribunitian authority was again conferred upon him for five years three hundred eighteen and a commission given him to settle the affairs of Germany The ambassadors of the Parthians after having had an audience of Augustus were ordered to apply to him likewise in his province But on receiving intelligence of an insurrection in Illyricum three hundred nineteen he went over to superintend the management of that new war which proved the most serious of all the foreign wars since the Carthaginian This he conducted during three years with fifteen legions and an equal number of auxiliary forces under great difficulties and an extreme scarcity of corn And though he was several times recalled he nevertheless persisted fearing lest an enemy so powerful and so near should fall upon the army in their retreat This resolution was attended with good success for he at last reduced to complete subjection all Illyricum lying between Italy and the kingdom of Noricum Thrace Macedonia the river Danube and the Adriatic gulf XVII The glory he acquired by these successes received an increase from the conjuncture in which they happened For almost about that very time three hundred twenty Quintilius Varus was cut off with three legions in Germany and it was generally believed that the victorious Germans would have joined the Pannonians had not the war of Illyricum been previously concluded A triumph therefore besides many other great honours was decreed him Some proposed that the surname of Pannonicus others that of Invincible and others of O Pius should be conferred on him but Augustus interposed engaging for him that he would be satisfied with that to which he would succeed at his death He postponed his triumph because two hundred five the state was at that time under great affliction for the disaster of Varus and his army Nevertheless he entered the city in a triumphal robe crowned with laurel and mounting a tribunal in the Septa sat with Augustus between the two consuls whilst the senate gave their attendance standing whence after he had saluted the people he was attended by them in procession to the several temples XVIII Next year he went again to Germany where finding that the defeat of Varus was occasioned by the rashness and negligence of the commander he thought proper to be guided in everything by the advice of a council of war whereas at other times he used to follow the dictates of his own judgment and considered himself alone as sufficiently qualified for the direction of affairs He likewise used more cautions than usual Having to pass the Rhine he restricted the whole convoy within certain limits and stationing himself on the bank of the river would not suffer the waggons to cross the river until he had searched them at the water side to see that they carried nothing but what was allowed or necessary Beyond the Rhine such was his way of living that he took his meals sitting on the bare ground three hundred twenty one and often passed the night without a tent and his regular orders for the day as well as those upon sudden emergencies he gave in writing with this injunction that in case of any doubt as to the meaning of them they should apply to him for satisfaction even at any hour of the night XIX He maintained the strictest discipline amongst the troops reviving many old customs relative to punishing and degrading offenders setting a mark of disgrace even upon the commander of a legion for sending a few soldiers with one of his freedmen across the river for the purpose of hunting Though it was his desire to leave as little as possible in the power of fortune or accident yet he always engaged the enemy with more confidence when in his night watches the lamp failed and went out of itself trusting as he said in an omen which had never failed him and his ancestors two hundred six in all their commands But in the midst of victory he was very near being assassinated by some Bructerian who mixing with those about him and being discovered by his trepidation was put to the torture and confessed his intended crime XX After two years he returned from Germany to the city and celebrated the triumph which he had deferred attended by his lieutenants for whom he had procured the honour of triumphal ornaments three hundred twenty two Before he turned to ascend the Capitol he alighted from his chariot and knelt before his father who sat by to superintend the solemnity Bato the Pannonian chief he sent to Ravenna loaded with rich presents in gratitude for his having suffered him and his army to retire from a position in which he had so enclosed them that they were entirely at his mercy He afterwards gave the people a dinner at a thousand tables besides thirty sesterces to each man He likewise dedicated the temple of Concord three hundred twenty three and that of Castor and Pollux which had been erected out of the spoils of the war in his own and his brother s name XXI A law having been not long after carried by the consuls three hundred twenty four for his being appointed a colleague with Augustus in the administration of the provinces and in taking the census when that was finished he went into Illyricum three hundred twenty five But being hastily recalled during his journey he found Augustus alive indeed but past all hopes of recovery and was with him in private a whole day I know it is generally believed that upon Tiberius s quitting the room after their private conference those who were in waiting overheard Augustus say Ah unhappy Roman people to be ground by the jaws of such a slow devourer Nor am I ignorant of its being reported by some that Augustus so openly and undisguisedly condemned the sourness of his temper that sometimes upon his coming in he would break off any jocular conversation in which he was engaged and that he was only prevailed upon by the two hundred seven importunity of his wife to adopt him or actuated by the ambitious view of recommending his own memory from a comparison with such a successor Yet I must hold to this opinion that a prince so extremely circumspect and prudent as he was did nothing rashly especially in an affair of so great importance but that upon weighing the vices and virtues of Tiberius with each other he judged the latter to preponderate and this the rather since he swore publicly in an assembly of the people that he adopted him for the public good Besides in several of his letters he extols him as a consummate general and the only security of the Roman people Of such declarations I subjoin the following instances Farewell my dear Tiberius and may success attend you whilst you are warring for me and the Muses three hundred twenty six Farewell my most dear and as I hope to prosper most gallant man and accomplished general Again The disposition of your summer quarters In truth my dear Tiberius I do not think that amidst so many difficulties and with an army so little disposed for action any one could have behaved more prudently than you have done All those likewise who were with you acknowledge that this verse is applicable to you Unus homo nobis vigilando restituit rem three hundred twenty seven One man by vigilance restored the state Whenever he says anything happens that requires more than ordinary consideration or I am out of humour upon any occasion I still by Hercules long for my dear Tiberius and those lines of Homer frequently occur to my thoughts Toutou d espomenoio kai ek pyros aithomenoio Ampho nostaesuimen epei peri oide noaesai three hundred twenty eight Bold from his prudence I could ev n aspire To dare with him the burning rage of fire When I hear and read that you are much impaired by the two hundred eight continued fatigues you undergo may the gods confound me if my whole frame does not tremble So I beg you to spare yourself lest if we should hear of your being ill the news prove fatal both to me and your mother and the Roman people should be in peril for the safety of the empire It matters nothing whether I be well or no if you be not well I pray heaven preserve you for us and bless you with health both now and ever if the gods have any regard for the Roman people XXII He did not make the death of Augustus public until he had taken off young Agrippa He was slain by a tribune who commanded his guard upon reading a written order for that purpose respecting which order it was then a doubt whether Augustus left it in his last moments to prevent any occasion of public disturbance after his decease or Livia issued it in the name of Augustus and whether with the knowledge of Tiberius or not When the tribune came to inform him that he had executed his command he replied I commanded you no such thing and you must answer for it to the senate avoiding as it seems the odium of the act for that time And the affair was soon buried in silence XXIII Having summoned the senate to meet by virtue of his tribunitian authority and begun a mournful speech he drew a deep sigh as if unable to support himself under his affliction and wishing that not his voice only but his very breath of life might fail him gave his speech to his son Drusus to read Augustus s will was then brought in and read by a freedman none of the witnesses to it being admitted but such as were of the senatorian order the rest owning their hand writing without doors The will began thus Since my ill fortune has deprived me of my two sons Caius and Lucius let Tiberius Caesar be heir to two thirds of my estate These words countenanced the suspicion of those who were of opinion that Tiberius was appointed successor more out of necessity than choice since Augustus could not refrain from prefacing his will in that manner XXIV Though he made no scruple to assume and exercise immediately the imperial authority by giving orders that he two hundred nine should be attended by the guards who were the security and badge of the supreme power yet he affected by a most impudent piece of acting to refuse it for a long time one while sharply reprehending his friends who entreated him to accept it as little knowing what a monster the government was another while keeping in suspense the senate when they implored him and threw themselves at his feet by ambiguous answers and a crafty kind of dissimulation insomuch that some were out of patience and one cried out during the confusion Either let him accept it or decline it at once and a second told him to his face Others are slow to perform what they promise but you are slow to promise what you actually perform At last as if forced to it and complaining of the miserable and burdensome service imposed upon him he accepted the government not however without giving hopes of his resigning it some time or other The exact words he used were these Until the time shall come when ye may think it reasonable to give some rest to my old age XXV The cause of his long demur was fear of the dangers which threatened him on all hands insomuch that he said I have got a wolf by the ears For a slave of Agrippa s Clemens by name had drawn together a considerable force to revenge his master s death Lucius Scribonius Libo a senator of the first distinction was secretly fomenting a rebellion and the troops both in Illyricum and Germany were mutinous Both armies insisted upon high demands particularly that their pay should be made equal to that of the pretorian guards The army in Germany absolutely refused to acknowledge a prince who was not their own choice and urged with all possible importunity Germanicus three hundred twenty nine who commanded them to take the government on himself though he obstinately refused it It was Tiberius s apprehension from this quarter which made him request the senate to assign him some part only in the administration such as they should judge proper since no man could be sufficient for the whole without one or more to assist him He pretended likewise to be in a bad state of health that Germanicus might the more patiently wait in hopes of speedily succeeding him or at least of being two hundred ten admitted to be a colleague in the government When the mutinies in the armies were suppressed he got Clemens into his hands by stratagem That he might not begin his reign by an act of severity he did not call Libo to an account before the senate until his second year being content in the mean time with taking proper precautions for his own security For upon Libo s attending a sacrifice amongst the high priests instead of the usual knife he ordered one of lead to be given him and when he desired a private conference with him he would not grant his request but on condition that his son Drusus should be present and as they walked together he held him fast by the right hand under the pretence of leaning upon him until the conversation was over XXVI When he was delivered from his apprehensions his behaviour at first was unassuming and he did not carry himself much above the level of a private person and of the many and great honours offered him he accepted but few and such as were very moderate His birth day which happened to fall at the time of the Plebeian Circensian games he with difficulty suffered to be honoured with the addition of only a single chariot drawn by two horses He forbad temples flamens or priests to be appointed for him as likewise the erection of any statues or effigies for him without his permission and this he granted only on condition that they should not be placed amongst the images of the gods but only amongst the ornaments of houses He also interposed to prevent the senate from swearing to maintain his acts and the month of September from being called Tiberius and October being named after Livia The praenomen likewise of EMPEROR with the cognomen of FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY and a civic crown in the vestibule of his house he would not accept He never used the name of AUGUSTUS although he inherited it in any of his letters excepting those addressed to kings and princes Nor had he more than three consulships one for a few days another for three months and a third during his absence from the city until the ides fifteenth of May XXVII He had such an aversion to flattery that he would never suffer any senator to approach his litter as he passed the streets in it either to pay him a civility or upon business two hundred eleven And when a man of consular rank in begging his pardon for some offence he had given him attempted to fall at his feet he started from him in such haste that he stumbled and fell If any compliment was paid him either in conversation or a set speech he would not scruple to interrupt and reprimand the party and alter what he had said Being once called lord three hundred thirty by some person he desired that he might no more be affronted in that manner When another to excite veneration called his occupations sacred and a third had expressed himself thus By your authority I have waited upon the senate he obliged them to change their phrases in one of them adopting persuasion instead of authority and in the other laborious instead of sacred XXVIII He remained unmoved at all the aspersions scandalous reports and lampoons which were spread against him or his relations declaring In a free state both the tongue and the mind ought to be free Upon the senate s desiring that some notice might be taken of those offences and the persons charged with them he replied We have not so much time upon our hands that we ought to involve ourselves in more business If you once make an opening three hundred thirty one for such proceedings you will soon have nothing else to do All private quarrels will be brought before you under that pretence There is also on record another sentence used by him in the senate which is far from assuming If he speaks otherwise of me I shall take care to behave in such a manner as to be able to give a good account both of my words and actions and if he persists I shall hate him in my turn XXIX These things were so much the more remarkable in him because in the respect he paid to individuals or the whole body of the senate he went beyond all bounds Upon his differing with Quintus Haterius in the senate house Pardon me sir he said I beseech you if I shall as a senator speak my mind very freely in opposition to you Afterwards addressing the senate in general he said Conscript Fathers I have often said it both now and at other times that a good two hundred twelve and useful prince whom you have invested with so great and absolute power ought to be a slave to the senate to the whole body of the people and often to individuals likewise nor am I sorry that I have said it I have always found you good kind and indulgent masters and still find you so XXX He likewise introduced a certain show of liberty by preserving to the senate and magistrates their former majesty and power All affairs whether of great or small importance public or private were laid before the senate Taxes and monopolies the erecting or repairing edifices levying and disbanding soldiers the disposal of the legions and auxiliary forces in the provinces the appointment of generals for the management of extraordinary wars and the answers to letters from foreign princes were all submitted to the senate He compelled the commander of a troop of horse who was accused of robbery attended with violence to plead his cause before the senate He never entered the senate house but unattended and being once brought thither in a litter because he was indisposed he dismissed his attendants at the door XXXI When some decrees were made contrary to his opinion he did not even make any complaint And though he thought that no magistrates after their nomination should be allowed to absent themselves from the city but reside in it constantly to receive their honours in person a praetor elect obtained liberty to depart under the honorary title of a legate at large Again when he proposed to the senate that the Trebians might have leave granted them to divert some money which had been left them by will for the purpose of building a new theatre to that of making a road he could not prevail to have the will of the testator set aside And when upon a division of the house he went over to the minority nobody followed him All other things of a public nature were likewise transacted by the magistrates and in the usual forms the authority of the consuls remaining so great that some ambassadors from Africa applied to them and complained that they could not have their business dispatched by Caesar to whom they had been sent And no wonder since it was observed that he used to rise up as the consuls approached and give them the way two hundred thirteen XXXII He reprimanded some persons of consular rank in command of armies for not writing to the senate an account of their proceedings and for consulting him about the distribution of military rewards as if they themselves had not a right to bestow them as they judged proper He commended a praetor who on entering office revived an old custom of celebrating the memory of his ancestors in a speech to the people He attended the corpses of some persons of distinction to the funeral pile He displayed the same moderation with regard to persons and things of inferior consideration The magistrates of Rhodes having dispatched to him a letter on public business which was not subscribed he sent for them and without giving them so much as one harsh word desired them to subscribe it and so dismissed them Diogenes the grammarian who used to hold public disquisitions at Rhodes every sabbath day once refused him admittance upon his coming to hear him out of course and sent him a message by a servant postponing his admission until the next seventh day Diogenes afterwards coming to Rome and waiting at his door to be allowed to pay his respects to him he sent him word to come again at the end of seven years To some governors who advised him to load the provinces with taxes he answered It is the part of a good shepherd to shear not flay his sheep XXXIII He assumed the sovereignty three hundred thirty two by slow degrees and exercised it for a long time with great variety of conduct though generally with a due regard to the public good At first he only interposed to prevent ill management Accordingly he rescinded some decrees of the senate and when the magistrates sat for the administration of justice he frequently offered his service as assessor either taking his place promiscuously amongst them or seating himself in a corner of the tribunal If a rumour prevailed that any person under prosecution was likely to be acquitted by his interest he would suddenly make his appearance and from the floor of the court two hundred fourteen or the praetor s bench remind the judges of the laws and of their oaths and the nature of the charge brought before them he likewise took upon himself the correction of public morals where they tended to decay either through neglect or evil custom XXXIV He reduced the expense of the plays and public spectacles by diminishing the allowances to actors and curtailing the number of gladiators He made grievous complaints to the senate that the price of Corinthian vessels was become enormous and that three mullets had been sold for thirty thousand sesterces upon which he proposed that a new sumptuary law should be enacted that the butchers and other dealers in viands should be subject to an assize fixed by the senate yearly and the aediles commissioned to restrain eating houses and taverns so far as not even to permit the sale of any kind of pastry And to encourage frugality in the public by his own example he would often at his solemn feasts have at his tables victuals which had been served up the day before and were partly eaten and half a boar affirming It has all the same good bits that the whole had He published an edict against the practice of people s kissing each other when they met and would not allow new year s gifts three hundred thirty three to be presented after the calends the first of January was passed He had been in the habit of returning these offerings four fold and making them with his own hand but being annoyed by the continual interruption to which he was exposed during the whole month by those who had not the opportunity of attending him on the festival he returned none after that day XXXV Married women guilty of adultery though not prosecuted publicly he authorised the nearest relations to punish by agreement among themselves according to ancient custom He discharged a Roman knight from the obligation of an oath he had taken never to turn away his wife and allowed him to divorce her upon her being caught in criminal intercourse with her son in law Women of ill fame divesting themselves of the rights and dignity of matrons had now begun a practice of professing themselves prostitutes to avoid two hundred fifteen the punishment of the laws and the most profligate young men of the senatorian and equestrian orders to secure themselves against a decree of the senate which prohibited their performing on the stage or in the amphitheatre voluntarily subjected themselves to an infamous sentence by which they were degraded All those he banished that none for the future might evade by such artifices the intention and efficacy of the law He stripped a senator of the broad stripes on his robe upon information of his having removed to his gardens before the calends the first of July in order that he might afterwards hire a house cheaper in the city He likewise dismissed another from the office of quaestor for repudiating the day after he had been lucky in drawing his lot a wife whom he had married only the day before XXXVI He suppressed all foreign religions and the Egyptian three hundred thirty four and Jewish rites obliging those who practised that kind of superstition to burn their vestments and all their sacred utensils He distributed the Jewish youths under the pretence of military service among the provinces noted for an unhealthy climate and dismissed from the city all the rest of that nation as well as those who were proselytes to that religion three hundred thirty five under pain of slavery for life unless they complied He also expelled the astrologers but upon their suing for pardon and promising to renounce their profession he revoked his decree XXXVII But above all things he was careful to keep the two hundred sixteen public peace against robbers burglars and those who were disaffected to the government He therefore increased the number of military stations throughout Italy and formed a camp at Rome for the pretorian cohorts which till then had been quartered in the city He suppressed with great severity all tumults of the people on their first breaking out and took every precaution to prevent them Some persons having been killed in a quarrel which happened in the theatre he banished the leaders of the parties and the players about whom the disturbance had arisen nor could all the entreaties of the people afterwards prevail upon him to recall them three hundred thirty six The people of Pollentia having refused to permit the removal of the corpse of a centurion of the first rank from the forum until they had extorted from his heirs a sum of money for a public exhibition of gladiators he detached a cohort from the city and another from the kingdom of Cottius three hundred thirty seven who concealing the cause of their march entered the town by different gates with their arms suddenly displayed and trumpets sounding and having seized the greatest part of the people and the magistrates they were imprisoned for life He abolished every where the privileges of all places of refuge The Cyzicenians having committed an outrage upon some Romans he deprived them of the liberty they had obtained for their good services in the Mithridatic war Disturbances from foreign enemies he quelled by his lieutenants without ever going against them in person nor would he even employ his lieutenants but with much reluctance and when it was absolutely necessary Princes who were ill affected towards him he kept in subjection more by menaces and remonstrances than by force of arms Some whom he induced to come to him by fair words and promises he never would permit to return home as Maraboduus the German Thrascypolis the two hundred seventeen Thracian and Archelaus the Cappadocian whose kingdom he even reduced into the form of a province XXXVIII He never set foot outside the gates of Rome for two years together from the time he assumed the supreme power and after that period went no farther from the city than to some of the neighbouring towns his farthest excursion being to Antium three hundred thirty eight and that but very seldom and for a few days though he often gave out that he would visit the provinces and armies and made preparations for it almost every year by taking up carriages and ordering provisions for his retinue in the municipia and colonies At last he suffered vows to be put up for his good journey and safe return insomuch that he was called jocosely by the name of Callipides who is famous in a Greek proverb for being in a great hurry to go forward but without ever advancing a cubit XXXIX But after the loss of his two sons of whom Germanicus died in Syria and Drusus at Rome he withdrew into Campania three hundred thirty nine at which time opinion and conversation were almost general that he never would return and would die soon And both nearly turned out to be true For indeed he never more came to Rome and a few days after leaving it when he was at a villa of his called the Cave near Terracina three hundred forty during supper a great many huge stones fell from above which killed several of the guests and attendants but he almost hopelessly escaped XL After he had gone round Campania and dedicated the capitol at Capua and a temple to Augustus at Nola three hundred forty one which he made the pretext of his journey he retired to Capri being two hundred eighteen greatly delighted with the island because it was accessible only by a narrow beach being on all sides surrounded with rugged cliffs of a stupendous height and by a deep sea But immediately the people of Rome being extremely clamorous for his return on account of a disaster at Fidenae three hundred forty two where upwards of twenty thousand persons had been killed by the fall of the amphitheatre during a public spectacle of gladiators he crossed over again to the continent and gave all people free access to him so much the more because at his departure from the city he had caused it to be proclaimed that no one should address him and had declined admitting any persons to his presence on the journey XLI Returning to the island he so far abandoned all care of the government that he never filled up the decuriae of the knights never changed any military tribunes or prefects or governors of provinces and kept Spain and Syria for several years without any consular lieutenants He likewise suffered Armenia to be seized by the Parthians Moesia by the Dacians and Sarmatians and Gaul to be ravaged by the Germans to the great disgrace and no less danger of the empire XLII But having now the advantage of privacy and being remote from the observation of the people of Rome he abandoned himself to all the vicious propensities which he had long but imperfectly concealed and of which I shall here give a particular account from the beginning While a young soldier in the camp he was so remarkable for his excessive inclination to wine that for Tiberius they called him Biberius for Claudius Caldius and for Nero Mero And after he succeeded to the empire and was invested with the office of reforming the morality of the people he spent a whole night and two days together in feasting and drinking with Pomponius Flaccus and Lucius Piso to one of whom he immediately gave the province of Syria and to the other the prefecture of the city declaring them in his letters patent to be very pleasant companions and friends fit for all occasions He made an appointment to sup with Sestius Gallus a lewd and prodigal old fellow who had been disgraced by Augustus and reprimanded by himself but a few days before in the senate house upon condition that he should not recede in the least from his usual method of entertainment and that they should be attended at table by naked girls He preferred a very obscure candidate for the quaestorship before the most noble competitors only for taking off in pledging him at table an amphora of wine at a draught three hundred forty three He presented Asellius Sabinus with two hundred thousand sesterces for writing a dialogue in the way of dispute betwixt the truffle and the fig pecker the oyster and the thrush He likewise instituted a new office to administer to his voluptuousness to which he appointed Titus Caesonius Priscus a Roman knight XLIII In his retreat at Capri three hundred forty four he also contrived an apartment containing couches and adapted to the secret practice of abominable lewdness where he entertained companies of girls and catamites and assembled from all quarters inventors of unnatural copulations whom he called Spintriae who defiled one another in his presence to inflame by the exhibition the languid appetite He had several chambers set round with pictures and statues in the most lascivious attitudes and furnished with the books of Elephantis that none might want a pattern for the execution of any lewd project that was prescribed him He likewise contrived recesses in woods and groves for the gratification of lust where young persons of both sexes prostituted themselves in caves and hollow rocks in the disguise of little Pans and Nymphs three hundred forty five So that he was publicly and commonly called by an abuse of the name of the island Caprineus three hundred forty six XLIV But he was still more infamous if possible for an two hundred twenty abomination not fit to be mentioned or heard much less credited three hundred forty seven When a picture painted by Parrhasius in which the artist had represented Atalanta in the act of submitting to Meleager s lust in a most unnatural way was bequeathed to him with this proviso that if the subject was offensive to him he might receive in lieu of it a million of sesterces he not only chose the picture but hung it up in his bed chamber It is also reported that during a sacrifice he was so captivated with the form of a youth who held a censer that before the religious rites were well over he took him aside and abused him as also a brother of his who had been playing the flute and soon afterwards broke the legs of both of them for upbraiding one another with their shame XLV How much he was guilty of a most foul intercourse with women even of the first quality three hundred forty eight appeared very plainly by the death of one Mallonia who being brought to his bed but resolutely refusing to comply with his lust he gave her up to the common informers Even when she was upon her trial he frequently called out to her and asked her Do you repent until she quitting the court went home and stabbed herself openly upbraiding the vile old lecher for his gross obscenity three hundred forty nine Hence there was an allusion to him in a farce which was acted at the next public sports and was received with great applause and became a common topic of ridicule three hundred fifty that the old goat XLVI He was so niggardly and covetous that he never allowed to his attendants in his travels and expeditions any salary but their diet only Once indeed he treated them liberally at the instigation of his step father when dividing them into three classes according to their rank he gave the two hundred twenty one first six the second four and the third two hundred thousand sesterces which last class he called not friends but Greeks XLVII During the whole time of his government he never erected any noble edifice for the only things he did undertake namely building the temple of Augustus and restoring Pompey s Theatre he left at last after many years unfinished Nor did he ever entertain the people with public spectacles and he was seldom present at those which were given by others lest any thing of that kind should be requested of him especially after he was obliged to give freedom to the comedian Actius Having relieved the poverty of a few senators to avoid further demands he declared that he should for the future assist none but those who gave the senate full satisfaction as to the cause of their necessity Upon this most of the needy senators from modesty and shame declined troubling him Amongst these was Hortalus grandson to the celebrated orator Quintus Hortensius who marrying by the persuasion of Augustus had brought up four children upon a very small estate XLVIII He displayed only two instances of public munificence One was an offer to lend gratis for three years a hundred millions of sesterces to those who wanted to borrow and the other when some large houses being burnt down upon Mount Caelius he indemnified the owners To the former of these he was compelled by the clamours of the people in a great scarcity of money when he had ratified a decree of the senate obliging all money lenders to advance two thirds of their capital on land and the debtors to pay off at once the same proportion of their debts and it was found insufficient to remedy the grievance The other he did to alleviate in some degree the pressure of the times But his benefaction to the sufferers by fire he estimated at so high a rate that he ordered the Caelian Hill to be called in future the Augustan To the soldiery after doubling the legacy left them by Augustus he never gave any thing except a thousand denarii a man to the pretorian guards for not joining the party of Sejanus and some presents to the legions in Syria because they alone had not paid reverence to the effigies of Sejanus among their standards He seldom gave discharges to the veteran soldiers calculating two hundred twenty two on their deaths from advanced age and on what would be saved by thus getting rid of them in the way of rewards or pensions Nor did he ever relieve the provinces by any act of generosity excepting Asia where some cities had been destroyed by an earthquake XLIX In the course of a very short time he turned his mind to sheer robbery It is certain that Cneius Lentulus the augur a man of vast estate was so terrified and worried by his threats and importunities that he was obliged to make him his heir and that Lepida a lady of a very noble family was condemned by him in order to gratify Quirinus a man of consular rank extremely rich and childless who had divorced her twenty years before and now charged her with an old design to poison him Several persons likewise of the first distinction in Gaul Spain Syria and Greece had their estates confiscated upon such despicably trifling and shameless pretences that against some of them no other charge was preferred than that they held large sums of ready money as part of their property Old immunities the rights of mining and of levying tolls were taken from several cities and private persons And Vonones king of the Parthians who had been driven out of his dominions by his own subjects and fled to Antioch with a vast treasure claiming the protection of the Roman people his allies was treacherously robbed of all his money and afterwards murdered L He first manifested hatred towards his own relations in the case of his brother Drusus betraying him by the production of a letter to himself in which Drusus proposed that Augustus should be forced to restore the public liberty In course of time he shewed the same disposition with regard to the rest of his family So far was he from performing any office of kindness or humanity to his wife when she was banished and by her father s order confined to one town that he forbad her to stir out of the house or converse with any men He even wronged her of the dowry given her by her father and of her yearly allowance by a quibble of law because Augustus had made no provision for them on her behalf in his will Being harassed by his mother Livia who claimed an equal share in the government with him he frequently avoided two hundred twenty three seeing her and all long and private conferences with her lest it should be thought that he was governed by her counsels which notwithstanding he sometimes sought and was in the habit of adopting He was much offended at the senate when they proposed to add to his other titles that of the Son of Livia as well as Augustus He therefore would not suffer her to be called the Mother of her Country nor to receive any extraordinary public distinction Nay he frequently admonished her not to meddle with weighty affairs and such as did not suit her sex especially when he found her present at a fire which broke out near the Temple of Vesta three hundred fifty one and encouraging the people and soldiers to use their utmost exertions as she had been used to do in the time of her husband LI He afterwards proceeded to an open rupture with her and as is said upon this occasion She having frequently urged him to place among the judges a person who had been made free of the city he refused her request unless she would allow it to be inscribed on the roll That the appointment had been extorted from him by his mother Enraged at this Livia brought forth from her chapel some letters from Augustus to her complaining of the sourness and insolence of Tiberius s temper and these she read So much was he offended at these letters having been kept so long and now produced with so much bitterness against him that some considered this incident as one of the causes of his going into seclusion if not the principal reason for his so doing In the two hundred twenty four whole years she lived during his retirement he saw her but once and that for a few hours only When she fell sick shortly afterwards he was quite unconcerned about visiting her in her illness and when she died after promising to attend her funeral he deferred his coming for several days so that the corpse was in a state of decay and putrefaction before the interment and he then forbad divine honours being paid to her pretending that he acted according to her own directions He likewise annulled her will and in a short time ruined all her friends and acquaintance not even sparing those to whom on her death bed she had recommended the care of her funeral but condemning one of them a man of equestrian rank to the treadmill three hundred fifty two LII He entertained no paternal affection either for his own son Drusus or his adopted son Germanicus Offended at the vices of the former who was of a loose disposition and led a dissolute life he was not much affected at his death but almost immediately after the funeral resumed his attention to business and prevented the courts from being longer closed The ambassadors from the people of Ilium coming rather late to offer their condolence he said to them by way of banter as if the affair had already faded from his memory And I heartily condole with you on the loss of your renowned countryman Hector He so much affected to depreciate Germanicus that he spoke of his achievements as utterly insignificant and railed at his most glorious victories as ruinous to the state complaining of him also to the senate for going to Alexandria without his knowledge upon occasion of a great and sudden famine at Rome It was believed that he took care to have him dispatched by Cneius Piso his lieutenant in Syria This person was afterwards tried for the murder and would as was supposed have produced his orders had they not been contained in a private and confidential dispatch The following words therefore were posted up in many places and frequently shouted in the night Give us back our Germanicus This suspicion was afterwards confirmed by the barbarous treatment of his wife and children two hundred twenty five LIII His daughter in law Agrippina after the death of her husband complaining upon some occasion with more than ordinary freedom he took her by the hand and addressed her in a Greek verse to this effect My dear child do you think yourself injured because you are not empress Nor did he ever vouchsafe to speak to her again Upon her refusing once at supper to taste some fruit which he presented to her he declined inviting her to his table pretending that she in effect charged him with a design to poison her whereas the whole was a contrivance of his own He was to offer the fruit and she to be privately cautioned against eating what would infallibly cause her death At last having her accused of intending to flee for refuge to the statue of Augustus or to the army he banished her to the island of Pandataria three hundred fifty three Upon her reviling him for it he caused a centurion to beat out one of her eyes and when she resolved to starve herself to death he ordered her mouth to be forced open and meat to be crammed down her throat But she persisting in her resolution and dying soon afterwards he persecuted her memory with the basest aspersions and persuaded the senate to put her birth day amongst the number of unlucky days in the calendar He likewise took credit for not having caused her to be strangled and her body cast upon the Gemonian Steps and suffered a decree of the senate to pass thanking him for his clemency and an offering of gold to be made to Jupiter Capitolinus on the occasion LIV He had by Germanicus three grandsons Nero Drusus and Caius and by his son Drusus one named Tiberius Of these after the loss of his sons he commended Nero and Drusus the two eldest sons of Germanicus to the senate and at their being solemnly introduced into the forum distributed money among the people But when he found that on entering upon the new year they were included in the public vows for his own welfare he told the senate that such honours ought not to be conferred but upon those who had been proved and were of more advanced years By thus betraying his private feelings towards them he exposed them to all sorts of accusations and after practising many artifices to provoke two hundred twenty six them to rail at and abuse him that he might be furnished with a pretence to destroy them he charged them with it in a letter to the senate at the same time accusing them in the bitterest terms of the most scandalous vices Upon their being declared enemies by the senate he starved them to death Nero in the island of Ponza and Drusus in the vaults of the Palatium It is thought by some that Nero was driven to a voluntary death by the executioner s shewing him some halters and hooks as if he had been sent to him by order of the senate Drusus it is said was so rabid with hunger that he attempted to eat the chaff with which his mattress was stuffed The relics of both were so scattered that it was with difficulty they were collected LV Besides his old friends and intimate acquaintance he required the assistance of twenty of the most eminent persons in the city as counsellors in the administration of public affairs Out of all this number scarcely two or three escaped the fury of his savage disposition All the rest he destroyed upon one pretence or another and among them Aelius Sejanus whose fall was attended with the ruin of many others He had advanced this minister to the highest pitch of grandeur not so much from any real regard for him as that by his base and sinister contrivances he might ruin the children of Germanicus and thereby secure the succession to his own grandson by Drusus LVI He treated with no greater leniency the Greeks in his family even those with whom he was most pleased Having asked one Zeno upon his using some far fetched phrases What uncouth dialect is that he replied The Doric For this answer he banished him to Cinara three hundred fifty four suspecting that he taunted him with his former residence at Rhodes where the Doric dialect is spoken It being his custom to start questions at supper arising out of what he had been reading in the day and finding that Seleucus the grammarian used to inquire of his attendants what authors he was then studying and so came prepared for his enquiries he first turned him out of his family and then drove him to the extremity of laying violent hands upon himself two hundred twenty seven LVII His cruel and sullen temper appeared when he was still a boy which Theodorus of Gadara three hundred fifty five his master in rhetoric first discovered and expressed by a very apposite simile calling him sometimes when he chid him Mud mixed with blood But his disposition shewed itself still more clearly on his attaining the imperial power and even in the beginning of his administration when he was endeavouring to gain the popular favour by affecting moderation Upon a funeral passing by a wag called out to the dead man Tell Augustus that the legacies he bequeathed to the people are not yet paid The man being brought before him he ordered that he should receive what was due to him and then be led to execution that he might deliver the message to his father himself Not long afterwards when one Pompey a Roman knight persisted in his opposition to something he proposed in the senate he threatened to put him in prison and told him Of a Pompey I shall make a Pompeian of you by a bitter kind of pun playing upon the man s name and the ill fortune of his party LVIII About the same time when the praetor consulted him whether it was his pleasure that the tribunals should take cognizance of accusations of treason he replied The laws ought to be put in execution and he did put them in execution most severely Some person had taken off the head of Augustus from one of his statues and replaced it by another three hundred fifty six The matter was brought before the senate and because the case was not clear the witnesses were put to the torture The party accused being found guilty and condemned this kind of proceeding was carried so far that it became capital for a man to beat his slave or change his clothes near the statue of Augustus to carry his head stamped upon the coin or cut in the stone of a ring into a necessary house or the stews or to reflect upon anything that had been either said or done by him In fine a person was condemned to death for suffering some honours to be decreed to him in the colony where he lived upon the same day on which they had formerly been decreed to Augustus two hundred twenty eight LIX He was besides guilty of many barbarous actions under the pretence of strictness and reformation of manners but more to gratify his own savage disposition Some verses were published which displayed the present calamities of his reign and anticipated the future three hundred fifty seven Asper et immitis breviter vis omnia dicam Dispeream si te mater amare potest Non es eques quare non sunt tibi millia centum Omnia si quaeras et Rhodos exsilium est Aurea mutasti Saturni saecula Caesar Incolumi nam te ferrea semper erunt Fastidit vinum quia jam sit it iste cruorem Tam bibit hunc avide quam bibit ante merum Adspice felicem sibi non tibi Romule Sullam Et Marium si vis adspice sed reducem Nec non Antoni civilia bella moventis Nec semel infectas adspice caeda manus Et dic Roma perit regnabit sanguine multo Ad regnum quisquis venit ab exsilio Obdurate wretch too fierce too fell to move The least kind yearnings of a mother s love No knight thou art as having no estate Long suffered saint thou in Rhodes an exile s fate No more the happy Golden Age we see The Iron s come and sure to last with thee Instead of wine he thirsted for before He wallows now in floods of human gore Reflect ye Romans on the dreadful times Made such by Marius and by Sylla s crimes Reflect how Antony s ambitious rage Twice scar d with horror a distracted age And say Alas Rome s blood in streams will flow When banish d miscreants rule this world below At first he would have it understood that these satirical verses were drawn forth by the resentment of those who were impatient under the discipline of reformation rather than that they spoke their real sentiments and he would frequently say Let them hate me so long as they do but approve my conduct three hundred fifty eight At length however his behaviour showed that he was sensible they were too well founded two hundred twenty nine LX A few days after his arrival at Capri a fisherman coming up to him unexpectedly when he was desirous of privacy and presenting him with a large mullet he ordered the man s face to be scrubbed with the fish being terrified at the thought of his having been able to creep upon him from the back of the island over such rugged and steep rocks The man while undergoing the punishment expressing his joy that he had not likewise offered him a large crab which he had also taken he ordered his face to be farther lacerated with its claws He put to death one of the pretorian guards for having stolen a peacock out of his orchard In one of his journeys his litter being obstructed by some bushes he ordered the officer whose duty it was to ride on and examine the road a centurion of the first cohorts to be laid on his face upon the ground and scourged almost to death LXI Soon afterwards he abandoned himself to every species of cruelty never wanting occasions of one kind or another to serve as a pretext He first fell upon the friends and acquaintance of his mother then those of his grandsons and his daughter in law and lastly those of Sejanus after whose death he became cruel in the extreme From this it appeared that he had not been so much instigated by Sejanus as supplied with occasions of gratifying his savage temper when he wanted them Though in a short memoir which he composed of his own life he had the effrontery to write I have punished Sejanus because I found him bent upon the destruction of the children of my son Germanicus one of these he put to death when he began to suspect Sejanus and another after he was taken off It would be tedious to relate all the numerous instances of his cruelty suffice it to give a few examples in their different kinds Not a day passed without the punishment of some person or other not excepting holidays or those appropriated to the worship of the gods Some were tried even on New Year s Day Of many who were condemned their wives and children shared the same fate and for those who were sentenced to death the relations were forbid to put on mourning Considerable rewards were voted for the prosecutors and sometimes for the witnesses also The information of any person without exception was taken and all offences were capital even speaking two hundred thirty a few words though without any ill intention A poet was charged with abusing Agamemnon and a historian three hundred fifty nine for calling Brutus and Cassius the last of the Romans The two authors were immediately called to account and their writings suppressed though they had been well received some years before and read in the hearing of Augustus Some who were thrown into prison were not only denied the solace of study but debarred from all company and conversation Many persons when summoned to trial stabbed themselves at home to avoid the distress and ignominy of a public condemnation which they were certain would ensue Others took poison in the senate house The wounds were bound up and all who had not expired were carried half dead and panting for life to prison Those who were put to death were thrown down the Gemonian stairs and then dragged into the Tiber In one day twenty were treated in this manner and amongst them women and boys Because according to an ancient custom it was not lawful to strangle virgins the young girls were first deflowered by the executioner and afterwards strangled Those who were desirous to die were forced to live For he thought death so slight a punishment that upon hearing that Carnulius one of the accused who was under prosecution had killed himself he exclaimed Carnulius has escaped me In calling over his prisoners when one of them requested the favour of a speedy death he replied You are not yet restored to favour A man of consular rank writes in his annals that at table where he himself was present with a large company he was suddenly asked aloud by a dwarf who stood by amongst the buffoons why Paconius who was under a prosecution for treason lived so long Tiberius immediately reprimanded him for his pertness but wrote to the senate a few days after to proceed without delay to the punishment of Paconius LXII Exasperated by information he received respecting the death of his son Drusus he carried his cruelty still farther He imagined that he had died of a disease occasioned two hundred thirty one by his intemperance but finding that he had been poisoned by the contrivance of his wife Livilla three hundred sixty and Sejanus he spared no one from torture and death He was so entirely occupied with the examination of this affair for whole days together that upon being informed that the person in whose house he had lodged at Rhodes and whom he had by a friendly letter invited to Rome was arrived he ordered him immediately to be put to the torture as a party concerned in the enquiry Upon finding his mistake he commanded him to be put to death that he might not publish the injury done him The place of execution is still shown at Capri where he ordered those who were condemned to die after long and exquisite tortures to be thrown before his eyes from a precipice into the sea There a party of soldiers belonging to the fleet waited for them and broke their bones with poles and oars lest they should have any life left in them Among various kinds of torture invented by him one was to induce people to drink a large quantity of wine and then to tie up their members with harp strings thus tormenting them at once by the tightness of the ligature and the stoppage of their urine Had not death prevented him and Thrasyllus designedly as some say prevailed with him to defer some of his cruelties in hopes of longer life it is believed that he would have destroyed many more and not have spared even the rest of his grandchildren for he was jealous of Caius and hated Tiberius as having been conceived in adultery This conjecture is indeed highly probable for he used often to say Happy Priam who survived all his children three hundred sixty one LXIII Amidst these enormities in how much fear and apprehension as well as odium and detestation he lived is evident from many indications He forbade the soothsayers to be consulted in private and without some witnesses being present He attempted to suppress the oracles in the neighbourhood of the city but being terrified by the divine authority of the two hundred thirty two Praenestine Lots three hundred sixty two he abandoned the design For though they were sealed up in a box and carried to home yet they were not to be found in it until it was returned to the temple More than one person of consular rank appointed governors of provinces he never ventured to dismiss to their respective destinations but kept them until several years after when he nominated their successors while they still remained present with him In the meantime they bore the title of their office and he frequently gave them orders which they took care to have executed by their deputies and assistants LXIV He never removed his daughter in law or grandsons three hundred sixty three after their condemnation to any place but in fetters and in a covered litter with a guard to hinder all who met them on the road and travellers from stopping to gaze at them LXV After Sejanus had plotted against him though he saw that his birth day was solemnly kept by the public and divine honours paid to golden images of him in every quarter yet it was with difficulty at last and more by artifice than his imperial power that he accomplished his death In the first place to remove him from about his person under the pretext of doing him honour he made him his colleague in his fifth consulship which although then absent from the city he took upon him for that purpose long after his preceding consulship Then having flattered him with the hope of an alliance by marriage with one of his own kindred and the prospect of the tribunitian authority he suddenly while Sejanus little expected it charged him with treason in an abject and pitiful address to the senate in which among other things he begged them to send one of the consuls to conduct himself a poor solitary old man with a guard of soldiers into their presence Still distrustful however and apprehensive of an insurrection he ordered his grandson Drusus whom he still kept in confinement at Rome to be set at liberty and if occasion required to head the troops He had likewise ships in readiness to transport him to any of the legions to which he might consider it expedient to make his escape Meanwhile he was upon the two hundred thirty three watch from the summit of a lofty cliff for the signals which he had ordered to be made if any thing occurred lest the messengers should be tardy Even when he had quite foiled the conspiracy of Sejanus he was still haunted as much as ever with fears and apprehensions insomuch that he never once stirred out of the Villa Jovis for nine months after LXVI To the extreme anxiety of mind which he now experienced he had the mortification to find superadded the most poignant reproaches from all quarters Those who were condemned to die heaped upon him the most opprobrious language in his presence or by hand bills scattered in the senators seats in the theatre These produced different effects sometimes he wished out of shame to have all smothered and concealed at other times he would disregard what was said and publish it himself To this accumulation of scandal and open sarcasm there is to be subjoined a letter from Artabanus king of the Parthians in which he upbraids him with his parricides murders cowardice and lewdness and advises him to satisfy the furious rage of his own people which he had so justly excited by putting an end to his life without delay LXVII At last being quite weary of himself he acknowledged his extreme misery in a letter to the senate which begun thus What to write to you Conscript Fathers or how to write or what not to write at this time may all the gods and goddesses pour upon my head a more terrible vengeance than that under which I feel myself daily sinking if I can tell Some are of opinion that he had a foreknowledge of those things from his skill in the science of divination and perceived long before what misery and infamy would at last come upon him and that for this reason at the beginning of his reign he had absolutely refused the title of the Father of his Country and the proposal of the senate to swear to his acts lest he should afterwards to his greater shame be found unequal to such extraordinary honours This indeed may be justly inferred from the speeches which he made upon both those occasions as when he says I shall ever be the same and shall never change my conduct so long as I retain my senses but to avoid giving a bad precedent to posterity the senate ought to beware of binding themselves to the acts of two hundred thirty four any person whatever who might by some accident or other be induced to alter them And again If ye should at any time entertain a jealousy of my conduct and my entire affection for you which heaven prevent by putting a period to my days rather than I should live to see such an alteration in your opinion of me the title of Father will add no honour to me but be a reproach to you for your rashness in conferring it upon me or inconstancy in altering your opinion of me LXVIII In person he was large and robust of a stature somewhat above the common size broad in the shoulders and chest and proportionable in the rest of his frame He used his left hand more readily and with more force than his right and his joints were so strong that he could bore a fresh sound apple through with his finger and wound the head of a boy or even a young man with a fillip He was of a fair complexion and wore his hair so long behind that it covered his neck which was observed to be a mark of distinction affected by the family He had a handsome face but it was often full of pimples His eyes which were large had a wonderful faculty of seeing in the night time and in the dark for a short time only and immediately after awaking from sleep but they soon grew dim again He walked with his neck stiff and upright generally with a frowning countenance being for the most part silent when he spoke to those about him it was very slowly and usually accompanied with a slight gesticulation of his fingers All which being repulsive habits and signs of arrogance were remarked by Augustus who often endeavoured to excuse them to the senate and people declaring that they were natural defects which proceeded from no viciousness of mind He enjoyed a good state of health without interruption almost during the whole period of his rule though from the thirtieth year of his age he treated it himself according to his own discretion without any medical assistance LXIX In regard to the gods and matters of religion he discovered much indifference being greatly addicted to astrology and fully persuaded that all things were governed by fate Yet he was extremely afraid of lightning and when the sky was in a disturbed state always wore a laurel crown on his head because it is supposed that the leaf of that tree is never touched by the lightning two hundred thirty five LXX He applied himself with great diligence to the liberal arts both Greek and Latin In his Latin style he affected to imitate Messala Corvinus three hundred sixty four a venerable man to whom he had paid much respect in his own early years But he rendered his style obscure by excessive affectation and abstruseness so that he was thought to speak better extempore than in a premeditated discourse He composed likewise a lyric ode under the title of A Lamentation upon the death of Lucius Caesar and also some Greek poems in imitation of Euphorion Rhianus and Parthenius three hundred sixty five These poets he greatly admired and placed their works and statues in the public libraries amongst the eminent authors of antiquity On this account most of the learned men of the time vied with each other in publishing observations upon them which they addressed to him His principal study however was the history of the fabulous ages inquiring even into its trifling details in a ridiculous manner for he used to try the grammarians a class of men which as I have already observed he much affected with such questions as these Who was Hecuba s mother What name did Achilles assume among the virgins What was it that the Sirens used to sing And the first day that he entered the senate house after the death of Augustus as if he intended to pay respect at once to his father s memory and to the gods he made an offering of frankincense and wine but without any music in imitation of Minos upon the death of his son LXXI Though he was ready and conversant with the Greek tongue yet he did not use it everywhere but chiefly he avoided it in the senate house insomuch that having occasion to employ the word monopolium monopoly he first begged pardon for being obliged to adopt a foreign word And when in a decree of the senate the word emblaema emblem was read he proposed to have it changed and that a Latin word should be substituted in its room or if no proper one could be found to express the thing by circumlocution A soldier two hundred thirty six who was examined as a witness upon a trial in Greek three hundred sixty six he would not allow to reply except in Latin LXXII During the whole time of his seclusion at Capri twice only he made an effort to visit Rome Once he came in a galley as far as the gardens near the Naumachia but placed guards along the banks of the Tiber to keep off all who should offer to come to meet him The second time he travelled on the Appian Way three hundred sixty seven as far as the seventh mile stone from the city but he immediately returned without entering it having only taken a view of the walls at a distance For what reason he did not disembark in his first excursion is uncertain but in the last he was deterred from entering the city by a prodigy He was in the habit of diverting himself with a snake and upon going to feed it with his own hand according to custom he found it devoured by ants from which he was advised to beware of the fury of the mob On this account returning in all haste to Campania he fell ill at Astura three hundred sixty eight but recovering a little went on to Circeii three hundred sixty nine And to obviate any suspicion of his being in a bad state of health he was not only present at the sports in the camp but encountered with javelins a wild boar which was let loose in the arena Being immediately seized with a pain in the side and catching cold upon his over heating himself in the exercise he relapsed into a worse condition than he was before He held out however for some time and sailing as far as Misenum three hundred seventy omitted nothing two hundred thirty seven in his usual mode of life not even in his entertainments and other gratifications partly from an ungovernable appetite and partly to conceal his condition For Charicles a physician having obtained leave of absence on his rising from table took his hand to kiss it upon which Tiberius supposing he did it to feel his pulse desired him to stay and resume his place and continued the entertainment longer than usual Nor did he omit his usual custom of taking his station in the centre of the apartment a lictor standing by him while he took leave of each of the party by name LXXIII Meanwhile finding upon looking over the acts of the senate that some person under prosecution had been discharged without being brought to a hearing for he had only written cursorily that they had been denounced by an informer he complained in a great rage that he was treated with contempt and resolved at all hazards to return to Capri not daring to attempt any thing until he found himself in a place of security But being detained by storms and the increasing violence of his disorder he died shortly afterwards at a villa formerly belonging to Lucullus in the seventy eighth year of his age three hundred seventy one and the twenty third of his reign upon the seventeenth of the calends of April sixteenth March in the consulship of Cneius Acerronius Proculus and Caius Pontius Niger Some think that a slow consuming poison was given him by Caius three hundred seventy two Others say that during the interval of the intermittent fever with which he happened to be seized upon asking for food it was denied him Others report that he was stifled by a pillow thrown upon him three hundred seventy three when on his recovering from a swoon he called for his ring which had been taken from him in the fit Seneca writes That finding himself dying he took his signet ring off his finger and held it a while as if he would deliver it to somebody but put it again upon his finger and lay for some time with his left hand clenched and without stirring when suddenly summoning his attendants two hundred thirty eight and no one answering the call he rose but his strength failing him he fell down at a short distance from his bed LXXIV Upon his last birth day he had brought a full sized statue of the Timenian Apollo from Syracuse a work of exquisite art intending to place it in the library of the new temple three hundred seventy four but he dreamt that the god appeared to him in the night and assured him that his statue could not be erected by him A few days before he died the Pharos at Capri was thrown down by an earthquake And at Misenum some embers and live coals which were brought in to warm his apartment went out and after being quite cold burst out into a flame again towards evening and continued burning very brightly for several hours LXXV The people were so much elated at his death that when they first heard the news they ran up and down the city some crying out Away with Tiberius to the Tiber others exclaiming May the earth the common mother of mankind and the infernal gods allow him no abode in death but amongst the wicked Others threatened his body with the hook and the Gemonian stairs their indignation at his former cruelty being increased by a recent atrocity It had been provided by an act of the senate that the execution of condemned criminals should always be deferred until the tenth day after the sentence Now this fell on the very day when the news of Tiberius s death arrived and in consequence of which the unhappy men implored a reprieve for mercy s sake but as Caius had not yet arrived and there was no one else to whom application could be made on their behalf their guards apprehensive of violating the law strangled them and threw them down the Gemonian stairs This roused the people to a still greater abhorrence of the tyrant s memory since his cruelty continued in use even after he was dead As soon as his corpse was begun to be moved from Misenum many cried out for its being carried to Atella three hundred seventy five and being half burnt there two hundred thirty nine in the amphitheatre It was however brought to Rome and burnt with the usual ceremony LXXVI He had made about two years before duplicates of his will one written by his own hand and the other by that of one of his freedmen and both were witnessed by some persons of very mean rank He appointed his two grandsons Caius by Germanicus and Tiberius by Drusus joint heirs to his estate and upon the death of one of them the other was to inherit the whole He gave likewise many legacies amongst which were bequests to the Vestal Virgins to all the soldiers and each one of the people of Rome and to the magistrates of the several quarters of the city At the death of Augustus there had elapsed so long a period from the overthrow of the republic by Julius Caesar that few were now living who had been born under the ancient constitution of the Romans and the mild and prosperous administration of Augustus during forty four years had by this time reconciled the minds of the people to a despotic government Tiberius the adopted son of the former sovereign was of mature age and though he had hitherto lived for the most part abstracted from any concern with public affairs yet having been brought up in the family of Augustus he was acquainted with his method of government which there was reason to expect he would render the model of his own Livia too his mother and the relict of the late emperor was still living a woman venerable by years who had long been familiar with the councils of Augustus and from her high rank as well as uncommon affability possessed an extensive influence amongst all classes of the people Such were the circumstances in favour of Tiberius s succession at the demise of Augustus but there were others of a tendency disadvantageous to his views His temper was haughty and reserved Augustus had often apologised for the ungraciousness of his manners He was disobedient to his mother and though he had not openly discovered any propensity to vice he enjoyed none of those qualities which usually conciliate popularity To these considerations it is to be added that Postumus Agrippa the grandson of Augustus by Julia was living and if consanguinity was to be the rule of succession his right was indisputably preferable to that of an adopted son Augustus had sent this youth into exile a few years before but towards the close two hundred forty of his life had expressed a design of recalling him with the view as was supposed of appointing him his successor The father of young Agrippa had been greatly beloved by the Romans and the fate of his mother Julia though she was notorious for her profligacy had ever been regarded by them with peculiar sympathy and tenderness Many therefore attached to the son the partiality entertained for his parents which was increased not only by a strong suspicion but a general surmise that his elder brothers Caius and Lucius had been violently taken off to make way for the succession of Tiberius That an obstruction was apprehended to Tiberius s succession from this quarter is put beyond all doubt when we find that the death of Augustus was industriously kept secret until young Agrippa should be removed who it is generally agreed was dispatched by an order from Livia and Tiberius conjointly or at least from the former Though by this act there remained no rival to Tiberius yet the consciousness of his own want of pretensions to the Roman throne seems to have still rendered him distrustful of the succession and that he should have quietly obtained it without the voice of the people the real inclination of the senate or the support of the army can be imputed only to the influence of his mother and his own dissimulation Ardently solicitous to attain the object yet affecting a total indifference artfully prompting the senate to give him the charge of the government at the time that he intimated an invincible reluctance to accept it his absolutely declining it in perpetuity but fixing no time for an abdication his deceitful insinuation of bodily infirmities with hints likewise of approaching old age that he might allay in the senate all apprehensions of any great duration of his power and repress in his adopted son Germanicus the emotions of ambition to displace him form altogether a scene of the most insidious policy inconsistency and dissimulation In this period died in the eighty sixth year of her age Livia Drusilla mother of the emperor and the relict of Augustus whom she survived fifteen years She was the daughter of L Drusus Calidianus and married Tiberius Claudius Nero by whom she had two sons Tiberius and Drusus The conduct of this lady seems to justify the remark of Caligula that she was an Ulysses in a woman s dress Octavius first saw her as she fled from the danger which threatened her husband who had espoused the cause of Antony and though she was then pregnant he resolved to marry her whether with her own inclination or not is left by Tacitus undetermined To pave the way for this union he divorced his wife Scribonia and with the approbation of the Augurs which he could have no difficulty in obtaining celebrated two hundred forty one his nuptials with Livia There ensued from this marriage no issue though much desired by both parties but Livia retained without interruption an unbounded ascendancy over the emperor whose confidence she abused while the uxorious husband little suspected that he was cherishing in his bosom a viper who was to prove the destruction of his house She appears to have entertained a predominant ambition of giving an heir to the Roman empire and since it could not be done by any fruit of her marriage with Augustus she resolved on accomplishing that end in the person of Tiberius the eldest son by her former husband The plan which she devised for this purpose was to exterminate all the male offspring of Augustus by his daughter Julia who was married to Agrippa a stratagem which when executed would procure for Tiberius through the means of adoption the eventual succession to the empire The cool yet sanguinary policy and the patient perseverance of resolution with which she prosecuted her design have seldom been equalled While the sons of Julia were yet young and while there was still a possibility that she herself might have issue by Augustus she suspended her project in the hope perhaps that accident or disease might operate in its favour but when the natural term of her constitution had put a period to her hopes of progeny and when the grandsons of the emperor were risen to the years of manhood and had been adopted by him she began to carry into execution what she long had meditated The first object devoted to destruction was C Caesar Agrippa the eldest of Augustus s grandsons This promising youth was sent to Armenia upon an expedition against the Persians and Lollius who had been his governor either accompanied him thither from Rome or met him in the East where he had obtained some appointment From the hand of this traitor perhaps under the pretext of exercising the authority of a preceptor but in reality instigated by Livia the young prince received a fatal blow of which he died some time after The manner of Caius s death seems to have been carefully kept from the knowledge of Augustus who promoted Lollius to the consulship and made him governor of a province but by his rapacity in this station he afterwards incurred the emperor s displeasure The true character of this person had escaped the keen discernment of Horace as well as the sagacity of the emperor for in two epistles addressed to Lollius he mentions him as great and accomplished in the superlative degree maxime Lolli liberrime Lolli so imposing had been the manners and address of this deceitful courtier Lucius the second son of Julia was banished into Campania two hundred forty two for using as it is said so litious language against his grandfather In the seventh year of his exile Augustus proposed to recall him but Livia and Tiberius dreading the consequences of his being restored to the emperor s favour put in practice the expedient of having him immediately assassinated Postumus Agrippa the third son incurred the displeasure of his grandfather in the same way as Lucius and was confined at Surrentum where he remained a prisoner until he was put to death by the order either of Livia alone or in conjunction with Tiberius as was before observed Such was the catastrophe through the means of Livia of all the grandsons of Augustus and reason justifies the inference that she who scruple not to lay violent hands upon those young men had formerly practised every artifice that could operate towards rendering them obnoxious to the emperor We may even ascribe to her dark intrigues the dissolute conduct of Julia for the woman who could secretly act as procuress to her own husband would feel little restraint upon her mind against corrupting his daughter when such an effect might contribute to answer the purpose which she had in view But in the ingratitude of Tiberius however undutiful and reprehensible in a son towards a parent she at last experienced a just retribution for the crimes in which she had trained him to procure the succession to the empire To the disgrace of her sex she introduced amongst the Romans the horrible practice of domestic murder little known before the times when the thirst or intoxication of unlimited power had vitiated the social affections and she transmitted to succeeding ages a pernicious example by which immoderate ambition might be gratified at the expense of every moral obligation as well as of humanity One of the first victims in the sanguinary reign of the present emperor was Germanicus the son of Drusus Tiberius s own brother and who had been adopted by his uncle himself Under any sovereign of a temper different from that of Tiberius this amiable and meritorious prince would have been held in the highest esteem At the death of his grandfather Augustus he was employed in a war in Germany where he greatly distinguished himself by his military achievements and as soon as intelligence of that event arrived the soldiers by whom he was extremely beloved unanimously saluted him emperor Refusing however to accept this mark of their partiality he persevered in allegiance to the government of his uncle and prosecuted the war with success Upon the conclusion of this expedition he was sent with the title of emperor in the East to repress the seditions of the Armenians in which he was equally successful But the two hundred forty three fame which he acquired served only to render him an object of jealousy to Tiberius by whose order he was secretly poisoned at Daphne near Antioch in the thirty fourth year of his age The news of Germanicus s death was received at Rome with universal lamentation and all ranks of the people entertained an opinion that had he survived Tiberius he would have restored the freedom of the republic The love and gratitude of the Romans decreed many honours to his memory It was ordered that his name should be sung in a solemn procession of the Salii that crowns of oak in allusion to his victories should be placed upon curule chairs in the hall pertaining to the priests of Augustus and that an effigy of him in ivory should be drawn upon a chariot preceding the ceremonies of the Circensian games Triumphal arches were erected one at Rome another on the banks of the Rhine and a third upon Mount Amanus in Syria with inscriptions of his achievements and that he died for his services to the republic three hundred seventy six His obsequies were celebrated not with the display of images and funeral pomp but with the recital of his praises and the virtues which rendered him illustrious From a resemblance in his personal accomplishments his age the manner of his death and the vicinity of Daphne to Babylon many compared his fate to that of Alexander the Great He was celebrated for humanity and benevolence as well as military talents and amidst the toils of war found leisure to cultivate the arts of literary genius He composed two comedies in Greek some epigrams and a translation of Aratus into Latin verse He married Agrippina the daughter of M Agrippa by whom he had nine children This lady who had accompanied her husband into the east carried his ashes to Italy and accused his murderer Piso who unable to bear up against the public odium incurred by that transaction laid violent hands upon himself Agrippina was now nearly in the same predicament with regard to Tiberius that Ovid had formerly been in respect of Augustus He was sensible that when she accused Piso she was not ignorant of the person by whom the perpetrator of the murder had been instigated and her presence therefore seeming continually to reproach him with his guilt he resolved to rid himself of a person become so obnoxious to his sight and banished her to the island of Pandataria where she died some time afterwards of famine But it was not sufficient to gratify this sanguinary tyrant that he had without any cause cut off both Germanicus and his wife Agrippina the distinguished merits and popularity of that prince were yet to be revenged upon his children and accordingly he two hundred forty four set himself to invent a pretext for their destruction After endeavouring in vain by various artifices to provoke the resentment of Nero and Drusus against him he had recourse to false accusation and not only charged them with seditious designs to which their tender years were ill adapted but with vices of a nature the most scandalous By a sentence of the senate which manifested the extreme servility of that assembly he procured them both to be declared open enemies to their country Nero he banished to the island of Pontia where like his unfortunate mother he miserably perished by famine and Drusus was doomed to the same fate in the lower part of the Palatium after suffering for nine days the violence of hunger and having as is related devoured part of his bed The remaining son Caius on account of his vicious disposition he resolved to appoint his successor on the throne that after his own death a comparison might be made in favour of his memory when the Romans should be governed by a sovereign yet more vicious and more tyrannical if possible than himself Sejanus the minister in the present reign imitated with success for some time the hypocrisy of his master and had his ambitious temper impatient of attaining its object allowed him to wear the mask for a longer period he might have gained the imperial diadem in the pursuit of which he was overtaken by that fate which he merited still more by his cruelties than his perfidy to Tiberius This man was a native of Volsinium in Tuscany and the son of a Roman knight He had first insinuated himself into the favour of Caius Caesar the grandson of Augustus after whose death he courted the friendship of Tiberius and obtained in a short time his entire confidence which he improved to the best advantage The object which he next pursued was to gain the attachment of the senate and the officers of the army besides whom with a new kind of policy he endeavoured to secure in his interest every lady of distinguished connections by giving secretly to each of them a promise of marriage as soon as he should arrive at the sovereignty The chief obstacles in his way were the sons and grandsons of Tiberius and these he soon sacrificed to his ambition under various pretences Drusus the eldest of this progeny having in a fit of passion struck the favourite was destined by him to destruction For this purpose he had the presumption to seduce Livia the wife of Drusus to whom she had borne several children and she consented to marry her adulterer upon the death of her husband who was soon after poisoned through the means of an eunuch named Lygdus by order of her and Sejanus Drusus was the son of Tiberius by Vipsania one of Agrippa s two hundred forty five daughters He displayed great intrepidity during the war in the provinces of Illyricum and Pannonia but appears to have been dissolute in his morals Horace is said to have written the Ode in praise of Drusus at the desire of Augustus and while the poet celebrates the military courage of the prince he insinuates indirectly a salutary admonition to the cultivation of the civil virtues Doctrina sed vim promovet insitam Rectique cultus pectora roborant Utcunque defecere mores Dedecorant bene nata culpae Ode iv four Yet sage instructions to refine the soul And raise the genius wondrous aid impart Conveying inward as they purely roll Strength to the mind and vigour to the heart When morals fail the stains of vice disgrace The fairest honours of the noblest race Francis Upon the death of Drusus Sejanus openly avowed a desire of marrying the widowed princess but Tiberius opposing this measure and at the same time recommending Germanicus to the senate as his successor in the empire the mind of Sejanus was more than ever inflamed by the united and now furious passions of love and ambition He therefore urged his demand with increased importunity but the emperor still refusing his consent and things being not yet ripe for an immediate revolt Sejanus thought nothing so favourable for the prosecution of his designs as the absence of Tiberius from the capital With this view under the pretence of relieving his master from the cares of government he persuaded him to retire to a distance from Rome The emperor indolent and luxurious approved of the proposal and retired into Campania leaving to his ambitious minister the whole direction of the empire Had Sejanus now been governed by common prudence and moderation he might have attained to the accomplishment of all his wishes but a natural impetuosity of temper and the intoxication of power precipitated him into measures which soon effected his destruction As if entirely emancipated from the control of a master he publicly declared himself sovereign of the Roman empire and that Tiberius who had by this time retired to Capri was only the dependent prince of that tributary island He even went so far in degrading the emperor as to have him introduced in a ridiculous light upon the stage Advice of Sejanus s proceedings was soon carried to the emperor at Capri his indignation was immediately excited and with a confidence founded upon an authority exercised for several years he sent orders for accusing Sejanus two hundred forty six before the senate This mandate no sooner arrived than the audacious minister was deserted by his adherents he was in a short time after seized without resistance and strangled in prison the same day Human nature recoils with horror at the cruelties of this execrable tyrant who having first imbrued his hands in the blood of his own relations proceeded to exercise them upon the public with indiscriminate fury Neither age nor sex afforded any exemption from his insatiable thirst for blood Innocent children were condemned to death and butchered in the presence of their parents virgins without any imputed guilt were sacrificed to a similar destiny but there being an ancient custom of not strangling females in that situation they were first deflowered by the executioner and afterwards strangled as if an atrocious addition to cruelty could sanction the exercise of it Fathers were constrained by violence to witness the death of their own children and even the tears of a mother at the execution of her child were punished as a capital offence Some extraordinary calamities occasioned by accident added to the horrors of the reign A great number of houses on Mount Caelius were destroyed by fire and by the fall of a temporary building at Fidenae erected for the purpose of exhibiting public shows about twenty thousand persons were either greatly hurt or crushed to death in the rains By another fire which afterwards broke out a part of the Circus was destroyed with the numerous buildings on Mount Aventine The only act of munificence displayed by Tiberius during his reign was upon the occasion of those fires when to qualify the severity of his government he indemnified the most considerable sufferers for the loss they had sustained Through the whole of his life Tiberius seems to have conducted himself with a uniform repugnance to nature Affable on a few occasions but in general averse to society he indulged from his earliest years a moroseness of disposition which counterfeited the appearance of austere virtue and in the decline of life when it is common to reform from juvenile indiscretions he launched forth into excesses of a kind the most unnatural and most detestable Considering the vicious passions which had ever brooded in his heart it may seem surprising that he restrained himself within the bounds of decency during so many years after his accession but though utterly destitute of reverence or affection for his mother he still felt during her life a filial awe upon his mind and after her death he was actuated by a slavish fear of Sejanus until at last political necessity absolved him likewise from this restraint These checks being both removed two hundred forty seven he rioted without any control either from sentiment or authority Pliny relates that the art of making glass malleable was actually discovered under the reign of Tiberius and that the shop and tools of the artist were destroyed lest by the establishment of this invention gold and silver should lose their value Dion adds that the author of the discovery was put to death The gloom which darkened the Roman capital during this melancholy period shed a baleful influence on the progress of science throughout the empire and literature languished during the present reign in the same proportion as it had flourished in the preceding It is doubtful whether such a change might not have happened in some degree even had the government of Tiberius been equally mild with that of his predecessor The prodigious fame of the writers of the Augustan age by repressing emulation tended to a general diminution of the efforts of genius for some time while the banishment of Ovid it is probable and the capital punishment of a subsequent poet for censuring the character of Agamemnon operated towards the farther discouragement of poetical exertions There now existed no circumstance to counterbalance these disadvantages Genius no longer found a patron either in the emperor or his minister and the gates of the palace were shut against all who cultivated the elegant pursuits of the Muses Panders catamites assassins wretches stained with every crime were the constant attendants as the only fit companions of the tyrant who now occupied the throne We are informed however that even this emperor had a taste for the liberal arts and that he composed a lyric poem upon the death of Lucius Caesar with some Greek poems in imitation of Euphorion Rhianus and Parthenius But none of these has been transmitted to posterity and if we should form an opinion of them upon the principle of Catullus that to be a good poet one ought to be a good man there is little reason to regret that they have perished We meet with no poetical production in this reign and of prose writers the number is inconsiderable as will appear from the following account of them VELLEIUS PATERCULUS was born of an equestrian family in Campania and served as a military tribune under Tiberius in his expeditions in Gaul and Germany He composed an Epitome of the History of Greece and Rome with that of other nations of remote antiquity but of this work there only remain fragments of the history of Greece and Rome from the conquest of Perseus to the seventeenth year of the reign of Tiberius It is written in two books addressed to Marcus Vinicius who had two hundred forty eight the office of consul Rapid in the narrative and concise as well as elegant in style this production exhibits a pleasing epitome of ancient transactions enlivened occasionally with anecdotes and an expressive description of characters In treating of the family of Augustus Paterculus is justly liable to the imputation of partiality which he incurs still more in the latter period of his history by the praise which is lavished on Tiberius and his minister Sejanus He intimates a design of giving a more full account of the civil war which followed the death of Julius Caesar but this if he ever accomplished it has not been transmitted to posterity Candid but decided in his judgment of motives and actions if we except his invectives against Pompey he shows little propensity to censure but in awarding praise he is not equally parsimonious and on some occasions risks the imputation of hyperbole The grace however and the apparent sincerity with which it is bestowed reconcile us to the compliment This author concludes his history with a prayer for the prosperity of the Roman empire VALERIUS MAXIMUS was descended of a Patrician family but we learn nothing more concerning him than that for some time he followed a military life under Sextus Pompey He afterwards betook himself to writing and has left an account in nine books of the memorable apophthegms and actions of eminent persons first of the Romans and afterwards of foreign nations The subjects are of various kinds political moral and natural ranged into distinct classes His transitions from one subject to another are often performed with gracefulness and where he offers any remarks they generally show the author to be a man of judgment and observation Valerius Maximus is chargeable with no affectation of style but is sometimes deficient in that purity of language which might be expected in the age of Tiberius to whom the work is addressed What inducement the author had to this dedication we know not but as it is evident from a passage in the ninth book that the compliment was paid after the death of Sejanus and consequently in the most shameful period of Tiberius s reign we cannot entertain any high opinion of the independent spirit of Valerius Maximus who could submit to flatter a tyrant in the zenith of infamy and detestation But we cannot ascribe the cause to any delicate artifice of conveying to Tiberius indirectly an admonition to reform his conduct Such an expedient would have only provoked the severest resentment from his jealousy PHAEDRUS was a native of Thrace and was brought to Rome as a slave He had the good fortune to come into the service of Augustus where improving his talents by reading he obtained two hundred forty nine the favour of the emperor and was made one of his freedmen In the reign of Tiberius he translated into Iambic verse the Fables of Aesop They are divided into five books and are not less conspicuous for precision and simplicity of thought than for purity and elegance of style conveying moral sentiments with unaffected ease and impressive energy Phaedrus underwent for some time a persecution from Sejanus who conscious of his own delinquency suspected that he was obliquely satirised in the commendations bestowed on virtue by the poet The work of Phaedrus is one of the latest which have been brought to light since the revival of learning It remained in obscurity until two hundred years ago when it was discovered in a library at Rheims HYGINUS is said to have been a native of Alexandria or according to others a Spaniard He was like Phaedrus a freedman of Augustus but though industrious he seems not to have improved himself so much as his companion in the art of composition He wrote however a mythological history under the title of Fables a work called Poeticon Astronomicon with a treatise on agriculture commentaries on Virgil the lives of eminent men and some other productions now lost His remaining works are much mutilated and if genuine afford an unfavourable specimen of his elegance and correctness as a writer CELSUS was a physician in the time of Tiberius and has written eight books De Medicina in which he has collected and digested into order all that is valuable on the subject in the Greek and Roman authors The professors of Medicine were at that time divided into three sects viz the Dogmatists Empirics and Methodists the first of whom deviated less than the others from the plan of Hippocrates but they were in general irreconcilable to each other in respect both of their opinions and practice Celsus with great judgment has occasionally adopted particular doctrines from each of them and whatever he admits into his system he not only establishes by the most rational observations but confirms by its practical utility In justness of remark in force of argument in precision and perspicuity as well as in elegance of expression he deservedly occupies the most distinguished rank amongst the medical writers of antiquity It appears that Celsus likewise wrote on agriculture rhetoric and military affairs but of those several treatises no fragments now remain To the writers of this reign we must add APICIUS COELIUS who has left a book De Re Coquinaria of Cookery There were three Romans of the name of Apicius all remarkable for their two hundred fifty gluttony The first lived in the time of the Republic the last in that of Trajan and the intermediate Apicius under the emperors Augustus and Tiberius This man as Seneca informs us wasted on luxurious living sexcenties sestertium a sum equal to four hundred eighty four thousand three hundred seventy five pounds sterling Upon examining the state of his affairs he found that there remained no more of his estate than centies sestertium eighty thousand seven hundred twenty ninel threes fourd which seeming to him too small to live upon he ended his days by poison CAIUS CAESAR CALIGULA two hundred fifty one I Germanicus the father of Caius Caesar and son of Drusus and the younger Antonia was after his adoption by Tiberius his uncle preferred to the quaestorship three hundred seventy seven five years before he had attained the legal age and immediately upon the expiration of that office to the consulship three hundred seventy eight Having been sent to the army in Germany he restored order among the legions who upon the news of Augustus s death obstinately refused to acknowledge Tiberius as emperor three hundred seventy nine and offered to place him at the head of the state In which affair it is difficult to say whether his regard to filial duty or the firmness of his resolution was most conspicuous Soon afterwards he defeated the enemy and obtained the honours of a triumph Being then made consul for the second time three hundred eighty before he could enter upon his office he was obliged to set out suddenly for the east where after he had conquered the king of Armenia and reduced Cappadocia into the form of a province he died at Antioch of a lingering distemper in the thirty fourth year of his age three hundred eighty one not without the suspicion of being poisoned For besides the livid spots which appeared all over his body and a foaming at the mouth when his corpse was burnt the heart was found entire among the bones its nature being such as it is supposed that when tainted by poison it is indestructible by fire three hundred eighty two II It was a prevailing opinion that he was taken off by the contrivance of Tiberius and through the means of Cneius Piso This person who was about the same time prefect of Syria and made no secret of his position being such that two hundred fifty two he must either offend the father or the son loaded Germanicus even during his sickness with the most unbounded and scurrilous abuse both by word and deed for which upon his return to Rome he narrowly escaped being torn to pieces by the people and was condemned to death by the senate III It is generally agreed that Germanicus possessed all the noblest endowments of body and mind in a higher degree than had ever before fallen to the lot of any man a handsome person extraordinary courage great proficiency in eloquence and other branches of learning both Greek and Roman besides a singular humanity and a behaviour so engaging as to captivate the affections of all about him The slenderness of his legs did not correspond with the symmetry and beauty of his person in other respects but this defect was at length corrected by his habit of riding after meals In battle he often engaged and slew an enemy in single combat He pleaded causes even after he had the honour of a triumph Among other fruits of his studies he left behind him some Greek comedies Both at home and abroad he always conducted himself in a manner the most unassuming On entering any free and confederate town he never would be attended by his lictors Whenever he heard in his travels of the tombs of illustrious men he made offerings over them to the infernal deities He gave a common grave under a mound of earth to the scattered relics of the legionaries slain under Varus and was the first to put his hand to the work of collecting and bringing them to the place of burial He was so extremely mild and gentle to his enemies whoever they were or on what account soever they bore him enmity that although Piso rescinded his decrees and for a long time severely harassed his dependents he never showed the smallest resentment until he found himself attacked by magical charms and imprecations and even then the only steps he took was to renounce all friendship with him according to ancient custom and to exhort his servants to avenge his death if any thing untoward should befall him IV He reaped the fruit of his noble qualities in abundance being so much esteemed and beloved by his friends that Augustus to say nothing of his other relations being a long time in doubt whether he should not appoint him his successor at last ordered Tiberius to adopt him He was so extremely popular that many authors tell us the crowds of those who went to meet him upon his coming to any place or to attend him at his departure were so prodigious that he was sometimes in danger of his life and that upon his return from Germany after he had quelled the mutiny in the army there all the cohorts of the pretorian guards marched out to meet him notwithstanding the order that only two should go and that all the people of Rome both men and women of every age sex and rank flocked as far as the twentieth milestone to attend his entrance V At the time of his death however and afterwards they displayed still greater and stronger proofs of their extraordinary attachment to him The day on which he died stones were thrown at the temples the altars of the gods demolished the household gods in some cases thrown into the streets and new born infants exposed It is even said that barbarous nations both those engaged in intestine wars and those in hostilities against us all agreed to a cessation of arms as if they had been mourning for some very near and common friend that some petty kings shaved their beards and their wives heads in token of their extreme sorrow and that the king of kings three hundred eighty three forbore his exercise of hunting and feasting with his nobles which amongst the Parthians is equivalent to a cessation of all business in a time of public mourning with us VI At Rome upon the first news of his sickness the city was thrown into great consternation and grief waiting impatiently for farther intelligence when suddenly in the evening a report without any certain author was spread that he was recovered upon which the people flocked with torches two hundred fifty four and victims to the Capitol and were in such haste to pay the vows they had made for his recovery that they almost broke open the doors Tiberius was roused from out of his sleep with the noise of the people congratulating one another and singing about the streets Salva Roma salva patria salvus est Germanicus Rome is safe our country safe for our Germanicus is safe But when certain intelligence of his death arrived the mourning of the people could neither be assuaged by consolation nor restrained by edicts and it continued during the holidays in the month of December The atrocities of the subsequent times contributed much to the glory of Germanicus and the endearment of his memory all people supposing and with reason that the fear and awe of him had laid a restraint upon the cruelty of Tiberius which broke out soon afterwards VII Germanicus married Agrippina the daughter of Marcus Agrippa and Julia by whom he had nine children two of whom died in their infancy and another a few years after a sprightly boy whose effigy in the character of a Cupid Livia set up in the temple of Venus in the Capitol Augustus also placed another statue of him in his bed chamber and used to kiss it as often as he entered the apartment The rest survived their father three daughters Agrippina Drusilla and Livilla who were born in three successive years and as many sons Nero Drusus and Caius Caesar Nero and Drusus at the accusation of Tiberius were declared public enemies VIII Caius Caesar was born on the day before the calends thirty first August of September at the time his father and Caius Fonteius Capito were consuls three hundred eighty four But where he was born is rendered uncertain from the number of places which are said to have given him birth Cneius Lentulus Gaetulicus three hundred eighty five says that he was born at Tibur Pliny the younger in the country of the Treviri at a village called Ambiatinus above Confluentes three hundred eighty six and he alleges as a proof of it that altars are there shown with this inscription For Agrippina s child birth Some verses which were published in his reign intimate that he was born in the winter quarters of the legions In castris natus patriis nutritius in armis Jam designati principis omen erat Born in the camp and train d in every toil Which taught his sire the haughtiest foes to foil Destin d he seem d by fate to raise his name And rule the empire with Augustan fame I find in the public registers that he was born at Antium Pliny charges Gaetulicus as guilty of an arrant forgery merely to soothe the vanity of a conceited young prince by giving him the lustre of being born in a city sacred to Hercules and says that he advanced this false assertion with the more assurance because the year before the birth of Caius Germanicus had a son of the same name born at Tibur concerning whose amiable childhood and premature death I have already spoken three hundred eighty seven Dates clearly prove that Pliny is mistaken for the writers of Augustus s history all agree that Germanicus at the expiration of his consulship was sent into Gaul after the birth of Caius Nor will the inscription upon the altar serve to establish Pliny s opinion because Agrippina was delivered of two daughters in that country and any child birth without regard to sex is called puerperium as the ancients were used to call girls puerae and boys puelli There is also extant a letter written by Augustus a few months before his death to his granddaughter Agrippina about the same Caius for there was then no other child of hers living under that name He writes as follows I gave orders yesterday for Talarius and Asellius to set out on their journey towards you if the gods permit with your child Caius upon the fifteenth of the calends of June eighteenth May I also send with him a physician of mine and I wrote to Germanicus that he may retain him if he pleases Farewell my dear Agrippina and take what care you can to two hundred fifty six come safe and well to your Germanicus I imagine it is sufficiently evident that Caius could not be born at a place to which he was carried from The City when almost two years old The same considerations must likewise invalidate the evidence of the verses and the rather because the author is unknown The only authority therefore upon which we can depend in this matter is that of the acts and the public register especially as he always preferred Antium to every other place of retirement and entertained for it all that fondness which is commonly attached to one s native soil It is said too that upon his growing weary of the city he designed to have transferred thither the seat of empire IX It was to the jokes of the soldiers in the camp that he owed the name of Caligula three hundred eighty eight he having been brought up among them in the dress of a common soldier How much his education amongst them recommended him to their favour and affection was sufficiently apparent in the mutiny upon the death of Augustus when the mere sight of him appeased their fury though it had risen to a great height For they persisted in it until they observed that he was sent away to a neighbouring city three hundred eighty nine to secure him against all danger Then at last they began to relent and stopping the chariot in which he was conveyed earnestly deprecated the odium to which such a proceeding would expose them X He likewise attended his father in his expedition to Syria After his return he lived first with his mother and when she was banished with his great grandmother Livia Augusta in praise of whom after her decease though then only a boy he pronounced a funeral oration in the Rostra He was then transferred to the family of his grandmother Antonia and afterwards in the twentieth year of his age being called by Tiberius to Capri he in one and the same day assumed the manly habit and shaved his beard but without receiving any of the honours which had been paid to his brothers on a similar two hundred fifty seven occasion While he remained in that island many insidious artifices were practised to extort from him complaints against Tiberius but by his circumspection he avoided falling into the snare three hundred ninety He affected to take no more notice of the ill treatment of his relations than if nothing had befallen them With regard to his own sufferings he seemed utterly insensible of them and behaved with such obsequiousness to his grandfather three hundred ninety one and all about him that it was justly said of him There never was a better servant nor a worse master XI But he could not even then conceal his natural disposition to cruelty and lewdness He delighted in witnessing the infliction of punishments and frequented taverns and bawdy houses in the night time disguised in a periwig and a long coat and was passionately addicted to the theatrical arts of singing and dancing All these levities Tiberius readily connived at in hopes that they might perhaps correct the roughness of his temper which the sagacious old man so well understood that he often said That Caius was destined to be the ruin of himself and all mankind and that he was rearing a hydra three hundred ninety two for the people of Rome and a Phaeton for all the world three hundred ninety three XII Not long afterwards he married Junia Claudilla the daughter of Marcus Silanus a man of the highest rank Being then chosen augur in the room of his brother Drusus before he could be inaugurated he was advanced to the pontificate with no small commendation of his dutiful behaviour and great capacity The situation of the court likewise was at this time favourable to his fortunes as it was now left destitute of support Sejanus being suspected and soon afterwards taken off and he was by degrees flattered with the hope of succeeding Tiberius in the empire In order more effectually to secure this object upon Junia s dying in child bed he engaged in a criminal commerce with Ennia Naevia the wife two hundred fifty eight of Macro at that time prefect of the pretorian cohorts promising to marry her if he became emperor to which he bound himself not only by an oath but by a written obligation under his hand Having by her means insinuated himself into Macro s favour some are of opinion that he attempted to poison Tiberius and ordered his ring to be taken from him before the breath was out of his body and that because he seemed to hold it fast he caused a pillow to be thrown upon him three hundred ninety four squeezing him by the throat at the same time with his own hand One of his freedmen crying out at this horrid barbarity he was immediately crucified These circumstances are far from being improbable as some authors relate that afterwards though he did not acknowledge his having a hand in the death of Tiberius yet he frankly declared that he had formerly entertained such a design and as a proof of his affection for his relations he would frequently boast That to revenge the death of his mother and brothers he had entered the chamber of Tiberius when he was asleep with a poniard but being seized with a fit of compassion threw it away and retired and that Tiberius though aware of his intention durst not make any inquiries or attempt revenge XIII Having thus secured the imperial power he fulfilled by his elevation the wish of the Roman people I may venture to say of all mankind for he had long been the object of expectation and desire to the greater part of the provincials and soldiers who had known him when a child and to the whole people of Rome from their affection for the memory of Germanicus his father and compassion for the family almost entirely destroyed Upon his moving from Misenum therefore although he was in mourning and following the corpse of Tiberius he had to walk amidst altars victims and lighted torches with prodigious crowds of people everywhere attending him in transports of joy and calling him besides other auspicious names by those of their star their chick their pretty puppet and bantling XIV Immediately on his entering the city by the joint acclamations of the senate and people who broke into the senate house Tiberius s will was set aside it having left his two hundred fifty nine other grandson three hundred ninety five then a minor coheir with him the whole government and administration of affairs was placed in his hands so much to the joy and satisfaction of the public that in less than three months after above a hundred and sixty thousand victims are said to have been offered in sacrifice Upon his going a few days afterwards to the nearest islands on the coast of Campania three hundred ninety six vows were made for his safe return every person emulously testifying their care and concern for his safety And when he fell ill the people hung about the Palatium all night long some vowed in public handbills to risk their lives in the combats of the amphitheatre and others to lay them down for his recovery To this extraordinary love entertained for him by his countrymen was added an uncommon regard by foreign nations Even Artabanus king of the Parthians who had always manifested hatred and contempt for Tiberius solicited his friendship came to hold a conference with his consular lieutenant and passing the Euphrates paid the highest honours to the eagles the Roman standards and the images of the Caesars three hundred ninety seven XV Caligula himself inflamed this devotion by practising all the arts of popularity After he had delivered with floods of tears a speech in praise of Tiberius and buried him with the utmost pomp he immediately hastened over to Pandataria and the Pontian islands three hundred ninety eight to bring thence the ashes of his mother and brother and to testify the great regard he had for their memory he performed the voyage in a very tempestuous season He approached their remains with profound veneration and deposited them in the urns with his own hands Having brought them in grand solemnity to Ostia three hundred ninety nine with an ensign flying in the stern of the galley and thence up the Tiber to Rome they were borne by persons of the first distinction in the equestrian order on two biers into the mausoleum four hundred two hundred sixty at noon day He appointed yearly offerings to be solemnly and publicly celebrated to their memory besides Circensian games to that of his mother and a chariot with her image to be included in the procession four hundred one The month of September he called Germanicus in honour of his father By a single decree of the senate he heaped upon his grandmother Antonia all the honours which had been ever conferred on the empress Livia His uncle Claudius who till then continued in the equestrian order he took for his colleague in the consulship He adopted his brother Tiberius four hundred two on the day he took upon him the manly habit and conferred upon him the title of Prince of the Youths As for his sisters he ordered these words to be added to the oaths of allegiance to himself Nor will I hold myself or my own children more dear than I do Caius and his sisters four hundred three and commanded all resolutions proposed by the consuls in the senate to be prefaced thus May what we are going to do prove fortunate and happy to Caius Caesar and his sisters With the like popularity he restored all those who had been condemned and banished and granted an act of indemnity against all impeachments and past offences To relieve the informers and witnesses against his mother and brothers from all apprehension he brought the records of their trials into the forum and there burnt them calling loudly on the gods to witness that he had not read or handled them A memorial which was offered him relative to his own security he would not receive declaring that he had done nothing to make any one his enemy and said at the same time he had no ears for informers XVI The Spintriae those panderers to unnatural lusts four hundred four he banished from the city being prevailed upon not to throw them two hundred sixty one into the sea as he had intended The writings of Titus Labienus Cordus Cremutius and Cassius Severus which had been suppressed by an act of the senate he permitted to be drawn from obscurity and universally read observing that it would be for his own advantage to have the transactions of former times delivered to posterity He published accounts of the proceedings of the government a practice which had been introduced by Augustus but discontinued by Tiberius four hundred five He granted the magistrates a full and free jurisdiction without any appeal to himself He made a very strict and exact review of the Roman knights but conducted it with moderation publicly depriving of his horse every knight who lay under the stigma of any thing base and dishonourable but passing over the names of those knights who were only guilty of venial faults in calling over the list of the order To lighten the labours of the judges he added a fifth class to the former four He attempted likewise to restore to the people their ancient right of voting in the choice of magistrates four hundred six He paid very honourably and without any dispute the legacies left by Tiberius in his will though it had been set aside as likewise those left by the will of Livia Augusta which Tiberius had annulled He remitted the hundredth penny due to the government in all auctions throughout Italy He made up to many their losses sustained by fire and when he restored their kingdoms to any princes he likewise allowed them all the arrears of the taxes and revenues which had accrued in the interval as in the case of Antiochus of Comagene where the confiscation would have amounted to a hundred millions of sesterces To prove to the world that he was ready to encourage good examples of every kind he gave to a freed woman eighty thousand sesterces for not discovering a crime committed by her patron though she had been put to exquisite torture for that purpose For all these acts of beneficence amongst other honours a golden shield was decreed to him which the colleges of priests were to carry annually upon a fixed day into the Capitol with the senate attending and the youth of the nobility of both sexes celebrating the praise of his virtues in two hundred sixty two songs It was likewise ordained that the day on which he succeeded to the empire should be called Palilia in token of the city s being at that time as it were new founded four hundred seven XVII He held the consulship four times the first four hundred eight from the calends the first of July for two months the second four hundred nine from the calends of January for thirty days the third four hundred ten until the ides the thirteenth of January and the fourth four hundred eleven until the seventh of the same ides seventh January Of these the two last he held successively The third he assumed by his sole authority at Lyons not as some are of opinion from arrogance or neglect of rules but because at that distance it was impossible for him to know that his colleague had died a little before the beginning of the new year He twice distributed to the people a bounty of three hundred sesterces a man and as often gave a splendid feast to the senate and the equestrian order with their wives and children In the latter he presented to the men forensic garments and to the women and children purple scarfs To make a perpetual addition to the public joy for ever he added to the Saturnalia four hundred twelve one day which he called Juvenalis the juvenile feast XVIII He exhibited some combats of gladiators either in the amphitheatre of Taurus four hundred thirteen or in the Septa with which he intermingled troops of the best pugilists from Campania and Africa He did not always preside in person upon those occasions but sometimes gave a commission to magistrates or friends to supply his place He frequently entertained the people with stage plays two hundred sixty three of various kinds and in several parts of the city and sometimes by night when he caused the whole city to be lighted He likewise gave various things to be scrambled for among the people and distributed to every man a basket of bread with other victuals Upon this occasion he sent his own share to a Roman knight who was seated opposite to him and was enjoying himself by eating heartily To a senator who was doing the same he sent an appointment of praetor extraordinary He likewise exhibited a great number of Circensian games from morning until night intermixed with the hunting of wild beasts from Africa or the Trojan exhibition Some of these games were celebrated with peculiar circumstances the Circus being overspread with vermilion and chrysolite and none drove in the chariot races who were not of the senatorian order For some of these he suddenly gave the signal when upon his viewing from the Gelotiana four hundred fourteen the preparations in the Circus he was asked to do so by a few persons in the neighbouring galleries XIX He invented besides a new kind of spectacle such as had never been heard of before For he made a bridge of about three miles and a half in length from Baiae to the mole of Puteoli four hundred fifteen collecting trading vessels from all quarters mooring them in two rows by their anchors and spreading earth upon them to form a viaduct after the fashion of the Appian Way four hundred sixteen This bridge he crossed and recrossed for two days together the first day mounted on a horse richly caparisoned wearing on his head a crown of oak leaves armed with a battle axe a Spanish buckler and a sword and in a cloak made of cloth of gold the day following in the habit of a charioteer standing in a chariot drawn by two high bred horses having with him a young boy Darius by name one of the Parthian hostages with a cohort of the pretorian guards attending him and a two hundred sixty four party of his friends in cars of Gaulish make four hundred seventeen Most people I know are of opinion that this bridge was designed by Caius in imitation of Xerxes who to the astonishment of the world laid a bridge over the Hellespont which is somewhat narrower than the distance betwixt Baiae and Puteoli Others however thought that he did it to strike terror in Germany and Britain which he was upon the point of invading by the fame of some prodigious work But for myself when I was a boy I heard my grandfather say four hundred eighteen that the reason assigned by some courtiers who were in habits of the greatest intimacy with him was this when Tiberius was in some anxiety about the nomination of a successor and rather inclined to pitch upon his grandson Thrasyllus the astrologer had assured him That Caius would no more be emperor than he would ride on horseback across the gulf of Baiae XX He likewise exhibited public diversions in Sicily Grecian games at Syracuse and Attic plays at Lyons in Gaul besides a contest for pre eminence in the Grecian and Roman eloquence in which we are told that such as were baffled bestowed rewards upon the best performers and were obliged to compose speeches in their praise but that those who performed the worst were forced to blot out what they had written with a sponge or their tongue unless they preferred to be beaten with a rod or plunged over head and ears into the nearest river XXI He completed the works which were left unfinished by Tiberius namely the temple of Augustus and the theatre two hundred sixty five of Pompey four hundred nineteen He began likewise the aqueduct from the neighbourhood of Tibur four hundred twenty and an amphitheatre near the Septa four hundred twenty one of which works one was completed by his successor Claudius and the other remained as he left it The walls of Syracuse which had fallen to decay by length of time he repaired as he likewise did the temples of the gods He formed plans for rebuilding the palace of Polycrates at Samos finishing the temple of the Didymaean Apollo at Miletus and building a town on a ridge of the Alps but above all for cutting through the isthmus in Achaia four hundred twenty two and even sent a centurion of the first rank to measure out the work XXII Thus far we have spoken of him as a prince What remains to be said of him bespeaks him rather a monster than a man He assumed a variety of titles such as Dutiful The two hundred sixty six Pious The Child of the Camp the Father of the Armies and The Greatest and Best Caesar Upon hearing some kings who came to the city to pay him court conversing together at supper about their illustrious descent he exclaimed Eis koiranos eto eis basileus Let there be but one prince one king He was strongly inclined to assume the diadem and change the form of government from imperial to regal but being told that he far exceeded the grandeur of kings and princes he began to arrogate to himself a divine majesty He ordered all the images of the gods which were famous either for their beauty or the veneration paid them among which was that of Jupiter Olympius to be brought from Greece that he might take the heads off and put on his own Having continued part of the Palatium as far as the Forum and the temple of Castor and Pollux being converted into a kind of vestibule to his house he often stationed himself between the twin brothers and so presented himself to be worshipped by all votaries some of whom saluted him by the name of Jupiter Latialis He also instituted a temple and priests with choicest victims in honour of his own divinity In his temple stood a statue of gold the exact image of himself which was daily dressed in garments corresponding with those he wore himself The most opulent persons in the city offered themselves as candidates for the honour of being his priests and purchased it successively at an immense price The victims were flamingos peacocks bustards guinea fowls turkey and pheasant hens each sacrificed on their respective days On nights when the moon was full he was in the constant habit of inviting her to his embraces and his bed In the day time he talked in private to Jupiter Capitolinus one while whispering to him and another turning his ear to him sometimes he spoke aloud and in railing language For he was overheard to threaten the god thus Hae em anaeir hae ego se four hundred twenty three Raise thou me up or I ll two hundred sixty seven until being at last prevailed upon by the entreaties of the god as he said to take up his abode with him he built a bridge over the temple of the Deified Augustus by which he joined the Palatium to the Capitol Afterwards that he might be still nearer he laid the foundations of a new palace in the very court of the Capitol XXIII He was unwilling to be thought or called the grandson of Agrippa because of the obscurity of his birth and he was offended if any one either in prose or verse ranked him amongst the Caesars He said that his mother was the fruit of an incestuous commerce maintained by Augustus with his daughter Julia And not content with this vile reflection upon the memory of Augustus he forbad his victories at Actium and on the coast of Sicily to be celebrated as usual affirming that they had been most pernicious and fatal to the Roman people He called his grandmother Livia Augusta Ulysses in a woman s dress and had the indecency to reflect upon her in a letter to the senate as of mean birth and descended by the mother s side from a grandfather who was only one of the municipal magistrates of Fondi whereas it is certain from the public records that Aufidius Lurco held high offices at Rome His grandmother Antonia desiring a private conference with him he refused to grant it unless Macro the prefect of the pretorian guards were present Indignities of this kind and ill usage were the cause of her death but some think he also gave her poison Nor did he pay the smallest respect to her memory after her death but witnessed the burning from his private apartment His brother Tiberius who had no expectation of any violence was suddenly dispatched by a military tribune sent by his order for that purpose He forced Silanus his father in law to kill himself by cutting his throat with a razor The pretext he alleged for these murders was that the latter had not followed him upon his putting to sea in stormy weather but stayed behind with the view of seizing the city if he should perish The other he said smelt of an antidote which he had taken to prevent his being poisoned by him whereas Silanus was only afraid of being sea sick and the disagreeableness of a voyage and Tiberius had merely taken a medicine for an habitual cough two hundred sixty eight which was continually growing worse As for his successor Claudius he only saved him for a laughing stock XXIV He lived in the habit of incest with all his sisters and at table when much company was present he placed each of them in turns below him whilst his wife reclined above him It is believed that he deflowered one of them Drusilla before he had assumed the robe of manhood and was even caught in her embraces by his grandmother Antonia with whom they were educated together When she was afterwards married to Cassius Longinus a man of consular rank he took her from him and kept her constantly as if she were his lawful wife In a fit of sickness he by his will appointed her heiress both of his estate and the empire After her death he ordered a public mourning for her during which it was capital for any person to laugh use the bath or sup with his parents wife or children Being inconsolable under his affliction he went hastily and in the night time from the City going through Campania to Syracuse and then suddenly returned without shaving his beard or trimming his hair Nor did he ever afterwards in matters of the greatest importance not even in the assemblies of the people or before the soldiers swear any otherwise than By the divinity of Drusilla The rest of his sisters he did not treat with so much fondness or regard but frequently prostituted them to his catamites He therefore the more readily condemned them in the case of Aemilius Lepidus as guilty of adultery and privy to that conspiracy against him Nor did he only divulge their own hand writing relative to the affair which he procured by base and lewd means but likewise consecrated to Mars the Avenger three swords which had been prepared to stab him with an inscription setting forth the occasion of their consecration XXV Whether in the marriage of his wives in repudiating them or retaining them he acted with greater infamy it is difficult to say Being at the wedding of Caius Piso with Livia Orestilla he ordered the bride to be carried to his own house but within a few days divorced her and two years after banished her because it was thought that upon her divorce she returned to the embraces of her former husband two hundred sixty nine Some say that being invited to the wedding supper he sent a messenger to Piso who sat opposite to him in these words Do not be too fond with my wife and that he immediately carried her off Next day he published a proclamation importing That he had got a wife as Romulus and Augustus had done four hundred twenty four Lollia Paulina who was married to a man of consular rank in command of an army he suddenly called from the province where she was with her husband upon mention being made that her grandmother was formerly very beautiful and married her but he soon afterwards parted with her interdicting her from having ever afterwards any commerce with man He loved with a most passionate and constant affection Caesonia who was neither handsome nor young and was besides the mother of three daughters by another man but a wanton of unbounded lasciviousness Her he would frequently exhibit to the soldiers dressed in a military cloak with shield and helmet and riding by his side To his friends he even showed her naked After she had a child he honoured her with the title of wife in one and the same day declaring himself her husband and father of the child of which she was delivered He named it Julia Drusilla and carrying it round the temples of all the goddesses laid it on the lap of Minerva to whom he recommended the care of bringing up and instructing her He considered her as his own child for no better reason than her savage temper which was such even in her infancy that she would attack with her nails the face and eyes of the children at play with her XXVI It would be of little importance as well as disgusting to add to all this an account of the manner in which he treated his relations and friends as Ptolemy king Juba s son his cousin for he was the grandson of Mark Antony by his daughter Selene four hundred twenty five and especially Macro himself and Ennia likewise four hundred twenty six by whose assistance he had obtained the empire all of whom for their alliance and eminent services he rewarded with violent deaths Nor was he more mild or respectful in his behaviour towards the senate Some who had borne the two hundred seventy highest offices in the government he suffered to run by his litter in their togas for several miles together and to attend him at supper sometimes at the head of his couch sometimes at his feet with napkins Others of them after he had privately put them to death he nevertheless continued to send for as if they were still alive and after a few days pretended that they had laid violent hands upon themselves The consuls having forgotten to give public notice of his birth day he displaced them and the republic was three days without any one in that high office A quaestor who was said to be concerned in a conspiracy against him he scourged severely having first stripped off his clothes and spread them under the feet of the soldiers employed in the work that they might stand the more firm The other orders likewise he treated with the same insolence and violence Being disturbed by the noise of people taking their places at midnight in the circus as they were to have free admission he drove them all away with clubs In this tumult above twenty Roman knights were squeezed to death with as many matrons with a great crowd besides When stage plays were acted to occasion disputes between the people and the knights he distributed the money tickets sooner than usual that the seats assigned to the knights might be all occupied by the mob In the spectacles of gladiators sometimes when the sun was violently hot he would order the curtains which covered the amphitheatre to be drawn aside four hundred twenty seven and forbad any person to be let out withdrawing at the same time the usual apparatus for the entertainment and presenting wild beasts almost pined to death the most sorry gladiators decrepit with age and fit only to work the machinery and decent house keepers who were remarkable for some bodily infirmity Sometimes shutting up the public granaries he would oblige the people to starve for a while XXVII He evinced the savage barbarity of his temper chiefly by the following indications When flesh was only to be had at a high price for feeding his wild beasts reserved for the spectacles he ordered that criminals should be given them two hundred seventy one to be devoured and upon inspecting them in a row while he stood in the middle of the portico without troubling himself to examine their cases he ordered them to be dragged away from bald pate to bald pate four hundred twenty eight Of one person who had made a vow for his recovery to combat with a gladiator he exacted its performance nor would he allow him to desist until he came off conqueror and after many entreaties Another who had vowed to give his life for the same cause having shrunk from the sacrifice he delivered adorned as a victim with garlands and fillets to boys who were to drive him through the streets calling on him to fulfil his vow until he was thrown headlong from the ramparts After disfiguring many persons of honourable rank by branding them in the face with hot irons he condemned them to the mines to work in repairing the high ways or to fight with wild beasts or tying them by the neck and heels in the manner of beasts carried to slaughter would shut them up in cages or saw them asunder Nor were these severities merely inflicted for crimes of great enormity but for making remarks on his public games or for not having sworn by the Genius of the emperor He compelled parents to be present at the execution of their sons and to one who excused himself on account of indisposition he sent his own litter Another he invited to his table immediately after he had witnessed the spectacle and coolly challenged him to jest and be merry He ordered the overseer of the spectacles and wild beasts to be scourged in fetters during several days successively in his own presence and did not put him to death until he was disgusted with the stench of his putrefied brain He burned alive in the centre of the arena of the amphitheatre the writer of a farce for some witty verse which had a double meaning A Roman knight who had been exposed to the wild beasts crying out that he was innocent he called him back and having had his tongue cut out remanded him to the arena XXVIII Asking a certain person whom he recalled after a long exile how he used to spend his time he replied with flattery I was always praying the gods for what has happened that Tiberius might die and you be emperor Concluding therefore that those he had himself banished also two hundred seventy two prayed for his death he sent orders round the islands four hundred twenty nine to have them all put to death Being very desirous to have a senator torn to pieces he employed some persons to call him a public enemy fall upon him as he entered the senate house stab him with their styles and deliver him to the rest to tear asunder Nor was he satisfied until he saw the limbs and bowels of the man after they had been dragged through the streets piled up in a heap before him XXIX He aggravated his barbarous actions by language equally outrageous There is nothing in my nature said he that I commend or approve so much as my adiatrepsia inflexible rigour Upon his grandmother Antonia s giving him some advice as if it was a small matter to pay no regard to it he said to her Remember that all things are lawful for me When about to murder his brother whom he suspected of taking antidotes against poison he said See then an antidote against Caesar And when he banished his sisters he told them in a menacing tone that he had not only islands at command but likewise swords One of pretorian rank having sent several times from Anticyra four hundred thirty whither he had gone for his health to have his leave of absence prolonged he ordered him to be put to death adding these words Bleeding is necessary for one that has taken hellebore so long and found no benefit It was his custom every tenth day to sign the lists of prisoners appointed for execution and this he called clearing his accounts And having condemned several Gauls and Greeks at one time he exclaimed in triumph I have conquered Gallograecia four hundred thirty one XXX He generally prolonged the sufferings of his victims by causing them to be inflicted by slight and frequently repeated strokes this being his well known and constant order two hundred seventy three Strike so that he may feel himself die Having punished one person for another by mistaking his name he said he deserved it quite as much He had frequently in his mouth these words of the tragedian Oderint dum metuant four hundred thirty two I scorn their hatred if they do but fear me He would often inveigh against all the senators without exception as clients of Sejanus and informers against his mother and brothers producing the memorials which he had pretended to burn and excusing the cruelty of Tiberius as necessary since it was impossible to question the veracity of such a number of accusers four hundred thirty three He continually reproached the whole equestrian order as devoting themselves to nothing but acting on the stage and fighting as gladiators Being incensed at the people s applauding a party at the Circensian games in opposition to him he exclaimed I wish the Roman people had but one neck four hundred thirty four When Tetrinius the highwayman was denounced he said his persecutors too were all Tetrinius s Five Retiarii four hundred thirty five in tunics fighting in a company yielded without a struggle to the same number of opponents and being ordered to be slain one of them taking up his lance again killed all the conquerors This he lamented in a proclamation as a most cruel butchery and cursed all those who had borne the sight of it XXXI He used also to complain aloud of the state of the times because it was not rendered remarkable by any public two hundred seventy four calamities for while the reign of Augustus had been made memorable to posterity by the disaster of Varus four hundred thirty six and that of Tiberius by the fall of the theatre at Fidenae four hundred thirty seven his was likely to pass into oblivion from an uninterrupted series of prosperity And at times he wished for some terrible slaughter of his troops a famine a pestilence conflagrations or an earthquake XXXII Even in the midst of his diversions while gaming or feasting this savage ferocity both in his language and actions never forsook him Persons were often put to the torture in his presence whilst he was dining or carousing A soldier who was an adept in the art of beheading used at such times to take off the heads of prisoners who were brought in for that purpose At Puteoli at the dedication of the bridge which he planned as already mentioned four hundred thirty eight he invited a number of people to come to him from the shore and then suddenly threw them headlong into the sea thrusting down with poles and oars those who to save themselves had got hold of the rudders of the ships At Rome in a public feast a slave having stolen some thin plates of silver with which the couches were inlaid he delivered him immediately to an executioner with orders to cut off his hands and lead him round the guests with them hanging from his neck before his breast and a label signifying the cause of his punishment A gladiator who was practising with him and voluntarily threw himself at his feet he stabbed with a poniard and then ran about with a palm branch in his hand after the manner of those who are victorious in the games When a victim was to be offered upon an altar he clad in the habit of the Popae four hundred thirty nine and holding the axe aloft for a while at last instead of the animal slaughtered an officer who attended to cut up the sacrifice And at a sumptuous entertainment he fell suddenly into a violent fit of laughter and upon the consuls who reclined next to him respectfully asking him the occasion Nothing replied he but that upon a single nod of mine you might both have your throats cut two hundred seventy five XXXIII Among many other jests this was one As he stood by the statue of Jupiter he asked Apelles the tragedian which of them he thought was biggest Upon his demurring about it he lashed him most severely now and then commending his voice whilst he entreated for mercy as being well modulated even when he was venting his grief As often as he kissed the neck of his wife or mistress he would say So beautiful a throat must be cut whenever I please and now and then he would threaten to put his dear Caesonia to the torture that he might discover why he loved her so passionately XXXIV In his behaviour towards men of almost all ages he discovered a degree of jealousy and malignity equal to that of his cruelty and pride He so demolished and dispersed the statues of several illustrious persons which had been removed by Augustus for want of room from the court of the Capitol into the Campus Martius that it was impossible to set them up again with their inscriptions entire And for the future he forbad any statue whatever to be erected without his knowledge and leave He had thoughts too of suppressing Homer s poems For why said he may not I do what Plato has done before me who excluded him from his commonwealth four hundred forty He was likewise very near banishing the writings and the busts of Virgil and Livy from all libraries censuring one of them as a man of no genius and very little learning and the other as a verbose and careless historian He often talked of the lawyers as if he intended to abolish their profession By Hercules he would say I shall put it out of their power to answer any questions in law otherwise than by referring to me XXXV He took from the noblest persons in the city the ancient marks of distinction used by their families as the collar from Torquatus four hundred forty one from Cincinnatus the curl of two hundred seventy six hair four hundred forty two and from Cneius Pompey the surname of Great belonging to that ancient family Ptolemy mentioned before whom he invited from his kingdom and received with great honours he suddenly put to death for no other reason but because he observed that upon entering the theatre at a public exhibition he attracted the eyes of all the spectators by the splendour of his purple robe As often as he met with handsome men who had fine heads of hair he would order the back of their heads to be shaved to make them appear ridiculous There was one Esius Proculus the son of a centurion of the first rank who for his great stature and fine proportions was called the Colossal Him he ordered to be dragged from his seat in the arena and matched with a gladiator in light armour and afterwards with another completely armed and upon his worsting them both commanded him forthwith to be bound to be led clothed in rags up and down the streets of the city and after being exhibited in that plight to the women to be then butchered There was no man of so abject or mean condition whose excellency in any kind he did not envy The Rex Nemorensis four hundred forty three having many years enjoyed the honour of the priesthood he procured a still stronger antagonist to oppose him One Porius who fought in a chariot four hundred forty four having been victorious in an exhibition and in his joy given freedom to a slave was applauded so vehemently that Caligula rose in such haste from his seat that treading upon the hem of his toga he tumbled down the steps full of indignation two hundred seventy seven and crying out A people who are masters of the world pay greater respect to a gladiator for a trifle than to princes admitted amongst the gods or to my own majesty here present amongst them XXXVI He never had the least regard either to the chastity of his own person or that of others He is said to have been inflamed with an unnatural passion for Marcus Lepidus Mnester an actor in pantomimes and for certain hostages and to have engaged with them in the practice of mutual pollution Valerius Catullus a young man of a consular family bawled aloud in public that he had been exhausted by him in that abominable act Besides his incest with his sisters and his notorious passion for Pyrallis the prostitute there was hardly any lady of distinction with whom he did not make free He used commonly to invite them with their husbands to supper and as they passed by the couch on which he reclined at table examine them very closely like those who traffic in slaves and if any one from modesty held down her face he raised it up with his hand Afterwards as often as he was in the humour he would quit the room send for her he liked best and in a short time return with marks of recent disorder about them He would then commend or disparage her in the presence of the company recounting the charms or defects of her person and behaviour in private To some he sent a divorce in the name of their absent husbands and ordered it to be registered in the public acts XXXVII In the devices of his profuse expenditure he surpassed all the prodigals that ever lived inventing a new kind of bath with strange dishes and suppers washing in precious unguents both warm and cold drinking pearls of immense value dissolved in vinegar and serving up for his guests loaves and other victuals modelled in gold often saying that a man ought either to be a good economist or an emperor Besides he scattered money to a prodigious amount among the people from the top of the Julian Basilica four hundred forty five during several days successively He built two ships with ten banks of oars after the Liburnian fashion the poops of which blazed with jewels and the sails were of various parti colours They were fitted up with ample baths galleries and saloons and supplied with a great variety of vines and other fruit trees In these he would sail in the day time along the coast of Campania feasting two hundred seventy eight amidst dancing and concerts of music In building his palaces and villas there was nothing he desired to effect so much in defiance of all reason as what was considered impossible Accordingly moles were formed in the deep and adverse sea four hundred forty six rocks of the hardest stone cut away plains raised to the height of mountains with a vast mass of earth and the tops of mountains levelled by digging and all these were to be executed with incredible speed for the least remissness was a capital offence Not to mention particulars he spent enormous sums and the whole treasures which had been amassed by Tiberius Caesar amounting to two thousand seven hundred millions of sesterces within less than a year XXXVIII Having therefore quite exhausted these funds and being in want of money he had recourse to plundering the people by every mode of false accusation confiscation and taxation that could be invented He declared that no one had any right to the freedom of Rome although their ancestors had acquired it for themselves and their posterity unless they were sons for that none beyond that degree ought to be considered as posterity When the grants of the Divine Julius and Augustus were produced to him he only said that he was very sorry they were obsolete and out of date He also charged all those with making false returns who after the taking of the census had by any means whatever increased their property He annulled the wills of all who had been centurions of the first rank as testimonies of their base ingratitude if from the beginning of Tiberius s reign they had not left either that prince or himself their heir He also set aside the wills of all others if any person only pretended to say that they designed at their death to leave Caesar their heir The public becoming terrified at this proceeding he was now appointed joint heir with their friends and in the case of parents with their children by persons unknown to him Those who lived any considerable time after making such a will he said were only making game of him and accordingly he sent many of them poisoned cakes He used to try such causes himself fixing previously the sum he proposed to raise during the sitting and after he had secured it quitting the tribunal Impatient of the least delay he condemned by a single sentence forty two hundred seventy nine persons against whom there were different charges boasting to Caesonia when she awoke how much business he had dispatched while she was taking her mid day sleep He exposed to sale by auction the remains of the apparatus used in the public spectacles and exacted such biddings and raised the prices so high that some of the purchasers were ruined and bled themselves to death There is a well known story told of Aponius Saturninus who happening to fall asleep as he sat on a bench at the sale Caius called out to the auctioneer not to overlook the praetorian personage who nodded to him so often and accordingly the salesman went on pretending to take the nods for tokens of assent until thirteen gladiators were knocked down to him at the sum of nine millions of sesterces four hundred forty seven he being in total ignorance of what was doing XXXIX Having also sold in Gaul all the clothes furniture slaves and even freedmen belonging to his sisters at prodigious prices after their condemnation he was so much delighted with his gains that he sent to Rome for all the furniture of the old palace four hundred forty eight pressing for its conveyance all the carriages let to hire in the city with the horses and mules belonging to the bakers so that they often wanted bread at Rome and many who had suits at law in progress lost their causes because they could not make their appearance in due time according to their recognizances In the sale of this furniture every artifice of fraud and imposition was employed Sometimes he would rail at the bidders for being niggardly and ask them if they were not ashamed to be richer than he was at another he would affect to be sorry that the property of princes should be passing into the hands of private persons He had found out that a rich provincial had given two hundred thousand sesterces to his chamberlains for an underhand invitation to his table and he was much pleased to find that honour valued at so high a rate The day following as the same person was sitting at the sale he sent him some bauble for which he told him he must pay two hundred thousand sesterces and that he should sup with Caesar upon his own invitation two hundred eighty XL He levied new taxes and such as were never before known at first by the publicans but afterwards because their profit was enormous by centurions and tribunes of the pretorian guards no description of property or persons being exempted from some kind of tax or other For all eatables brought into the city a certain excise was exacted for all law suits or trials in whatever court the fortieth part of the sum in dispute and such as were convicted of compromising litigations were made liable to a penalty Out of the daily wages of the porters he received an eighth and from the gains of common prostitutes what they received for one favour granted There was a clause in the law that all bawds who kept women for prostitution or sale should be liable to pay and that marriage itself should not be exempted XLI These taxes being imposed but the act by which they were levied never submitted to public inspection great grievances were experienced from the want of sufficient knowledge of the law At length on the urgent demands of the Roman people he published the law but it was written in a very small hand and posted up in a corner so that no one could make a copy of it To leave no sort of gain untried he opened brothels in the Palatium with a number of cells furnished suitably to the dignity of the place in which married women and free born youths were ready for the reception of visitors He sent likewise his nomenclators about the forums and courts to invite people of all ages the old as well as the young to his brothel to come and satisfy their lusts and he was ready to lend his customers money upon interest clerks attending to take down their names in public as persons who contributed to the emperor s revenue Another method of raising money which he thought not below his notice was gaming which by the help of lying and perjury he turned to considerable account Leaving once the management of his play to his partner in the game he stepped into the court and observing two rich Roman knights passing by he ordered them immediately to be seized and their estates confiscated Then returning in great glee he boasted that he had never made a better throw in his life XLII After the birth of his daughter complaining of his two hundred eighty one poverty and the burdens to which he was subjected not only as an emperor but a father he made a general collection for her maintenance and fortune He likewise gave public notice that he would receive new year s gifts on the calends of January following and accordingly stood in the vestibule of his house to clutch the presents which people of all ranks threw down before him by handfuls and lapfuls At last being seized with an invincible desire of feeling money taking off his slippers he repeatedly walked over great heaps of gold coin spread upon the spacious floor and then laying himself down rolled his whole body in gold over and over again XLIII Only once in his life did he take an active part in military affairs and then not from any set purpose but during his journey to Mevania to see the grove and river of Clitumnus four hundred forty nine Being recommended to recruit a body of Batavians who attended him he resolved upon an expedition into Germany Immediately he drew together several legions and auxiliary forces from all quarters and made every where new levies with the utmost rigour Collecting supplies of all kinds such as never had been assembled upon the like occasion he set forward on his march and pursued it sometimes with so much haste and precipitation that the pretorian cohorts were obliged contrary to custom to pack their standards on horses or mules and so follow him At other times he would march so slow and luxuriously that he was carried in a litter by eight men ordering the roads to be swept by the people of the neighbouring towns and sprinkled with water to lay the dust XLIV On arriving at the camp in order to show himself an active general and severe disciplinarian he cashiered the lieutenants who came up late with the auxiliary forces from different quarters In reviewing the army he deprived of their companies most of the centurions of the first rank who had now served their legal time in the wars and some whose time would have expired in a few days alleging against them their age and infirmity and railing at the covetous disposition two hundred eighty two of the rest of them he reduced the bounty due to those who had served out their time to the sum of six thousand sesterces Though he only received the submission of Adminius the son of Cunobeline a British king who being driven from his native country by his father came over to him with a small body of troops four hundred fifty yet as if the whole island had been surrendered to him he dispatched magnificent letters to Rome ordering the bearers to proceed in their carriages directly up to the forum and the senate house and not to deliver the letters but to the consuls in the temple of Mars and in the presence of a full assembly of the senators XLV Soon after this there being no hostilities he ordered a few Germans of his guard to be carried over and placed in concealment on the other side of the Rhine and word to be brought him after dinner that an enemy was advancing with great impetuosity This being accordingly done he immediately threw himself with his friends and a party of the pretorian knights into the adjoining wood where lopping branches from the trees and forming trophies of them he returned by torch light upbraiding those who did not follow him with timorousness and cowardice but he presented the companions and sharers of his victory with crowns of a new form and under a new name having the sun moon and stars represented on them and which he called Exploratoriae Again some hostages were by his order taken from the school and privately sent off upon notice of which he immediately rose from table pursued them with the cavalry as if they had run away and coming up with them brought them back in fetters proceeding to an extravagant pitch of ostentation likewise in this military comedy Upon his again sitting down to table it being reported to him that the troops were all reassembled he ordered them to sit down as they were in their armour animating them in the words of that well known verse of Virgil two hundred eighty three Durate et vosmet rebus servate secundis Aen one Bear up and save yourselves for better days In the mean time he reprimanded the senate and people of Rome in a very severe proclamation For revelling and frequenting the diversions of the circus and theatre and enjoying themselves at their villas whilst their emperor was fighting and exposing himself to the greatest dangers XLVI At last as if resolved to make war in earnest he drew up his army upon the shore of the ocean with his balistae and other engines of war and while no one could imagine what he intended to do on a sudden commanded them to gather up the sea shells and fill their helmets and the folds of their dress with them calling them the spoils of the ocean due to the Capitol and the Palatium As a monument of his success he raised a lofty tower upon which as at Pharos four hundred fifty one he ordered lights to be burnt in the night time for the direction of ships at sea and then promising the soldiers a donative of a hundred denarii four hundred fifty two a man as if he had surpassed the most eminent examples of generosity Go your ways said he and be merry go ye are rich XLVII In making preparations for his triumph besides the prisoners and deserters from the barbarian armies he picked out the men of greatest stature in all Gaul such as he said were fittest to grace a triumph with some of the chiefs and reserved them to appear in the procession obliging them not only to dye their hair yellow and let it grow long but to learn the German language and assume the names commonly used in that country He ordered likewise the gallies in which he had entered the ocean to be conveyed to Rome a great part of the way by land and wrote to his comptrollers in the city to make proper preparations for a triumph against two hundred eighty four his arrival at as small expense as possible but on a scale such as had never been seen before since they had full power over the property of every one XLVIII Before he left the province he formed a design of the most horrid cruelty to massacre the legions which had mutinied upon the death of Augustus for seizing and detaining by force his father Germanicus their commander and himself then an infant in the camp Though he was with great difficulty dissuaded from this rash attempt yet neither the most urgent entreaties nor representations could prevent him from persisting in the design of decimating these legions Accordingly he ordered them to assemble unarmed without so much as their swords and then surrounded them with armed horse But finding that many of them suspecting that violence was intended were making off to arm in their own defence he quitted the assembly as fast as he could and immediately marched for Rome bending now all his fury against the senate whom he publicly threatened to divert the general attention from the clamour excited by his disgraceful conduct Amongst other pretexts of offence he complained that he was defrauded of a triumph which was justly his due though he had just before forbidden upon pain of death any honour to be decreed him XLIX In his march he was waited upon by deputies from the senatorian order entreating him to hasten his return He replied to them I will come I will come and this with me striking at the same time the hilt of his sword He issued likewise this proclamation I am coming but for those only who wish for me the equestrian order and the people for I shall no longer treat the senate as their fellow citizen or prince He forbad any of the senators to come to meet him and either abandoning or deferring his triumph he entered the city in ovation on his birthday Within four months from this period he was slain after he had perpetrated enormous crimes and while he was meditating the execution if possible of still greater He had entertained a design of removing to Antium and afterwards to Alexandria having first cut off the flower of the equestrian and senatorian orders This is placed beyond all question by two books which were found in his cabinet two hundred eighty five under different titles one being called the sword and the other the dagger They both contained private marks and the names of those who were devoted to death There was also found a large chest filled with a variety of poisons which being afterwards thrown into the sea by order of Claudius are said to have so infected the waters that the fish were poisoned and cast dead by the tide upon the neighbouring shores L He was tall of a pale complexion ill shaped his neck and legs very slender his eyes and temples hollow his brows broad and knit his hair thin and the crown of the head bald The other parts of his body were much covered with hair On this account it was reckoned a capital crime for any person to look down from above as he was passing by or so much as to name a goat His countenance which was naturally hideous and frightful he purposely rendered more so forming it before a mirror into the most horrible contortions He was crazy both in body and mind being subject when a boy to the falling sickness When he arrived at the age of manhood he endured fatigue tolerably well but still occasionally he was liable to a faintness during which he remained incapable of any effort He was not insensible of the disorder of his mind and sometimes had thoughts of retiring to clear his brain four hundred fifty three It is believed that his wife Caesonia administered to him a love potion which threw him into a frenzy What most of all disordered him was want of sleep for he seldom had more than three or four hours rest in a night and even then his sleep was not sound but disturbed by strange dreams fancying among other things that a form representing the ocean spoke to him Being therefore often weary with lying awake so long sometimes he sat up in his bed at others walked in the longest porticos about the house and from time to time invoked and looked out for the approach of day LI To this crazy constitution of his mind may I think very justly be ascribed two faults which he had of a nature directly repugnant one to the other namely an excessive confidence and the most abject timidity For he who affected so two hundred eighty six much to despise the gods was ready to shut his eyes and wrap up his head in his cloak at the slightest storm of thunder and lightning and if it was violent he got up and hid himself under his bed In his visit to Sicily after ridiculing many strange objects which that country affords he ran away suddenly in the night from Messini terrified by the smoke and rumbling at the summit of Mount Aetna And though in words he was very valiant against the barbarians yet upon passing a narrow defile in Germany in his light car surrounded by a strong body of his troops some one happening to say There would be no small consternation amongst us if an enemy were to appear he immediately mounted his horse and rode towards the bridges in great haste but finding them blocked up with camp followers and baggage waggons he was in such a hurry that he caused himself to be carried in men s hands over the heads of the crowd Soon afterwards upon hearing that the Germans were again in rebellion he prepared to quit Rome and equipped a fleet comforting himself with this consideration that if the enemy should prove victorious and possess themselves of the heights of the Alps as the Cimbri four hundred fifty four had done or of the city as the Senones four hundred fifty five formerly did he should still have in reserve the transmarine provinces four hundred fifty six Hence it was I suppose that it occurred to his assassins to invent the story intended to pacify the troops who mutinied at his death that he had laid violent hands upon himself in a fit of terror occasioned by the news brought him of the defeat of his army LII In the fashion of his clothes shoes and all the rest of his dress he did not wear what was either national or properly civic or peculiar to the male sex or appropriate to mere mortals He often appeared abroad in a short coat of stout cloth richly embroidered and blazing with jewels in a tunic with sleeves and with bracelets upon his arms sometimes all in silks and two hundred eighty seven habited like a woman at other times in the crepidae or buskins sometimes in the sort of shoes used by the light armed soldiers or in the sock used by women and commonly with a golden beard fixed to his chin holding in his hand a thunderbolt a trident or a caduceus marks of distinction belonging to the gods only Sometimes too he appeared in the habit of Venus He wore very commonly the triumphal ornaments even before his expedition and sometimes the breast plate of Alexander the Great taken out of his coffin four hundred fifty seven LIII With regard to the liberal sciences he was little conversant in philology but applied himself with assiduity to the study of eloquence being indeed in point of enunciation tolerably elegant and ready and in his perorations when he was moved to anger there was an abundant flow of words and periods In speaking his action was vehement and his voice so strong that he was heard at a great distance When winding up an harangue he threatened to draw the sword of his lucubration holding a loose and smooth style in such contempt that he said Seneca who was then much admired wrote only detached essays and that his language was nothing but sand without lime He often wrote answers to the speeches of successful orators and employed himself in composing accusations or vindications of eminent persons who were impeached before the senate and gave his vote for or against the party accused according to his success in speaking inviting the equestrian order by proclamation to hear him LIV He also zealously applied himself to the practice of several other arts of different kinds such as fencing charioteering singing and dancing In the first of these he practised with the weapons used in war and drove the chariot in circuses built in several places He was so extremely fond of singing and dancing that he could not refrain in the theatre from singing with the tragedians and imitating the gestures of the actors either by way of applause or correction A night exhibition which he had ordered the day he was slain was thought to be intended for no other reason than to take the opportunity afforded by the licentiousness of the season to make his first appearance upon the stage Sometimes also two hundred eighty eight he danced in the night Summoning once to the Palatium in the second watch of the night four hundred fifty eight three men of consular rank who feared the words from the message he placed them on the proscenium of the stage and then suddenly came bursting out with a loud noise of flutes and castanets four hundred fifty nine dressed in a mantle and tunic reaching down to his heels Having danced out a song he retired Yet he who had acquired such dexterity in other exercises never learnt to swim LV Those for whom he once conceived a regard he favoured even to madness He used to kiss Mnester the pantomimic actor publicly in the theatre and if any person made the least noise while he was dancing he would order him to be dragged from his seat and scourged him with his own hand A Roman knight once making some bustle he sent him by a centurion an order to depart forthwith for Ostia four hundred sixty and carry a letter from him to king Ptolemy in Mauritania The letter was comprised in these words Do neither good nor harm to the bearer He made some gladiators captains of his German guards He deprived the gladiators called Mirmillones of some of their arms One Columbus coming off with victory in a combat but being slightly wounded he ordered some poison to be infused in the wound which he thence called Columbinum For thus it was certainly named with his own hand in a list of other poisons He was so extravagantly fond of the party of charioteers whose colours were green four hundred sixty one that he supped and lodged for some time constantly in the stable where their horses were kept At a certain revel he made a present of two millions of sesterces to one Cythicus a driver of a chariot The day before the Circensian games he used to send his soldiers to enjoin silence in the two hundred eighty nine neighbourhood that the repose of his horse Incitatus four hundred sixty two might not be disturbed For this favourite animal besides a marble stable an ivory manger purple housings and a jewelled frontlet he appointed a house with a retinue of slaves and fine furniture for the reception of such as were invited in the horse s name to sup with him It is even said that he intended to make him consul LVI In this frantic and savage career numbers had formed designs for cutting him off but one or two conspiracies being discovered and others postponed for want of opportunity at last two men concerted a plan together and accomplished their purpose not without the privity of some of the greatest favourites amongst his freedmen and the prefects of the pretorian guards because having been named though falsely as concerned in one conspiracy against him they perceived that they were suspected and become objects of his hatred For he had immediately endeavoured to render them obnoxious to the soldiery drawing his sword and declaring That he would kill himself if they thought him worthy of death and ever after he was continually accusing them to one another and setting them all mutually at variance The conspirators having resolved to fall upon him as he returned at noon from the Palatine games Cassius Chaerea tribune of the pretorian guards claimed the part of making the onset This Chaerea was now an elderly man and had been often reproached by Caius for effeminacy When he came for the watchword the latter would give Priapus or Venus and if on any occasion he returned thanks would offer him his hand to kiss making with his fingers an obscene gesture LVII His approaching fate was indicated by many prodigies The statue of Jupiter at Olympia which he had ordered to be taken down and brought to Rome suddenly burst out into such a violent fit of laughter that the machines employed in the work giving way the workmen took to their heels When this accident happened there came up a man named Cassius who said that he was commanded in a dream to sacrifice a bull to Jupiter The Capitol at Capua was two hundred ninety struck with lightning upon the ides of March fifteenth March as was also at Rome the apartment of the chief porter of the Palatium Some construed the latter into a presage that the master of the place was in danger from his own guards and the other they regarded as a sign that an illustrious person would be cut off as had happened before on that day Sylla the astrologer being consulted by him respecting his nativity assured him That death would unavoidably and speedily befall him The oracle of Fortune at Antium likewise forewarned him of Cassius on which account he had given orders for putting to death Cassius Longinus at that time proconsul of Asia not considering that Chaerea bore also that name The day preceding his death he dreamt that he was standing in heaven near the throne of Jupiter who giving him a push with the great toe of his right foot he fell headlong upon the earth Some things which happened the very day of his death and only a little before it were likewise considered as ominous presages of that event Whilst he was at sacrifice he was bespattered with the blood of a flamingo And Mnester the pantomimic actor performed in a play which the tragedian Neoptolemus had formerly acted at the games in which Philip the king of Macedon was slain And in the piece called Laureolus in which the principal actor running out in a hurry and falling vomited blood several of the inferior actors vying with each other to give the best specimen of their art made the whole stage flow with blood A spectacle had been purposed to be performed that night in which the fables of the infernal regions were to be represented by Egyptians and Ethiopians LVIII On the ninth of the calends of February twenty fourth January and about the seventh hour of the day after hesitating whether he should rise to dinner as his stomach was disordered by what he had eaten the day before at last by the advice of his friends he came forth In the vaulted passage through which he had to pass were some boys of noble extraction who had been brought from Asia to act upon the stage waiting for him in a private corridor and he stopped to see and speak to them and had not the leader of the party said that he was suffering from cold he would have gone back and made them act immediately Respecting what followed two hundred ninety one two different accounts are given Some say that whilst he was speaking to the boys Chaerea came behind him and gave him a heavy blow on the neck with his sword first crying out Take this that then a tribune by name Cornelius Sabinus another of the conspirators ran him through the breast Others say that the crowd being kept at a distance by some centurions who were in the plot Sabinus came according to custom for the word and that Caius gave him Jupiter upon which Chaerea cried out Be it so and then on his looking round clove one of his jaws with a blow As he lay on the ground crying out that he was still alive four hundred sixty three the rest dispatched him with thirty wounds For the word agreed upon among them all was Strike again Some likewise ran their swords through his privy parts Upon the first bustle the litter bearers came running in with their poles to his assistance and immediately afterwards his German body guards who killed some of the assassins and also some senators who had no concern in the affair LIX He lived twenty nine years and reigned three years ten months and eight days His body was carried privately into the Lamian Gardens four hundred sixty four where it was half burnt upon a pile hastily raised and then had some earth carelessly thrown over it It was afterwards disinterred by his sisters on their return from banishment burnt to ashes and buried Before this was done it is well known that the keepers of the gardens were greatly disturbed by apparitions and that not a night passed without some terrible alarm or other in the house where he was slain until it was destroyed by fire His wife Caesonia was killed with him being stabbed by a centurion and his daughter had her brains knocked out against a wall LX Of the miserable condition of those times any person two hundred ninety two may easily form an estimate from the following circumstances When his death was made public it was not immediately credited People entertained a suspicion that a report of his being killed had been contrived and spread by himself with the view of discovering how they stood affected towards him Nor had the conspirators fixed upon any one to succeed him The senators were so unanimous in their resolution to assert the liberty of their country that the consuls assembled them at first not in the usual place of meeting because it was named after Julius Caesar but in the Capitol Some proposed to abolish the memory of the Caesars and level their temples with the ground It was particularly remarked on this occasion that all the Caesars who had the praenomen of Caius died by the sword from the Caius Caesar who was slain in the times of Cinna Unfortunately a great chasm in the Annals of Tacitus at this period precludes all information from that historian respecting the reign of Caligula but from what he mentions towards the close of the preceding chapter it is evident that Caligula was forward to seize the reins of government upon the death of Tiberius whom though he rivalled him in his vices he was far from imitating in his dissimulation Amongst the people the remembrance of Germanicus virtues cherished for his family an attachment which was probably increased by its misfortunes and they were anxious to see revived in the son the popularity of the father Considering however that Caligula s vicious disposition was already known and that it had even been an inducement with Tiberius to procure his succession in order that it might prove a foil to his own memory it is surprising that no effort was made at this juncture to shake off the despotism which had been so intolerable in the last reign and restore the ancient liberty of the republic Since the commencement of the imperial dominion there never had been any period so favourable for a counter revolution as the present crisis There existed now no Livia to influence the minds of the senate and people in respect of the government nor was there any other person allied to the family of Germanicus whose countenance or intrigues could promote the views of Caligula He himself was now only in the twenty fifth year of his age was totally inexperienced in the administration of public affairs had never performed even the smallest service to his country and was generally known to be of a character which two hundred ninety three disgraced his illustrious descent Yet in spite of all these circumstances such was the destiny of Rome that his accession afforded joy to the soldiers who had known him in his childhood and to the populace in the capital as well as the people in the provinces who were flattered with the delusive expectation of receiving a prince who should adorn the throne with the amiable virtues of Germanicus It is difficult to say whether weakness of understanding or corruption of morals were more conspicuous in the character of Caligula He seems to have discovered from his earliest years an innate depravity of mind which was undoubtedly much increased by defect of education He had lost both his parents at an early period of life and from Tiberius own character as well as his views in training the person who should succeed him on the throne there is reason to think that if any attention whatever was paid to the education of Caligula it was directed to vitiate all his faculties and passions rather than to correct and improve them If such was really the object it was indeed prosecuted with success The commencement however of his reign was such as by no means prognosticated its subsequent transition The sudden change of his conduct the astonishing mixture of imbecility and presumption of moral turpitude and frantic extravagance which he afterwards evinced such as rolling himself over heaps of gold his treatment of his horse Incitatus and his design of making him consul seem to justify a suspicion that his brain had actually been affected either by the potion said to have been given him by his wife Caesonia or otherwise Philtres or love potions as they were called were frequent in those times and the people believed that they operated upon the mind by a mysterious and sympathetic power It is however beyond a doubt that their effects were produced entirely by the action of their physical qualities upon the organs of the body They were usually made of the satyrion which according to Pliny was a provocative They were generally given by women to their husbands at bed time and it was necessary towards their successful operation that the parties should sleep together This circumstance explains the whole mystery The philtres were nothing more than medicines of a stimulating quality which after exciting violent but temporary effects enfeebled the constitution and occasioned nervous disorders by which the mental faculties as well as the corporeal might be injured That this was really the case with Caligula seems probable not only from the falling sickness to which he was subject but from the habitual wakefulness of which he complained two hundred ninety four The profusion of this emperor during his short reign of three years and ten months is unexampled in history In the midst of profound peace without any extraordinary charges either civil or military he expended in less than one year besides the current revenue of the empire the sum of twenty one million seven hundred ninety six thousand eight hundred seventy five pounds sterling which had been left by Tiberius at his death To supply the extravagance of future years new and exorbitant taxes were imposed upon the people and those too on the necessaries of life There existed now amongst the Romans every motive that could excite a general indignation against the government yet such was still the dread of imperial power though vested in the hands of so weak and despicable a sovereign that no insurrection was attempted nor any extensive conspiracy formed but the obnoxious emperor fell at last a sacrifice to a few centurions of his own guard This reign was of too short duration to afford any new productions in literature but had it been extended to a much longer period the effects would probably have been the same Polite learning never could flourish under an emperor who entertained a design of destroying the writings of Virgil and Livy It is fortunate that these and other valuable productions of antiquity were too widely diffused over the world and too carefully preserved to be in danger of perishing through the frenzy of this capricious barbarian TIBERIUS CLAUDIUS DRUSUS CAESAR four hundred sixty five two hundred ninety five I Livia having married Augustus when she was pregnant was within three months afterwards delivered of Drusus the father of Claudius Caesar who had at first the praenomen of Decimus but afterwards that of Nero

2930-163436-0006	train-other-500	He likewise often declared that he would some time or other if possible restore the ancient government In this account I suppose some have ventured to affirm that Augustus was jealous of him and recalled him
2930-163436-0007	train-other-500	and because he made no haste to comply with the order took him off by poison This I mention that I may not be guilty of any omission more than because I think it either true or probable
2930-163436-0008	train-other-500	since Augustus loved him so much when living that he always in his wills made him joint heir with his sons as he once declared in the senate and upon his decease extolled him

2930-163436-0016	train-other-500	from an early age with great assiduity to the study of the liberal sciences and frequently published specimens of his skill in each of them But never with all his endeavours could he attain to any public post in the government

none	none	 that the Roman people should experience a fate so severe and so much below their grandeur To exhibit the opinion both favourable and otherwise entertained concerning him by Augustus his great uncle I have here subjoined some extracts from the letters of that emperor IV I have had some conversation with Tiberius according two hundred ninety eight to your desire my dear Livia as to what must be done with your grandson Tiberius at the games of Mars 
2930-163436-0020	train-other-500	We are both agreed in this that once for all we ought to determine what course to take with him
none	none	 For if he be really sound and so to speak quite right in his intellects four hundred seventy why should we hesitate to promote him 
2930-163436-0021	train-other-500	by the same steps and degrees we did his brother But if we find him below par and deficient both in body and mind we must beware of giving occasion for him and ourselves to be laughed at by the world
2930-163436-0022	train-other-500	which is ready enough to make such things the subject of mirth and derision
none	none	 For we never shall be easy if we are always to be debating upon every occasion of this kind 
2930-163436-0023	train-other-500	without settling in the first instance
none	none	 whether he be really capable of public offices or not With regard to what you consult me about at the present moment 
2930-163436-0024	train-other-500	I am not against his superintending the feast of the priests in the games of Mars if he will suffer himself to be governed by his kinsman Silanus s son that he may do nothing to make the people stare and laugh at him
none	none	 But I do not approve of his witnessing the Circensian games from the Pulvinar He will be there exposed to view 
2930-163436-0025	train-other-500	in the very front of the theatre
none	none	 Nor do I like that he should go to the Alban Mount four hundred seventy one or be at Rome during the Latin festivals 
2930-163436-0026	train-other-500	For if he be capable of attending his brother to the mount
none	none	 why is he not made prefect of the city Thus my dear Livia you have my thoughts upon the matter In my opinion we ought to two hundred ninety nine settle this affair once for all that we may not be always in suspense between hope and fear You may if you think proper give your kinsman Antonia 
2930-163436-0027	train-other-500	this part of my letter to read In another letter he writes as follows I shall invite the youth Tiberius every day during your absence to supper that he may not sup alone with his friends Sulpicius

2930-163436-0030	train-other-500	if I am not astonished that the declamation of your grandson Tiberius should please me for how he who talks so ill should be able to declaim so clearly and properly I cannot imagine
none	none	 There is no doubt but Augustus after this came to a resolution upon the subject and accordingly left him invested with no other honour than that of the Augural priesthood

2930-163436-0038	train-other-500	When he entered the theatre they used to rise and put off their cloaks The senate likewise decreed
none	none	 that he should be added to the number of the Augustal college of priests who were chosen by lot and soon afterwards when his house was burnt down that it should be rebuilt at the public charge and that he should have the privilege of giving his vote amongst the men of consular rank This decree was however repealed Tiberius insisting to have him excused on account of his imbecility and promising to make good his loss at his own expense But at his death he named him in his will amongst his third heirs for a third part of his estate

none	none	 and sometimes upon the public festivals of ancient institution Nor did he always adhere strictly to the letter of the laws but overruled the rigour or lenity of many of their enactments according to his sentiments of justice and equity For where persons lost their suits by insisting upon more than appeared to be their due before the judges of private causes he granted them the indulgence of a second trial And with regard to such as were convicted of any great delinquency he even exceeded the punishment appointed by law and condemned them to be exposed to wild beasts four hundred eighty nine XV But in hearing and determining causes he exhibited a strange inconsistency of temper being at one time circumspect and sagacious at another inconsiderate and rash and sometimes frivolous and like one out of his mind In correcting the roll of judges he struck off the name of one 
2930-163436-0073	train-other-500	who concealing the privilege his children gave him to be excused from serving had answered to his name as too eager for the office Another who was summoned before him in a cause of his own
none	none	 but alleged that the affair did not properly come under the three hundred six emperor s cognizance but that of the ordinary judges he ordered to plead the cause himself immediately before him and show in a case of his own 
2930-163436-0074	train-other-500	how equitable a judge he would prove in that of other persons A woman refusing to acknowledge her own son and there being no clear proof on either side he obliged her to confess the truth
none	none	 by ordering her to marry the young man four hundred ninety He was much inclined to determine causes in favour of the parties who appeared 
2930-163436-0075	train-other-500	against those who did not without inquiring whether their absence was occasioned by their own fault or by real necessity On proclamation of a man s being convicted of forgery and that he ought to have his hand cut off he insisted
2930-163436-0076	train-other-500	that an executioner should be immediately sent for with a Spanish sword and a block A person being prosecuted for falsely assuming the freedom of Rome and a frivolous dispute arising between the advocates in the cause
none	none	 whether he ought to make his appearance in the Roman 
2930-163436-0077	train-other-500	or Grecian dress to show his impartiality he commanded him to change his clothes several times according to the character he assumed in the accusation or defence An anecdote is related of him
2930-163436-0078	train-other-500	and believed to be true that in a particular cause he delivered his sentence in writing thus
none	none	 I am in favour of those who have spoken the truth four hundred ninety one By this he so much forfeited the good opinion of the world 
2930-163436-0079	train-other-500	that he was everywhere and openly despised A person making an excuse
none	none	 for the non appearance of a witness whom 
2930-163436-0080	train-other-500	he had sent for from the provinces declared it was impossible for him to appear concealing the reason for some time at last after several interrogatories were put to him on the subject he answered The man is dead to which Claudius replied
none	none	 I think that is a sufficient excuse Another thanking him for suffering a person who was prosecuted to make his defence by counsel added And yet it is no more than what is usual I have likewise heard some old men say four hundred ninety two that the advocates used to abuse his patience so grossly that they would not only three hundred seven call him back as he was quitting the tribunal but would seize him by the lap of his coat and sometimes catch him by the heels to make him stay That such behaviour however strange is not incredible will appear from this anecdote Some obscure Greek who was a litigant had an altercation with him in which he called out You are an old fool four hundred ninety three It is certain that a Roman knight who was prosecuted by an impotent device of his enemies on a false charge of abominable obscenity with women observing that common strumpets were summoned against him and allowed to give evidence upbraided Claudius in very harsh and severe terms with his folly and cruelty and threw his style and some books which he had in his hands in his face with such violence as to wound him severely in the cheek XVI He likewise assumed the censorship four hundred ninety four which had been discontinued since the time that Paulus and Plancus had jointly held it But this also he administered very unequally and with a strange variety of humour and conduct In his review of the knights he passed over without any mark of disgrace a profligate young man only because his father spoke of him in the highest terms 
2930-163437-0000	train-other-500	for said he his father is his proper censor
none	none	 Another who was infamous for debauching youths and for adultery he only admonished to indulge his youthful inclinations more sparingly or at least more cautiously four hundred ninety five adding why must I know what mistress you keep When at the request of his friends he had taken off a mark of infamy which he had set upon one knight s name he said Let the blot however remain He not only struck out of the list of judges 
2930-163437-0001	train-other-500	but likewise deprived of the freedom of Rome an illustrious man of the highest provincial rank in Greece only because he was ignorant of the Latin language Nor in this review did he suffer any one to give an account of his conduct by an advocate
2930-163437-0002	train-other-500	but obliged each man to speak for himself in the best way he could He disgraced many and some that little expected it and for a reason entirely new
none	none	 namely for going out of Italy without his license three hundred eight and one likewise for having in his province been the familiar companion of a king observing that in former times Rabirius Posthumus had been prosecuted for treason although he only went after Ptolemy to Alexandria for the purpose of securing payment of a debt four hundred ninety six Having tried to brand with disgrace several others he to his own greater shame found them generally innocent through the negligence of the persons employed to inquire into their characters 
2930-163437-0003	train-other-500	those whom he charged with living in celibacy with want of children or estate proving themselves to be husbands parents and in affluent circumstances One of the knights who was charged with stabbing himself laid his bosom bare
2930-163437-0004	train-other-500	to show that there was not the least mark of violence upon his body The following incidents were remarkable in his censorship He ordered a car plated with silver and of very sumptuous workmanship
none	none	 which was exposed for sale in the Sigillaria four hundred ninety seven to be purchased and broken in pieces before his eyes 
2930-163437-0005	train-other-500	He published twenty proclamations in one day in one of which he advised the people Since the vintage was very plentiful to have their casks well secured at the bung with pitch and in another he told them that nothing would sooner cure the bite of a viper
none	none	 than the sap of the yew tree XVII He undertook only one expedition and that was of short duration The triumphal ornaments decreed him by the senate 
2930-163437-0006	train-other-500	he considered as beneath the imperial dignity
none	none	 and was therefore resolved to have the honour of a real triumph For this purpose he selected Britain which had never been attempted by any one since Julius Caesar four hundred ninety eight and was then chafing three hundred nine with rage because the Romans would not give up some deserters Accordingly he set sail from Ostia but was twice very near being wrecked by the boisterous wind called Circius four hundred ninety nine upon the coast of Liguria and near the islands called Stoechades five hundred Having marched by land from Marseilles to Gessoriacum five hundred one he thence passed over to Britain and part of the island submitting to him within a few days after his arrival without battle or bloodshed he returned to Rome in less than six months from the time of his departure and triumphed in the most solemn manner five hundred two to witness which he not only three hundred ten gave leave to governors of provinces to come to Rome 
2930-163437-0007	train-other-500	but even to some of the exiles Among the spoils taken from the enemy he fixed upon the pediment of his house in the Palatium a naval crown in token of his having passed and as it were conquered the Ocean
2930-163437-0008	train-other-500	and had it suspended near the civic crown which was there before
none	none	 Messalina his wife followed his chariot in a covered litter five hundred three Those who had attained the honour of triumphal ornaments 
2930-163437-0009	train-other-500	in the same war rode behind the rest followed on foot wearing the robe with the broad stripes Crassus Frugi was mounted upon a horse richly caparisoned in a robe embroidered with palm leaves
none	none	 because this was the second time of his obtaining that honour XVIII He paid particular attention to the care of the city and to have it well supplied with provisions A dreadful fire happening in the Aemiliana five hundred four which lasted some time he passed two nights in the Diribitorium five hundred five and the soldiers and gladiators not being in sufficient numbers to extinguish it 
2930-163437-0010	train-other-500	he caused the magistrates to summon the people out of all the streets in the city to their assistance Placing bags of money before him he encouraged them to do their utmost declaring that he would reward every one on the spot
none	none	 according to their exertions XIX During a scarcity of provisions occasioned by bad crops 
2930-163437-0011	train-other-500	for several successive years
none	none	 he was stopped in the middle of the Forum by the mob 
2930-163437-0012	train-other-500	who so abused him at the same time pelting him with fragments of bread
none	none	 that he had some three hundred eleven difficulty in escaping into the palace by a back door He therefore used all possible means to bring provisions to the city even in the winter 
2930-163437-0013	train-other-500	He proposed to the merchants a sure profit by indemnifying them against any loss that might befall them by storms at sea and granted great privileges to those who built ships for that traffic
none	none	 To a citizen of Rome he gave an exemption from the penalty of the Papia Poppaean law five hundred six to one who had only the privilege of Latium 
2930-163437-0014	train-other-500	the freedom of the city and to women the rights which by law belonged to those who had four children
none	none	 which enactments are in force to this day XX He completed some important public works which though not numerous 
2930-163437-0015	train-other-500	were very useful The principal were an aqueduct which had been begun by Caius
none	none	 an emissary for the discharge of the waters of the Fucine lake five hundred seven and the harbour of Ostia although he knew that Augustus had refused to comply with the repeated application of the Marsians for one of these and that the other had been several times intended by Julius Caesar but as often abandoned on account of the difficulty of its execution 
2930-163437-0016	train-other-500	He brought to the city the cool and plentiful springs of the Claudian water one of which is called Caeruleus and the other Curtius and Albudinus as likewise the river of the New Anio in a stone canal
2930-163437-0017	train-other-500	and distributed them into many magnificent reservoirs The canal from the Fucine lake was undertaken as much for the sake of profit as for the honour of the enterprise for there were parties who offered to drain it at their own expense
2930-163437-0018	train-other-500	on condition of their having a grant of the land laid dry With great difficulty he completed a canal three miles in length partly by cutting through and partly by tunnelling a mountain thirty thousand men being constantly employed in the work
none	none	 for eleven years five hundred eight He formed the harbour at Ostia 
2930-163437-0019	train-other-500	by carrying out circular piers on the right and on the left
none	none	 with three hundred twelve a mole protecting in deep water the entrance of the port five hundred nine To secure the foundation of this mole he sunk the vessel in which the great obelisk five hundred ten had been brought from Egypt five hundred eleven and built upon piles a very lofty tower 
2930-163437-0020	train-other-500	in imitation of the Pharos at Alexandria on which lights were burnt
none	none	 to direct mariners in the night XXI He often distributed largesses of corn and money among the people 
2930-163437-0021	train-other-500	and entertained them with a great variety of public magnificent spectacles not only such as were usual and in the accustomed places but some of new invention and others revived from ancient models
none	none	 and exhibited in places where nothing of the kind had been ever before attempted In the games which he presented at the dedication of Pompey s theatre five hundred twelve which had been burnt down 
2930-163437-0022	train-other-500	and was rebuilt by him he presided upon a tribunal erected for him in the orchestra having first paid his devotions in the temple above
none	none	 and then coming down through the centre of the circle while all the people kept their seats in profound silence five hundred thirteen He likewise three hundred thirteen exhibited the secular games five hundred fourteen giving out that Augustus had anticipated the regular period 
2930-163437-0023	train-other-500	though he himself says in his history That they had been omitted before the age of Augustus who had calculated the years with great exactness
none	none	 and again brought them to their regular period five hundred fifteen The crier was therefore ridiculed when he invited people in the usual form 
2930-163437-0024	train-other-500	to games which no person had ever before seen nor ever would again when many were still living who had already seen them
none	none	 and some of the performers who had formerly acted in them 
2930-163437-0025	train-other-500	were now again brought upon the stage
none	none	 He likewise frequently celebrated the Circensian games in the Vatican five hundred sixteen sometimes exhibiting a hunt of wild beasts after every five courses He embellished the Circus Maximus with marble barriers and gilded goals which before were of common stone five hundred seventeen and wood 
2930-163437-0026	train-other-500	and assigned proper places for the senators
none	none	 who were used to sit promiscuously with the other spectators 
2930-163437-0027	train-other-500	Besides the chariot races he exhibited there the Trojan game and wild beasts from Africa which were encountered by a troop of pretorian knights with their tribunes and even the prefect at the head of them
none	none	 besides Thessalian horse who drive fierce bulls round the circus leap upon their backs when they have exhausted their fury 
2930-163437-0028	train-other-500	and drag them by the horns to the ground He gave exhibitions of gladiators in several places and of various kinds
none	none	 one yearly on the anniversary of his accession in the pretorian camp five hundred eighteen but without any hunting or the usual apparatus 
2930-163437-0029	train-other-500	another in the Septa as usual and in the same place another out of the common way and of a few days continuance only
none	none	 which he called Sportula 
2930-163437-0030	train-other-500	because when he was going to present it he informed the people by proclamation
none	none	 that he invited them to a late supper 
2930-163437-0031	train-other-500	got up in haste and without ceremony Nor did he lend himself to any kind of public diversion with more freedom and hilarity insomuch that he would hold out his left hand
none	none	 and three hundred fourteen joined by the common people count upon his fingers aloud 
2930-163437-0032	train-other-500	the gold pieces presented to those who came off conquerors He would earnestly invite the company to be merry sometimes calling them his masters with a mixture of insipid far fetched jests
none	none	 Thus when the people called for Palumbus five hundred nineteen he said 
2930-163437-0033	train-other-500	He would give them one when he could catch it The following was well intended and well timed having amidst great applause spared a gladiator on the intercession of his four sons he sent a billet immediately round the theatre
2930-163437-0034	train-other-500	to remind the people how much it behoved them to get children since they had before them an example how useful they had been in procuring favour and security for a gladiator He likewise represented in the Campus Martius the assault and sacking of a town
none	none	 and the surrender of the British kings five hundred twenty presiding in his general s cloak 
2930-163437-0035	train-other-500	Immediately before he drew off the waters from the Fucine lake he exhibited upon it a naval fight But the combatants on board the fleets crying out Health attend you noble emperor We who are about to peril our lives salute you
none	none	 and he replying Health attend you too they all refused to fight as if by that response he had meant to excuse them Upon this he hesitated for a time whether he should not destroy them all with fire and sword At last leaping from his seat and running along the shore of the lake with tottering steps the result of his foul excesses he partly by fair words and partly by threats persuaded them to engage This spectacle represented an engagement between the fleets of Sicily and Rhodes consisting each of twelve ships of war of three banks of oars The signal for the encounter was given by a silver Triton raised by machinery from the middle of the lake XXII With regard to religious ceremonies the administration of affairs both civil and military and the condition of all orders of the people at home and abroad some practices he corrected others which had been laid aside he revived and some regulations he introduced which were entirely new In appointing new priests for the several colleges he made no appointments without being sworn When an earthquake three hundred fifteen happened in the city he never failed to summon the people together by the praetor and appoint holidays for sacred rites And upon the sight of any ominous bird in the City or Capitol he issued an order for a supplication the words of which by virtue of his office of high priest after an exhortation from the rostra he recited in the presence of the people who repeated them after him all workmen and slaves being first ordered to withdraw XXIII The courts of judicature whose sittings had been formerly divided between the summer and winter months he ordered for the dispatch of business to sit the whole year round The jurisdiction in matters of trust which used to be granted annually by special commission to certain magistrates and in the city only he made permanent and extended to the provincial judges likewise He altered a clause added by Tiberius to the Papia Poppaean law five hundred twenty one which inferred that men of sixty years of age were incapable of begetting children He ordered that out of the ordinary course of proceeding orphans might have guardians appointed them by the consuls and that those who were banished from any province by the chief magistrate should be debarred from coming into the City or any part of Italy He inflicted on certain persons a new sort of banishment by forbidding them to depart further than three miles from Rome When any affair of importance came before the senate he used to sit between the two consuls upon the seats of the tribunes He reserved to himself the power of granting license to travel out of Italy which before had belonged to the senate XXIV He likewise granted the consular ornaments to his Ducenarian procurators From those who declined the senatorian dignity he took away the equestrian Although he had in the beginning of his reign declared that he would admit no man into the senate who was not the great grandson of a Roman citizen yet he gave the broad hem to the son of a freedman on condition that he should be adopted by a Roman knight Being afraid however of incurring censure by such an act he informed the public that his ancestor Appius Caecus the censor had elected the sons of freedmen into three hundred sixteen the senate for he was ignorant it seems that in the times of Appius and a long while afterwards persons manumitted were not called freedmen but only their sons who were free born Instead of the expense which the college of quaestors was obliged to incur in paving the high ways he ordered them to give the people an exhibition of gladiators and relieving them of the provinces of Ostia and Cisalpine Gaul he reinstated them in the charge of the treasury which since it was taken from them had been managed by the praetors or those who had formerly filled that office He gave the triumphal ornaments to Silanus who was betrothed to his daughter though he was under age and in other cases he bestowed them on so many and with so little reserve that there is extant a letter unanimously addressed to him by all the legions begging him to grant his consular lieutenants the triumphal ornaments at the time of their appointment to commands in order to prevent their seeking occasion to engage in unnecessary wars He decreed to Aulus Plautius the honour of an ovation five hundred twenty two going to meet him at his entering the city and walking with him in the procession to the Capitol and back in which he took the left side giving him the post of honour He allowed Gabinius Secundus upon his conquest of the Chauci a German tribe to assume the cognomen of Chaucius five hundred twenty three XXV His military organization of the equestrian order was this After having the command of a cohort they were promoted to a wing of auxiliary horse and subsequently received the commission of tribune of a legion He raised a body of militia who were called Supernumeraries who though they were a sort of soldiers and kept in reserve yet received pay He procured an act of the senate to prohibit all soldiers from attending senators at their houses in the way of respect and compliment He confiscated the estates of all freedmen who presumed to take upon themselves the equestrian rank Such of them as were ungrateful to their patrons and were complained of by them he reduced to their former condition of three hundred seventeen slavery and declared to their advocates that he would always give judgment against the freedmen in any suit at law which the masters might happen to have with them Some persons having exposed their sick slaves in a languishing condition on the island of Aesculapius five hundred twenty four because of the tediousness of their cure he declared all who were so exposed perfectly free never more to return if they should recover to their former servitude and that if any one chose to kill at once rather than expose a slave he should be liable for murder He published a proclamation forbidding all travellers to pass through the towns of Italy any otherwise than on foot or in a litter or chair five hundred twenty five He quartered a cohort of soldiers at Puteoli and another at Ostia to be in readiness against any accidents from fire He prohibited foreigners from adopting Roman names especially those which belonged to families five hundred twenty six Those who falsely pretended to the freedom of Rome he beheaded on the Esquiline He gave up to the senate the provinces of Achaia and Macedonia which Tiberius had transferred to his own administration He deprived the Lycians of their liberties as a punishment for their fatal dissensions but restored to the Rhodians their freedom upon their repenting of their former misdemeanors He exonerated for ever the people of Ilium from the payment of taxes as being the founders of the Roman race reciting upon the occasion a letter in Greek three hundred eighteen from the senate and people of Rome to king Seleucus five hundred twenty seven on which they promised him their friendship and alliance provided that he would grant their kinsmen the Iliensians immunity from all burdens He banished from Rome all the Jews who were continually making disturbances at the instigation of one Chrestus five hundred twenty eight He allowed the ambassadors of the Germans to sit at the public spectacles in the seats assigned to the senators being induced to grant them favours by their frank and honourable conduct For having been seated in the rows of benches which were common to the people on observing the Parthian and Armenian ambassadors sitting among the senators they took upon themselves to cross over into the same seats as being they said no way inferior to the others in point either of merit or rank The religious rites of the Druids solemnized with such horrid cruelties which had only been forbidden the citizens of Rome during the reign of Augustus he utterly abolished among the Gauls five hundred twenty nine On the other hand he attempted three hundred nineteen to transfer the Eleusinian mysteries from Attica to Rome five hundred thirty He likewise ordered the temple of Venus Erycina in Sicily which was old and in a ruinous condition to be repaired at the expense of the Roman people He concluded treaties with foreign princes in the forum with the sacrifice of a sow and the form of words used by the heralds in former times But in these and other things and indeed the greater part of his administration he was directed not so much by his own judgment as by the influence of his wives and freedmen for the most part acting in conformity to what their interests or fancies dictated XXVI He was twice married at a very early age first to Aemilia Lepida the grand daughter of Augustus and afterwards to Livia Medullina who had the cognomen of Camilla and was descended from the old dictator Camillus The former he divorced while still a virgin because her parents had incurred the displeasure of Augustus and he lost the latter by sickness on the day fixed for their nuptials He next married Plautia Urgulanilla whose father had enjoyed the honour of a triumph and soon afterwards Aelia Paetina the daughter of a man of consular rank But he divorced them both Paetina upon some trifling causes of disgust and Urgulanilla for scandalous lewdness and the suspicion of murder After them he took in marriage Valeria Messalina the daughter of Barbatus Messala his cousin But finding that besides her other shameful debaucheries she had even gone so far as to marry in his own absence Caius Silius the settlement of her dower being formally signed in the presence of the augurs he put her to death When summoning his pretorians to his presence he made to them this declaration As I have been so unhappy in my unions I am resolved to continue in future unmarried and if I should not I give you leave to stab me He was however unable to persist in this resolution for he began immediately to think of another wife and even of taking back Paetina whom he had formerly divorced he thought also of Lollia Paulina who had been married to Caius Caesar But being ensnared by the arts of Agrippina three hundred twenty the daughter of his brother Germanicus who took advantage of the kisses and endearments which their near relationship admitted to inflame his desires he got some one to propose at the next meeting of the senate that they should oblige the emperor to marry Agrippina as a measure highly conducive to the public interest and that in future liberty should be given for such marriages which until that time had been considered incestuous In less than twenty four hours after this he married her five hundred thirty one No person was found however to follow the example excepting one freedman and a centurion of the first rank at the solemnization of whose nuptials both he and Agrippina attended XXVII He had children by three of his wives by Urgulanilla Drusus and Claudia by Paetina Antonia and by Messalina Octavia and also a son whom at first he called Germanicus but afterwards Britannicus He lost Drusus at Pompeii when he was very young he being choked with a pear which in his play he tossed into the air and caught in his mouth Only a few days before he had betrothed him to one of Sejanus s daughters five hundred thirty two and I am therefore surprised that some authors should say he lost his life by the treachery of Sejanus Claudia who was in truth the daughter of Boter his freedman though she was born five months before his divorce he ordered to be thrown naked at her mother s door He married Antonia to Cneius Pompey the Great five hundred thirty three and afterwards to Faustus Sylla five hundred thirty four both youths of very noble parentage Octavia to his step son Nero five hundred thirty five after she had been contracted to Silanus Britannicus was born upon the twentieth day of his reign and in his second consulship He often earnestly commended him to the soldiers holding him in his arms before their ranks and would likewise show him to the people in the theatre setting him upon his lap or holding him out whilst he was still very young and was sure to receive their acclamations and good wishes on his behalf Of his three hundred twenty one sons in law he adopted Nero He not only dismissed from his favour both Pompey and Silanus but put them to death XXVIII Amongst his freedmen the greatest favourite was the eunuch Posides whom in his British triumph he presented with the pointless spear classing him among the military men Next to him if not equal in favour was Felix five hundred thirty six whom he not only preferred to commands both of cohorts and troops but to the government of the province of Judaea and he became in consequence of his elevation the husband of three queens five hundred thirty seven Another favourite was Harpocras to whom he granted the privilege of being carried in a litter within the city and of holding public spectacles for the entertainment of the people In this class was likewise Polybius who assisted him in his studies and had often the honour of walking between the two consuls But above all others Narcissus his secretary and Pallas five hundred thirty eight the comptroller of his accounts were in high favour with him He not only allowed them to receive by decree of the senate immense presents but also to be decorated with the quaestorian and praetorian ensigns of honour So much did he indulge them in amassing wealth and plundering the public that upon his complaining once of the lowness of his exchequer some one said with great reason that It would be full enough if those two freedmen of his would but take him into partnership with them XXIX Being entirely governed by these freedmen and as I have already said by his wives he was a tool to others rather than a prince He distributed offices or the command of armies pardoned or punished according as it suited their interests three hundred twenty two their passions or their caprice and for the most part without knowing or being sensible of what he did Not to enter into minute details relative to the revocation of grants the reversal of judicial decisions obtaining his signature to fictitious appointments or the bare faced alteration of them after signing he put to death Appius Silanus the father of his son in law and the two Julias the daughters of Drusus and Germanicus without any positive proof of the crimes with which they were charged or so much as permitting them to make any defence He also cut off Cneius Pompey the husband of his eldest daughter and Lucius Silanus who was betrothed to the younger Pompey was stabbed in the act of unnatural lewdness with a favourite paramour Silanus was obliged to quit the office of praetor upon the fourth of the calends of January twenty ninth Dec and to kill himself on new year s day five hundred thirty nine following the very same on which Claudius and Agrippina were married He condemned to death five and thirty senators and above three hundred Roman knights with so little attention to what he did that when a centurion brought him word of the execution of a man of consular rank who was one of the number and told him that he had executed his order he declared he had ordered no such thing but that he approved of it because his freedmen it seems had said that the soldiers did nothing more than their duty in dispatching the emperor s enemies without waiting for a warrant But it is beyond all belief that he himself at the marriage of Messalina with the adulterous Silius should actually sign the writings relative to her dowry induced as it is pretended by the design of diverting from himself and transferring upon another the danger which some omens seemed to threaten him XXX Either standing or sitting but especially when he lay asleep he had a majestic and graceful appearance for he was tall but not slender His grey looks became him well and he had a full neck But his knees were feeble and failed him in walking so that his gait was ungainly both when he assumed state and when he was taking diversion He was outrageous in his laughter and still more so in his wrath for then he foamed at the mouth and discharged from his nostrils He also stammered in his speech and had a tremulous motion three hundred twenty three of the head at all times but particularly when he was engaged in any business however trifling XXXI Though his health was very infirm during the former part of his life yet after he became emperor he enjoyed a good state of health except only that he was subject to a pain of the stomach In a fit of this complaint he said he had thoughts of killing himself XXXII He gave entertainments as frequent as they were splendid and generally when there was such ample room that very often six hundred guests sat down together At a feast he gave on the banks of the canal for draining the Fucine Lake he narrowly escaped being drowned the water at its discharge rushing out with such violence that it overflowed the conduit At supper he had always his own children with those of several of the nobility who according to an ancient custom sat at the feet of the couches One of his guests having been suspected of purloining a golden cup he invited him again the next day but served him with a porcelain jug It is said too that he intended to publish an edict allowing to all people the liberty of giving vent at table to any distension occasioned by flatulence upon hearing of a person whose modesty when under restraint had nearly cost him his life XXXIII He was always ready to eat and drink at any time or in any place One day as he was hearing causes in the Forum of Augustus he smelt the dinner which was preparing for the Salii five hundred forty in the temple of Mars adjoining whereupon he quitted three hundred twenty four the tribunal and went to partake of the feast with the priests He scarcely ever left the table until he had thoroughly crammed himself and drank to intoxication and then he would immediately fall asleep lying upon his back with his mouth open While in this condition a feather was put down his throat to make him throw up the contents of his stomach Upon composing himself to rest his sleep was short and he usually awoke before midnight but he would sometimes sleep in the daytime and that even when he was upon the tribunal so that the advocates often found it difficult to wake him though they raised their voices for that purpose He set no bounds to his libidinous intercourse with women but never betrayed any unnatural desires for the other sex He was fond of gaming and published a book upon the subject He even used to play as he rode in his chariot having the tables so fitted that the game was not disturbed by the motion of the carriage XXXIV His cruel and sanguinary disposition was exhibited upon great as well as trifling occasions When any person was to be put to the torture or criminal punished for parricide he was impatient for the execution and would have it performed in his own presence When he was at Tibur being desirous of seeing an example of the old way of putting malefactors to death some were immediately bound to a stake for the purpose but there being no executioner to be had at the place he sent for one from Rome and waited for his coming until night In any exhibition of gladiators presented either by himself or others if any of the combatants chanced to fall he ordered them to be butchered especially the Retiarii that he might see their faces in the agonies of death Two gladiators happening to kill each other he immediately ordered some little knives to be made of their swords for his own use He took great pleasure in seeing men engage with wild beasts and the combatants who appeared on the stage at noon He would therefore come to the theatre by break of day and at noon dismissing the people to dinner continued sitting himself and besides those who were devoted to that sanguinary fate he would match others with the beasts upon slight or sudden occasions as for instance the carpenters and their three hundred twenty six assistants and people of that sort if a machine or any piece of work in which they had been employed about the theatre did not answer the purpose for which it had been intended To this desperate kind of encounter he forced one of his nomenclators even encumbered as he was by wearing the toga XXXV But the characteristics most predominant in him were fear and distrust In the beginning of his reign though he much affected a modest and humble appearance as has been already observed yet he durst not venture himself at an entertainment without being attended by a guard of spearmen and made soldiers wait upon him at table instead of servants He never visited a sick person until the chamber had been first searched and the bed and bedding thoroughly examined At other times all persons who came to pay their court to him were strictly searched by officers appointed for that purpose nor was it until after a long time and with much difficulty that he was prevailed upon to excuse women boys and girls from such rude handling or suffer their attendants or writing masters to retain their cases for pens and styles When Camillus formed his plot against him not doubting but his timidity might be worked upon without a war he wrote to him a scurrilous petulant and threatening letter desiring him to resign the government and betake himself to a life of privacy Upon receiving this requisition he had some thoughts of complying with it and summoned together the principal men of the city to consult with them on the subject XXXVI Having heard some loose reports of conspiracies formed against him he was so much alarmed that he thought of immediately abdicating the government And when as I have before related a man armed with a dagger was discovered near him while he was sacrificing he instantly ordered the heralds to convoke the senate and with tears and dismal exclamations lamented that such was his condition that he was safe no where and for a long time afterwards he abstained from appearing in public He smothered his ardent love for Messalina not so much on account of her infamous conduct as from apprehension of danger believing that she aspired to share with Silius her partner in adultery the imperial dignity three hundred twenty six Upon this occasion he ran in a great fright and a very shameful manner to the camp asking all the way he went if the empire were indeed safely his XXXVII No suspicion was too trifling no person on whom it rested too contemptible to throw him into a panic and induce him to take precautions for his safety and meditate revenge A man engaged in a litigation before his tribunal having saluted him drew him aside and told him he had dreamt that he saw him murdered and shortly afterwards when his adversary came to deliver his plea to the emperor the plaintiff pretending to have discovered the murderer pointed to him as the man he had seen in his dream whereupon as if he had been taken in the act he was hurried away to execution We are informed that Appius Silanus was got rid of in the same manner by a contrivance betwixt Messalina and Narcissus in which they had their several parts assigned them Narcissus therefore burst into his lord s chamber before daylight apparently in great fright and told him that he had dreamt that Appius Silanus had murdered him The empress upon this affecting great surprise declared she had the like dream for several nights successively Presently afterwards word was brought as it had been agreed on that Appius was come he having indeed received orders the preceding day to be there at that time and as if the truth of the dream was sufficiently confirmed by his appearance at that juncture he was immediately ordered to be prosecuted and put to death The day following Claudius related the whole affair to the senate and acknowledged his great obligation to his freedmen for watching over him even in his sleep XXXVIII Sensible of his being subject to passion and resentment he excused himself in both instances by a proclamation assuring the public that the former should be short and harmless and the latter never without good cause After severely reprimanding the people of Ostia for not sending some boats to meet him upon his entering the mouth of the Tiber in terms which might expose them to the public resentment he wrote to Rome that he had been treated as a private person yet immediately afterwards he pardoned them and that in a way which had the appearance of making them three hundred twenty seven satisfaction or begging pardon for some injury he had done them Some people who addressed him unseasonably in public he pushed away with his own hand He likewise banished a person who had been secretary to a quaestor and even a senator who had filled the office of praetor without a hearing and although they were innocent the former only because he had treated him with rudeness while he was in a private station and the other because in his aedileship he had fined some tenants of his for selling cooked victuals contrary to law and ordered his steward who interfered to be whipped On this account likewise he took from the aediles the jurisdiction they had over cooks shops He did not scruple to speak of his own absurdities and declared in some short speeches which he published that he had only feigned imbecility in the reign of Caius because otherwise it would have been impossible for him to have escaped and arrived at the station he had then attained He could not however gain credit for this assertion for a short time afterwards a book was published under the title of Moron anastasis The Resurrection of Fools the design of which was to show that nobody ever counterfeited folly XXXIX Amongst other things people admired in him his indifference and unconcern or to express it in Greek his meteoria and ablepsia Placing himself at table a little after Messalina s death he enquired Why the empress did not come Many of those whom he had condemned to death he ordered the day after to be invited to his table and to game with him and sent to reprimand them as sluggish fellows for not making greater haste When he was meditating his incestuous marriage with Agrippina he was perpetually calling her My daughter my nursling born and brought up upon my lap And when he was going to adopt Nero as if there was little cause for censure in his adopting a son in law when he had a son of his own arrived at years of maturity he continually gave out in public that no one had ever been admitted by adoption into the Claudian family XL He frequently appeared so careless in what he said and so inattentive to circumstances that it was believed he never reflected who he himself was or amongst whom or at three hundred twenty eight what time or in what place he spoke In a debate in the senate relative to the butchers and vintners he cried out I ask you who can live without a bit of meat And mentioned the great plenty of old taverns from which he himself used formerly to have his wine Among other reasons for his supporting a certain person who was candidate for the quaestorship he gave this His father said he once gave me very seasonably a draught of cold water when I was sick Upon his bringing a woman as a witness in some cause before the senate he said This woman was my mother s freedwoman and dresser but she always considered me as her master and this I say because there are some still in my family that do not look upon me as such The people of Ostia addressing him in open court with a petition he flew into a rage at them and said There is no reason why I should oblige you if any one else is free to act as he pleases surely I am The following expressions he had in his mouth every day and at all hours and seasons What do you take me for a Theogonius five hundred forty one And in Greek lalei kai mae thingane Speak but do not touch me besides many other familiar sentences below the dignity of a private person much more of an emperor who was not deficient either in eloquence or learning as having applied himself very closely to the liberal sciences XLI By the encouragement of Titus Livius five hundred forty two and with the assistance of Sulpicius Flavus he attempted at an early age the composition of a history and having called together a numerous auditory to hear and give their judgment upon it he read it over with much difficulty and frequently interrupting himself For after he had begun a great laugh was raised amongst the company by the breaking of several benches from the weight of a very fat man and even when order was restored he could not forbear bursting out into violent fits of laughter at the remembrance of the accident After he became emperor likewise he wrote several things three hundred twenty nine which he was careful to have recited to his friends by a reader He commenced his history from the death of the dictator Caesar but afterwards he took a later period and began at the conclusion of the civil wars because he found he could not speak with freedom and a due regard to truth concerning the former period having been often taken to task both by his mother and grandmother Of the earlier history he left only two books but of the latter one and forty He compiled likewise the History of his Own Life in eight books full of absurdities but in no bad style also A Defence of Cicero against the Books of Asinius Gallus five hundred forty three which exhibited a considerable degree of learning He besides invented three new letters and added them to the former alphabet five hundred forty four as highly necessary He published a book to recommend them while he was yet only a private person but on his elevation to imperial power he had little difficulty in introducing them into common use and these letters are still extant in a variety of books registers and inscriptions upon buildings XLII He applied himself with no less attention to the study of Grecian literature asserting upon all occasions his love of that language and its surpassing excellency A stranger once holding a discourse both in Greek and Latin he addressed him thus Since you are skilled in both our tongues And recommending Achaia to the favour of the senate he said I have a particular attachment to that province on account of our common studies In the senate he often made long replies to ambassadors in that language On the tribunal he frequently quoted the verses of Homer When at any time he had taken vengeance on an enemy or a conspirator he scarcely ever gave to the tribune on guard who three hundred thirty according to custom came for the word any other than this Andr epamynastai ote tis proteros chalepaenae Tis time to strike when wrong demands the blow To conclude he wrote some histories likewise in Greek namely twenty books on Tuscan affairs and eight on the Carthaginian in consequence of which another museum was founded at Alexandria in addition to the old one and called after his name and it was ordered that upon certain days in every year his Tuscan history should be read over in one of these and his Carthaginian in the other as in a school each history being read through by persons who took it in turn XLIII Towards the close of his life he gave some manifest indications that he repented of his marriage with Agrippina and his adoption of Nero For some of his freedmen noticing with approbation his having condemned the day before a woman accused of adultery he remarked It has been my misfortune to have wives who have been unfaithful to my bed but they did not escape punishment Often when he happened to meet Britannicus he would embrace him tenderly and express a desire that he might grow apace and receive from him an account of all his actions using the Greek phrase o trosas kai iasetai He who has wounded will also heal And intending to give him the manly habit while he was yet under age and a tender youth because his stature would allow of it he added I do so that the Roman people may at last have a real Caesar five hundred forty five XLIV Soon afterwards he made his will and had it signed by all the magistrates as witnesses But he was prevented from proceeding further by Agrippina accused by her own guilty conscience as well as by informers of a variety of crimes It is agreed that he was taken off by poison but where and by whom administered remains in uncertainty Some authors say that it was given him as he was feasting with the priests in the Capitol by the eunuch Halotus his taster Others say three hundred thirty one by Agrippina at his own table in mushrooms a dish of which he was very fond five hundred forty six The accounts of what followed likewise differ Some relate that he instantly became speechless was racked with pain through the night and died about day break others that at first he fell into a sound sleep and afterwards his food rising he threw up the whole but had another dose given him whether in water gruel under pretence of refreshment after his exhaustion or in a clyster as if designed to relieve his bowels is likewise uncertain XLV His death was kept secret until everything was settled relative to his successor Accordingly vows were made for his recovery and comedians were called to amuse him as it was pretended by his own desire He died upon the third of the ides of October thirteenth October in the consulship of Asinius Marcellus and Acilius Aviola in the sixty fourth year of his age and the fourteenth of his reign five hundred forty seven His funeral was celebrated with the customary imperial pomp and he was ranked amongst the gods This honour was taken from him by Nero but restored by Vespasian XLVI The chief presages of his death were the appearance of a comet his father Drusus s monument being struck by lightning and the death of most of the magistrates of all ranks that year It appears from several circumstances that he was sensible of his approaching dissolution and made no secret of it For when he nominated the consuls he appointed no one to fill the office beyond the month in which he died At the last assembly of the senate in which he made his appearance he earnestly exhorted his two sons to unity with each other and with earnest entreaties commended to the fathers the care of their tender years And in the last cause he heard from the tribunal he repeatedly declared in open court That he was now arrived at the last stage of mortal existence whilst all who heard it shrunk at hearing these ominous words The violent death of Caligula afforded the Romans a fresh opportunity to have asserted the liberty of their country but the conspirators had concerted no plan by which they should proceed upon the assassination of that tyrant and the indecision of the senate in a debate of two days on so sudden an emergency gave time to the caprice of the soldiers to interpose in the settlement of the government By an accident the most fortuitous a man devoid of all pretensions to personal merit so weak in understanding as to be the common sport of the emperor s household and an object of contempt even to his own kindred this man in the hour of military insolence was nominated by the soldiers as successor to the Roman throne Not yet in possession of the public treasury which perhaps was exhausted he could not immediately reward the services of his electors with a pecuniary gratification but he promised them a largess of fifteen thousand sesterces a man upwards of a hundred and forty pounds sterling and as we meet with no account of any subsequent discontents in the army we may justly conclude that the promise was soon after fulfilled This transaction laid the foundation of that military despotism which through many succeeding ages convulsed the Roman empire Besides the interposition of the soldiers upon this occasion it appears that the populace of Rome were extremely clamorous for the government of a single person and for that of Claudius in particular This partiality for a monarchical government proceeded from two causes The commonalty from their obscure situation were always the least exposed to oppression under a tyrannical prince They had likewise ever been remarkably fond of stage plays and public shows with which as well as with scrambles and donations of bread and other victuals the preceding emperor had frequently gratified them They had therefore less to fear and more to hope from the government of a single person than any other class of Roman citizens With regard to the partiality for Claudius it may be accounted for partly from the low habits of life to which he had been addicted in consequence of which many of them were familiarly acquainted with him and this circumstance likewise increased their hope of deriving some advantage from his accession Exclusive of all these considerations it is highly probable that the populace were instigated in favour of Claudius by the artifices of his freedmen persons of mean extraction by whom he was afterwards entirely governed and who upon such an occasion would exert their utmost efforts to procure his appointment to the throne From the debate in the senate having continued during three hundred thirty three two days it was evident that there was still a strong party for restoring the ancient form of government That they were in the end overawed by the clamour of the multitude is not surprising when we consider that the senate was totally unprovided with resources of every kind for asserting the independence of the nation by arms and the commonalty who interrupted their deliberations were the only people by whose assistance they ever could effect the restitution of public freedom To this may be added that the senate by the total reduction of their political importance ever since the overthrow of the republic had lost both the influence and authority which they formerly enjoyed The extreme cruelty likewise which had been exercised during the last two reigns afforded a further motive for relinquishing all attempts in favour of liberty as they might be severely revenged upon themselves by the subsequent emperor and it was a degree of moderation in Claudius which palliates the injustice of his cause that he began his government with an act of amnesty respecting the public transactions which ensued upon the death of Caligula Claudius at the time of his accession was fifty years of age and though he had hitherto lived apparently unambitious of public honours accompanied with great ostentation yet he was now seized with a desire to enjoy a triumph As there existed no war in which he might perform some military achievement his vanity could only be gratified by invading a foreign country where contrary to the advice contained in the testament of Augustus he might attempt to extend still further the limits of the empire Either Britain therefore or some nation on the continent at a great distance from the capital became the object of such an enterprize and the former was chosen not only as more convenient from its vicinity to the maritime province of Gaul but on account of a remonstrance lately presented by the Britons to the court of Rome respecting the protection afforded to some persons of that nation who had fled thither to elude the laws of their country Considering the state of Britain at that time divided as it was into a number of principalities amongst which there was no general confederacy for mutual defence and where the alarm excited by the invasion of Julius Caesar upwards of eighty years before had long since been forgotten a sudden attempt upon the island could not fail to be attended with success Accordingly an army was sent over under the command of Aulus Plautius an able general who defeated the natives in several engagements and penetrated a considerable way into the country Preparations for the emperor s voyage now being made Claudius set sail from Ostia at the mouth of three hundred thirty four the Tiber but meeting with a violent storm in the Mediterranean he landed at Marseilles and proceeding thence to Boulogne in Picardy passed over into Britain In what part he debarked is uncertain but it seems to have been at some place on the south east coast of the island He immediately received the submission of several British states the Cantii Atrebates Regni and Trinobantes who inhabited those parts and returning to Rome after an absence of six months celebrated with great pomp the triumph for which he had undertaken the expedition In the interior parts of Britain the natives under the command of Caractacus maintained an obstinate resistance and little progress was made by the Roman arms until Ostorius Scapula was sent over to prosecute the war He penetrated into the country of the Silures a warlike tribe who inhabited the banks of the Severn and having defeated Caractacus in a great battle made him prisoner and sent him to Rome The fame of the British prince had by this time spread over the provinces of Gaul and Italy and upon his arrival in the Roman capital the people flocked from all quarters to behold him The ceremonial of his entrance was conducted with great solemnity On a plain adjoining the Roman camp the pretorian troops were drawn up in martial array the emperor and his court took their station in front of the lines and behind them was ranged the whole body of the people The procession commenced with the different trophies which had been taken from the Britons during the progress of the war Next followed the brothers of the vanquished prince with his wife and daughter in chains expressing by their supplicating looks and gestures the fears with which they were actuated But not so Caractacus himself With a manly gait and an undaunted countenance he marched up to the tribunal where the emperor was seated and addressed him in the following terms If to my high birth and distinguished rank I had added the virtues of moderation Rome had beheld me rather as a friend than a captive and you would not have rejected an alliance with a prince descended from illustrious ancestors and governing many nations The reverse of my fortune to you is glorious and to me humiliating I had arms and men and horses I possessed extraordinary riches and can it be any wonder that I was unwilling to lose them Because Rome aspires to universal dominion must men therefore implicitly resign themselves to subjection I opposed for a long time the progress of your arms and had I acted otherwise would either you have had the glory of conquest or I of a brave resistance I am now in your three hundred thirty five power if you are determined to take revenge my fate will soon be forgotten and you will derive no honour from the transaction Preserve my life and I shall remain to the latest ages a monument of your clemency Immediately upon this speech Claudius granted him his liberty as he did likewise to the other royal captives They all returned their thanks in a manner the most grateful to the emperor and as soon as their chains were taken off walking towards Agrippina who sat upon a bench at a little distance they repeated to her the same fervent declarations of gratitude and esteem History has preserved no account of Caractacus after this period but it is probable that he returned in a short time to his own country where his former valour and the magnanimity which he had displayed at Rome would continue to render him illustrious through life even amidst the irretrievable ruin of his fortunes The most extraordinary character in the present reign was that of Valeria Messalina the daughter of Valerius Messala Barbatus She was married to Claudius and had by him a son and a daughter To cruelty in the prosecution of her purposes she added the most abandoned incontinence Not confining her licentiousness within the limits of the palace where she committed the most shameful excesses she prostituted her person in the common stews and even in the public streets of the capital As if her conduct was already not sufficiently scandalous she obliged C Silius a man of consular rank to divorce his wife that she might procure his company entirely to herself Not contented with this indulgence to her criminal passion she next persuaded him to marry her and during an excursion which the emperor made to Ostia the ceremony of marriage was actually performed between them The occasion was celebrated with a magnificent supper to which she invited a large company and lest the whole should be regarded as a frolic not meant to be consummated the adulterous parties ascended the nuptial couch in the presence of the astonished spectators Great as was the facility of Claudius s temper in respect of her former behaviour he could not overlook so flagrant a violation both of public decency and the laws of the country Silius was condemned to death for the adultery which he had perpetrated with reluctance and Messalina was ordered into the emperor s presence to answer for her conduct Terror now operating upon her mind in conjunction with remorse she could not summon the resolution to support such an interview but retired into the gardens of Lucullus there to indulge at last the compunction which she felt for her crimes and to meditate the entreaties by which she should endeavour to soothe the resentment three hundred thirty six of her husband In the extremity of her distress she attempted to lay violent hands upon herself but her courage was not equal to the emergency Her mother Lepida who had not spoken with her for some years before was present upon the occasion and urged her to the act which alone could put a period to her infamy and wretchedness Again she made an effort but again her resolution abandoned her when a tribune burst into the gardens and plunging his sword into her body she instantly expired Thus perished a woman the scandal of whose lewdness resounded throughout the empire and of whom a great satirist then living has said perhaps without a hyperbole Et lassata viris necdum satiata recessit Juvenal Sat VI It has been already observed that Claudius was entirely governed by his freedmen a class of retainers which enjoyed a great share of favour and confidence with their patrons in those times They had before been the slaves of their masters and had obtained their freedom as a reward for their faithful and attentive services Of the esteem in which they were often held we meet with an instance in Tiro the freedman of Cicero to whom that illustrious Roman addresses several epistles written in the most familiar and affectionate strain of friendship As it was common for them to be taught the more useful parts of education in the families of their masters they were usually well qualified for the management of domestic concerns and might even be competent to the superior departments of the state especially in those times when negotiations and treaties with foreign princes seldom or never occurred and in arbitrary governments where public affairs were directed more by the will of the sovereign or his ministers than by refined suggestions of policy From the character generally given of Claudius before his elevation to the throne we should not readily imagine that he was endowed with any taste for literary composition yet he seems to have exclusively enjoyed this distinction during his own reign in which learning was at a low ebb Besides history Suetonius informs us that he wrote a Defence of Cicero against the Charges of Asinius Gallus This appears to be the only tribute of esteem or approbation paid to the character of Cicero from the time of Livy the historian to the extinction of the race of the Caesars Asinius Gallus was the son of Asinius Pollio the orator Marrying Vipsania after she had been divorced by Tiberius he incurred the displeasure of that emperor and died of famine either voluntarily or by order of the tyrant He wrote a comparison between his father and Cicero in which with more filial partiality than justice he gave the preference to the former NERO CLAUDIUS CAESAR three hundred thirty seven I Two celebrated families the Calvini and Aenobarbi sprung from the race of the Domitii The Aenobarbi derive both their extraction and their cognomen from one Lucius Domitius of whom we have this tradition As he was returning out of the country to Rome he was met by two young men of a most august appearance who desired him to announce to the senate and people a victory of which no certain intelligence had yet reached the city To prove that they were more than mortals they stroked his cheeks and thus changed his hair which was black to a bright colour resembling that of brass which mark of distinction descended to his posterity for they had generally red beards This family had the honour of seven consulships five hundred forty eight one triumph five hundred forty nine and two censorships five hundred fifty and being admitted into the patrician order they continued the use of the same cognomen with no other praenomina five hundred fifty one than those of Cneius and Lucius These however they assumed with singular irregularity three persons in succession sometimes adhering to one of them and then they were changed alternately For the first second and third of the Aenobarbi had the praenomen of Lucius and again the three following successively that of Cneius while those who came after were called by turns one Lucius and the other Cneius It appears to me proper to give a short account of several of the family to show that Nero so far degenerated from the noble qualities of his ancestors that he retained only their vices as if those alone had been transmitted to him by his descent II To begin therefore at a remote period his great grandfather s grandfather Cneius Domitius when he was tribune of the people being offended with the high priests for electing another than himself in the room of his father obtained the three hundred thirty eight transfer of the right of election from the colleges of the priests to the people In his consulship five hundred fifty two having conquered the Allobroges and the Arverni five hundred fifty three he made a progress through the province mounted upon an elephant with a body of soldiers attending him in a sort of triumphal pomp Of this person the orator Licinius Crassus said It was no wonder he had a brazen beard who had a face of iron and a heart of lead His son during his praetorship five hundred fifty four proposed that Cneius Caesar upon the expiration of his consulship should be called to account before the senate for his administration of that office which was supposed to be contrary both to the omens and the laws Afterwards when he was consul himself five hundred fifty five he tried to deprive Cneius of the command of the army and having been by intrigue and cabal appointed his successor he was made prisoner at Corsinium in the beginning of the civil war Being set at liberty he went to Marseilles which was then besieged where having by his presence animated the people to hold out he suddenly deserted them and at last was slain in the battle of Pharsalia He was a man of little constancy and of a sullen temper In despair of his fortunes he had recourse to poison but was so terrified at the thoughts of death that immediately repenting he took a vomit to throw it up again and gave freedom to his physician for having with great prudence and wisdom given him only a gentle dose of the poison When Cneius Pompey was consulting with his friends in what manner he should conduct himself towards those who were neuter and took no part in the contest he was the only one who proposed that they should be treated as enemies III He left a son who was without doubt the best of the family By the Pedian law he was condemned although innocent amongst others who were concerned in the death of Caesar five hundred fifty six Upon this he went over to Brutus and Cassius his near relations and after their death not only kept together the fleet the command of which had been given him some time before but even increased it At last when the party had everywhere been defeated he voluntarily surrendered it to three hundred thirty nine Mark Antony considering it as a piece of service for which the latter owed him no small obligations Of all those who were condemned by the law above mentioned he was the only man who was restored to his country and filled the highest offices When the civil war again broke out he was appointed lieutenant under the same Antony and offered the chief command by those who were ashamed of Cleopatra but not daring on account of a sudden indisposition with which he was seized either to accept or refuse it he went over to Augustus five hundred fifty seven and died a few days after not without an aspersion cast upon his memory For Antony gave out that he was induced to change sides by his impatience to be with his mistress Servilia Nais five hundred fifty eight IV This Cneius had a son named Domitius who was afterwards well known as the nominal purchaser of the family property left by Augustus s will five hundred fifty nine and no less famous in his youth for his dexterity in chariot driving than he was afterwards for the triumphal ornaments which he obtained in the German war But he was a man of great arrogance prodigality and cruelty When he was aedile he obliged Lucius Plancus the censor to give him the way and in his praetorship and consulship he made Roman knights and married women act on the stage He gave hunts of wild beasts both in the Circus and in all the wards of the city as also a show of gladiators but with such barbarity that Augustus after privately reprimanding him to no purpose was obliged to restrain him by a public edict V By the elder Antonia he had Nero s father a man of execrable character in every part of his life During his attendance upon Caius Caesar in the East he killed a freedman of his own for refusing to drink as much as he ordered him Being dismissed for this from Caesar s society he did not mend his habits for in a village upon the Appian road he suddenly whipped his horses and drove his chariot on purpose three hundred forty over a poor boy crushing him to pieces At Rome he struck out the eye of a Roman knight in the Forum only for some free language in a dispute between them He was likewise so fraudulent that he not only cheated some silversmiths five hundred sixty of the price of goods he had bought of them but during his praetorship defrauded the owners of chariots in the Circensian games of the prizes due to them for their victory His sister jeering him for the complaints made by the leaders of the several parties he agreed to sanction a law That for the future the prizes should be immediately paid A little before the death of Tiberius he was prosecuted for treason adulteries and incest with his sister Lepida but escaped in the timely change of affairs and died of a dropsy at Pyrgi five hundred sixty one leaving behind him his son Nero whom he had by Agrippina the daughter of Germanicus VI Nero was born at Antium nine months after the death of Tiberius five hundred sixty two upon the eighteenth of the calends of January fifteenth December just as the sun rose so that its beams touched him before they could well reach the earth While many fearful conjectures in respect to his future fortune were formed by different persons from the circumstances of his nativity a saying of his father Domitius was regarded as an ill presage who told his friends who were congratulating him upon the occasion That nothing but what was detestable and pernicious to the public could ever be produced of him and Agrippina Another manifest prognostic of his future infelicity occurred upon his lustration day five hundred sixty three For Caius Caesar being requested by his sister to give the child what name he thought proper looking at his uncle Claudius who three hundred forty one afterwards when emperor adopted Nero he gave his and this not seriously but only in jest Agrippina treating it with contempt because Claudius at that time was a mere laughing stock at the palace He lost his father when he was three years old being left heir to a third part of his estate of which he never got possession the whole being seized by his company heir Caius His mother being soon after banished he lived with his aunt Lepida in a very necessitous condition under the care of two tutors a dancing master and a barber After Claudius came to the empire he not only recovered his father s estate but was enriched with the additional inheritance of that of his step father Crispus Passienus Upon his mother s recall from banishment he was advanced to such favour through Nero s powerful interest with the emperor that it was reported assassins were employed by Messalina Claudius s wife to strangle him as Britannicus s rival whilst he was taking his noon day repose In addition to the story it was said that they were frightened by a serpent which crept from under his cushion and ran away The tale was occasioned by finding on his couch near the pillow the skin of a snake which by his mother s order he wore for some time upon his right arm inclosed in a bracelet of gold This amulet at last he laid aside from aversion to her memory but he sought for it again in vain in the time of his extremity VII When he was yet a mere boy before he arrived at the age of puberty during the celebration of the Circensian games five hundred sixty four he performed his part in the Trojan play with a degree of firmness which gained him great applause In the eleventh year of his age he was adopted by Claudius and placed under the tuition of Annaeus Seneca five hundred sixty five who had been made a senator It is said that Seneca dreamt the night after that he was giving a lesson to Caius Caesar five hundred sixty six Nero soon verified his dream betraying the cruelty of his disposition in every way he could For he attempted to persuade his father that his brother Britannicus was nothing but a changeling because the latter had three hundred forty two saluted him notwithstanding his adoption by the name of Aenobarbus as usual When his aunt Lepida was brought to trial he appeared in court as a witness against her to gratify his mother who persecuted the accused On his introduction into the Forum at the age of manhood he gave a largess to the people and a donative to the soldiers for the pretorian cohorts he appointed a solemn procession under arms and marched at the head of them with a shield in his hand after which he went to return thanks to his father in the senate Before Claudius likewise at the time he was consul he made a speech for the Bolognese in Latin and for the Rhodians and people of Ilium in Greek He had the jurisdiction of praefect of the city for the first time during the Latin festival during which the most celebrated advocates brought before him not short and trifling causes as is usual in that case but trials of importance notwithstanding they had instructions from Claudius himself to the contrary Soon afterwards he married Octavia and exhibited the Circensian games and hunting of wild beasts in honour of Claudius VIII He was seventeen years of age at the death of that prince five hundred sixty seven and as soon as that event was made public he went out to the cohort on guard between the hours of six and seven for the omens were so disastrous that no earlier time of the day was judged proper On the steps before the palace gate he was unanimously saluted by the soldiers as their emperor and then carried in a litter to the camp thence after making a short speech to the troops into the senate house where he continued until the evening of all the immense honours which were heaped upon him refusing none but the title of FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY on account of his youth IX He began his reign with an ostentation of dutiful regard to the memory of Claudius whom he buried with the utmost pomp and magnificence pronouncing the funeral oration himself and then had him enrolled amongst the gods He paid likewise the highest honours to the memory of his father Domitius He left the management of affairs both public and private to his mother The word which he gave the first day of his reign to the tribune on guard was The three hundred forty three Best of Mothers and afterwards he frequently appeared with her in the streets of Rome in her litter He settled a colony at Antium in which he placed the veteran soldiers belonging to the guards and obliged several of the richest centurions of the first rank to transfer their residence to that place where he likewise made a noble harbour at a prodigious expense five hundred sixty eight X To establish still further his character he declared that he designed to govern according to the model of Augustus and omitted no opportunity of showing his generosity clemency and complaisance The more burthensome taxes he either entirely took off or diminished The rewards appointed for informers by the Papian law he reduced to a fourth part and distributed to the people four hundred sesterces a man To the noblest of the senators who were much reduced in their circumstances he granted annual allowances in some cases as much as five hundred thousand sesterces and to the pretorian cohorts a monthly allowance of corn gratis When called upon to subscribe the sentence according to custom of a criminal condemned to die I wish said he I had never learnt to read and write He continually saluted people of the several orders by name without a prompter When the senate returned him their thanks for his good government he replied to them It will be time enough to do so when I shall have deserved it He admitted the common people to see him perform his exercises in the Campus Martius He frequently declaimed in public and recited verses of his own composing not only at home but in the theatre so much to the joy of all the people that public prayers were appointed to be put up to the gods upon that account and the verses which had been publicly read were after being written in gold letters consecrated to Jupiter Capitolinus three hundred forty four XI He presented the people with a great number and variety of spectacles as the Juvenal and Circensian games stage plays and an exhibition of gladiators In the Juvenal he even admitted senators and aged matrons to perform parts In the Circensian games he assigned the equestrian order seats apart from the rest of the people and had races performed by chariots drawn each by four camels In the games which he instituted for the eternal duration of the empire and therefore ordered to be called Maximi many of the senatorian and equestrian order of both sexes performed A distinguished Roman knight descended on the stage by a rope mounted on an elephant A Roman play likewise composed by Afranius was brought upon the stage It was entitled The Fire and in it the performers were allowed to carry off and to keep to themselves the furniture of the house which as the plot of the play required was burnt down in the theatre Every day during the solemnity many thousand articles of all descriptions were thrown amongst the people to scramble for such as fowls of different kinds tickets for corn clothes gold silver gems pearls pictures slaves beasts of burden wild beasts that had been tamed at last ships lots of houses and lands were offered as prizes in a lottery XII These games he beheld from the front of the proscenium In the show of gladiators which he exhibited in a wooden amphitheatre built within a year in the district of the Campus Martius five hundred sixty nine he ordered that none should be slain not even the condemned criminals employed in the combats He secured four hundred senators and six hundred Roman knights amongst whom were some of unbroken fortunes and unblemished reputation to act as gladiators From the same orders he engaged persons to encounter wild beasts and for various other services in the theatre He presented the public with the representation of a naval fight upon sea water with huge fishes swimming in it as also with the Pyrrhic dance performed by certain youths to each of whom after the performance was over he granted the freedom of Rome During this diversion a bull covered Pasiphae concealed within a wooden statue of a cow as many of the spectators believed Icarus upon his first attempt to fly fell on the stage close to three hundred forty five the emperor s pavilion and bespattered him with blood For he very seldom presided in the games but used to view them reclining on a couch at first through some narrow apertures but afterwards with the Podium five hundred seventy quite open He was the first who instituted five hundred seventy one in imitation of the Greeks a trial of skill in the three several exercises of music wrestling and horse racing to be performed at Rome every five years and which he called Neronia Upon the dedication of his bath five hundred seventy two and gymnasium he furnished the senate and the equestrian order with oil He appointed as judges of the trial men of consular rank chosen by lot who sat with the praetors At this time he went down into the orchestra amongst the senators and received the crown for the best performance in Latin prose and verse for which several persons of the greatest merit contended but they unanimously yielded to him The crown for the best performer on the harp being likewise awarded to him by the judges he devoutly saluted it and ordered it to be carried to the statue of Augustus In the gymnastic exercises which he presented in the Septa while they were preparing the great sacrifice of an ox he shaved his beard for the first time five hundred seventy three and putting it up in a casket of gold studded with pearls of great price consecrated it to Jupiter Capitolinus He invited the Vestal Virgins to see the three hundred forty six wrestlers perform because at Olympia the priestesses of Ceres are allowed the privilege of witnessing that exhibition XIII Amongst the spectacles presented by him the solemn entrance of Tiridates five hundred seventy four into the city deserves to be mentioned This personage who was king of Armenia he invited to Rome by very liberal promises But being prevented by unfavourable weather from showing him to the people upon the day fixed by proclamation he took the first opportunity which occurred several cohorts being drawn up under arms about the temples in the forum while he was seated on a curule chair on the rostra in a triumphal dress amidst the military standards and ensigns Upon Tiridates advancing towards him on a stage made shelving for the purpose he permitted him to throw himself at his feet but quickly raised him with his right hand and kissed him The emperor then at the king s request took the turban from his head and replaced it by a crown whilst a person of pretorian rank proclaimed in Latin the words in which the prince addressed the emperor as a suppliant After this ceremony the king was conducted to the theatre where after renewing his obeisance Nero seated him on his right hand Being then greeted by universal acclamation with the title of Emperor and sending his laurel crown to the Capitol Nero shut the temple of the two faced Janus as though there now existed no war throughout the Roman empire XIV He filled the consulship four times five hundred seventy five the first for two months the second and last for six and the third for four the two intermediate ones he held successively but the others after an interval of some years between them XV In the administration of justice he scarcely ever gave his decision on the pleadings before the next day and then in writing His manner of hearing causes was not to allow any adjournment but to dispatch them in order as they stood When he withdrew to consult his assessors he did not debate the matter openly with them but silently and privately reading over their opinions which they gave separately in writing three hundred forty seven he pronounced sentence from the tribunal according to his own view of the case as if it was the opinion of the majority For a long time he would not admit the sons of freedmen into the senate and those who had been admitted by former princes he excluded from all public offices To supernumerary candidates he gave command in the legions to comfort them under the delay of their hopes The consulship he commonly conferred for six months and one of the two consuls dying a little before the first of January he substituted no one in his place disliking what had been formerly done for Caninius Rebilus on such an occasion who was consul for one day only He allowed the triumphal honours only to those who were of quaestorian rank and to some of the equestrian order and bestowed them without regard to military service And instead of the quaestors whose office it properly was he frequently ordered that the addresses which he sent to the senate on certain occasions should be read by the consuls XVI He devised a new style of building in the city ordering piazzas to be erected before all houses both in the streets and detached to give facilities from their terraces in case of fire for preventing it from spreading and these he built at his own expense He likewise designed to extend the city walls as far as Ostia and bring the sea from thence by a canal into the old city Many severe regulations and new orders were made in his time A sumptuary law was enacted Public suppers were limited to the Sportulae five hundred seventy six and victualling houses restrained from selling any dressed victuals except pulse and herbs whereas before they sold all kinds of meat He likewise inflicted punishments on the Christians a sort of people who held a new and impious five hundred seventy seven superstition three hundred forty eight He forbad the revels of the charioteers who had long assumed a licence to stroll about and established for themselves a kind of prescriptive right to cheat and thieve making a jest of it The partisans of the rival theatrical performers were banished as well as the actors themselves XVII To prevent forgery a method was then first invented of having writings bored run through three times with a thread and then sealed It was likewise provided that in wills the two first pages with only the testator s name upon them should be presented blank to those who were to sign them as witnesses and that no one who wrote a will for another should insert any legacy for himself It was likewise ordained that clients should pay their advocates a certain reasonable fee but nothing for the court which was to be gratuitous the charges for it being paid out of the public treasury that causes the cognizance of which before belonged to the judges of the exchequer should be transferred to the forum and the ordinary tribunals and that all appeals from the judges should be made to the senate XVIII He never entertained the least ambition or hope of augmenting and extending the frontiers of the empire On the contrary he had thoughts of withdrawing the troops from Britain and was only restrained from so doing by the fear of appearing to detract from the glory of his father five hundred seventy eight All three hundred forty nine that he did was to reduce the kingdom of Pontus which was ceded to him by Polemon and also the Alps five hundred seventy nine upon the death of Cottius into the form of a province XIX Twice only he undertook any foreign expeditions one to Alexandria and the other to Achaia but he abandoned the prosecution of the former on the very day fixed for his departure by being deterred both by ill omens and the hazard of the voyage For while he was making the circuit of the temples having seated himself in that of Vesta when he attempted to rise the skirt of his robe stuck fast and he was instantly seized with such a dimness in his eyes that he could not see a yard before him In Achaia he attempted to make a cut through the Isthmus five hundred eighty and having made a speech encouraging his pretorians to set about the work on a signal given by sound of trumpet he first broke ground with a spade and carried off a basket full of earth upon his shoulders He made preparations for an expedition to the Pass of the Caspian mountains five hundred eighty one forming a new legion out of his late levies in Italy of men all six feet high which he called the phalanx of Alexander the Great These transactions in part unexceptionable and in part highly commendable I have brought into one view in order to separate them from the scandalous and criminal part of his conduct of which I shall now give an account XX Among the other liberal arts which he was taught in his youth he was instructed in music and immediately after three hundred fifty his advancement to the empire he sent for Terpnus a performer upon the harp five hundred eighty two who flourished at that time with the highest reputation Sitting with him for several days following as he sang and played after supper until late at night he began by degrees to practise upon the instrument himself Nor did he omit any of those expedients which artists in music adopt for the preservation and improvement of their voices He would lie upon his back with a sheet of lead upon his breast clear his stomach and bowels by vomits and clysters and forbear the eating of fruits or food prejudicial to the voice Encouraged by his proficiency though his voice was naturally neither loud nor clear he was desirous of appearing upon the stage frequently repeating amongst his friends a Greek proverb to this effect that no one had any regard for music which they never heard Accordingly he made his first public appearance at Naples and although the theatre quivered with the sudden shock of an earthquake he did not desist until he had finished the piece of music he had begun He played and sung in the same place several times and for several days together taking only now and then a little respite to refresh his voice Impatient of retirement it was his custom to go from the bath to the theatre and after dining in the orchestra amidst a crowded assembly of the people he promised them in Greek five hundred eighty three that after he had drank a little he would give them a tune which would make their ears tingle Being highly pleased with the songs that were sung in his praise by some Alexandrians belonging to the fleet just arrived at Naples five hundred eighty four he sent for more of the like singers from Alexandria At the same time he chose young men of the equestrian order and above five thousand robust young fellows from the common people on purpose to learn various kinds of applause called bombi imbrices and testae five hundred eighty five which they were to practise in his favour whenever he performed They were three hundred fifty one divided into several parties and were remarkable for their fine heads of hair and were extremely well dressed with rings upon their left hands The leaders of these bands had salaries of forty thousand sesterces allowed them XXI At Rome also being extremely proud of his singing he ordered the games called Neronia to be celebrated before the time fixed for their return All now becoming importunate to hear his heavenly voice he informed them that he would gratify those who desired it at the gardens But the soldiers then on guard seconding the voice of the people he promised to comply with their request immediately and with all his heart He instantly ordered his name to be entered upon the list of musicians who proposed to contend and having thrown his lot into the urn among the rest took his turn and entered attended by the prefects of the pretorian cohorts bearing his harp and followed by the military tribunes and several of his intimate friends After he had taken his station and made the usual prelude he commanded Cluvius Rufus a man of consular rank to proclaim in the theatre that he intended to sing the story of Niobe This he accordingly did and continued it until nearly ten o clock but deferred the disposal of the crown and the remaining part of the solemnity until the next year that he might have more frequent opportunities of performing But that being too long he could not refrain from often appearing as a public performer during the interval He made no scruple of exhibiting on the stage even in the spectacles presented to the people by private persons and was offered by one of the praetors no less than a million of sesterces for his services He likewise sang tragedies in a mask the visors of the heroes and gods as also of the heroines and goddesses being formed into a resemblance of his own face and that of any woman he was in love with Amongst the rest he sung Canace in Labour five hundred eighty six Orestes the Murderer of his Mother Oedipus three hundred fifty two Blinded and Hercules Mad In the last tragedy it is said that a young sentinel posted at the entrance of the stage seeing him in a prison dress and bound with fetters as the fable of the play required ran to his assistance XXII He had from his childhood an extravagant passion for horses and his constant talk was of the Circensian races notwithstanding it was prohibited him Lamenting once among his fellow pupils the case of a charioteer of the green party who was dragged round the circus at the tail of his chariot and being reprimanded by his tutor for it he pretended that he was talking of Hector In the beginning of his reign he used to amuse himself daily with chariots drawn by four horses made of ivory upon a table He attended at all the lesser exhibitions in the circus at first privately but at last openly so that nobody ever doubted of his presence on any particular day Nor did he conceal his desire to have the number of the prizes doubled so that the races being increased accordingly the diversion continued until a late hour the leaders of parties refusing now to bring out their companies for any time less than the whole day Upon this he took a fancy for driving the chariot himself and that even publicly Having made his first experiment in the gardens amidst crowds of slaves and other rabble he at length performed in the view of all the people in the Circus Maximus whilst one of his freedmen dropped the napkin in the place where the magistrates used to give the signal Not satisfied with exhibiting various specimens of his skill in those arts at Rome he went over to Achaia as has been already said principally for this purpose The several cities in which solemn trials of musical skill used to be publicly held had resolved to send him the crowns belonging to those who bore away the prize These he accepted so graciously that he not only gave the deputies who brought them an immediate audience but even invited them to his table Being requested by some of them to sing at supper and prodigiously applauded he said the Greeks were the only people who has an ear for music and were the only good judges of him and his attainments Without delay he commenced his journey and on his arrival at Cassiope five hundred eighty seven three hundred fifty two exhibited his first musical performance before the altar of Jupiter Cassius XXIII He afterwards appeared at the celebration of all public games in Greece for such as fell in different years he brought within the compass of one and some he ordered to be celebrated a second time in the same year At Olympia likewise contrary to custom he appointed a public performance in music and that he might meet with no interruption in this employment when he was informed by his freedman Helius that affairs at Rome required his presence he wrote to him in these words Though now all your hopes and wishes are for my speedy return yet you ought rather to advise and hope that I may come back with a character worthy of Nero During the time of his musical performance nobody was allowed to stir out of the theatre upon any account however necessary insomuch that it is said some women with child were delivered there Many of the spectators being quite wearied with hearing and applauding him because the town gates were shut slipped privately over the walls or counterfeiting themselves dead were carried out for their funeral With what extreme anxiety he engaged in these contests with what keen desire to bear away the prize and with how much awe of the judges is scarcely to be believed As if his adversaries had been on a level with himself he would watch them narrowly defame them privately and sometimes upon meeting them rail at them in very scurrilous language or bribe them if they were better performers than himself He always addressed the judges with the most profound reverence before he began telling them he had done all things that were necessary by way of preparation but that the issue of the approaching trial was in the hand of fortune and that they as wise and skilful men ought to exclude from their judgment things merely accidental Upon their encouraging him to have a good heart he went off with more assurance but not entirely free from anxiety interpreting the silence and modesty of some of them into sourness and ill nature and saying that he was suspicious of them XXIV In these contests he adhered so strictly to the rules three hundred fifty four that he never durst spit nor wipe the sweat from his forehead in any other way than with his sleeve Having in the performance of a tragedy dropped his sceptre and not quickly recovering it he was in a great fright lest he should be set aside for the miscarriage and could not regain his assurance until an actor who stood by swore he was certain it had not been observed in the midst of the acclamations and exultations of the people When the prize was adjudged to him he always proclaimed it himself and even entered the lists with the heralds That no memory or the least monument might remain of any other victor in the sacred Grecian games he ordered all their statues and pictures to be pulled down dragged away with hooks and thrown into the common sewers He drove the chariot with various numbers of horses and at the Olympic games with no fewer than ten though in a poem of his he had reflected upon Mithridates for that innovation Being thrown out of his chariot he was again replaced but could not retain his seat and was obliged to give up before he reached the goal but was crowned notwithstanding On his departure he declared the whole province a free country and conferred upon the judges in the several games the freedom of Rome with large sums of money All these favours he proclaimed himself with his own voice from the middle of the Stadium during the solemnity of the Isthmian games XXV On his return from Greece arriving at Naples because he had commenced his career as a public performer in that city he made his entrance in a chariot drawn by white horses through a breach in the city wall according to the practice of those who were victorious in the sacred Grecian games In the same manner he entered Antium Alba and Rome He made his entry into the city riding in the same chariot in which Augustus had triumphed in a purple tunic and a cloak embroidered with golden stars having on his head the crown won at Olympia and in his right hand that which was given him at the Parthian games the rest being carried in a procession before him with inscriptions denoting the places where they had been won from whom and in what plays or musical performances whilst a train followed him with loud acclamations crying out that they three hundred fifty five were the emperor s attendants and the soldiers of his triumph Having then caused an arch of the Circus Maximus five hundred eighty eight to be taken down he passed through the breach as also through the Velabrum five hundred eighty nine and the forum to the Palatine hill and the temple of Apollo Everywhere as he marched along victims were slain whilst the streets were strewed with saffron and birds chaplets and sweetmeats scattered abroad He suspended the sacred crowns in his chamber about his beds and caused statues of himself to be erected in the attire of a harper and had his likeness stamped upon the coin in the same dress After this period he was so far from abating any thing of his application to music that for the preservation of his voice he never addressed the soldiers but by messages or with some person to deliver his speeches for him when he thought fit to make his appearance amongst them Nor did he ever do any thing either in jest or earnest without a voice master standing by him to caution him against overstraining his vocal organs and to apply a handkerchief to his mouth when he did He offered his friendship or avowed three hundred fifty six open enmity to many according as they were lavish or sparing in giving him their applause XXVI Petulancy lewdness luxury avarice and cruelty he practised at first with reserve and in private as if prompted to them only by the folly of youth but even then the world was of opinion that they were the faults of his nature and not of his age After it was dark he used to enter the taverns disguised in a cap or a wig and ramble about the streets in sport which was not void of mischief He used to beat those he met coming home from supper and if they made any resistance would wound them and throw them into the common sewer He broke open and robbed shops establishing an auction at home for selling his booty In the scuffles which took place on those occasions he often ran the hazard of losing his eyes and even his life being beaten almost to death by a senator for handling his wife indecently After this adventure he never again ventured abroad at that time of night without some tribunes following him at a little distance In the day time he would be carried to the theatre incognito in a litter placing himself upon the upper part of the proscenium where he not only witnessed the quarrels which arose on account of the performances but also encouraged them When they came to blows and stones and pieces of broken benches began to fly about he threw them plentifully amongst the people and once even broke a praetor s head XXVII His vices gaining strength by degrees he laid aside his jocular amusements and all disguise breaking out into enormous crimes without the least attempt to conceal them His revels were prolonged from mid day to midnight while he was frequently refreshed by warm baths and in the summer time by such as were cooled with snow He often supped in public in the Naumachia with the sluices shut or in the Campus Martius or the Circus Maximus being waited upon at table by common prostitutes of the town and Syrian strumpets and glee girls As often as he went down the Tiber to Ostia or coasted through the gulf of Baiae booths furnished as brothels and eating houses were erected along the shore and river banks before which stood matrons who like bawds and hostesses allured him to land It was also his custom to invite three hundred fifty seven himself to supper with his friends at one of which was expended no less than four millions of sesterces in chaplets and at another something more in roses XXVIII Besides the abuse of free born lads and the debauch of married women he committed a rape upon Rubria a Vestal Virgin He was upon the point of marrying Acte five hundred ninety his freedwoman having suborned some men of consular rank to swear that she was of royal descent He gelded the boy Sporus and endeavoured to transform him into a woman He even went so far as to marry him with all the usual formalities of a marriage settlement the rose coloured nuptial veil and a numerous company at the wedding When the ceremony was over he had him conducted like a bride to his own house and treated him as his wife five hundred ninety one It was jocularly observed by some person that it would have been well for mankind had such a wife fallen to the lot of his father Domitius This Sporus he carried about with him in a litter round the solemn assemblies and fairs of Greece and afterwards at Rome through the Sigillaria five hundred ninety two dressed in the rich attire of an empress kissing him from time to time as they rode together That he entertained an incestuous passion for his mother five hundred ninety three but was deterred by her enemies for fear that this haughty and overbearing woman should by her compliance get him entirely into her power and govern in every thing was universally believed especially after he had introduced amongst his concubines a strumpet who was reported to have a strong resemblance to Agrippina five hundred ninety four XXIX He prostituted his own chastity to such a degree that three hundred fifty eight after he had defiled every part of his person with some unnatural pollution he at last invented an extraordinary kind of diversion which was to be let out of a den in the arena covered with the skin of a wild beast and then assail with violence the private parts both of men and women while they were bound to stakes After he had vented his furious passion upon them he finished the play in the embraces of his freedman Doryphorus five hundred ninety five to whom he was married in the same way that Sporus had been married to himself imitating the cries and shrieks of young virgins when they are ravished I have been informed from numerous sources that he firmly believed no man in the world to be chaste or any part of his person undefiled but that most men concealed that vice and were cunning enough to keep it secret To those therefore who frankly owned their unnatural lewdness he forgave all other crimes XXX He thought there was no other use of riches and money than to squander them away profusely regarding all those as sordid wretches who kept their expenses within due bounds and extolling those as truly noble and generous souls who lavished away and wasted all they possessed He praised and admired his uncle Caius five hundred ninety six upon no account more than for squandering in a short time the vast treasure left him by Tiberius Accordingly he was himself extravagant and profuse beyond all bounds He spent upon Tiridates eight hundred thousand sesterces a day a sum almost incredible and at his departure presented him with upwards of a million five hundred ninety seven He likewise bestowed upon Menecrates the harper and Spicillus a gladiator the estates and houses of men who had received the honour of a triumph He enriched the usurer Cercopithecus Panerotes with estates both in town and country and gave him a funeral in pomp and magnificence little inferior to that of princes He never wore the same garment twice He three hundred fifty nine has been known to stake four hundred thousand sesterces on a throw of the dice It was his custom to fish with a golden net drawn by silken cords of purple and scarlet It is said that he never travelled with less than a thousand baggage carts the mules being all shod with silver and the drivers dressed in scarlet jackets of the finest Canusian cloth five hundred ninety eight with a numerous train of footmen and troops of Mazacans five hundred ninety nine with bracelets on their arms and mounted upon horses in splendid trappings XXXI In nothing was he more prodigal than in his buildings He completed his palace by continuing it from the Palatine to the Esquiline hill calling the building at first only The Passage but after it was burnt down and rebuilt The Golden House six hundred Of its dimensions and furniture it may be sufficient to say thus much the porch was so high that there stood in it a colossal statue of himself a hundred and twenty feet in height and the space included in it was so ample that it had triple porticos a mile in length and a lake like a sea surrounded with buildings which had the appearance of a city Within its area were corn fields vineyards pastures and woods containing a vast number of animals of various kinds both wild and tame In other parts it was entirely over laid with gold and adorned with jewels and mother of pearl The supper rooms were vaulted and compartments of the ceilings inlaid with ivory were made to revolve and scatter flowers while they contained pipes which three hundred sixty shed unguents upon the guests The chief banqueting room was circular and revolved perpetually night and day in imitation of the motion of the celestial bodies The baths were supplied with water from the sea and the Albula Upon the dedication of this magnificent house after it was finished all he said in approval of it was that he had now a dwelling fit for a man He commenced making a pond for the reception of all the hot streams from Baiae which he designed to have continued from Misenum to the Avernian lake in a conduit enclosed in galleries and also a canal from Avernum to Ostia that ships might pass from one to the other without a sea voyage The length of the proposed canal was one hundred and sixty miles and it was intended to be of breadth sufficient to permit ships with five banks of oars to pass each other For the execution of these designs he ordered all prisoners in every part of the empire to be brought to Italy and that even those who were convicted of the most heinous crimes in lieu of any other sentence should be condemned to work at them He was encouraged to all this wild and enormous profusion not only by the great revenue of the empire but by the sudden hopes given him of an immense hidden treasure which queen Dido upon her flight from Tyre had brought with her to Africa This a Roman knight pretended to assure him upon good grounds was still hid there in some deep caverns and might with a little labour be recovered XXXII But being disappointed in his expectations of this resource and reduced to such difficulties for want of money that he was obliged to defer paying his troops and the rewards due to the veterans he resolved upon supplying his necessities by means of false accusations and plunder In the first place he ordered that if any freedman without sufficient reason bore the name of the family to which he belonged the half instead of three fourths of his estate should be brought into the exchequer at his decease also that the estates of all such persons as had not in their wills been mindful of their prince should be confiscated and that the lawyers who had drawn or dictated such wills should be liable to a fine He ordained likewise that all words and actions upon which any informer could ground a prosecution should be deemed treason He demanded an equivalent for the crowns which the cities of three hundred sixty one Greece had at any time offered him in the solemn games Having forbad any one to use the colours of amethyst and Tyrian purple he privately sent a person to sell a few ounces of them upon the day of the Nundinae and then shut up all the merchants shops on the pretext that his edict had been violated It is said that as he was playing and singing in the theatre observing a married lady dressed in the purple which he had prohibited he pointed her out to his procurators upon which she was immediately dragged out of her seat and not only stripped of her clothes but her property He never nominated a person to any office without saying to him You know what I want and let us take care that nobody has any thing he can call his own At last he rifled many temples of the rich offerings with which they were stored and melted down all the gold and silver statues and amongst them those of the penates six hundred one which Galba afterwards restored XXXIII He began the practice of parricide and murder with Claudius himself for although he was not the contriver of his death he was privy to the plot Nor did he make any secret of it but used afterwards to commend in a Greek proverb mushrooms as food fit for the gods because Claudius had been poisoned with them He traduced his memory both by word and deed in the grossest manner one while charging him with folly another while with cruelty For he used to say by way of jest that he had ceased morari six hundred two amongst men pronouncing the first syllable long and treated as null many of his decrees and ordinances as made by a doting old blockhead He enclosed the place where his body was burnt with only a low wall of rough masonry He attempted to poison three hundred sixty two Britannicus as much out of envy because he had a sweeter voice as from apprehension of what might ensue from the respect which the people entertained for his father s memory He employed for this purpose a woman named Locusta who had been a witness against some persons guilty of like practices But the poison she gave him working more slowly than he expected and only causing a purge he sent for the woman and beat her with his own hand charging her with administering an antidote instead of poison and upon her alleging in excuse that she had given Britannicus but a gentle mixture in order to prevent suspicion Think you said he that I am afraid of the Julian law and obliged her to prepare in his own chamber and before his eyes as quick and strong a dose as possible This he tried upon a kid but the animal lingering for five hours before it expired he ordered her to go to work again and when she had done he gave the poison to a pig which dying immediately he commanded the potion to be brought into the eating room and given to Britannicus while he was at supper with him The prince had no sooner tasted it than he sunk on the floor Nero meanwhile pretending to the guests that it was only a fit of the falling sickness to which he said he was subject He buried him the following day in a mean and hurried way during violent storms of rain He gave Locusta a pardon and rewarded her with a great estate in land placing some disciples with her to be instructed in her trade XXXIV His mother being used to make strict inquiry into what he said or did and to reprimand him with the freedom of a parent he was so much offended that he endeavoured to expose her to public resentment by frequently pretending a resolution to quit the government and retire to Rhodes Soon afterwards he deprived her of all honour and power took from her the guard of Roman and German soldiers banished her from the palace and from his society and persecuted her in every way he could contrive employing persons to harass her when at Rome with law suits and to disturb her in her retirement from town with the most scurrilous and abusive language following her about by land and sea But being terrified with her menaces and violent spirit he resolved upon her destruction and thrice attempted it by poison Finding however three hundred sixty three that she had previously secured herself by antidotes he contrived machinery by which the floor over her bed chamber might be made to fall upon her while she was asleep in the night This design miscarrying likewise through the little caution used by those who were in the secret his next stratagem was to construct a ship which could be easily shivered in hopes of destroying her either by drowning or by the deck above her cabin crushing her in its fall Accordingly under colour of a pretended reconciliation he wrote her an extremely affectionate letter inviting her to Baiae to celebrate with him the festival of Minerva He had given private orders to the captains of the galleys which were to attend her to shatter to pieces the ship in which she had come by falling foul of it but in such manner that it might appear to be done accidentally He prolonged the entertainment for the more convenient opportunity of executing the plot in the night and at her return for Bauli six hundred three instead of the old ship which had conveyed her to Baiae he offered that which he had contrived for her destruction He attended her to the vessel in a very cheerful mood and at parting with her kissed her breasts after which he sat up very late in the night waiting with great anxiety to learn the issue of his project But receiving information that every thing had fallen out contrary to his wish and that she had saved herself by swimming not knowing what course to take upon her freedman Lucius Agerinus bringing word with great joy that she was safe and well he privately dropped a poniard by him He then commanded the freedman to be seized and put in chains under pretence of his having been employed by his mother to assassinate him at the same time ordering her to be put to death and giving out that to avoid punishment for her intended crime she had laid violent hands upon herself Other circumstances still more horrible are related on good authority as that he went to view her corpse and handling her limbs pointed out some blemishes and commended other points and that growing thirsty during the survey he called for drink Yet he was never afterwards able to bear the stings of his own conscience for this atrocious act although encouraged by the congratulatory addresses of the army the senate and people He frequently affirmed that he was haunted by his mother s ghost and persecuted with the whips three hundred sixty four and burning torches of the Furies Nay he attempted by magical rites to bring up her ghost from below and soften her rage against him When he was in Greece he durst not attend the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries at the initiation of which impious and wicked persons are warned by the voice of the herald from approaching the rites six hundred four Besides the murder of his mother he had been guilty of that of his aunt for being obliged to keep her bed in consequence of a complaint in her bowels he paid her a visit and she being then advanced in years stroking his downy chin in the tenderness of affection said to him May I but live to see the day when this is shaved for the first time six hundred five and I shall then die contented He turned however to those about him made a jest of it saying that he would have his beard immediately taken off and ordered the physicians to give her more violent purgatives He seized upon her estate before she had expired suppressing her will that he might enjoy the whole himself XXXV He had besides Octavia two other wives Poppaea Sabina whose father had borne the office of quaestor and who had been married before to a Roman knight and after her Statilia Messalina great grand daughter of Taurus six hundred six who was twice consul and received the honour of a triumph To obtain possession of her he put to death her husband Atticus Vestinus who was then consul He soon became disgusted with Octavia and ceased from having any intercourse with her and being censured by his friends for it he replied She ought to be satisfied with having the rank and appendages of his wife Soon afterwards he made several attempts but in vain to strangle her and then divorced her for barrenness But the people disapproving of the divorce and making severe comments upon it he also banished her six hundred seven At last he three hundred sixty five put her to death upon a charge of adultery so impudent and false that when all those who were put to the torture positively denied their knowledge of it he suborned his pedagogue Anicetus to affirm that he had secretly intrigued with and debauched her He married Poppaea twelve days after the divorce of Octavia six hundred eight and entertained a great affection for her but nevertheless killed her with a kick which he gave her when she was big with child and in bad health only because she found fault with him for returning late from driving his chariot He had by her a daughter Claudia Augusta who died an infant There was no person at all connected with him who escaped his deadly and unjust cruelty Under pretence of her being engaged in a plot against him he put to death Antonia Claudius s daughter who refused to marry him after the death of Poppaea In the same way he destroyed all who were allied to him either by blood or marriage amongst whom was young Aulus Plautinus He first compelled him to submit to his unnatural lust and then ordered him to be executed crying out Let my mother bestow her kisses on my successor thus defiled pretending that he had been his mothers paramour and by her encouraged to aspire to the empire His step son Rufinus Crispinus Poppaea s son though a minor he ordered to be drowned in the sea while he was fishing by his own slaves because he was reported to act frequently amongst his play fellows the part of a general or an emperor He banished Tuscus his nurse s son for presuming when he was procurator of Egypt to wash in the baths which had been constructed in expectation of his own coming Seneca his preceptor he forced to kill himself six hundred nine though upon his desiring leave to retire and offering to surrender his estate he solemnly swore that there was no foundation for his suspicions and that he would perish himself sooner than hurt him Having promised Burrhus the pretorian prefect a remedy for a swelling in his throat he sent him poison Some old rich freedmen of Claudius who had formerly not only promoted three hundred sixty six his adoption but were also instrumental to his advancement to the empire and had been his governors he took off by poison given them in their meat or drink XXXVI Nor did he proceed with less cruelty against those who were not of his family A blazing star which is vulgarly supposed to portend destruction to kings and princes appeared above the horizon several nights successively six hundred ten He felt great anxiety on account of this phenomenon and being informed by one Babilus an astrologer that princes were used to expiate such omens by the sacrifice of illustrious persons and so avert the danger foreboded to their own persons by bringing it on the heads of their chief men he resolved on the destruction of the principal nobility in Rome He was the more encouraged to this because he had some plausible pretence for carrying it into execution from the discovery of two conspiracies against him the former and more dangerous of which was that formed by Piso six hundred eleven and discovered at Rome the other was that of Vinicius six hundred twelve at Beneventum The conspirators were brought to their trials loaded with triple fetters Some ingenuously confessed the charge others avowed that they thought the design against his life an act of favour for which he was obliged to them as it was impossible in any other way than by death to relieve a person rendered infamous by crimes of the greatest enormity The children of those who had been condemned were banished the city and afterwards either poisoned or starved to death It is asserted that some of them with their tutors and the slaves who carried their satchels were all poisoned together at one dinner and others not suffered to seek their daily bread XXXVII From this period he butchered without distinction or quarter all whom his caprice suggested as objects for his cruelty and upon the most frivolous pretences To mention only a few Salvidienus Orfitus was accused of letting three hundred sixty seven out three taverns attached to his house in the Forum to some cities for the use of their deputies at Rome The charge against Cassius Longinus a lawyer who had lost his sight was that he kept amongst the busts of his ancestors that of Caius Cassius who was concerned in the death of Julius Caesar The only charge objected against Paetus Thrasea was that he had a melancholy cast of features and looked like a schoolmaster He allowed but one hour to those whom he obliged to kill themselves and to prevent delay he sent them physicians to cure them immediately if they lingered beyond that time for so he called bleeding them to death There was at that time an Egyptian of a most voracious appetite who would digest raw flesh or any thing else that was given him It was credibly reported that the emperor was extremely desirous of furnishing him with living men to tear and devour Being elated with his great success in the perpetration of crimes he declared that no prince before himself ever knew the extent of his power He threw out strong intimations that he would not even spare the senators who survived but would entirely extirpate that order and put the provinces and armies into the hands of the Roman knights and his own freedmen It is certain that he never gave or vouchsafed to allow any one the customary kiss either on entering or departing or even returned a salute And at the inauguration of a work the cut through the Isthmus six hundred thirteen he with a loud voice amidst the assembled multitude uttered a prayer that the undertaking might prove fortunate for himself and the Roman people without taking the smallest notice of the senate XXXVIII He spared moreover neither the people of Rome nor the capital of his country Somebody in conversation saying Emou thanontos gaia michthaeto pyri When I am dead let fire devour the world Nay said he let it be while I am living emou xontos And he acted accordingly for pretending to be disgusted with the old buildings and the narrow and winding streets he set the city on fire so openly that many of consular rank caught his own household servants on their property with tow and three hundred sixty eight torches in their hands but durst not meddle with them There being near his Golden House some granaries the site of which he exceedingly coveted they were battered as if with machines of war and set on fire the walls being built of stone During six days and seven nights this terrible devastation continued the people being obliged to fly to the tombs and monuments for lodging and shelter Meanwhile a vast number of stately buildings the houses of generals celebrated in former times and even then still decorated with the spoils of war were laid in ashes as well as the temples of the gods which had been vowed and dedicated by the kings of Rome and afterwards in the Punic and Gallic wars in short everything that was remarkable and worthy to be seen which time had spared six hundred fourteen This fire he beheld from a tower in the house of Mecaenas and being greatly delighted as he said with the beautiful effects of the conflagration he sung a poem on the ruin of Troy in the tragic dress he used on the stage To turn this calamity to his own advantage by plunder and rapine he promised to remove the bodies of those who had perished in the fire and clear the rubbish at his own expense suffering no one to meddle with the remains of their property But he not only received but exacted contributions on account of the loss until he had exhausted the means both of the provinces and private persons XXXIX To these terrible and shameful calamities brought upon the people by their prince were added some proceeding from misfortune Such were a pestilence by which within the space of one autumn there died no less than thirty thousand persons as appeared from the registers in the temple of Libitina a great disaster in Britain six hundred fifteen where two of the principal towns belonging to the Romans were plundered and a three hundred sixty nine dreadful havoc made both amongst our troops and allies a shameful discomfiture of the army of the East where in Armenia the legions were obliged to pass under the yoke and it was with great difficulty that Syria was retained Amidst all these disasters it was strange and indeed particularly remarkable that he bore nothing more patiently than the scurrilous language and railing abuse which was in every one s mouth treating no class of persons with more gentleness than those who assailed him with invective and lampoons Many things of that kind were posted up about the city or otherwise published both in Greek and Latin such as these Neron Orestaes Alkmaion maetroktonai Neonymphon six hundred sixteen Neron idian maeter apekteinen Orestes and Alcaeon Nero too The lustful Nero worst of all the crew Fresh from his bridal their own mothers slew Quis neget Aeneae magna de stirpe Neronem Sustulit hic matrem sustulit six hundred seventeen ille patrem Sprung from Aeneas pious wise and great Who says that Nero is degenerate Safe through the flames one bore his sire the other To save himself took off his loving mother Dum tendit citharam noster dum cornua Parthus Noster erit Paean ille Ekataebeletaes His lyre to harmony our Nero strings His arrows o er the plain the Parthian wings Ours call the tuneful Paean famed in war The other Phoebus name the god who shoots afar six hundred eighteen Roma domus fiet Vejos migrate Quirites Si non et Vejos occupat ista domus All Rome will be one house to Veii fly Should it not stretch to Veii by and by six hundred nineteen three hundred seventy But he neither made any inquiry after the authors nor when information was laid before the senate against some of them would he allow a severe sentence to be passed Isidorus the Cynic philosopher said to him aloud as he was passing along the streets You sing the misfortunes of Nauplius well but behave badly yourself And Datus a comic actor when repeating these words in the piece Farewell father Farewell mother mimicked the gestures of persons drinking and swimming significantly alluding to the deaths of Claudius and Agrippina and on uttering the last clause Orcus vobis ducit pedes You stand this moment on the brink of Orcus he plainly intimated his application of it to the precarious position of the senate Yet Nero only banished the player and philosopher from the city and Italy either because he was insensible to shame or from apprehension that if he discovered his vexation still keener things might be said of him XL The world after tolerating such an emperor for little less than fourteen years at length forsook him the Gauls headed by Julius Vindex who at that time governed the province as pro praetor being the first to revolt Nero had been formerly told by astrologers that it would be his fortune to be at last deserted by all the world and this occasioned that celebrated saying of his An artist can live in any country by which he meant to offer as an excuse for his practice of music that it was not only his amusement as a prince but might be his support when reduced to a private station Yet some of the astrologers promised him in his forlorn state the rule of the East and some in express words the kingdom of Jerusalem But the greater part of them flattered him with assurances of his being restored to his former fortune And being most inclined to believe the latter prediction upon losing Britain and Armenia he imagined he had run through all the misfortunes which the fates had decreed him But when upon consulting the oracle of Apollo at Delphi he was advised to beware of the seventy third year as if he were not to die till then never thinking of Galba s age he conceived such hopes not only of living to advanced years but of constant and singular good fortune that having lost some things of great value by shipwreck he scrupled not to say amongst his friends that three hundred seventy one the fishes would bring them back to him At Naples he heard of the insurrection in Gaul on the anniversary of the day on which he killed his mother and bore it with so much unconcern as to excite a suspicion that he was really glad of it since he had now a fair opportunity of plundering those wealthy provinces by the right of war Immediately going to the gymnasium he witnessed the exercise of the wrestlers with the greatest delight Being interrupted at supper with letters which brought yet worse news he expressed no greater resentment than only to threaten the rebels For eight days together he never attempted to answer any letters nor give any orders but buried the whole affair in profound silence XLI Being roused at last by numerous proclamations of Vindex treating him with reproaches and contempt he in a letter to the senate exhorted them to avenge his wrongs and those of the republic desiring them to excuse his not appearing in the senate house because he had got cold But nothing so much galled him as to find himself railed at as a pitiful harper and instead of Nero styled Aenobarbus which being his family name since he was upbraided with it he declared that he would resume it and lay aside the name he had taken by adoption Passing by the other accusations as wholly groundless he earnestly refuted that of his want of skill in an art upon which he had bestowed so much pains and in which he had arrived at such perfection asking frequently those about him if they knew any one who was a more accomplished musician But being alarmed by messengers after messengers of ill news from Gaul he returned in great consternation to Rome On the road his mind was somewhat relieved by observing the frivolous omen of a Gaulish soldier defeated and dragged by the hair by a Roman knight which was sculptured on a monument so that he leaped for joy and adored the heavens Even then he made no appeal either to the senate or people but calling together some of the leading men at his own house he held a hasty consultation upon the present state of affairs and then during the remainder of the day carried them about with him to view some musical instruments of a new invention which were played by water six hundred twenty three hundred seventy two exhibiting all the parts and discoursing upon the principles and difficulties of the contrivance which he told them he intended to produce in the theatre if Vindex would give him leave XLII Soon afterwards he received intelligence that Galba and the Spaniards had declared against him upon which he fainted and losing his reason lay a long time speechless apparently dead As soon as recovered from this state stupefaction he tore his clothes and beat his head crying out It is all over with me His nurse endeavouring to comfort him and telling him that the like things had happened to other princes before him he replied I am beyond all example wretched for I have lost an empire whilst I am still living He nevertheless abated nothing of his luxury and inattention to business Nay on the arrival of good news from the provinces he at a sumptuous entertainment sung with an air of merriment some jovial verses upon the leaders of the revolt which were made public and accompanied them with suitable gestures Being carried privately to the theatre he sent word to an actor who was applauded by the spectators that he had it all his own way now that he himself did not appear on the stage XLIII At the first breaking out of these troubles it is believed that he had formed many designs of a monstrous nature although conformable enough to his natural disposition These were to send new governors and commanders to the provinces and the armies and employ assassins to butcher all the former governors and commanders as men unanimously engaged in a conspiracy against him to massacre the exiles in every quarter and all the Gaulish population in Rome the former lest they should join the insurrection the latter as privy to the designs of their countrymen and ready to support three hundred seventy three them to abandon Gaul itself to be wasted and plundered by his armies to poison the whole senate at a feast to fire the city and then let loose the wild beasts upon the people in order to impede their stopping the progress of the flames But being deterred from the execution of these designs not so much by remorse of conscience as by despair of being able to effect them and judging an expedition into Gaul necessary he removed the consuls from their office before the time of its expiration was arrived and in their room assumed the consulship himself without a colleague as if the fates had decreed that Gaul should not be conquered but by a consul Upon assuming the fasces after an entertainment at the palace as he walked out of the room leaning on the arms of some of his friends he declared that as soon as he arrived in the province he would make his appearance amongst the troops unarmed and do nothing but weep and that after he had brought the mutineers to repentance he would the next day in the public rejoicings sing songs of triumph which he must now without loss of time apply himself to compose XLIV In preparing for this expedition his first care was to provide carriages for his musical instruments and machinery to be used upon the stage to have the hair of the concubines he carried with him dressed in the fashion of men and to supply them with battle axes and Amazonian bucklers He summoned the city tribes to enlist but no qualified persons appearing he ordered all masters to send a certain number of slaves the best they had not excepting their stewards and secretaries He commanded the several orders of the people to bring in a fixed proportion of their estates as they stood in the censor s books all tenants of houses and mansions to pay one year s rent forthwith into the exchequer and with unheard of strictness would receive only new coin of the purest silver and the finest gold insomuch that most people refused to pay crying out unanimously that he ought to squeeze the informers and oblige them to surrender their gains XLV The general odium in which he was held received an increase by the great scarcity of corn and an occurrence connected with it For as it happened just at that time there arrived from Alexandria a ship which was said to be freighted three hundred seventy four with dust for the wrestlers belonging to the emperor six hundred twenty one This so much inflamed the public rage that he was treated with the utmost abuse and scurrility Upon the top of one of his statues was placed the figure of a chariot with a Greek inscription that Now indeed he had a race to run let him be gone A little bag was tied about another with a ticket containing these words What could I do Truly thou hast merited the sack six hundred twenty two Some person likewise wrote on the pillars in the forum that he had even woke the cocks six hundred twenty three with his singing And many in the night time pretending to find fault with their servants frequently called for a Vindex six hundred twenty four XLVI He was also terrified with manifest warnings both old and new arising from dreams auspices and omens He had never been used to dream before the murder of his mother After that event he fancied in his sleep that he was steering a ship and that the rudder was forced from him that he was dragged by his wife Octavia into a prodigiously dark place and was at one time covered over with a vast swarm of winged ants and at another surrounded by the national images which were set up near Pompey s theatre and hindered from advancing farther that a Spanish jennet he was fond of had his hinder parts so changed as to resemble those of an ape and having his head only left unaltered neighed very harmoniously The doors of the mausoleum of Augustus flying open of themselves there issued from it a voice calling on him by name The Lares being adorned with fresh garlands on the calends the first of January fell down during the preparations for sacrificing to them While he was taking three hundred seventy five the omens Sporus presented him with a ring the stone of which had carved upon it the Rape of Proserpine When a great multitude of the several orders was assembled to attend at the solemnity of making vows to the gods it was a long time before the keys of the Capitol could be found And when in a speech of his to the senate against Vindex these words were read that the miscreants should be punished and soon make the end they merited they all cried out You will do it Augustus It was likewise remarked that the last tragic piece which he sung was Oedipus in Exile and that he fell as he was repeating this verse Thanein m anoge syngamos maetaer pataer Wife mother father force me to my end XLVII Meanwhile on the arrival of the news that the rest of the armies had declared against him he tore to pieces the letters which were delivered to him at dinner overthrew the table and dashed with violence against the ground two favourite cups which he called Homer s because some of that poet s verses were cut upon them Then taking from Locusta a dose of poison which he put up in a golden box he went into the Servilian gardens and thence dispatching a trusty freedman to Ostia with orders to make ready a fleet he endeavoured to prevail with some tribunes and centurions of the pretorian guards to attend him in his flight but part of them showing no great inclination to comply others absolutely refusing and one of them crying out aloud Usque adeone mori miserum est Say is it then so sad a thing to die six hundred twenty five he was in great perplexity whether he should submit himself to Galba or apply to the Parthians for protection or else appear before the people dressed in mourning and upon the rostra in the most piteous manner beg pardon for his past misdemeanors and if he could not prevail request of them to grant him at least the government of Egypt A speech to this purpose was afterwards found in his writing case But it is conjectured that he durst not venture upon this project for fear of being torn to pieces before he could get to the Forum Deferring therefore his resolution until the next three hundred seventy six day he awoke about midnight and finding the guards withdrawn he leaped out of bed and sent round for his friends But none of them vouchsafing any message in reply he went with a few attendants to their houses The doors being every where shut and no one giving him any answer he returned to his bed chamber whence those who had the charge of it had all now eloped some having gone one way and some another carrying off with them his bedding and box of poison He then endeavoured to find Spicillus the gladiator or some one to kill him but not being able to procure any one What said he have I then neither friend nor foe and immediately ran out as if he would throw himself into the Tiber XLVIII But this furious impulse subsiding he wished for some place of privacy where he might collect his thoughts and his freedman Phaon offering him his country house between the Salarian six hundred twenty six and Nomentan six hundred twenty seven roads about four miles from the city he mounted a horse barefoot as he was and in his tunic only slipping over it an old soiled cloak with his head muffled up and an handkerchief before his face and four persons only to attend him of whom Sporus was one He was suddenly struck with horror by an earthquake and by a flash of lightning which darted full in his face and heard from the neighbouring camp six hundred twenty eight the shouts of the soldiers wishing his destruction and prosperity to Galba He also heard a traveller they met on the road say They are three hundred seventy seven in pursuit of Nero and another ask Is there any news in the city about Nero Uncovering his face when his horse was started by the scent of a carcase which lay in the road he was recognized and saluted by an old soldier who had been discharged from the guards When they came to the lane which turned up to the house they quitted their horses and with much difficulty he wound among bushes and briars and along a track through a bed of rushes over which they spread their cloaks for him to walk on Having reached a wall at the back of the villa Phaon advised him to hide himself awhile in a sand pit when he replied I will not go under ground alive Staying there some little time while preparations were made for bringing him privately into the villa he took up some water out of a neighbouring tank in his hand to drink saying This is Nero s distilled water six hundred twenty nine Then his cloak having been torn by the brambles he pulled out the thorns which stuck in it At last being admitted creeping upon his hands and knees through a hole made for him in the wall he lay down in the first closet he came to upon a miserable pallet with an old coverlet thrown over it and being both hungry and thirsty though he refused some coarse bread that was brought him he drank a little warm water XLIX All who surrounded him now pressing him to save himself from the indignities which were ready to befall him he ordered a pit to be sunk before his eyes of the size of his body and the bottom to be covered with pieces of marble put together if any could be found about the house and water and wood six hundred thirty to be got ready for immediate use about his corpse weeping at every thing that was done and frequently saying What an artist is now about to perish Meanwhile letters being brought in by a servant belonging to Phaon he snatched them out of his hand and there read That he had been declared an enemy by the senate and that search was making for him that he might be punished according to the ancient custom of the Romans He then inquired what kind of punishment that was and being told that the three hundred seventy eight practice was to strip the criminal naked and scourge him to death while his neck was fastened within a forked stake he was so terrified that he took up two daggers which he had brought with him and after feeling the points of both put them up again saying The fatal hour is not yet come One while he begged of Sporus to begin to wail and lament another while he entreated that one of them would set him an example by killing himself and then again he condemned his own want of resolution in these words I yet live to my shame and disgrace this is not becoming for Nero it is not becoming Thou oughtest in such circumstances to have a good heart Come then courage man six hundred thirty one The horsemen who had received orders to bring him away alive were now approaching the house As soon as he heard them coming he uttered with a trembling voice the following verse Hippon m okupodon amphi ktupos ouata ballei six hundred thirty two The noise of swift heel d steeds assails my ears he drove a dagger into his throat being assisted in the act by Epaphroditus his secretary A centurion bursting in just as he was half dead and applying his cloak to the wound pretending that he was come to his assistance he made no other reply but this Tis too late and Is this your loyalty Immediately after pronouncing these words he expired with his eyes fixed and starting out of his head to the terror of all who beheld him He had requested of his attendants as the most essential favour that they would let no one have his head but that by all means his body might be burnt entire And this Icelus Galba s freedman granted He had but a little before been discharged from the prison into which he had been thrown when the disturbances first broke out L The expenses of his funeral amounted to two hundred thousand sesterces the bed upon which his body was carried to the pile and burnt being covered with the white robes interwoven with gold which he had worn upon the calends of January preceding His nurses Ecloge and Alexandra with his concubine Acte deposited his remains in the tomb belonging three hundred seventy nine to the family of the Domitii which stands upon the top of the Hill of the Gardens six hundred thirty three and is to be seen from the Campus Martius In that monument a coffin of porphyry with an altar of marble of Luna over it is enclosed by a wall built of stone brought from Thasos six hundred thirty four LI In stature he was a little below the common height his skin was foul and spotted his hair inclined to yellow his features were agreeable rather than handsome his eyes grey and dull his neck was thick his belly prominent his legs very slender his constitution sound For though excessively luxurious in his mode of living he had in the course of fourteen years only three fits of sickness which were so slight that he neither forbore the use of wine nor made any alteration in his usual diet In his dress and the care of his person he was so careless that he had his hair cut in rings one above another and when in Achaia he let it grow long behind and he generally appeared in public in the loose dress which he used at table with a handkerchief about his neck and without either a girdle or shoes LII He was instructed when a boy in the rudiments of almost all the liberal sciences but his mother diverted him from the study of philosophy as unsuited to one destined to be an emperor and his preceptor Seneca discouraged him from reading the ancient orators that he might longer secure his devotion to himself Therefore having a turn for poetry three hundred eighty he composed verses both with pleasure and ease nor did he as some think publish those of other writers as his own Several little pocket books and loose sheets have cone into my possession which contain some well known verses in his own hand and written in such a manner that it was very evident from the blotting and interlining that they had not been transcribed from a copy nor dictated by another but were written by the composer of them LIII He had likewise great taste for drawing and painting as well as for moulding statues in plaster But above all things he most eagerly coveted popularity being the rival of every man who obtained the applause of the people for any thing he did It was the general belief that after the crowns he won by his performances on the stage he would the next lustrum have taken his place among the wrestlers at the Olympic games For he was continually practising that art nor did he witness the gymnastic games in any part of Greece otherwise than sitting upon the ground in the stadium as the umpires do And if a pair of wrestlers happened to break the bounds he would with his own hands drag them back into the centre of the circle Because he was thought to equal Apollo in music and the sun in chariot driving he resolved also to imitate the achievements of Hercules And they say that a lion was got ready for him to kill either with a club or with a close hug in view of the people in the amphitheatre which he was to perform naked LIV Towards the end of his life he publicly vowed that if his power in the state was securely re established he would in the spectacles which he intended to exhibit in honour of his success include a performance upon organs six hundred thirty five as well as upon flutes and bagpipes and on the last day of the games would act in the play and take the part of Turnus as we find it in Virgil And there are some who say that he put to death the player Paris as a dangerous rival LV He had an insatiable desire to immortalize his name and acquire a reputation which should last through all succeeding ages but it was capriciously directed He therefore three hundred eighty one took from several things and places their former appellations and gave them new names derived from his own He called the month of April Neroneus and designed changing the name of Rome into that of Neropolis LVI He held all religious rites in contempt except those of the Syrian Goddess six hundred thirty six but at last he paid her so little reverence that he made water upon her being now engaged in another superstition in which only he obstinately persisted For having received from some obscure plebeian a little image of a girl as a preservative against plots and discovering a conspiracy immediately after he constantly worshipped his imaginary protectress as the greatest amongst the gods offering to her three sacrifices daily He was also desirous to have it supposed that he had by revelations from this deity a knowledge of future events A few months before he died he attended a sacrifice according to the Etruscan rites but the omens were not favourable LVII He died in the thirty second year of his age six hundred thirty seven upon the same day on which he had formerly put Octavia to death and the public joy was so great upon the occasion that the common people ran about the city with caps upon their heads Some however were not wanting who for a long time decked his tomb with spring and summer flowers Sometimes they placed his image upon the rostra dressed in robes of state at another they published proclamations in his name as if he were still alive and would shortly return to Rome and take vengeance on all his enemies Vologesus king of the Parthians when he sent ambassadors to the senate to renew his alliance with the Roman people earnestly requested that due honour should be paid to the memory of Nero and to conclude when twenty years afterwards at which time I was a young man six hundred thirty eight some person of obscure birth gave himself out for Nero that name secured him so favourable a reception three hundred eighty two from the Parthians that he was very zealously supported and it was with much difficulty that they were prevailed upon to give him up Though no law had ever passed for regulating the transmission of the imperial power yet the design of conveying it by lineal descent was implied in the practice of adoption By the rule of hereditary succession Britannicus the son of Claudius was the natural heir to the throne but he was supplanted by the artifices of his stepmother who had the address to procure it for her own son Nero From the time of Augustus it had been the custom of each of the new sovereigns to commence his reign in such a manner as tended to acquire popularity however much they all afterwards degenerated from those specious beginnings Whether this proceeded entirely from policy or that nature was not yet vitiated by the intoxication of uncontrolled power is uncertain but such were the excesses into which they afterwards plunged that we can scarcely exempt any of them except perhaps Claudius from the imputation of great original depravity The vicious temper of Tiberius was known to his own mother Livia that of Caligula had been obvious to those about him from his infancy Claudius seems to have had naturally a stronger tendency to weakness than to vice but the inherent wickedness of Nero was discovered at an early period by his preceptor Seneca Yet even this emperor commenced his reign in a manner which procured him approbation Of all the Roman emperors who had hitherto reigned he seems to have been most corrupted by profligate favourites who flattered his follies and vices to promote their own aggrandisement In the number of these was Tigellinus who met at last with the fate which he had so amply merited The several reigns from the death of Augustus present us with uncommon scenes of cruelty and horror but it was reserved for that of Nero to exhibit to the world the atrocious act of an emperor deliberately procuring the death of his mother Julia Agrippina was the daughter of Germanicus and married Domitius Aenobarbus by whom she had Nero At the death of Messalina she was a widow and Claudius her uncle entertaining a design of entering again into the married state she aspired to an incestuous alliance with him in competition with Lollia Paulina a woman of beauty and intrigue who had been married to C Caesar The two rivals were strongly supported by their three hundred eighty three respective parties but Agrippina by her superior interest with the emperor s favourites and the familiarity to which her near relation gave her a claim obtained the preference and the portentous nuptials of the emperor and his niece were publicly solemnized in the palace Whether she was prompted to this flagrant indecency by personal ambition alone or by the desire of procuring the succession to the empire for her son is uncertain but there remains no doubt of her having removed Claudius by poison with a view to the object now mentioned Besides Claudius she projected the death of L Silanus and she accomplished that of his brother Junius Silanus by means likewise of poison She appears to have been richly endowed with the gifts of nature but in her disposition intriguing violent imperious and ready to sacrifice every principle of virtue in the pursuit of supreme power or sensual gratification As she resembled Livia in the ambition of a mother and the means by which she indulged it so she more than equalled her in the ingratitude of an unnatural son and a parricide She is said to have left behind her some memoirs of which Tacitus availed himself in the composition of his Annals In this reign the conquest of the Britons still continued to be the principal object of military enterprise and Suetonius Paulinus was invested with the command of the Roman army employed in the reduction of that people The island of Mona now Anglesey being the chief seat of the Druids he resolved to commence his operations with attacking a place which was the centre of superstition and to which the vanquished Britons retreated as the last asylum of liberty The inhabitants endeavoured both by force of arms and the terrors of religion to obstruct his landing on this sacred island The women and Druids assembled promiscuously with the soldiers upon the shore where running about in wild disorder with flaming torches in their hands and pouring forth the most hideous exclamations they struck the Romans with consternation But Suetonius animating his troops they boldly attacked the inhabitants routed them in the field and burned the Druids in the same fires which had been prepared by those priests for the catastrophe of the invaders destroying at the same time all the consecrated groves and altars in the island Suetonius having thus triumphed over the religion of the Britons flattered himself with the hopes of soon effecting the reduction of the people But they encouraged by his absence had taken arms and under the conduct of Boadicea queen of the Iceni who had been treated in the most ignominious manner by the Roman tribunes had already driven the hateful invaders from their several settlements Suetonius hastened to three hundred eighty four the protection of London which was by this time a flourishing Roman colony but he found upon his arrival that any attempt to preserve it would be attended with the utmost danger to the army London therefore was reduced to ashes and the Romans and all strangers to the number of seventy thousand were put to the sword without distinction the Britons seeming determined to convince the enemy that they would acquiesce in no other terms than a total evacuation of the island This massacre however was revenged by Suetonius in a decisive engagement where eighty thousand of the Britons are said to have been killed after which Boadicea to avoid falling into the hands of the insolent conquerors put a period to her own life by means of poison It being judged unadvisable that Suetonius should any longer conduct the war against a people whom he had exasperated by his severity he was recalled and Petronius Turpilianus appointed in his room The command was afterwards given successively to Trebellius Maximus and Vettius Bolanus but the plan pursued by these generals was only to retain by a conciliatory administration the parts of the island which had already submitted to the Roman arms During these transactions in Britain Nero himself was exhibiting in Rome or some of the provinces such scenes of extravagance as almost exceed credibility In one place entering the lists amongst the competitors in a chariot race in another contending for victory with the common musicians on the stage revelling in open day in the company of the most abandoned prostitutes and the vilest of men in the night committing depredations on the peaceful inhabitants of the capital polluting with detestable lust or drenching with human blood the streets the palace and the habitations of private families and to crown his enormities setting fire to Rome while he sung with delight in beholding the dreadful conflagration In vain would history be ransacked for a parallel to this emperor who united the most shameful vices to the most extravagant vanity the most abject meanness to the strongest but most preposterous ambition and the whole of whose life was one continued scene of lewdness sensuality rapine cruelty and folly It is emphatically observed by Tacitus that Nero after the murder of many illustrious personages manifested a desire of extirpating virtue itself Among the excesses of Nero s reign are to be mentioned the horrible cruelties exercised against the Christians in various parts of the empire in which inhuman transactions the natural barbarity of the emperor was inflamed by the prejudices and interested policy of the pagan priesthood three hundred eighty five The tyrant scrupled not to charge them with the act of burning Rome and he satiated his fury against them by such outrages as are unexampled in history They were covered with the skins of wild beasts and torn by dogs were crucified and set on fire that they might serve for lights in the night time Nero offered his gardens for this spectacle and exhibited the games of the Circus by this dreadful illumination Sometimes they were covered with wax and other combustible materials after which a sharp stake was put under their chin to make them stand upright and they were burnt alive to give light to the spectators In the person of Nero it is observed by Suetonius the race of the Caesars became extinct a race rendered illustrious by the first and second emperors but which their successors no less disgraced The despotism of Julius Caesar though haughty and imperious was liberal and humane that of Augustus if we exclude a few instances of vindictive severity towards individuals was mild and conciliating but the reigns of Tiberius Caligula and Nero for we except Claudius from part of the censure while discriminated from each other by some peculiar circumstances exhibited the most flagrant acts of licentiousness and perverted authority The most abominable lust the most extravagant luxury the most shameful rapaciousness and the most inhuman cruelty constitute the general characteristics of those capricious and detestable tyrants Repeated experience now clearly refuted the opinion of Augustus that he had introduced amongst the Romans the best form of government but while we make this observation it is proper to remark that had he even restored the republic there is reason to believe that the nation would again have been soon distracted with internal divisions and a perpetual succession of civil wars The manners of the people were become too dissolute to be restrained by the authority of elective and temporary magistrates and the Romans were hastening to that fatal period when general and great corruption with its attendant debility would render them an easy prey to any foreign invaders But the odious government of the emperors was not the only grievance under which the people laboured in those disastrous times patrician avarice concurred with imperial rapacity to increase the sufferings of the nation The senators even during the commonwealth had become openly corrupt in the dispensation of public justice and under the government of the emperors pernicious abuse was practised to a yet greater extent That class being now equally with other Roman citizens dependent on the sovereign power their sentiments of duty and three hundred eighty six honour were degraded by the loss of their former dignity and being likewise deprived of the lucrative governments of provinces to which they had annually succeeded by an elective rotation in the times of the republic they endeavoured to compensate the reduction of their emoluments by an unbounded venality in the judicial decisions of the forum Every source of national happiness and prosperity was by this means destroyed The possession of property became precarious industry in all its branches was effectually discouraged and the amor patriae which had formerly been the animating principle of the nation was almost universally extinguished It is a circumstance corresponding to the general singularity of the present reign that of the few writers who flourished in it and whose works have been transmitted to posterity two ended their days by the order of the emperor and the third from indignation at his conduct These unfortunate victims were Seneca Petronius Arbiter and Lucan SENECA was born about six years before the Christian aera and gave early indication of uncommon talents His father who had come from Corduba to Rome was a man of letters particularly fond of declamation in which he instructed his son and placed him for the acquisition of philosophy under the most celebrated stoics of that age Young Seneca imbibing the precepts of the Pythagorean doctrine religiously abstained from eating the flesh of animals until Tiberius having threatened to punish some Jews and Egyptians who abstained from certain meats he was persuaded by his father to renounce the Pythagorean practice Seneca displayed the talents of an eloquent speaker but dreading the jealousy of Caligula who aspired to the same excellence he thought proper to abandon that pursuit and apply himself towards suing for the honours and offices of the state He accordingly obtained the place of quaestor in which office incurring the imputation of a scandalous amour with Julia Livia he removed from Rome and was banished by the emperor Claudius to Corsica Upon the marriage of Claudius with Agrippina Seneca was recalled from his exile in which he had remained near eight years and was appointed to superintend the education of Nero now destined to become the successor to the throne In the character of preceptor he appears to have acquitted himself with ability and credit though he has been charged by his enemies with having initiated his pupil in those detestable vices which disgraced the reign of Nero Could he have indeed been guilty of such immoral conduct it is probable that he would not so easily have three hundred eighty seven forfeited the favour of that emperor and it is more reasonable to suppose that his disapprobation of Nero s conduct was the real cause of that odium which soon after proved fatal to him By the enemies whom distinguished merit and virtue never fail to excite at a profligate court Seneca was accused of having maintained a criminal correspondence with Agrippina in the life time of Claudius but the chief author of this calumny was Suilius who had been banished from Rome at the instance of Seneca He was likewise charged with having amassed exorbitant riches with having built magnificent houses and formed beautiful gardens during the four years in which he had acted as preceptor to Nero This charge he considered as a prelude to his destruction which to avoid if possible he requested of the emperor to accept of the riches and possessions which he had acquired in his situation at court and to permit him to withdraw himself into a life of studious retirement Nero dissembling his secret intentions refused this request and Seneca that he might obviate all cause of suspicion or offence kept himself at home for some time under the pretext of indisposition Upon the breaking out of the conspiracy of Piso in which some of the principal senators were concerned Natalis the discoverer of the plot mentioned Seneca s name as an accessory There is however no satisfactory evidence that Seneca had any knowledge of the plot Piso according to the declaration of Natalis had complained that he never saw Seneca and the latter had observed in answer that it was not conducive to their common interest to see each other often Seneca likewise pleaded indisposition and said that his own life depended upon the safety of Piso s person Nero however glad of such an occasion of sacrificing the philosopher to his secret jealousy sent him an order to destroy himself When the messenger arrived with this mandate Seneca was sitting at table with his wife Paulina and two of his friends He heard the message not only with philosophical firmness but even with symptoms of joy and observed that such an honour might long have been expected from a man who had assassinated all his friends and even murdered his own mother The only request which he made was that he might be permitted to dispose of his possessions as he pleased but this was refused him Immediately turning himself to his friends who were weeping at his melancholy fate he said to them that since he could not leave them what he considered as his own property he should leave at least his own life for an example an innocence of conduct which they might imitate and by which they might acquire immortal fame He remonstrated with composure against their unavailing tears and three hundred eighty eight lamentations and asked them whether they had not learnt better to sustain the shocks of fortune and the violence of tyranny The emotions of his wife he endeavoured to allay with philosophical consolation and when she expressed a resolution to die with him he said that he was glad to find his example imitated with so much fortitude The veins of both were opened at the same time but Nero s command extending only to Seneca the life of Paulina was preserved and according to some authors she was not displeased at being prevented from carrying her precipitate resolution into effect Seneca s veins bleeding but slowly an opportunity was offered him of displaying in his last moments a philosophical magnanimity similar to that of Socrates and it appears that his conversation during this solemn period was maintained with dignified composure To accelerate his lingering fate he drank a dose of poison but this producing no effect he ordered his attendants to carry him into a warm bath for the purpose of rendering the haemorrhage from his veins more copious This expedient proving likewise ineffectual and the soldiers who witnessed the execution of the emperor s order being clamorous for its accomplishment he was removed into a stove and suffocated by the steam He underwent his fate on the twelfth of April in the sixty fifth year of the Christian aera and the fifty third year of his age His body was burnt and his ashes deposited in a private manner according to his will which had been made during the period when he was in the highest degree of favour with Nero The writings of Seneca are numerous and on various subjects His first composition addressed to Novacus is on Anger and continued through three books After giving a lively description of this passion the author discusses a variety of questions concerning it he argues strongly against its utility in contradiction to the peripatetics and recommends its restraint by many just and excellent considerations This treatise may be regarded in its general outlines as a philosophical amplification of the passage in Horace Ira furor brevis est animum rege qui nisi paret Imperat hunc fraenis hunc tu compesce catena Epist I ii Anger s a fitful madness rein thy mind Subdue the tyrant and in fetters bind Or be thyself the slave The next treatise is on Consolation addressed to his mother Helvia and was written during his exile He there informs his mother that he bears his banishment with fortitude and advises her to do the same He observes that in respect to himself three hundred eighty nine change of place poverty ignominy and contempt are not real evils that there may be two reasons for her anxiety on his account first that by his absence she is deprived of his protection and in the next place of the satisfaction arising from his company on both which heads he suggests a variety of pertinent observations Prefixed to this treatise are some epigrams written on the banishment of Seneca but whether or not by himself is uncertain Immediately subsequent to the preceding is another treatise on Consolation addressed to one of Claudius s freedmen named Polybius perhaps after the learned historian In this tract which is in several parts mutilated the author endeavours to console Polybius for the loss of a brother who had lately died The sentiments and admonitions are well suggested for the purpose but they are intermixed with such fulsome encomiums on the imperial domestic as degrade the dignity of the author and can be ascribed to no other motive than that of endeavouring to procure a recall from his exile through the interest of Polybius A fourth treatise on Consolation is addressed to Marcia a respectable and opulent lady the daughter of Cremutius Cordus by whose death she was deeply affected The author besides many consolatory arguments proposes for her imitation a number of examples by attending to which she may be enabled to overcome a passion that is founded only in too great sensibility of mind The subject is ingeniously prosecuted not without the occasional mixture of some delicate flattery suitable to the character of the correspondent These consolatory addresses are followed by a treatise on Providence which evinces the author to have entertained the most just and philosophical sentiments on that subject He infers the necessary existence of a Providence from the regularity and constancy observed in the government of the universe but his chief object is to show why upon the principle that a Providence exists good men should be liable to evils The enquiry is conducted with a variety of just observations and great force of argument by which the author vindicates the goodness and wisdom of the Almighty in a strain of sentiment corresponding to the most approved suggestions of natural religion The next treatise which is on Tranquillity of Mind appears to have been written soon after his return from exile There is a confusion in the arrangement of this tract but it contains a variety of just observations and may be regarded as a valuable production three hundred ninety Then follows a discourse on the Constancy of a Wise Man This has by some been considered as a part of the preceding treatise but they are evidently distinct It is one of the author s best productions in regard both of sentiment and composition and contains a fund of moral observations suited to fortify the mind under the oppression of accidental calamities We next meet with a tract on Clemency in two books addressed to Nero This appears to have been written in the beginning of the reign of Nero on whom the author bestows some high encomiums which at that time seem not to have been destitute of foundation The discourse abounds with just observation applicable to all ranks of men and if properly attended to by that infatuated emperor might have prevented the perpetration of those acts of cruelty which with his other extravagancies have rendered his name odious to posterity The discourse which succeeds is on the Shortness of Life addressed to Paulinus In this excellent treatise the author endeavours to show that the complaint of the shortness of life is not founded in truth that it is men who make life short either by passing it in indolence or otherwise improperly He inveighs against indolence luxury and every unprofitable avocation observing that the best use of time is to apply it to the study of wisdom by which life may be rendered sufficiently long Next follows a discourse on a Happy Life addressed to Gallio Seneca seems to have intended this as a vindication of himself against those who calumniated him on account of his riches and manner of living He maintained that a life can only be rendered happy by its conformity to the dictates of virtue but that such a life is perfectly compatible with the possession of riches where they happen to accrue The author pleads his own cause with great ability as well as justness of argument His vindication is in many parts highly beautiful and accompanied with admirable sentiments respecting the moral obligations to a virtuous life The conclusion of this discourse bears no similarity in point of composition to the preceding parts and is evidently spurious The preceding discourse is followed by one upon the Retirement of a Wise Man The beginning of this tract is wanting but in the sequel the author discusses a question which was much agitated amongst the Stoics and Epicureans viz whether a wise man ought to concern himself with the affairs of the public Both these sects of philosophers maintained that a life of retirement was most suitable to a wise man but they differed with respect to the circumstances in which it might be proper to deviate from this conduct one party considering the deviation three hundred ninety one as prudent when there existed a just motive for such conduct and the other when there was no forcible reason against it Seneca regards both these opinions as founded upon principles inadequate to the advancement both of public and private happiness which ought ever to be the ultimate object of moral speculation The last of the author s discourses addressed to Aebucius is on Benefits and continued through seven books He begins with lamenting the frequency of ingratitude amongst mankind a vice which he severely censures After some preliminary considerations respecting the nature of benefits he proceeds to show in what manner and on whom they ought to be conferred The greater part of these books is employed on the solution of abstract questions relative to benefits in the manner of Chrysippus where the author states explicitly the arguments on both sides and from the full consideration of them deduces rational conclusions The Epistles of Seneca consist of one hundred and twenty four all on moral subjects His Natural Questions extend through seven books in which he has collected the hypotheses of Aristotle and other ancient writers These are followed by a whimsical effusion on the death of Caligula The remainder of his works comprises seven Persuasive Discourses five books of Controversies and ten books containing Extracts of Declamations From the multiplicity of Seneca s productions it is evident that notwithstanding the luxurious life he is said to have led he was greatly devoted to literature a propensity which it is probable was confirmed by his banishment during almost eight years in the island of Corsica where he was in a great degree secluded from every other resource of amusement to a cultivated mind But with whatever splendour Seneca s domestic economy may have been supported it seems highly improbable that he indulged himself in luxurious enjoyment to any vicious excess His situation at the Roman court being honourable and important could not fail of being likewise advantageous not only from the imperial profusion common at that time but from many contingent emoluments which his extensive interest and patronage would naturally afford him He was born of a respectable rank lived in habits of familiar intercourse with persons of the first distinction and if in the course of his attendance upon Nero he had acquired a large fortune no blame could justly attach to his conduct in maintaining an elegant hospitality The imputation of luxury was thrown upon him from two quarters viz by the dissolute companions of Nero to whom the mention of such an example served as an apology for their own extreme dissipation three hundred ninety two and by those who envied him for the affluence and dignity which he had acquired The charge however is supported only by vague assertion and is discredited by every consideration which ought to have weight in determining the reality of human characters It seems totally inconsistent with his habits of literary industry with the virtuous sentiments which he every where strenuously maintains and the esteem with which he was regarded by a numerous acquaintance as a philosopher and a moralist The writings of Seneca have been traduced almost equally with his manner of living though in both he has a claim to indulgence from the fashion of the times He is more studious of minute embellishments in style than the writers of the Augustan age and the didactic strain in which he mostly prosecutes his subjects has a tendency to render him sententious but the expression of his thoughts is neither enfeebled by decoration nor involved in obscurity by conciseness He is not more rich in artificial ornament than in moral admonition Seneca has been charged with depreciating former writers to render himself more conspicuous a charge which so far as appears from his writings is founded rather in negative than positive testimony He has not endeavoured to establish his fame by any affectation of singularity in doctrine and while he passes over in silence the names of illustrious authors he avails himself with judgment of the most valuable stores with which they had enriched philosophy On the whole he is an author whose principles may be adopted not only with safety but great advantage and his writings merit a degree of consideration superior to what they have hitherto ever enjoyed in the literary world Seneca besides his prose works was the author of some tragedies The Medea the Troas and the Hippolytus are ascribed to him His father is said to have written the Hercules Furens Thyestes Agamemnon and Hercules Oetaeus The three remaining tragedies the Thebais Oedipus and Octavia usually published in the same collection with the seven preceding are supposed to be the productions of other authors but of whom is uncertain These several pieces are written in a neat style the plots and characters are conducted with an attention to probability and nature but none of them is so forcible in point of tragical distress as to excite in the reader any great degree of emotion PETRONIUS was a Roman knight and apparently of considerable fortune In his youth he seems to have given great application to polite literature in which he acquired a justness of taste as well as an elegance of composition Early initiated in the gaieties three hundred ninety three of fashionable life he contracted a habit of voluptuousness which rendered him an accommodating companion to the dissipated and the luxurious The court of Claudius entirely governed for some time by Messalina was then the residence of pleasure and here Petronius failed not of making a conspicuous appearance More delicate however than sensual he rather joined in the dissipation than indulged in the vices of the palace To interrupt a course of life too uniform to afford him perpetual satisfaction he accepted of the proconsulship of Bithynia and went to that province where he discharged the duties of his office with great credit Upon his return to Rome Nero who had succeeded Claudius made him consul in recompense of his services This new dignity by giving him frequent and easy access to the emperor created an intimacy between them which was increased to friendship and esteem on the side of Nero by the elegant entertainments often given him by Petronius In a short time this gay voluptuary became so much a favourite at court that nothing was agreeable but what was approved by Petronius and the authority which he acquired by being umpire in whatever related to the economy of gay dissipation procured him the title of Arbiter elegantiarum Things continued in this state whilst the emperor kept within the bounds of moderation and Petronius acted as intendant of his pleasures ordering him shows games comedies music feats and all that could contribute to make the hours of relaxation pass agreeably seasoning at the same time the innocent delights which he procured for the emperor with every possible charm to prevent him from seeking after such as might prove pernicious both to morals and the republic Nero however giving way to his own disposition which was naturally vicious at length changed his conduct not only in regard to the government of the empire but of himself and listening to other counsels than those of Petronius gave the entire reins to his passions which afterwards plunged him in ruin The emperor s new favourite was Tigellinus a man of the most profligate morals who omitted nothing that could gratify the inordinate appetites of his prince at the expense of all decency and virtue During this period Petronius gave vent to his indignation in the satire transmitted under his name by the title of Satyricon But his total retirement from court did not secure him from the artifices of Tigellinus who laboured with all his power to destroy the man whom he had industriously supplanted in the emperor s favour With this view he insinuated to Nero that Petronius was too intimately connected with Scevinus not to be engaged in Piso s conspiracy and to support his calumny caused the emperor to be present at the examination three hundred ninety four of one of Petronius s slaves whom he had secretly suborned to swear against his master After this transaction to deprive Petronius of all means of justifying himself they threw into prison the greatest part of his domestics Nero embraced with joy the opportunity of removing a man to whom he knew the present manners of the court were utterly obnoxious and he soon after issued orders for arresting Petronius As it required however some time to deliberate whether they should put a person of his consideration to death without more evident proofs of the charges preferred against him such was his disgust at living in the power of so detestable and capricious a tyrant that he resolved to die For this purpose making choice of the same expedient which had been adopted by Seneca he caused his veins to be opened but he closed them again for a little time that he might enjoy the conversation of his friends who came to see him in his last moments He desired them it is said to entertain him not with discourses on the immortality of the soul or the consolation of philosophy but with agreeable tales and poetic gallantries Disdaining to imitate the servility of those who dying by the orders of Nero yet made him their heir and filled their wills with encomiums on the tyrant and his favourites he broke to pieces a goblet of precious stones out of which he had commonly drank that Nero who he knew would seize upon it after his death might not have the pleasure of using it As the only present suitable to such a prince he sent him under a sealed cover his Satyricon written purposely against him and then broke his signet that it might not after his death become the means of accusation against the person in whose custody it should be found The Satyricon of Petronius is one of the most curious productions in the Latin language Novel in its nature and without any parallel in the works of antiquity some have imagined it to be a spurious composition fabricated about the time of the revival of learning in Europe This conjecture however is not more destitute of support than repugnant to the most circumstantial evidence in favour of its authenticity Others admitting the work to be a production of the age of Nero have questioned the design with which it was written and have consequently imputed to the author a most immoral intention Some of the scenes incidents and characters are of so extraordinary a nature that the description of them without a particular application must have been regarded as extremely whimsical and the work notwithstanding its ingenuity has been doomed to perpetual oblivion but history justifies the belief that in the court of Nero the extravagancies mentioned by Petronius were realized three hundred ninety five to a degree which authenticates the representation given of them The inimitable character of Trimalchio which exhibits a person sunk in the most debauched effeminacy was drawn for Nero and we are assured that there were formerly medals of that emperor with these words C Nero August Imp and on the reverse Trimalchio The various characters are well discriminated and supported with admirable propriety Never was such licentiousness of description united to such delicacy of colouring The force of the satire consists not in poignancy of sentiment but in the ridicule which arises from the whimsical but characteristic and faithful exhibition of the objects introduced That Nero was struck with the justness of the representation is evident from the displeasure which he showed at finding Petronius so well acquainted with his infamous excesses After levelling his suspicion on all who could possibly have betrayed him he at last fixed on a senator s wife named Silia who bore a part in his revels and was an intimate friend of Petronius upon which she was immediately sent into banishment Amongst the miscellaneous materials in this work are some pieces of poetry written in an elegant taste A poem on the civil war between Caesar and Pompey is beautiful and animated Though the Muses appear to have been mostly in a quiescent state from the time of Augustus we find from Petronius Arbiter who exhibits the manners of the capital during the reign of Nero that poetry still continued to be a favourite pursuit amongst the Romans and one to which indeed they seem to have had a national propensity Ecce inter pocula quaerunt Romulidae saturi quid dia poemata narrent Persius Sat i thirty Nay more Our nobles gorged and swilled with wine Call o er the banquet for a lay divine Gifford It was cultivated as a kind of fashionable exercise in short and desultory attempts in which the chief ambition was to produce verses extempore They were publicly recited by their authors with great ostentation and a favourable verdict from an audience however partial and frequently obtained either by intrigue or bribery was construed by those frivolous pretenders into a real adjudication of poetical fame The custom of publicly reciting poetical compositions with the view of obtaining the opinion of the hearers concerning them and for which purpose Augustus had built the Temple of Apollo was well calculated for the improvement of taste and judgment as well as the excitement of emulation but conducted as it now was it led to a general degradation of poetry Barbarism in three hundred ninety six language and a corruption of taste were the natural consequences of this practice while the judgment of the multitude was either blind or venal and while public approbation sanctioned the crudities of hasty composition There arose however in this period some candidates for the bays who carried their efforts beyond the narrow limits which custom and inadequate genius prescribed to the poetical exertions of their contemporaries Amongst these were Lucan and Persius LUCAN was the son of Annaeus Mela the brother of Seneca the philosopher He was born at Corduba the original residence of the family but came early to Rome where his promising talents and the patronage of his uncle recommended him to the favour of Nero by whom he was raised to the dignity of an augur and quaestor before he had attained the usual age Prompted by the desire of displaying his political abilities he had the imprudence to engage in a competition with his imperial patron The subject chosen by Nero was the tragical fate of Niobe and that of Lucan was Orpheus The ease with which the latter obtained the victory in the contest excited the jealousy of the emperor who resolved upon depressing his rising genius With this view he exposed him daily to the mortification of fresh insults until at last the poet s resentment was so much provoked that he entered into the conspiracy of Piso for cutting off the tyrant The plot being discovered there remained for the unfortunate Lucan no hope of pardon and choosing the same mode of death which was employed by his uncle he had his veins opened while he sat in a warm bath and expired in pronouncing with great emphasis the following lines in his Pharsalia Scinditur avulsus nec sicut vulnere sanguis Emicuit lentus ruptis cadit undique venis Discursusque animae diversa in membra meantis Interceptus aquis nullius vita perempti Est tanta dimissa via Lib iii six hundred thirty eight Asunder flies the man No single wound the gaping rupture seems Where trickling crimson flows in tender streams But from an opening horrible and wide A thousand vessels pour the bursting tide At once the winding channel s course was broke Where wandering life her mazy journey took Rowe Some authors have said that he betrayed pusillanimity at the hour of death and that to save himself from punishment he three hundred ninety seven accused his mother of being involved in the conspiracy This circumstance however is not mentioned by other writers who relate on the contrary that he died with philosophical fortitude He was then only in the twenty sixth year of his age Lucan had scarcely reached the age of puberty when he wrote a poem on the contest between Hector and Achilles He also composed in his youth a poem on the burning of Rome but his only surviving work is the Pharsalia written on the civil war between Caesar and Pompey This poem consisting of ten books is unfinished and its character has been more depreciated than that of any other production of antiquity In the plan of the poem the author prosecutes the different events in the civil war beginning his narrative at the passage of the Rubicon by Caesar He invokes not the muses nor engages any gods in the dispute but endeavours to support an epic dignity by vigour of sentiment and splendour of description The horrors of civil war and the importance of a contest which was to determine the fate of Rome and the empire of the world are displayed with variety of colouring and great energy of expression In the description of scenes and the recital of heroic actions the author discovers a strong and lively imagination while in those parts of the work which are addressed either to the understanding or the passions he is bold figurative and animated Indulging too much in amplification he is apt to tire with prolixity but in all his excursions he is ardent elevated impressive and often brilliant His versification has not the smoothness which we admire in the compositions of Virgil and his language is often involved in the intricacies of technical construction but with all his defects his beauties are numerous and he discovers a greater degree of merit than is commonly found in the productions of a poet of twenty six years of age at which time he died PERSIUS was born at Volaterrae of an equestrian family about the beginning of the Christian aera His father dying when he was six years old he was left to the care of his mother for whom and for his sisters he expresses the warmest affection At the age of twelve he came to Rome where after attending a course of grammar and rhetoric under the respective masters of those branches of education he placed himself under the tuition of Annaeus Cornutus a celebrated stoic philosopher of that time There subsisted between him and this preceptor so great a friendship that at his death which happened in the twenty ninth year of his age he bequeathed to Cornutus a handsome sum of money and his library The latter however accepting only the books left the money to Persius s sisters Priscian Quintilian and other ancient writers spear of Persius s satires as consisting of a book without any division They have since however been generally divided into six different satires but by some only into five The subjects of these compositions are the vanity of the poets in his time the backwardness of youth to the cultivation of moral science ignorance and temerity in political administration chiefly in allusion to the government of Nero the fifth satire is employed in evincing that the wise man also is free in discussing which point the author adopts the observations used by Horace on the same subject The last satire of Persius is directed against avarice In the fifth we meet with a beautiful address to Cornutus whom the author celebrates for his amiable virtues and peculiar talents for teaching The following lines at the same time that they show how diligently the preceptor and his pupil were employed through the whole day in the cultivation of moral science afford a more agreeable picture of domestic comfort and philosophical conviviality than might be expected in the family of a rigid stoic Tecum etenim longos memini consumere soles Et tecum primas epulis decerpere noctes Unum opus et requiem pariter disponimus ambo Atque verecunda laxamus feria mensa Sat v Can I forget how many a summer s day Spent in your converse stole unmarked away Or how while listening with increased delight I snatched from feasts the earlier hours of night Gifford The satires of Persius are written in a free expostulatory and argumentative manner possessing the same justness of sentiment as those of Horace but exerted in the way of derision and not with the admirable raillery of that facetious author They are regarded by many as obscure but this imputation arises more from unacquaintance with the characters and manners to which the author alludes than from any peculiarity either in his language or composition His versification is harmonious and we have only to remark in addition to similar examples in other Latin writers that though Persius is acknowledged to have been both virtuous and modest there are in the fourth satire a few passages which cannot decently admit of being translated Such was the freedom of the Romans in the use of some expressions which just refinement has now exploded Another poet in this period was FABRICIUS VEIENTO who wrote a severe satire against the priests of his time as also one three hundred ninety nine against the senators for corruption in their judicial capacity Nothing remains of either of those productions but for the latter the author was banished by Nero There now likewise flourished a lyric poet CAESIUS BASSUS to whom Persius has addressed his sixth satire He is said to have been next to Horace the best lyric poet among the Romans but of his various compositions only a few inconsiderable fragments are preserved To the two poets now mentioned must be added POMPONIUS SECUNDUS a man of distinguished rank in the army and who obtained the honour of a triumph for a victory over a tribe of barbarians in Germany He wrote several tragedies which in the judgment of Quintilian were beautiful compositions SERGIUS SULPICIUS GALBA four hundred I The race of the Caesars became extinct in Nero an event prognosticated by various signs two of which were particularly significant Formerly when Livia after her marriage with Augustus was making a visit to her villa at Veii six hundred thirty nine an eagle flying by let drop upon her lap a hen with a sprig of laurel in her mouth just as she had seized it Livia gave orders to have the hen taken care of and the sprig of laurel set and the hen reared such a numerous brood of chickens that the villa to this day is called the Villa of the Hens six hundred forty The laurel groves flourished so much that the Caesars procured thence the boughs and crowns they bore at their triumphs It was also their constant custom to plant others on the same spot immediately after a triumph and it was observed that a little before the death of each prince the tree which had been set by him died away But in the last year of Nero the whole plantation of laurels perished to the very roots and the hens all died About the same time the temple of the Caesars six hundred forty one being struck with lightning the heads of all the statues in it fell off at once and Augustus s sceptre was dashed from his hands II Nero was succeeded by Galba six hundred forty two who was not in the remotest degree allied to the family of the Caesars but without doubt of very noble extraction being descended from a great and ancient family for he always used to put amongst his other titles upon the bases of his statues his being great grandson to Q Catulus Capitolinus And when he came to four hundred one be emperor he set up the images of his ancestors in the hall six hundred forty three of the palace according to the inscriptions on which he carried up his pedigree on the father s side to Jupiter and by the mother s to Pasiphae the wife of Minos III To give even a short account of the whole family would be tedious I shall therefore only slightly notice that branch of it from which he was descended Why or whence the first of the Sulpicii who had the cognomen of Galba was so called is uncertain Some are of opinion that it was because he set fire to a city in Spain after he had a long time attacked it to no purpose with torches dipped in the gum called Galbanum others said he was so named because in a lingering disease he made use of it as a remedy wrapped up in wool others on account of his being prodigiously corpulent such a one being called in the language of the Gauls Galba or on the contrary because he was of a slender habit of body like those insects which breed in a sort of oak and are called Galbae Sergius Galba a person of consular rank six hundred forty four and the most eloquent man of his time gave a lustre to the family History relates that when he was pro praetor of Spain he perfidiously put to the sword thirty thousand Lusitanians and by that means gave occasion to the war of Viriatus six hundred forty five His grandson being incensed against Julius Caesar whose lieutenant he had been in Gaul because he was through him disappointed of the consulship six hundred forty six joined with Cassius and Brutus in the conspiracy against him for which he was condemned by the Pedian law From him were descended the grandfather and father of the emperor Galba The grandfather was more celebrated for his application to study than four hundred two for any figure he made in the government For he rose no higher than the praetorship but published a large and not uninteresting history His father attained to the consulship six hundred forty seven he was a short man and hump backed but a tolerable orator and an industrious pleader He was twice married the first of his wives was Mummia Achaica daughter of Catulus and great grand daughter of Lucius Mummius who sacked Corinth six hundred forty eight and the other Livia Ocellina a very rich and beautiful woman by whom it is supposed he was courted for the nobleness of his descent They say that she was farther encouraged to persevere in her advances by an incident which evinced the great ingenuousness of his disposition Upon her pressing her suit he took an opportunity when they were alone of stripping off his toga and showing her the deformity of his person that he might not be thought to impose upon her He had by Achaica two sons Caius and Sergius The elder of these Caius six hundred forty nine having very much reduced his estate retired from town and being prohibited by Tiberius from standing for a pro consulship in his year put an end to his own life IV The emperor Sergius Galba was born in the consulship of M Valerius Messala and Cn Lentulus upon the ninth of the calends of January twenty fourth December six hundred fifty in a villa standing upon a hill near Terracina on the left hand side of the road to Fundi six hundred fifty one Being adopted by his step mother six hundred fifty two he assumed the name of Livius with the cognomen of Ocella and changed his praenomen for he afterwards used that of Lucius instead of Sergius until he arrived at the imperial dignity It is well known that when he came once amongst other boys of his own age to pay his respects to Augustus the latter pinching his cheek said to him And thou child too wilt taste our imperial dignity Tiberius likewise being told that he would come to be emperor but at an advanced age exclaimed Let him live then since that does not concern me When his grandfather was offering sacrifice to four hundred three avert some ill omen from lightning the entrails of the victim were snatched out of his hand by an eagle and carried off into an oak tree loaded with acorns Upon this the soothsayers said that the family would come to be masters of the empire but not until many years had elapsed at which he smiling said Ay when a mule comes to bear a foal When Galba first declared against Nero nothing gave him so much confidence of success as a mule s happening at that time to have a foal And whilst all others were shocked at the occurrence as a most inauspicious prodigy he alone regarded it as a most fortunate omen calling to mind the sacrifice and saying of his grandfather When he took upon him the manly habit he dreamt that the goddess Fortune said to him I stand before your door weary and unless I am speedily admitted I shall fall into the hands of the first who comes to seize me On his awaking when the door of the house was opened he found a brazen statue of the goddess above a cubit long close to the threshold which he carried with slim to Tusculum where he used to pass the summer season and having consecrated it in an apartment of his house he ever after worshipped it with a monthly sacrifice and an anniversary vigil Though but a very young man he kept up an ancient but obsolete custom and now nowhere observed except in his own family which was to have his freedmen and slaves appear in a body before him twice a day morning and evening to offer him their salutations V Amongst other liberal studies he applied himself to the law He married Lepida six hundred fifty three by whom he had two sons but the mother and children all dying he continued a widower nor could he be prevailed upon to marry again not even Agrippina herself at that time left a widow by the death of Domitius who had employed all her blandishments to allure him to her embraces while he was a married man insomuch that Lepida s mother when in company with several married women rebuked her for it and even went so far as to cuff her Most of all he courted the empress Livia six hundred fifty four by whose favour while she was living he made a considerable figure and narrowly missed being enriched by the will which she left at her death in which she distinguished him from the rest of the four hundred four legatees by a legacy of fifty millions of sesterces But because the sum was expressed in figures and not in words at length it was reduced by her heir Tiberius to five hundred thousand and even this he never received six hundred fifty five VI Filling the great offices before the age required for it by law during his praetorship at the celebration of games in honour of the goddess Flora he presented the new spectacle of elephants walking upon ropes He was then governor of the province of Aquitania for near a year and soon afterwards took the consulship in the usual course and held it for six months six hundred fifty six It so happened that he succeeded L Domitius the father of Nero and was succeeded by Salvius Otho father to the emperor of that name so that his holding it between the sons of these two men looked like a presage of his future advancement to the empire Being appointed by Caius Caesar to supersede Gaetulicus in his command the day after his joining the legions he put a stop to their plaudits in a public spectacle by issuing an order That they should keep their hands under their cloaks Immediately upon which the following verse became very common in the camp Disce miles militare Galba est non Gaetulicus Learn soldier now in arms to use your hands Tis Galba not Gaetulicus commands With equal strictness he would allow of no petitions for leave of absence from the camp He hardened the soldiers both old and young by constant exercise and having quickly reduced within their own limits the barbarians who had made inroads into Gaul upon Caius s coming into Germany he so far recommended himself and his army to that emperor s approbation that amongst the innumerable troops drawn from all the provinces of the empire none met with higher commendation or greater rewards from him He likewise distinguished himself by heading an escort with a shield in his hand six hundred fifty eight and running at the side of the emperor s chariot twenty miles together VII Upon the news of Caius s death though many earnestly pressed him to lay hold of that opportunity of seizing the empire he chose rather to be quiet On this account he was in great favour with Claudius and being received into the number of his friends stood so high in his good opinion that the expedition to Britain six hundred fifty nine was for some time suspended because he was suddenly seized with a slight indisposition He governed Africa as pro consul for two years being chosen out of the regular course to restore order in the province which was in great disorder from civil dissensions and the alarms of the barbarians His administration was distinguished by great strictness and equity even in matters of small importance A soldier upon some expedition being charged with selling in a great scarcity of corn a bushel of wheat which was all he had left for a hundred denarii he forbad him to be relieved by any body when he came to be in want himself and accordingly he died of famine When sitting in judgment a cause being brought before him about some beast of burden the ownership of which was claimed by two persons the evidence being slight on both sides and it being difficult to come at the truth he ordered the beast to be led to a pond at which he had used to be watered with his head muffled up and the covering being there removed that he should be the property of the person whom he followed of his own accord after drinking VIII For his achievements both at this time in Africa and formerly in Germany he received the triumphal ornaments and three sacerdotal appointments one among The Fifteen another in the college of Titius and a third amongst the Augustals and from that time to the middle of Nero s reign he lived for the most part in retirement He never went abroad four hundred five so much as to take the air without a carriage attending him in which there was a million of sesterces in gold ready at hand until at last at the time he was living in the town of Fundi the province of Hispania Tarraconensis was offered him After his arrival in the province whilst he was sacrificing in a temple a boy who attended with a censer became all on a sudden grey headed This incident was regarded by some as a token of an approaching revolution in the government and that an old man would succeed a young one that is that he would succeed Nero And not long after a thunderbolt falling into a lake in Cantabria six hundred sixty twelve axes were found in it a manifest sign of the supreme power IX He governed the province during eight years his administration being of an uncertain and capricious character At first he was active vigorous and indeed excessively severe in the punishment of offenders For a money dealer having committed some fraud in the way of his business he cut off his hands and nailed them to his counter Another who had poisoned an orphan to whom he was guardian and next heir to the estate he crucified On this delinquent imploring the protection of the law and crying out that he was a Roman citizen he affected to afford him some alleviation and to mitigate his punishment by a mark of honour ordered a cross higher than usual and painted white to be erected for him But by degrees he gave himself up to a life of indolence and inactivity from the fear of giving Nero any occasion of jealousy and because as he used to say Nobody was obliged to render an account of their leisure hours He was holding a court of justice on the circuit at New Carthage six hundred sixty one when he received intelligence of the insurrection in Gaul six hundred sixty two and while the lieutenant of Aquitania was soliciting his assistance letters were brought from Vindex requesting him to assert the rights of mankind and put himself at their head to relieve them from the tyranny of Nero Without any long demur he accepted the invitation from a mixture of fear and hope For he had discovered that private orders had been sent by Nero to his procurators in the province to get four hundred seven him dispatched and he was encouraged to the enterprise as well by several auspices and omens as by the prophecy of a young woman of good family The more so because the priest of Jupiter at Clunia six hundred sixty three admonished by a dream had discovered in the recesses of the temple some verses similar to those in which she had delivered her prophecy These had also been uttered by a girl under divine inspiration about two hundred years before The import of the verses was That in time Spain should give the world a lord and master X Taking his seat on the tribunal therefore as if there was no other business than the manumitting of slaves he had the effigies of a number of persons who had been condemned and put to death by Nero set up before him whilst a noble youth stood by who had been banished and whom he had purposely sent for from one of the neighbouring Balearic isles and lamenting the condition of the times and being thereupon unanimously saluted by the title of Emperor he publicly declared himself only the lieutenant of the senate and people of Rome Then shutting the courts he levied legions and auxiliary troops among the provincials besides his veteran army consisting of one legion two wings of horse and three cohorts Out of the military leaders most distinguished for age and prudence he formed a kind of senate with whom to advise upon all matters of importance as often as occasion should require He likewise chose several young men of the equestrian order who were to be allowed the privilege of wearing the gold ring and being called The Reserve should mount guard before his bed chamber instead of the legionary soldiers He likewise issued proclamations throughout the provinces of the empire exhorting all to rise in arms unanimously and aid the common cause by all the ways and means in their power About the same time in fortifying a town which he had pitched upon for a military post a ring was found of antique workmanship in the stone of which was engraved the goddess Victory with a trophy Presently after a ship of Alexandria arrived at Dertosa six hundred sixty four loaded with arms without any person to steer it or so much as a single sailor or passenger four hundred eight on board From this incident nobody entertained the least doubt but the war upon which they were entering was just and honourable and favoured likewise by the gods when all on a sudden the whole design was exposed to failure One of the two wings of horse repenting of the violation of their oath to Nero attempted to desert him upon his approach to the camp and were with some difficulty kept in their duty And some slaves who had been presented to him by a freedman of Nero s on purpose to murder him had like to have killed him as he went through a narrow passage to the bath Being overheard to encourage one another not to lose the opportunity they were called to an account concerning it and recourse being had to the torture a confession was extorted from them XI These dangers were followed by the death of Vindex at which being extremely discouraged as if fortune had quite forsaken him he had thoughts of putting an end to his own life but receiving advice by his messengers from Rome that Nero was slain and that all had taken an oath to him as emperor he laid aside the title of lieutenant and took upon him that of Caesar Putting himself upon his march in his general s cloak and a dagger hanging from his neck before his breast he did not resume the use of the toga until Nymphidius Sabinus prefect of the pretorian guards at Rome with the two lieutenants Fonteius Capito in Germany and Claudius Macer in Africa who opposed his advancement were all put down XII Rumours of his cruelty and avarice had reached the city before his arrival such as that he had punished some cities of Spain and Gaul for not joining him readily by the imposition of heavy taxes and some by levelling their walls and had put to death the governors and procurators with their wives and children likewise that a golden crown of fifteen pounds weight taken out of the temple of Jupiter with which he was presented by the people of Tarracona he had melted down and had exacted from them three ounces which were wanting in the weight This report of him was confirmed and increased as soon as he entered the town For some seamen who had been taken from the fleet and enlisted four hundred nine among the troops by Nero he obliged to return to their former condition but they refusing to comply and obstinately clinging to the more honourable service under their eagles and standards he not only dispersed them by a body of horse but likewise decimated them He also disbanded a cohort of Germans which had been formed by the preceding emperors for their body guard and upon many occasions found very faithful and sent them back into their own country without giving them any gratuity pretending that they were more inclined to favour the advancement of Cneius Dolabella near whose gardens they encamped than his own The following ridiculous stories were also related of him but whether with or without foundation I know not such as that when a more sumptuous entertainment than usual was served up he fetched a deep groan that when one of the stewards presented him with an account of his expenses he reached him a dish of legumes from his table as a reward for his care and diligence and when Canus the piper had played much to his satisfaction he presented him with his own hand five denarii taken out of his pocket XIII His arrival therefore in town was not very agreeable to the people and this appeared at the next public spectacle For when the actors in a farce began a well known song Venit io Simus six hundred sixty five a villa Lo Clodpate from his village comes all the spectators with one voice went on with the rest repeating and acting the first verse several times over XIV He possessed himself of the imperial power with more favour and authority than he administered it although he gave many proofs of his being an excellent prince but these were not so grateful to the people as his misconduct was offensive He was governed by three favourites who because they lived in the palace and were constantly about him obtained the name of his pedagogues These were Titus Vinius who had been his lieutenant in Spain a man of insatiable four hundred ten avarice Cornelius Laco who from an assessor to the prince was advanced to be prefect of the pretorian guards a person of intolerable arrogance as well as indolence and his freedman Icelus dignified a little before with the privilege of wearing the gold ring and the use of the cognomen Martianus who became a candidate for the highest honour within the reach of any person of the equestrian order six hundred sixty six He resigned himself so implicitly into the power of those three favourites who governed in every thing according to the capricious impulse of their vices and tempers and his authority was so much abused by them that the tenor of his conduct was not very consistent with itself At one time he was more rigorous and frugal at another more lavish and negligent than became a prince who had been chosen by the people and was so far advanced in years He condemned some men of the first rank in the senatorian and equestrian orders upon a very slight suspicion and without trial He rarely granted the freedom of the city to any one and the privilege belonging to such as had three children only to one or two and that with great difficulty and only for a limited time When the judges petitioned to have a sixth decury added to their number he not only denied them but abolished the vacation which had been granted them by Claudius for the winter and the beginning of the year XV It was thought that he likewise intended to reduce the offices held by senators and men of the equestrian order to a term of two years continuance and to bestow them only on those who were unwilling to accept them and had refused them All the grants of Nero he recalled saving only the tenth part of them For this purpose he gave a commission to fifty Roman knights with orders that if players or wrestlers had sold what had been formerly given them it should be exacted from the purchasers since the others having no doubt spent the money were not in a condition to pay But on the other hand he suffered his attendants and freedmen to sell or give away the revenue of the state or immunities from taxes and to punish the innocent or pardon criminals at pleasure Nay when the Roman people were very clamorous for the punishment of Halotus and Tigellinus two of the four hundred eleven most mischievous amongst all the emissaries of Nero he protected them and even bestowed on Halotus one of the best procurations in his disposal And as to Tigellinus he even reprimanded the people for their cruelty by a proclamation XVI By this conduct he incurred the hatred of all orders of the people but especially of the soldiery For their commanders having promised them in his name a donative larger than usual upon their taking the oath to him before his arrival at Rome he refused to make it good frequently bragging that it was his custom to choose his soldiers not buy them Thus the troops became exasperated against him in all quarters The pretorian guards he alarmed with apprehensions of danger and unworthy treatment disbanding many of them occasionally as disaffected to his government and favourers of Nymphidius But most of all the army in Upper Germany was incensed against him as being defrauded of the rewards due to them for the service they had rendered in the insurrection of the Gauls under Vindex They were therefore the first who ventured to break into open mutiny refusing upon the calends the first of January to take any oath of allegiance except to the senate and they immediately dispatched deputies to the pretorian troops to let them know they did not like the emperor who had been set up in Spain and to desire that they would make choice of another who might meet with the approbation of all the armies XVII Upon receiving intelligence of this imagining that he was slighted not so much on account of his age as for having no children he immediately singled out of a company of young persons of rank who came to pay their compliments to him Piso Frugi Licinianus a youth of noble descent and great talents for whom he had before contracted such a regard that he had appointed him in his will the heir both of his estate and name Him he now styled his son and taking him to the camp adopted him in the presence of the assembled troops but without making any mention of a donative This circumstance afforded the better opportunity to Marcus Salvius Otho of accomplishing his object six days after the adoption XVIII Many remarkable prodigies had happened from the four hundred twelve very beginning of his reign which forewarned him of his approaching fate In every town through which he passed in his way from Spain to Rome victims were slain on the right and left of the roads and one of these which was a bull being maddened with the stroke of the axe broke the rope with which it was tied and running straight against his chariot with his fore feet elevated bespattered him with blood Likewise as he was alighting one of the guard being pushed forward by the crowd had very nearly wounded him with his lance And upon his entering the city and afterwards the palace he was welcomed with an earthquake and a noise like the bellowing of cattle These signs of ill fortune were followed by some that were still more apparently such Out of all his treasures he had selected a necklace of pearls and jewels to adorn his statue of Fortune at Tusculum But it suddenly occurring to him that it deserved a more august place he consecrated it to the Capitoline Venus and next night he dreamt that Fortune appeared to him complaining that she had been defrauded of the present intended her and threatening to resume what she had given him Terrified at this denunciation at break of day he sent forward some persons to Tusculum to make preparations for a sacrifice which might avert the displeasure of the goddess and when he himself arrived at the place he found nothing but some hot embers upon the altar and an old man in black standing by holding a little incense in a glass and some wine in an earthern pot It was remarked too that whilst he was sacrificing upon the calends of January the chaplet fell from his head and upon his consulting the pullets for omens they flew away Farther upon the day of his adopting Piso when he was to harangue the soldiers the seat which he used upon those occasions through the neglect of his attendants was not placed according to custom upon his tribunal and in the senate house his curule chair was set with the back forward XIX The day before he was slain as he was sacrificing in the morning the augur warned him from time to time to be upon his guard for that he was in danger from assassins and that they were near at hand Soon after he was informed that Otho was in possession of the pretorian camp And though most of his friends advised him to repair thither immediately four hundred thirteen in hopes that he might quell the tumult by his authority and presence he resolved to do nothing more than keep close within the palace and secure himself by guards of the legionary soldiers who were quartered in different parts about the city He put on a linen coat of mail however remarking at the same time that it would avail him little against the points of so many swords But being tempted out by false reports which the conspirators had purposely spread to induce him to venture abroad some few of those about him too hastily assuring him that the tumult had ceased the mutineers were apprehended and the rest coming to congratulate him resolved to continue firm in their obedience he went forward to meet them with so much confidence that upon a soldier s boasting that he had killed Otho he asked him By what authority and proceeded as far as the Forum There the knights appointed to dispatch him making their way through the crowd of citizens upon seeing him at a distance halted a while after which galloping up to him now abandoned by all his attendants they put him to death XX Some authors relate that upon their first approach he cried out What do you mean fellow soldiers I am yours and you are mine and promised them a donative but the generality of writers relate that he offered his throat to them saying Do your work and strike since you are resolved upon it It is remarkable that not one of those who were at hand ever made any attempt to assist the emperor and all who were sent for disregarded the summons except a troop of Germans They in consideration of his late kindness in showing them particular attention during a sickness which prevailed in the camp flew to his aid but came too late for being not well acquainted with the town they had taken a circuitous route He was slain near the Curtian Lake six hundred sixty seven and there left until a common soldier returning from the receipt of his allowance of corn throwing down the load which he carried cut off his head There being upon it no hair by which he might hold it he hid it in the bosom of his dress but afterwards thrusting his thumb into the mouth he carried it in that manner to Otho who gave it to the drudges and slaves who attended the soldiers and they fixing it upon the four hundred fourteen point of a spear carried it in derision round the camp crying out as they went along You take your fill of joy in your old age They were irritated to this pitch of rude banter by a report spread a few days before that upon some one s commending his person as still florid and vigorous he replied Eti moi menos empedoi estin six hundred sixty eight My strength as yet has suffered no decay A freedman of Petrobius s who himself had belonged to Nero s family purchased the head from them at the price of a hundred gold pieces and threw it into the place where by Galba s order his patron had been put to death At last after some time his steward Argius buried it with the rest of his body in his own gardens near the Aurelian Way XXI In person he was of a good size bald before with blue eyes and an aquiline nose and his hands and feet were so distorted with the gout that he could neither wear a shoe nor turn over the leaves of a book or so much as hold it He had likewise an excrescence in his right side which hung down to that degree that it was with difficulty kept up by a bandage XXII He is reported to have been a great eater and usually took his breakfast in the winter time before day At supper he fed very heartily giving the fragments which were left by handfuls to be distributed amongst the attendants In his lust he was more inclined to the male sex and such of them too as were old It is said of him that in Spain when Icelus an old catamite of his brought him the news of Nero s death he not only kissed him lovingly before company but begged of him to remove all impediments and then took him aside into a private apartment XXIII He perished in the seventy third year of his age and the seventh month of his reign six hundred sixty nine The senate as soon as they could with safety ordered a statue to be erected for him upon the naval column in that part of the Forum where he four hundred fifteen was slain But Vespasian cancelled the decree upon a suspicion that he had sent assassins from Spain into Judaea to murder him GALBA was for a private man the most wealthy of any who had ever aspired to the imperial dignity He valued himself upon his being descended from the family of the Servii but still more upon his relation to Quintus Catulus Capitolinus celebrated for integrity and virtue He was likewise distantly related to Livia the wife of Augustus by whose interest he was preferred from the station which he held in the palace to the dignity of consul and who left him a great legacy at her death His parsimonious way of living and his aversion to all superfluity or excess were construed into avarice as soon as he became emperor whence Plutarch observes that the pride which he took in his temperance and economy was unseasonable While he endeavoured to reform the profusion in the public expenditure which prevailed in the reign of Nero he ran into the opposite extreme and it is objected to him by some historians that he maintained not the imperial dignity in a degree consistent even with decency He was not sufficiently attentive either to his own security or the tranquillity of the state when he refused to pay the soldiers the donative which he had promised them This breach of faith seems to be the only act in his life that affects his integrity and it contributed more to his ruin than even the odium which he incurred by the open venality and rapaciousness of his favourites particularly Vinius A SALVIUS OTHO four hundred sixteen I The ancestors of Otho were originally of the town of Ferentum of an ancient and honourable family and indeed one of the most considerable in Etruria His grandfather M Salvius Otho whose father was a Roman knight but his mother of mean extraction for it is not certain whether she was free born by the favour of Livia Augusta in whose house he had his education was made a senator but never rose higher than the praetorship His father Lucius Otho was by the mother s side nobly descended allied to several great families and so dearly beloved by Tiberius and so much resembled him in his features that most people believed Tiberius was his father He behaved with great strictness and severity not only in the city offices but in the pro consulship of Africa and some extraordinary commands in the army He had the courage to punish with death some soldiers in Illyricum who in the disturbance attempted by Camillus upon changing their minds had put their generals to the sword as promoters of that insurrection against Claudius He ordered the execution to take place in the front of the camp six hundred seventy and under his own eyes though he knew they had been advanced to higher ranks in the army by Claudius on that very account By this action he acquired fame but lessened his favour at court which however he soon recovered by discovering to Claudius a design upon his life carried on by a Roman knight six hundred seventy one and which he had learnt from some of his slaves For the senate ordered a statue of him to be erected in the palace an honour which had been conferred but upon very few before him And Claudius advanced him to the dignity of a patrician commending him at the same time in the highest terms and concluding with these words A man than whom I don t so four hundred seventeen much as wish to have children that should be better He had two sons by a very noble woman Albia Terentia namely Lucius Titianus and a younger called Marcus who had the same cognomen as himself He had also a daughter whom he contracted to Drusus Germanicus s son before she was of marriageable age II The emperor Otho was born upon the fourth of the calends of May twenty eighth April in the consulship of Camillus Aruntius and Domitius Aenobarbus six hundred seventy two He was from his earliest youth so riotous and wild that he was often severely scourged by his father He was said to run about in the night time and seize upon any one he met who was either drunk or too feeble to make resistance and toss him in a blanket six hundred seventy three After his father s death to make his court the more effectually to a freedwoman about the palace who was in great favour he pretended to be in love with her though she was old and almost decrepit Having by her means got into Nero s good graces he soon became one of the principal favourites by the congeniality of his disposition to that of the emperor or as some say by the reciprocal practice of mutual pollution He had so great a sway at court that when a man of consular rank was condemned for bribery having tampered with him for a large sum of money to procure his pardon before he had quite effected it he scrupled not to introduce him into the senate to return his thanks III Having by means of this woman insinuated himself into all the emperor s secrets he upon the day designed for the murder of his mother entertained them both at a very splendid feast to prevent suspicion Poppaea Sabina for whom Nero entertained such a violent passion that he had taken her from her husband six hundred seventy four and entrusted her to him he received and went through the form of marrying her And not satisfied with obtaining her favours he loved her so extravagantly that he could not with patience bear Nero for his rival It is certainly believed that he not only refused admittance to those who were sent by Nero to fetch her but that on one four hundred eighteen occasion he shut him out and kept him standing before the door mixing prayers and menaces in vain and demanding back again what was entrusted to his keeping His pretended marriage therefore being dissolved he was sent lieutenant into Lusitania This treatment of him was thought sufficiently severe because harsher proceedings might have brought the whole farce to light which notwithstanding at last came out and was published to the world in the following distich Cur Otho mentitus sit quaeritis exul honore Uxoris moechus caeperat esse suae You ask why Otho s banish d Know the cause Comes not within the verge of vulgar laws Against all rules of fashionable life The rogue had dared to sleep with his own wife He governed the province in quality of quaestor for ten years with singular moderation and justice IV As soon as an opportunity of revenge offered he readily joined in Galba s enterprises and at the same time conceived hopes of obtaining the imperial dignity for himself To this he was much encouraged by the state of the times but still more by the assurances given him by Seleucus the astrologer who having formerly told him that he would certainly out live Nero came to him at that juncture unexpectedly promising him again that he should succeed to the empire and that in a very short time He therefore let slip no opportunity of making his court to every one about him by all manner of civilities As often as he entertained Galba at supper he distributed to every man of the cohort which attended the emperor on guard a gold piece endeavouring likewise to oblige the rest of the soldiers in one way or another Being chosen an arbitrator by one who had a dispute with his neighbour about a piece of land he bought it and gave it him so that now almost every body thought and said that he was the only man worthy of succeeding to the empire V He entertained hopes of being adopted by Galba and expected it every day But finding himself disappointed by Piso s being preferred before him he turned his thoughts to obtaining his purpose by the use of violence and to this he was instigated as well by the greatness of his debts as by resentment four hundred nineteen at Galba s conduct towards him For he did not conceal his conviction that he could not stand his ground unless he became emperor and that it signified nothing whether he fell by the hands of his enemies in the field or of his creditors in the Forum He had a few days before squeezed out of one of the emperor s slaves a million of sesterces for procuring him a stewardship and this was the whole fund he had for carrying on so great an enterprise At first the design was entrusted to only five of the guard but afterwards to ten others each of the five naming two They had every one ten thousand sesterces paid down and were promised fifty thousand more By these others were drawn in but not many from a confident assurance that when the matter came to the crisis they should have enough to join them VI His first intention was immediately after the departure of Piso to seize the camp and fall upon Galba whilst he was at supper in the palace but he was restrained by a regard for the cohort at that time on duty lest he should bring too great an odium upon it because it happened that the same cohort was on guard before both when Caius was slain and Nero deserted For some time afterwards he was restrained also by scruples about the omens and by the advice of Seleucus Upon the day fixed at last for the enterprise having given his accomplices notice to wait for him in the Forum near the temple of Saturn at the gilded mile stone six hundred seventy five he went in the morning to pay his respects to Galba and being received with a kiss as usual he attended him at sacrifice and heard the predictions of the augur six hundred seventy six A freedman of his then bringing four hundred twenty him word that the architects were come which was the signal agreed upon he withdrew as if it were with a design to view a house upon sale and went out by a back door of the palace to the place appointed Some say he pretended to be seized with an ague fit and ordered those about him to make that excuse for him if he was inquired after Being then quickly concealed in a woman s litter he made the best of his way for the camp But the bearers growing tired he got out and began to run His shoe becoming loose he stopped again but being immediately raised by his attendants upon their shoulders and unanimously saluted by the title of EMPEROR he came amidst auspicious acclamations and drawn swords into the Principia six hundred seventy seven in the camp all who met him joining in the cavalcade as if they had been privy to the design Upon this sending some soldiers to dispatch Galba and Piso he said nothing else in his address to the soldiery to secure their affections than these few words I shall be content with whatever ye think fit to leave me VII Towards the close of the day he entered the senate and after he had made a short speech to them pretending that he had been seized in the streets and compelled by violence to assume the imperial authority which he designed to exercise in conjunction with them he retired to the palace Besides other compliments which he received from those who flocked about him to congratulate and flatter him he was called Nero by the mob and manifested no intention of declining that cognomen Nay some authors relate that he used it in his official acts and the first letters he sent to the four hundred twenty one governors of provinces He suffered all his images and statues to be replaced and restored his procurators and freedmen to their former posts And the first writing which he signed as emperor was a promise of fifty millions of sesterces to finish the Golden house six hundred seventy eight He is said to have been greatly frightened that night in his sleep and to have groaned heavily and being found by those who came running in to see what the matter was lying upon the floor before his bed he endeavoured by every kind of atonement to appease the ghost of Galba by which he had found himself violently tumbled out of bed The next day as he was taking the omens a great storm arising and sustaining a grievous fall he muttered to himself from time to time Ti gar moi kai makrois aulois six hundred seventy nine What business have I the loud trumpets to sound VIII About the same time the armies in Germany took an oath to Vitellius as emperor Upon receiving this intelligence he advised the senate to send thither deputies to inform them that a prince had been already chosen and to persuade them to peace and a good understanding By letters and messages however he offered Vitellius to make him his colleague in the empire and his son in law But a war being now unavoidable and the generals and troops sent forward by Vitellius advancing he had a proof of the attachment and fidelity of the pretorian guards which had nearly proved fatal to the senatorian order It had been judged proper that some arms should be given out of the stores and conveyed to the fleet by the marine troops While they were employed in fetching these from the camp in the night some of the guards suspecting treachery excited a tumult and suddenly the whole body without any of their officers at their head ran to the palace demanding that the entire senate should be put to the sword and having repulsed some of the four hundred twenty two tribunes who endeavoured to stop them and slain others they broke all bloody as they were into the banquetting room inquiring for the emperor nor would they quit the place until they had seen him He now entered upon his expedition against Vitellius with great alacrity but too much precipitation and without any regard to the ominous circumstances which attended it For the Ancilia six hundred eighty had been taken out of the temple of Mars for the usual procession but were not yet replaced during which interval it had of old been looked upon as very unfortunate to engage in any enterprise He likewise set forward upon the day when the worshippers of the Mother of the gods six hundred eighty one begin their lamentations and wailing Besides these other unlucky omens attended him For in a victim offered to Father Dis six hundred eighty two he found the signs such as upon all other occasions are regarded as favourable whereas in that sacrifice the contrary intimations are judged the most propitious At his first setting forward he was stopped by inundations of the Tiber and at twenty miles distance from the city found the road blocked up by the fall of houses IX Though it was the general opinion that it would be proper to protract the war as the enemy were distressed by four hundred twenty three famine and the straitness of their quarters yet he resolved with equal rashness to force them to an engagement as soon as possible whether from impatience of prolonged anxiety and in the hope of bringing matters to an issue before the arrival of Vitellius or because he could not resist the ardour of the troops who were all clamorous for battle He was not however present at any of those which ensued but stayed behind at Brixellum six hundred eighty three He had the advantage in three slight engagements near the Alps about Placentia and a place called Castor s six hundred eighty four but was by a fraudulent stratagem of the enemy defeated in the last and greatest battle at Bedriacum six hundred eighty five For some hopes of a conference being given and the soldiers being drawn up to hear the conditions of peace declared very unexpectedly and amidst their mutual salutations they were obliged to stand to their arms Immediately upon this he determined to put an end to his life more as many think and not without reason out of shame at persisting in a struggle for the empire to the hazard of the public interest and so many lives than from despair or distrust of his troops For he had still in reserve and in full force those whom he had kept about him for a second trial of his fortune and others were coming up from Dalmatia Pannonia and Moesia nor were the troops lately defeated so far discouraged as not to be ready even of themselves to run all risks in order to wipe off their recent disgrace X My father Suetonius Lenis six hundred eighty six was in this battle being at four hundred twenty four that time an angusticlavian tribune in the thirteenth legion He used frequently to say that Otho before his advancement to the empire had such an abhorrence of civil war that once upon hearing an account given at table of the death of Cassius and Brutus he fell into a trembling and that he never would have interfered with Galba but that he was confident of succeeding in his enterprise without a war Moreover that he was then encouraged to despise life by the example of a common soldier who bringing news of the defeat of the army and finding that he met with no credit but was railed at for a liar and a coward as if he had run away from the field of battle fell upon his sword at the emperor s feet upon the sight of which my father said that Otho cried out that he would expose to no farther danger such brave men who had deserved so well at his hands Advising therefore his brother his brother s son and the rest of his friends to provide for their security in the best manner they could after he had embraced and kissed them he sent them away and then withdrawing into a private room by himself he wrote a letter of consolation to his sister containing two sheets He likewise sent another to Messalina Nero s widow whom he had intended to marry committing to her the care of his relics and memory He then burnt all the letters which he had by him to prevent the danger and mischief that might otherwise befall the writers from the conqueror What ready money he had he distributed among his domestics XI And now being prepared and just upon the point of dispatching himself he was induced to suspend the execution of his purpose by a great tumult which had broken out in the camp Finding that some of the soldiers who were making off had been seized and detained as deserters Let us add said he this night to our life These were his very words He then gave orders that no violence should be offered to any one and keeping his chamber door open until late at night he allowed all who pleased the liberty to come and see him At last after quenching his thirst with a draught of cold water he took up two poniards and having examined the points of both put one of them under his pillow and shutting his chamber door slept very soundly until awaking about break of day he stabbed himself under the left pap Some persons bursting into the room upon his first groan he at one time covered and at another exposed his wound to the view of the bystanders and thus life soon ebbed away His funeral was hastily performed according to his own order in the thirty eighth year of his age and ninety fifth day of his reign six hundred eighty seven XII The person and appearance of Otho no way corresponded to the great spirit he displayed on this occasion for he is said to have been of low stature splay footed and bandy legged He was however effeminately nice in the care of his person the hair on his body he plucked out by the roots and because he was somewhat bald he wore a kind of peruke so exactly fitted to his head that nobody could have known it for such He used to shave every day and rub his face with soaked bread the use of which he began when the down first appeared upon his chin to prevent his having any beard It is said likewise that he celebrated publicly the sacred rites of Isis six hundred eighty eight clad in a linen garment such as is used by the worshippers of that goddess These circumstances I imagine caused the world to wonder the more that his death was so little in character with his life Many of the soldiers who were present kissing and bedewing with their tears his hands and feet as he lay dead and celebrating him as a most gallant man and an incomparable emperor immediately put an end to their own lives upon the spot not far from his funeral pile four hundred twenty six Many of those likewise who were at a distance upon hearing the news of his death in the anguish of their hearts began fighting amongst themselves until they dispatched one another To conclude the generality of mankind though they hated him whilst living yet highly extolled him after his death insomuch that it was the common talk and opinion that Galba had been driven to destruction by his rival not so much for the sake of reigning himself as of restoring Rome to its ancient liberty It is remarkable in the fortune of this emperor that he owed both his elevation and catastrophe to the inextricable embarrassments in which he was involved first in respect of pecuniary circumstances and next of political He was not so far as we can learn a follower of any of the sects of philosophers which justified and even recommended suicide in particular cases yet he perpetrated that act with extraordinary coolness and resolution and what is no less remarkable from the motive as he avowed of public expediency only It was observed of him for many years after his death that none ever died like Otho AULUS VITELLIUS four hundred twenty seven I Very different accounts are given of the origin of the Vitellian family Some describe it as ancient and noble others as recent and obscure nay extremely mean I am inclined to think that these several representations have been made by the flatterers and detractors of Vitellius after he became emperor unless the fortunes of the family varied before There is extant a memoir addressed by Quintus Eulogius to Quintus Vitellius quaestor to the Divine Augustus in which it is said that the Vitellii were descended from Faunus king of the aborigines and Vitellia six hundred eighty nine who was worshipped in many places as a goddess and that they reigned formerly over the whole of Latium that all who were left of the family removed out of the country of the Sabines to Rome and were enrolled among the patricians that some monuments of the family continued a long time as the Vitellian Way reaching from the Janiculum to the sea and likewise a colony of that name which at a very remote period of time they desired leave from the government to defend against the Aequicolae six hundred ninety with a force raised by their own family only also that in the time of the war with the Samnites some of the Vitellii who went with the troops levied for the security of Apulia settled at Nuceria six hundred ninety one and their descendants a long time afterwards returned again to Rome and were admitted four hundred twenty eight into the patrician order On the other hand the generality of writers say that the founder of the family was a freedman Cassius Severus six hundred ninety two and some others relate that he was likewise a cobbler whose son having made a considerable fortune by agencies and dealings in confiscated property begot by a common strumpet daughter of one Antiochus a baker a child who afterwards became a Roman knight Of these different accounts the reader is left to take his choice II It is certain however that Publius Vitellius of Nuceria whether of an ancient family or of low extraction was a Roman knight and a procurator to Augustus He left behind him four sons all men of very high station who had the same cognomen but the different praenomina of Aulus Quintus Publius and Lucius Aulus died in the enjoyment of the consulship six hundred ninety three which office he bore jointly with Domitius the father of Nero Caesar He was elegant to excess in his manner of living and notorious for the vast expense of his entertainments Quintus was deprived of his rank of senator when upon a motion made by Tiberius a resolution passed to purge the senate of those who were in any respect not duly qualified for that honour Publius an intimate friend and companion of Germanicus prosecuted his enemy and murderer Cneius Piso and procured sentence against him After he had been made proctor being arrested among the accomplices of Sejanus and delivered into the hands of his brother to be confined in his house he opened a vein with a penknife intending to bleed himself to death He suffered however the wound to be bound up and cured not so much from repenting the resolution he had formed as to comply with the importunity of his relations He died afterwards a natural death during his confinement Lucius after his consulship six hundred ninety four was made governor of Syria six hundred ninety five and by his politic management not only brought Artabanus king of the Parthians to give him an interview but to worship the standards of the Roman legions He afterwards filled two ordinary consulships six hundred ninety six and also the censorship six hundred ninety seven jointly with the emperor Claudius Whilst that four hundred twenty nine prince was absent upon his expedition into Britain six hundred ninety eight the care of the empire was committed to him being a man of great integrity and industry But he lessened his character not a little by his passionate fondness for an abandoned freedwoman with whose spittle mixed with honey he used to anoint his throat and jaws by way of remedy for some complaint not privately nor seldom but daily and publicly Being extravagantly prone to flattery it was he who gave rise to the worship of Caius Caesar as a god when upon his return from Syria he would not presume to accost him any otherwise than with his head covered turning himself round and then prostrating himself upon the earth And to leave no artifice untried to secure the favour of Claudius who was entirely governed by his wives and freedmen he requested as the greatest favour from Messalina that she would be pleased to let him take off her shoes which when he had done he took her right shoe and wore it constantly betwixt his toga and his tunic and from time to time covered it with kisses He likewise worshipped golden images of Narcissus and Pallas among his household gods It was he too who when Claudius exhibited the secular games in his compliments to him upon that occasion used this expression May you often do the same III He died of palsy the day after his seizure with it leaving behind him two sons whom he had by a most excellent and respectable wife Sextilia He had lived to see them both consuls the same year and during the whole year also the younger succeeding the elder for the last six months six hundred ninety nine The senate honoured him after his decease with a funeral at the public expense and with a statue in the Rostra which had this inscription upon the base One who was steadfast in his loyalty to his prince The emperor Aulus Vitellius the son of this Lucius was born upon the eighth of the calends of October twenty fourth September or as some say upon the seventh of the ides of September seventh September in the consulship of Drusus Caesar and Norbanus Flaccus seven hundred His parents were so four hundred thirty terrified with the predictions of astrologers upon the calculation of his nativity that his father used his utmost endeavours to prevent his being sent governor into any of the provinces whilst he was alive His mother upon his being sent to the legions seven hundred one and also upon his being proclaimed emperor immediately lamented him as utterly ruined He spent his youth amongst the catamites of Tiberius at Capri was himself constantly stigmatized with the name of Spintria seven hundred two and was supposed to have been the occasion of his father s advancement by consenting to gratify the emperor s unnatural lust IV In the subsequent part of his life being still most scandalously vicious he rose to great favour at court being upon a very intimate footing with Caius Caligula because of his fondness for chariot driving and with Claudius for his love of gaming But he was in a still higher degree acceptable to Nero as well on the same accounts as for a particular service which he rendered him When Nero presided in the games instituted by himself though he was extremely desirous to perform amongst the harpers yet his modesty would not permit him notwithstanding the people entreated much for it Upon his quitting the theatre Vitellius fetched him back again pretending to represent the determined wishes of the people and so afforded him the opportunity of yielding to their in treaties V By the favour of these three princes he was not only advanced to the great offices of state but to the highest dignities of the sacred order after which he held the proconsulship of Africa and had the superintendence of the public works in which appointment his conduct and consequently his reputation were very different For he governed the province with singular integrity during two years in the latter of which he acted as deputy to his brother who succeeded him But in his office in the city he was said to pillage the temples of their gifts and ornaments and to have exchanged brass and tin for gold and silver seven hundred three VI He took to wife Petronia the daughter of a man of consular rank and had by her a son named Petronius who was blind of an eye The mother being willing to appoint this youth her heir upon condition that he should be released from his father s authority the latter discharged him accordingly but shortly after as was believed murdered him charging him with a design upon his life and pretending that he had from consciousness of his guilt drank the poison he had prepared for his father Soon afterwards he married Galeria Fundana the daughter of a man of pretorian rank and had by her both sons and daughters Among the former was one who had such a stammering in his speech that he was little better than if he had been dumb VII He was sent by Galba into Lower Germany seven hundred four contrary to his expectation It is supposed that he was assisted in procuring this appointment by the interest of Titus Junius a man of great influence at that time whose friendship he had long before gained by favouring the same set of charioteers with him in the Circensian games But Galba openly declared that none were less to be feared than those who only cared for their bellies and that even his enormous appetite must be satisfied with the plenty of that province so that it is evident he was selected for that government more out of contempt than kindness It is certain that when he was to set out he had not money for the expenses of his journey he being at that time so much straitened in his circumstances that he was obliged to put his wife and children whom he left at Rome into a poor lodging which he hired for them in order that he might let his own house for the remainder of the year and he pawned a pearl taken from his mother s ear ring to defray his expenses on the road A crowd of creditors who were waiting to stop him and amongst them the people of Sineussa and Formia whose taxes he had converted to his own use he eluded by alarming them with the apprehension of false accusation He had however sued a certain freedman who was clamorous in demanding a debt of him under pretence that he had kicked him which action he would not withdraw until he had wrung from the freedman fifty thousand sesterces Upon his arrival in the province the army four hundred thirty two which was disaffected to Galba and ripe for insurrection received him with open arms as if he had been sent them from heaven It was no small recommendation to their favour that he was the son of a man who had been thrice consul was in the prime of life and of an easy prodigal disposition This opinion which had been long entertained of him Vitellius confirmed by some late practices having kissed all the common soldiers whom he met with upon the road and been excessively complaisant in the inns and stables to the muleteers and travellers asking them in a morning if they had got their breakfasts and letting them see by belching that he had eaten his VIII After he had reached the camp he denied no man any thing he asked for and pardoned all who lay under sentence for disgraceful conduct or disorderly habits Before a month therefore had passed without regard to the day or season he was hurried by the soldiers out of his bed chamber although it was evening and he in an undress and unanimously saluted by the title of EMPEROR seven hundred five He was then carried round the most considerable towns in the neighbourhood with the sword of the Divine Julius in his hand which had been taken by some person out of the temple of Mars and presented to him when he was first saluted Nor did he return to the pretorium until his dining room was in flames from the chimney s taking fire Upon this accident all being in consternation and considering it as an unlucky omen he cried out Courage boys it shines brightly upon us And this was all he said to the soldiers The army of the Upper Province likewise which had before declared against Galba for the senate joining in the proceedings he very eagerly accepted the cognomen of Germanicus offered him by the unanimous consent of both armies but deferred assuming that of Augustus and refused for ever that of Caesar IX Intelligence of Galba s death arriving soon after when he had settled his affairs in Germany he divided his troops into two bodies intending to send one of them before him against Otho and to follow with the other himself The army he sent forward had a lucky omen for suddenly an eagle cams flying up to them on the right and having hovered four hundred thirty three round the standards flew gently before them on their road But on the other hand when he began his own march all the equestrian statues which were erected for him in several places fell suddenly down with their legs broken and the laurel crown which he had put on as emblematical of auspicious fortune fell off his head into a river Soon afterwards at Vienne seven hundred six as he was upon the tribunal administering justice a cock perched upon his shoulder and afterwards upon his head The issue corresponded to these omens for he was not able to keep the empire which had been secured for him by his lieutenants X He heard of the victory at Bedriacum seven hundred seven and the death of Otho whilst he was yet in Gaul and without the least hesitation by a single proclamation disbanded all the pretorian cohorts as having by their repeated treasons set a dangerous example to the rest of the army commanding them to deliver up their arms to his tribunes A hundred and twenty of them under whose hands he had found petitions presented to Otho for rewards of their service in the murder of Galba he besides ordered to be sought out and punished So far his conduct deserved approbation and was such as to afford hope of his becoming an excellent prince had he not managed his other affairs in a way more corresponding with his own disposition and his former manner of life than to the imperial dignity For having begun his march he rode through every city in his route in a triumphal procession and sailed down the rivers in ships fitted out with the greatest elegance and decorated with various kinds of crowns amidst the most extravagant entertainments Such was the want of discipline and the licentiousness both in his family and army that not satisfied with the provision every where made for them at the public expense they committed every kind of robbery and insult upon the inhabitants setting slaves at liberty as they pleased and if any dared to make resistance they dealt blows and abuse frequently wounds and sometimes slaughter amongst them When he reached the plains on which the battles four hundred thirty four were fought seven hundred eight some of those around him being offended at the smell of the carcases which lay rotting upon the ground he had the audacity to encourage them by a most detestable remark That a dead enemy smelt not amiss especially if he were a fellow citizen To qualify however the offensiveness of the stench he quaffed in public a goblet of wine and with equal vanity and insolence distributed a large quantity of it among his troops On his observing a stone with an inscription upon it to the memory of Otho he said It was a mausoleum good enough for such a prince He also sent the poniard with which Otho killed himself to the colony of Agrippina seven hundred nine to be dedicated to Mars Upon the Appenine hills he celebrated a Bacchanalian feast XI At last he entered the City with trumpets sounding in his general s cloak and girded with his sword amidst a display of standards and banners his attendants being all in the military habit and the arms of the soldiers unsheathed Acting more and more in open violation of all laws both divine and human he assumed the office of Pontifex Maximus upon the day of the defeat at the Allia seven hundred ten ordered the magistrates to be elected for ten years of office and made himself consul for life To put it out of all doubt what model he intended to follow in his government of the empire he made his offerings to the shade of Nero in the midst of the Campus Martius and with a full assembly of the public priests attending him And at a solemn entertainment he desired a harper who pleased the company much to sing something in praise of Domitius and upon his beginning some songs of Nero s he started up in presence of the whole assembly and could not refrain from applauding him by clapping his hands XII After such a commencement of his career he conducted four hundred thirty five his affairs during the greater part of his reign entirely by the advice and direction of the vilest amongst the players and charioteers and especially his freedman Asiaticus This fellow had when young been engaged with him in a course of mutual and unnatural pollution but being at last quite tired of the occupation ran away His master some time after caught him at Puteoli selling a liquor called Posca seven hundred eleven and put him in chains but soon released him and retained him in his former capacity Growing weary however of his rough and stubborn temper he sold him to a strolling fencing master after which when the fellow was to have been brought up to play his part at the conclusion of an entertainment of gladiators he suddenly carried him off and at length upon his being advanced to the government of a province gave him his freedom The first day of his reign he presented him with the gold rings at supper though in the morning when all about him requested that favour in his behalf he expressed the utmost abhorrence of putting so great a stain upon the equestrian order XIII He was chiefly addicted to the vices of luxury and cruelty He always made three meals a day sometimes four breakfast dinner and supper and a drunken revel after all This load of victuals he could well enough bear from a custom to which he had enured himself of frequently vomiting For these several meals he would make different appointments at the houses of his friends on the same day None ever entertained him at less expense than four hundred thousand sesterces seven hundred twelve The most famous was a set entertainment given him by his brother at which it is said there were served up no less than two thousand choice fishes and seven thousand birds Yet even this supper he himself outdid at a feast which he gave upon the first use of a dish which had been made for him and which for its extraordinary size he called The Shield of Minerva In this dish there were tossed up together the livers of char fish the brains of pheasants and peacocks with the tongues of flamingos and the entrails of lampreys which had been brought in ships of war as far as four hundred thirty six from the Carpathian Sea and the Spanish Straits He was not only a man of an insatiable appetite but would gratify it likewise at unseasonable times and with any garbage that came in his way so that at a sacrifice he would snatch from the fire flesh and cakes and eat them upon the spot When he travelled he did the same at the inns upon the road whether the meat was fresh dressed and hot or what had been left the day before and was half eaten XIV He delighted in the infliction of punishments and even those which were capital without any distinction of persons or occasions Several noblemen his school fellows and companions invited by him to court he treated with such flattering caresses as seemed to indicate an affection short only of admitting them to share the honours of the imperial dignity yet he put them all to death by some base means or other To one he gave poison with his own hand in a cup of cold water which he called for in a fever He scarcely spared one of all the usurers notaries and publicans who had ever demanded a debt of him at Rome or any toll or custom upon the road One of these while in the very act of saluting him he ordered for execution but immediately sent for him back upon which all about him applauding his clemency he commanded him to be slain in his own presence saying I have a mind to feed my eyes Two sons who interceded for their father he ordered to be executed with him A Roman knight upon his being dragged away for execution and crying out to him You are my heir he desired to produce his will and finding that he had made his freedman joint heir with him he commanded that both he and the freedman should have their throats cut He put to death some of the common people for cursing aloud the blue party in the Circensian games supposing it to be done in contempt of himself and the expectation of a revolution in the government There were no persons he was more severe against than jugglers and astrologers end as soon as any one of them was informed against he put him to death without the formality of a trial He was enraged against them because after his proclamation by which he commanded all astrologers to quit home and Italy also before the calends the first of October a bill was immediately posted about the city with the following words TAKE NOTICE seven hundred thirteen The Chaldaeans also decree that Vitellius Germanicus shall be no more by the day of the said calends He was even suspected of being accessary to his mother s death by forbidding sustenance to be given her when she was unwell a German witch seven hundred fourteen whom he held to be oracular having told him That he would long reign in security if he survived his mother But others say that being quite weary of the state of affairs and apprehensive of the future she obtained without difficulty a dose of poison from her son XV In the eighth month of his reign the troops both in Moesia and Pannonia revolted from him as did likewise of the armies beyond sea those in Judaea and Syria some of which swore allegiance to Vespasian as emperor in his own presence and others in his absence In order therefore to secure the favour and affection of the people Vitellius lavished on all around whatever he had it in his power to bestow both publicly and privately in the most extravagant manner He also levied soldiers in the city and promised all who enlisted as volunteers not only their discharge after the victory was gained but all the rewards due to veterans who had served their full time in the wars The enemy now pressing forward both by sea and land on one hand he opposed against them his brother with a fleet the new levies and a body of gladiators and in another quarter the troops and generals who were engaged at Bedriacum But being beaten or betrayed in every direction he agreed with Flavius Sabinus Vespasian s brother to abdicate on condition of having his life spared and a hundred millions of sesterces granted him and he immediately upon the palace steps publicly declared to a large body of soldiers there assembled that he resigned the government which he had accepted reluctantly but they all remonstrating against it he deferred the conclusion of the treaty Next day early in the morning he came down to the Forum in a very mean habit and with many tears repeated the four hundred thirty eight declaration from a writing which he held in his hand but the soldiers and people again interposing and encouraging him not to give way but to rely on their zealous support he recovered his courage and forced Sabinus with the rest of the Flavian party who now thought themselves secure to retreat into the Capitol where he destroyed them all by setting fire to the temple of Jupiter whilst he beheld the contest and the fire from Tiberius s house seven hundred fifteen where he was feasting Not long after repenting of what he had done and throwing the blame of it upon others he called a meeting and swore that nothing was dearer to him than the public peace which oath he also obliged the rest to take Then drawing a dagger from his side he presented it first to the consul and upon his refusing it to the magistrates and then to every one of the senators but none of them being willing to accept it he went away as if he meant to lay it up in the temple of Concord but some crying out to him You are Concord he came back again and said that he would not only keep his weapon but for the future use the cognomen of Concord XVI He advised the senate to send deputies accompanied by the Vestal Virgins to desire peace or at least time for consultation The day after while he was waiting for an answer he received intelligence by a scout that the enemy was advancing Immediately therefore throwing himself into a small litter borne by hand with only two attendants a baker and a cook he privately withdrew to his father s house on the Aventine hill intending to escape thence into Campania But a groundless report being circulated that the enemy was willing to come to terms he suffered himself to be carried back to the palace Finding however nobody there and those who were with him stealing away he girded round his waist a belt full of gold pieces and then ran into the porter s lodge tying the dog before the door and piling up against it the bed and bedding XVII By this time the forerunners of the enemy s army had broken into the palace and meeting with nobody searched as was natural every corner Being dragged by them out of his cell and asked who he was for they did not recognize him and if he knew where Vitellius was he deceived them by a falsehood But at last being discovered he begged hard to be detained in custody even were it in a prison pretending to have something to say which concerned Vespasian s security Nevertheless he was dragged half naked into the Forum with his hands tied behind him a rope about his neck and his clothes torn amidst the most contemptuous abuse both by word and deed along the Via Sacra his head being held back by the hair in the manner of condemned criminals and the point of a sword put under his chin that he might hold up his face to public view some of the mob meanwhile pelting him with dung and mud whilst others called him an incendiary and glutton They also upbraided him with the defects of his person for he was monstrously tall and had a face usually very red with hard drinking a large belly and one thigh weak occasioned by a chariot running against him as he was attending upon Caius seven hundred sixteen while he was driving At length upon the Scalae Gemoniae he was tormented and put to death in lingering tortures and then dragged by a hook into the Tiber XVIII He perished with his brother and son seven hundred seventeen in the fifty seventh year of his age seven hundred eighteen and verified the prediction of those who from the omen which happened to him at Vienne as before related seven hundred nineteen foretold that he would be made prisoner by some man of Gaul For he was seized by Antoninus Primus a general of the adverse party who was born at Toulouse and when a boy had the cognomen of Becco seven hundred twenty which signifies a cock s beak four hundred forty After the extinction of the race of the Caesars the possession of the imperial power became extremely precarious and great influence in the army was the means which now invariably led to the throne The soldiers having arrogated to themselves the right of nomination they either unanimously elected one and the same person or different parties supporting the interests of their respective favourites there arose between them a contention which was usually determined by an appeal to arms and followed by the assassination of the unsuccessful competitor Vitellius by being a parasite of all the emperors from Tiberius to Nero inclusively had risen to a high military rank by which with a spirit of enterprise and large promises to the soldiery it was not difficult to snatch the reins of government while they were yet fluctuating in the hands of Otho His ambition prompted to the attempt and his boldness was crowned with success In the service of the four preceding emperors Vitellius had imbibed the principal vices of them all but what chiefly distinguished him was extreme voraciousness which though he usually pampered it with enormous luxury could yet be gratified by the vilest and most offensive garbage The pusillanimity discovered by this emperor at his death forms a striking contrast to the heroic behaviour of Otho T FLAVIUS VESPASIANUS AUGUSTUS four hundred forty one I The empire which had been long thrown into a disturbed and unsetted state by the rebellion and violent death of its three last rulers was at length restored to peace and security by the Flavian family whose descent was indeed obscure and which boasted no ancestral honours but the public had no cause to regret its elevation though it is acknowledged that Domitian met with the just reward of his avarice and cruelty Titus Flavius Petro a townsman of Reate seven hundred twenty one whether a centurion or an evocatus seven hundred twenty two of Pompey s party in the civil war is uncertain fled out of the battle of Pharsalia and went home where having at last obtained his pardon and discharge he became a collector of the money raised by public sales in the way of auction His son surnamed Sabinus was never engaged in the military service though some say he was a centurion of the first order and others that whilst he held that rank he was discharged on account of his bad state of health this Sabinus I say was a publican and received the tax of the fortieth penny in Asia And there were remaining at the time of the advancement of the family several statues which had been erected to him by the cities of that province with this inscription To the honest Tax farmer seven hundred twenty three He afterwards turned usurer amongst the Helvetii and there died leaving behind him his wife Vespasia Pella and two sons by her the elder of whom Sabinus came to be prefect of the city and the younger Vespasian to be emperor Polla descended of a good family at Nursia seven hundred twenty four had for her father Vespasius Pollio thrice appointed four hundred forty two military tribune and at last prefect of the camp and her brother was a senator of praetorian dignity There is to this day about six miles from Nursia on the road to Spoletum a place on the summit of a hill called Vespasiae where are several monuments of the Vespasii a sufficient proof of the splendour and antiquity of the family I will not deny that some have pretended to say that Petro s father was a native of Gallia Transpadana seven hundred twenty five whose employment was to hire workpeople who used to emigrate every year from the country of the Umbria into that of the Sabines to assist them in their husbandry seven hundred twenty six but who settled at last in the town of Reate and there married But of this I have not been able to discover the least proof upon the strictest inquiry II Vespasian was born in the country of the Sabines beyond Reate in a little country seat called Phalacrine upon the fifth of the calends of December twenty seventh November in the evening in the consulship of Quintus Sulpicius Camerinus and Caius Poppaeus Sabinus five years before the death of Augustus seven hundred twenty seven and was educated under the care of Tertulla his grandmother by the father s side upon an estate belonging to the family at Cosa seven hundred twenty eight After his advancement to the empire he used frequently to visit the place where he had spent his infancy and the villa was continued in the same condition that he might see every thing about him just as he had been used to do And he had so great a regard for the memory of his grandmother that upon solemn occasions and festival days he constantly drank out of a silver cup which she had been accustomed to use After assuming the manly habit he had a long time a distaste for the senatorian toga though his brother had obtained it nor could he be persuaded by any one but his mother to sue for that badge of honour She at length drove him to it more by taunts and reproaches than by her entreaties four hundred forty three and authority calling him now and then by way of reproach his brother s footman He served as military tribune in Thrace When made quaestor the province of Crete and Cyrene fell to him by lot He was candidate for the aedileship and soon after for the praetorship but met with a repulse in the former case though at last with much difficulty he came in sixth on the poll books But the office of praetor he carried upon his first canvass standing amongst the highest at the poll Being incensed against the senate and desirous to gain by all possible means the good graces of Caius seven hundred twenty nine he obtained leave to exhibit extraordinary seven hundred thirty games for the emperor s victory in Germany and advised them to increase the punishment of the conspirators against his life by exposing their corpses unburied He likewise gave him thanks in that august assembly for the honour of being admitted to his table III Meanwhile he married Flavia Domitilla who had formerly been the mistress of Statilius Capella a Roman knight of Sabrata in Africa who Domitilla enjoyed Latin rights and was soon after declared fully and freely a citizen of Rome on a trial before the court of Recovery brought by her father Flavius Liberalis a native of Ferentum but no more than secretary to a quaestor By her he had the following children Titus Domitian and Domitilla He outlived his wife and daughter and lost them both before he became emperor After the death of his wife he renewed his union seven hundred thirty one with his former concubine Caenis the freedwoman of Antonia and also her amanuensis and treated her even after he was emperor almost as if she had been his lawful wife seven hundred thirty two four hundred forty four IV In the reign of Claudius by the interest of Narcissus he was sent to Germany in command of a legion whence being removed into Britain he engaged the enemy in thirty several battles He reduced under subjection to the Romans two very powerful tribes and above twenty great towns with the Isle of Wight which lies close to the coast of Britain partly under the command of Aulus Plautius the consular lieutenant and partly under Claudius himself seven hundred thirty three For this success he received the triumphal ornaments and in a short time after two priesthoods besides the consulship which he held during the two last months of the year seven hundred thirty four The interval between that and his proconsulship he spent in leisure and retirement for fear of Agrippina who still held great sway over her son and hated all the friends of Narcissus who was then dead Afterwards he got by lot the province of Africa which he governed with great reputation excepting that once in an insurrection at Adrumetum he was pelted with turnips It is certain that he returned thence nothing richer for his credit was so low that he was obliged to mortgage his whole property to his brother and was reduced to the necessity of dealing in mules for the support of his rank for which reason he was commonly called the Muleteer He is said likewise to have been convicted of extorting from a young man of fashion two hundred thousand sesterces for procuring him the broad stripe contrary to the wishes of his father and was severely reprimanded for it While in attendance upon Nero in Achaia he frequently withdrew from the theatre while Nero was singing and went to sleep if he remained which gave so much four hundred forty five offence that he was not only excluded from his society but debarred the liberty of saluting him in public Upon this he retired to a small out of the way town where he lay skulking in constant fear of his life until a province with an army was offered him A firm persuasion had long prevailed through all the East seven hundred thirty five that it was fated for the empire of the world at that time to devolve on some who should go forth from Judaea This prediction referred to a Roman emperor as the event shewed but the Jews applying it to themselves broke out into rebellion and having defeated and slain their governor seven hundred thirty six routed the lieutenant of Syria seven hundred thirty seven a man of consular rank who was advancing to his assistance and took an eagle the standard of one of his legions As the suppression of this revolt appeared to require a stronger force and an active general who might be safely trusted in an affair of so much importance Vespasian was chosen in preference to all others both for his known activity and on account of the obscurity of his origin and name being a person of whom four hundred forty six there could be not the least jealousy Two legions therefore eight squadrons of horse and ten cohorts being added to the former troops in Judaea and taking with him his eldest son as lieutenant as soon as he arrived in his province he turned the eyes of the neighbouring provinces upon him by reforming immediately the discipline of the camp and engaging the enemy once or twice with such resolution that in the attack of a castle seven hundred thirty eight he had his knee hurt by the stroke of a stone and received several arrows in his shield V After the deaths of Nero and Galba whilst Otho and Vitellius were contending for the sovereignty he entertained hopes of obtaining the empire with the prospect of which he had long before flattered himself from the following omens Upon an estate belonging to the Flavian family in the neighbourhood of Rome there was an old oak sacred to Mars which at the three several deliveries of Vespasia put out each time a new branch evident intimations of the future fortune of each child The first was but a slender one which quickly withered away and accordingly the girl that was born did not live long The second became vigorous which portended great good fortune but the third grew like a tree His father Sabinus encouraged by these omens which were confirmed by the augurs told his mother that her grandson would be emperor of Rome at which she laughed heartily wondering she said that her son should be in his dotage whilst she continued still in full possession of her faculties Afterwards in his aedileship when Caius Caesar being enraged at his not taking care to have the streets kept clean ordered the soldiers to fill the bosom of his gown with dirt some persons at that time construed it into a sign that the government being trampled under foot and deserted in some civil commotion would fall under his protection and as it were into his lap Once while he was at dinner a strange dog that wandered about the streets brought a man s hand seven hundred thirty nine and laid it under the table And another time while he was at supper a plough ox throwing the yoke off his neck broke into the room and after he had frightened away all the attendants four hundred forty seven on a sudden as if he was tired fell down at his feet as he lay still upon his couch and hung down his neck A cypress tree likewise in a field belonging to the family was torn up by the roots and laid flat upon the ground when there was no violent wind but next day it rose again fresher and stronger than before He dreamt in Achaia that the good fortune of himself and his family would begin when Nero had a tooth drawn and it happened that the day after a surgeon coming into the hall showed him a tooth which he had just extracted from Nero In Judaea upon his consulting the oracle of the divinity at Carmel seven hundred forty the answer was so encouraging as to assure him of success in anything he projected however great or important it might be And when Josephus seven hundred forty one one of the noble prisoners was put in chains he confidently affirmed that he should be released in a very short time by the same Vespasian but he would be emperor first seven hundred forty two Some omens were likewise mentioned in the news from Rome and among others that Nero towards the close of his days was commanded in a dream to carry Jupiter s sacred chariot out of the sanctuary where it stood to Vespasian s house and conduct it thence into the circus Also not long afterwards as Galba was going to the election in which he was created consul for the second time a statue of the Divine Julius seven hundred forty three turned towards the east And in the field of Bedriacum seven hundred forty four before the battle began two eagles engaged in the sight of the army and one of them being beaten a third came from the east and drove away the conqueror four hundred forty eight VI He made however no attempt upon the sovereignty though his friends were very ready to support him and even pressed him to the enterprise until he was encouraged to it by the fortuitous aid of persons unknown to him and at a distance Two thousand men drawn out of three legions in the Moesian army had been sent to the assistance of Otho While they were upon their march news came that he had been defeated and had put an end to his life notwithstanding which they continued their march as far as Aquileia pretending that they gave no credit to the report There tempted by the opportunity which the disorder of the times afforded them they ravaged and plundered the country at discretion until at length fearing to be called to an account on their return and punished for it they resolved upon choosing and creating an emperor For they were no ways inferior they said to the army which made Galba emperor nor to the pretorian troops which had set up Otho nor the army in Germany to whom Vitellius owed his elevation The names of all the consular lieutenants therefore being taken into consideration and one objecting to one and another to another for various reasons at last some of the third legion which a little before Nero s death had been removed out of Syria into Moesia extolled Vespasian in high terms and all the rest assenting his name was immediately inscribed on their standards The design was nevertheless quashed for a time the troops being brought to submit to Vitellius a little longer However the fact becoming known Tiberius Alexander governor of Egypt first obliged the legions under his command to swear obedience to Vespasian as their emperor on the calends the first of July which was observed ever after as the day of his accession to the empire and upon the fifth of the ides of the same month the twenty eighth July the army in Judaea where he then was also swore allegiance to him What contributed greatly to forward the affair was a copy of a letter whether real or counterfeit which was circulated and said to have been written by Otho before his decease to Vespasian recommending to him in the most urgent terms to avenge his death and entreating him to come to the aid of the commonwealth as well as a report which was circulated that Vitellius after his success against Otho proposed to change the winter quarters of the legions and remove those in Germany to a less four hundred forty nine hazardous station and a warmer climate Moreover amongst the governors of provinces Licinius Mucianus dropping the grudge arising from a jealousy of which he had hitherto made no secret promised to join him with the Syrian army and among the allied kings Volugesus king of the Parthians offered him a reinforcement of forty thousand archers VII Having therefore entered on a civil war and sent forward his generals and forces into Italy he himself in the meantime passed over to Alexandria to obtain possession of the key of Egypt seven hundred forty five Here having entered alone without attendants the temple of Serapis to take the auspices respecting the establishment of his power and having done his utmost to propitiate the deity upon turning round his freedman Basilides seven hundred forty six appeared before him and seemed to offer him the sacred leaves chaplets and cakes according to the usage of the place although no one had admitted him and he had long laboured under a muscular debility which would hardly have allowed him to walk into the temple besides which it was certain that at the very time he was far away Immediately after this arrived letters with intelligence that Vitellius s troops had been defeated at Cremona and he himself slain at Rome Vespasian the new emperor having been raised unexpectedly from a low estate wanted something which might clothe him with divine majesty and authority This likewise was now added A poor man who was blind and another who was lame came both together before him when he was seated on the tribunal imploring him to heal them seven hundred forty seven and saying that they were admonished four hundred fifty in a dream by the god Serapis to seek his aid who assured them that he would restore sight to the one by anointing his eyes with his spittle and give strength to the leg of the other if he vouchsafed but to touch it with his heel At first he could scarcely believe that the thing would any how succeed and therefore hesitated to venture on making the experiment At length however by the advice of his friends he made the attempt publicly in the presence of the assembled multitudes and it was crowned with success in both cases seven hundred forty eight About the same time at Tegea in Arcadia by the direction four hundred fifty one of some soothsayers several vessels of ancient workmanship were dug out of a consecrated place on which there was an effigy resembling Vespasian VIII Returning now to Rome under these auspices and with a great reputation after enjoying a triumph for victories over the Jews he added eight consulships seven hundred forty nine to his former one He likewise assumed the censorship and made it his principal concern during the whole of his government first to restore order in the state which had been almost ruined and was in a tottering condition and then to improve it The soldiers one part of them emboldened by victory and the other smarting with the disgrace of their defeat had abandoned themselves to every species of licentiousness and insolence Nay the provinces too and free cities and some kingdoms in alliance with Rome were all in a disturbed state He therefore disbanded many of Vitellius s soldiers and punished others and so far was he from granting any extraordinary favours to the sharers of his success that it was late before he paid the gratuities due to them by law That he might let slip no opportunity of reforming the discipline of the army upon a young man s coming much perfumed to return him thanks four hundred fifty two for having appointed him to command a squadron of horse he turned away his head in disgust and giving him this sharp reprimand I had rather you had smelt of garlic revoked his commission When the men belonging to the fleet who travelled by turns from Ostia and Puteoli to Rome petitioned for an addition to their pay under the name of shoe money thinking that it would answer little purpose to send them away without a reply he ordered them for the future to run barefooted and so they have done ever since He deprived of their liberties Achaia Lycia Rhodes Byzantium and Samos and reduced them into the form of provinces Thrace also and Cilicia as well as Comagene which until that time had been under the government of kings He stationed some legions in Cappadocia on account of the frequent inroads of the barbarians and instead of a Roman knight appointed as governor of it a man of consular rank The ruins of houses which had been burnt down long before being a great desight to the city he gave leave to any one who would to take possession of the void ground and build upon it if the proprietors should hesitate to perform the work themselves He resolved upon rebuilding the Capitol and was the foremost to put his hand to clearing the ground of the rubbish and removed some of it upon his own shoulder And he undertook likewise to restore the three thousand tables of brass which had been destroyed in the fire which consumed the Capitol searching in all quarters for copies of those curious and ancient records in which were contained the decrees of the senate almost from the building of the city as well as the acts of the people relative to alliances treaties and privileges granted to any person IX He likewise erected several new public buildings namely the temple of Peace seven hundred fifty near the Forum that of Claudius on the four hundred fifty three Coelian mount which had been begun by Agrippina but almost entirely demolished by Nero seven hundred fifty one and an amphitheatre seven hundred fifty two in the middle of the city upon finding that Augustus had projected such a work He purified the senatorian and equestrian orders which had been much reduced by the havoc made amongst them at several times and was fallen into disrepute by neglect Having expelled the most unworthy he chose in their room the most honourable persons in Italy and the provinces And to let it be known that those two orders differed not so much in privileges as in dignity he declared publicly when some altercation passed between a senator and a Roman knight that senators ought not to be treated with scurrilous language unless they were the aggressors and then it was fair and lawful to return it X The business of the courts had prodigiously accumulated partly from old law suits which on account of the interruption that had been given to the course of justice still remained undecided and partly from the accession of new suits arising out of the disorder of the times He therefore chose commissioners by lot to provide for the restitution of what had been seized by violence during the war and others with extraordinary jurisdiction to decide causes belonging to the centumviri and reduce them to as small a number as possible for the dispatch of which otherwise the lives of the litigants could scarcely allow sufficient time XI Lust and luxury from the licence which had long prevailed had also grown to an enormous height He therefore obtained a decree of the senate that a woman who formed an union with the slave of another person should be considered four hundred fifty four a bondwoman herself and that usurers should not be allowed to take proceedings at law for the recovery of money lent to young men whilst they lived in their father s family not even after their fathers were dead XII In other affairs from the beginning to the end of his government he conducted himself with great moderation and clemency He was so far from dissembling the obscurity of his extraction that he frequently made mention of it himself When some affected to trace his pedigree to the founders of Reate and a companion of Hercules seven hundred fifty three whose monument is still to be seen on the Salarian road he laughed at them for it And he was so little fond of external and adventitious ornaments that on the day of his triumph seven hundred fifty four being quite tired of the length and tediousness of the procession he could not forbear saying he was rightly served for having in his old age been so silly as to desire a triumph as if it was either due to his ancestors or had ever been expected by himself Nor would he for a long time accept of the tribunitian authority or the title of Father of his Country And in regard to the custom of searching those who came to salute him he dropped it even in the time of the civil war XIII He bore with great mildness the freedom used by his friends the satirical allusions of advocates and the petulance of philosophers Licinius Mucianus who had been guilty of notorious acts of lewdness but presuming upon his great services treated him very rudely he reproved only in private and when complaining of his conduct to a common friend of theirs he concluded with these words However I am a man Salvius Liberalis in pleading the cause of a rich man under prosecution presuming to say What is it to Caesar if Hipparchus possesses a hundred millions of sesterces he commended him for it Demetrius the Cynic philosopher seven hundred fifty five four hundred fifty five who had been sentenced to banishment meeting him on the road and refusing to rise up or salute him nay snarling at him in scurrilous language he only called him a cur XIV He was little disposed to keep up the memory of affronts or quarrels nor did he harbour any resentment on account of them He made a very splendid marriage for the daughter of his enemy Vitellius and gave her besides a suitable fortune and equipage Being in a great consternation after he was forbidden the court in the time of Nero and asking those about him what he should do or whither he should go one of those whose office it was to introduce people to the emperor thrusting him out bid him go to Morbonia seven hundred fifty six But when this same person came afterwards to beg his pardon he only vented his resentment in nearly the same words He was so far from being influenced by suspicion or fear to seek the destruction of any one that when his friends advised him to beware of Metius Pomposianus because it was commonly believed on his nativity being cast that he was destined by fate to the empire he made him consul promising for him that he would not forget the benefit conferred XV It will scarcely be found that so much as one innocent person suffered in his reign unless in his absence and without his knowledge or at least contrary to his inclination and when he was imposed upon Although Helvidius Priscus seven hundred fifty seven was the only man who presumed to salute him on his return from Syria by his private name of Vespasian and when he came to be praetor omitted any mark of honour to him or even any mention of him in his edicts yet he was not angry until Helvidius proceeded to inveigh against him with the most scurrilous language four hundred fifty six Though he did indeed banish him and afterwards ordered him to be put to death yet he would gladly have saved him notwithstanding and accordingly dispatched messengers to fetch back the executioners and he would have saved him had he not been deceived by a false account brought that he had already perished He never rejoiced at the death of any man nay he would shed tears and sigh at the just punishment of the guilty XVI The only thing deservedly blameable in his character was his love of money For not satisfied with reviving the imposts which had been repealed in the time of Galba he imposed new and onerous taxes augmented the tribute of the provinces and doubled that of some of them He likewise openly engaged in a traffic which is discreditable seven hundred fifty eight even to a private individual buying great quantities of goods for the purpose of retailing them again to advantage Nay he made no scruple of selling the great offices of the state to candidates and pardons to persons under prosecution whether they were innocent or guilty It is believed that he advanced all the most rapacious amongst the procurators to higher offices with the view of squeezing them after they had acquired great wealth He was commonly said to have used them as sponges because it was his practice as we may say to wet them when dry and squeeze them when wet It is said that he was naturally extremely covetous and was upbraided with it by an old herdsman of his who upon the emperor s refusing to enfranchise him gratis which on his advancement he humbly petitioned for cried out That the fox changed his hair but not his nature On the other hand some are of opinion that he was urged to his rapacious proceedings by necessity and the extreme poverty of the treasury and exchequer of which he took public notice in the beginning of his reign declaring that no less than four hundred thousand millions of sesterces were wanting to carry on the government This is the more likely to be true because he applied to the best purposes what he procured by bad means XVII His liberality however to all ranks of people was excessive He made up to several senators the estate required four hundred fifty seven by law to qualify them for that dignity relieving likewise such men of consular rank as were poor with a yearly allowance of five hundred thousand sesterces seven hundred fifty nine and rebuilt in a better manner than before several cities in different parts of the empire which had been damaged by earthquakes or fires XVIII He was a great encourager of learning and the liberal arts He first granted to the Latin and Greek professors of rhetoric the yearly stipend of a hundred thousand sesterces seven hundred sixty each out of the exchequer He also bought the freedom of superior poets and artists seven hundred sixty one and gave a noble gratuity to the restorer of the Coan of Venus seven hundred sixty two and to another artist who repaired the Colossus seven hundred sixty three Some one offering to convey some immense columns into the Capitol at a small expense by a mechanical contrivance he rewarded him very handsomely for his invention but would not accept his service saying Suffer me to find maintenance for the poor people seven hundred sixty four XIX In the games celebrated when the stage scenery of four hundred fifty eight the theatre of Marcellus seven hundred sixty five was repaired he restored the old musical entertainments He gave Apollinaris the tragedian four hundred thousand sesterces and to Terpinus and Diodorus the harpers two hundred thousand to some a hundred thousand and the least he gave to any of the performers was forty thousand besides many golden crowns He entertained company constantly at his table and often in great state and very sumptuously in order to promote trade As in the Saturnalia he made presents to the men which they were to carry away with them so did he to the women upon the calends of March seven hundred sixty six notwithstanding which he could not wipe off the disrepute of his former stinginess The Alexandrians called him constantly Cybiosactes a name which had been given to one of their kings who was sordidly avaricious Nay at his funeral Favo the principal mimic personating him and imitating as actors do both his manner of speaking and his gestures asked aloud of the procurators how much his funeral and the procession would cost And being answered ten millions of sesterces he cried out give him but a hundred thousand sesterces and they might throw his body into the Tiber if they would XX He was broad set strong limbed and his features gave the idea of a man in the act of straining himself In consequence one of the city wits upon the emperor s desiring him to say something droll respecting himself facetiously answered I will when you have done relieving your bowels seven hundred sixty seven He enjoyed a good state of health though he used no other means to preserve it than repeated friction as much four hundred fifty nine as he could bear on his neck and other parts of his body in the tennis court attached to the baths besides fasting one day in every month XXI His method of life was commonly this After he became emperor he used to rise very early often before daybreak Having read over his letters and the briefs of all the departments of the government offices he admitted his friends and while they were paying him their compliments he would put on his own shoes and dress himself with his own hands Then after the dispatch of such business as was brought before him he rode out and afterwards retired to repose lying on his couch with one of his mistresses of whom he kept several after the death of Caenis seven hundred sixty eight Coming out of his private apartments he passed to the bath and then entered the supper room They say that he was never more good humoured and indulgent than at that time and therefore his attendants always seized that opportunity when they had any favour to ask XXII At supper and indeed at other times he was extremely free and jocose For he had humour but of a low kind and he would sometimes use indecent language such as is addressed to young girls about to be married Yet there are some things related of him not void of ingenious pleasantry amongst which are the following Being once reminded by Mestrius Florus that plaustra was a more proper expression than plostra he the next day saluted him by the name of Flaurus seven hundred sixty nine A certain lady pretending to be desperately enamoured of him he was prevailed upon to admit her to his bed and after he had gratified her desires he gave her seven hundred seventy four hundred four hundred sixty thousand sesterces When his steward desired to know how he would have the sum entered in his accounts he replied For Vespasian s being seduced XXIII He used Greek verses very wittily speaking of a tall man who had enormous parts Makxi bibas kradon dolichoskion enchos Still shaking as he strode his vast long spear And of Cerylus a freedman who being very rich had begun to pass himself off as free born to elude the exchequer at his decease and assumed the name of Laches he said O Lachaes Lachaes Epan apothanaes authis ex archaes esae Kaerylos Ah Laches Laches when thou art no more Thou lieutenant Cerylus be called just as before He chiefly affected wit upon his own shameful means of raising money in order to wipe off the odium by some joke and turn it into ridicule One of his ministers who was much in his favour requesting of him a stewardship for some person under pretence of his being his brother he deferred granting him his petition and in the meantime sent for the candidate and having squeezed out of him as much money as he had agreed to give to his friend at court he appointed him immediately to the office The minister soon after renewing his application You must said he find another brother for the one you adopted is in truth mine Suspecting once during a journey that his mule driver had alighted to shoe his mules only in order to have an opportunity for allowing a person they met who was engaged in a law suit to speak to him he asked him how much he got for shoeing his mules and insisted on having a share of the profit When his son Titus blamed him for even laying a tax upon urine he applied to his nose a piece of the money he received in the first instalment and asked him if it stunk And he replying no And yet said he it is derived from urine Some deputies having come to acquaint him that a large statue which would cost a vast sum was ordered to be erected for him at the public expense he told them to pay it down immediately four hundred sixty one holding out the hollow of his hand and saying there was a base ready for the statue Not even when he was under the immediate apprehension and peril of death could he forbear jesting For when among other prodigies the mausoleum of the Caesars suddenly flew open and a blazing star appeared in the heavens one of the prodigies he said concerned Julia Calvina who was of the family of Augustus seven hundred seventy one and the other the king of the Parthians who wore his hair long And when his distemper first seized him I suppose said he I shall soon be a god seven hundred seventy two XXIV In his ninth consulship being seized while in Campania with a slight indisposition and immediately returning to the city he soon afterwards went thence to Cutiliae seven hundred seventy three and his estates in the country about Reate where he used constantly to spend the summer Here though his disorder much increased and he injured his bowels by too free use of the cold waters he nevertheless attended to the dispatch of business and even gave audience to ambassadors in bed At last being taken ill of a diarrhoea to such a degree that he was ready to faint he cried out An emperor ought to die standing upright In endeavouring to rise he died in the hands of those who were helping him up upon the eighth of the calends of July twenty fourth June seven hundred seventy four being sixty nine years one month and seven days old XXV All are agreed that he had such confidence in the calculations on his own nativity and that of his sons that after several conspiracies against him he told the senate that either his sons would succeed him or nobody It is said likewise that he once saw in a dream a balance in the middle of the porch of the Palatine house exactly poised in one four hundred sixty two scale of which stood Claudius and Nero in the other himself and his sons The event corresponded to the symbol for the reigns of the two parties were precisely of the same duration seven hundred seventy five Neither consanguinity nor adoption as formerly but great influence in the army having now become the road to the imperial throne no person could claim a better title to that elevation than Titus Flavius Vespasian He had not only served with great reputation in the wars both in Britain and Judaea but seemed as yet untainted with any vice which could pervert his conduct in the civil administration of the empire It appears however that he was prompted more by the persuasion of friends than by his own ambition to prosecute the attainment of the imperial dignity To render this enterprise more successful recourse was had to a new and peculiar artifice which while well accommodated to the superstitious credulity of the Romans impressed them with an idea that Vespasian s destiny to the throne was confirmed by supernatural indications But after his elevation we hear no more of his miraculous achievements The prosecution of the war in Britain which had been suspended for some years was resumed by Vespasian and he sent thither Petilius Cerealis who by his bravery extended the limits of the Roman province Under Julius Frontinus successor to that general the invaders continued to make farther progress in the reduction of the island but the commander who finally established the dominion of the Romans in Britain was Julius Agricola not less distinguished for his military achievements than for his prudent regard to the civil administration of the country He began his operations with the conquest of North Wales whence passing over into the island of Anglesey which had revolted since the time of Suetonius Paulinus he again reduced it to subjection Then proceeding northwards with his victorious army he defeated the Britons in every engagement took possession of all the territories in the southern parts of the island and driving before him all who refused to submit to the Roman arms penetrated even into the forests and mountains of Caledonia He defeated the natives under Galgacus their leader in a decisive battle and fixing a line of garrisons between the friths of Clyde and Forth he secured the Roman province from the incursions of the people who occupied the parts of the island four hundred sixty three beyond that boundary Wherever he established the Roman power he introduced laws and civilization amongst the inhabitants and employed every means of conciliating their affection as well as of securing their obedience The war in Judaea which had been commenced under the former reign was continued in that of Vespasian but he left the siege of Jerusalem to be conducted by his son Titus who displayed great valour and military talents in the prosecution of the enterprise After an obstinate defence by the Jews that city so much celebrated in the sacred writings was finally demolished and the glorious temple itself the admiration of the world reduced to ashes contrary however to the will of Titus who exerted his utmost efforts to extinguish the flames The manners of the Romans had now attained to an enormous pitch of depravity through the unbounded licentiousness of the tines and to the honour of Vespasian he discovered great zeal in his endeavours to effect a national reformation Vigilant active and persevering he was indefatigable in the management of public affairs and rose in the winter before day break to give audience to his officers of state But if we give credit to the whimsical imposition of a tax upon urine we cannot entertain any high opinion either of his talents as a financier or of the resources of the Roman empire By his encouragement of science he displayed a liberality of which there occurs no example under all the preceding emperors since the time of Augustus Pliny the elder was now in the height of reputation as well as in great favour with Vespasian and it was probably owing not a little to the advice of that minister that the emperor showed himself so much the patron of literary men A writer mentioned frequently by Pliny and who lived in this reign was Licinius Mucianus a Roman knight he treated of the history and geography of the eastern countries Juvenal who had begun his Satires several years before continued to inveigh against the flagrant vices of the times but the only author whose writings we have to notice in the present reign is a poet of a different class C VALERIUS FLACCUS wrote a poem in eight books on the Expedition of the Argonauts a subject which next to the wars of Thebes and Troy was in ancient times the most celebrated Of the life of this author biographers have transmitted no particulars but we may place his birth in the reign of Tiberius before all the writers who flourished in the Augustan age were extinct He enjoyed the rays of the setting sun which had illumined that glorious period and he discovers the efforts of an ambition to recall its meridian splendour As the poem was left four hundred sixty four incomplete by the death of the author we can only judge imperfectly of the conduct and general consistency of the fable but the most difficult part having been executed without any room for the censure of candid criticism we may presume that the sequel would have been finished with an equal claim to indulgence if not to applause The traditional anecdotes relative to the Argonautic expedition are introduced with propriety and embellished with the graces of poetical fiction In describing scenes of tenderness this author is happily pathetic and in the heat of combat proportionably animated His similes present the imagination with beautiful imagery and not only illustrate but give additional force to the subject We find in Flaccus a few expressions not countenanced by the authority of the most celebrated Latin writers His language however in general is pure but his words are perhaps not always the best that might have been chosen The versification is elevated though not uniformly harmonious and there pervades the whole poem an epic dignity which renders it superior to the production ascribed to Orpheus or to that of Apollonius on the same subject TITUS FLAVIUS VESPASIANUS AUGUSTUS four hundred sixty five I Titus who had the same cognomen with his father was the darling and delight of mankind so much did the natural genius address or good fortune he possessed tend to conciliate the favour of all This was indeed extremely difficult after he became emperor as before that time and even during the reign of his father he lay under public odium and censure He was born upon the third of the calends of January thirtieth Dec in the year remarkable for the death of Caius seven hundred seventy six near the Septizonium seven hundred seventy seven in a mean house and a very small and dark room which still exists and is shown to the curious II He was educated in the palace with Britannicus and instructed in the same branches of learning and under the same masters During this time they say that a physiognomist being introduced by Narcissus the freedman of Claudius to examine the features of Britannicus seven hundred seventy eight positively affirmed that he would never become emperor but that Titus who stood by would They were so familiar that Titus being next him at table is thought to have tasted of the fatal potion which put an end to Britannicus s life and to have contracted from it a distemper which hung about him a long time In remembrance of all these circumstances he afterwards erected a golden statue of him in the Palatium and dedicated to him an equestrian statue of ivory attending it in the Circensian procession in which it is still carried to this day four hundred sixty six III While yet a boy he was remarkable for his noble endowments both of body and mind and as he advanced in years they became still more conspicuous He had a fine person combining an equal mixture of majesty and grace was very strong though not tall and somewhat corpulent Gifted with an excellent memory and a capacity for all the arts of peace and war he was a perfect master of the use of arms and riding very ready in the Latin and Greek tongues both in verse and prose and such was the facility he possessed in both that he would harangue and versify extempore Nor was he unacquainted with music but could both sing and play upon the harp sweetly and scientifically I have likewise been informed by many persons that he was remarkably quick in writing short hand would in merriment and jest engage with his secretaries in the imitation of any hand writing he saw and often say that he was admirably qualified for forgery IV He filled with distinction the rank of a military tribune both in Germany and Britain in which he conducted himself with the utmost activity and no less modesty and reputation as appears evident from the great number of statues with honourable inscriptions erected to him in various parts of both those provinces After serving in the wars he frequented the courts of law but with less assiduity than applause About the same time he married Arricidia the daughter of Tertullus who was only a knight but had formerly been prefect of the pretorian guards After her decease he married Marcia Furnilla of a very noble family but afterwards divorced her taking from her the daughter he had by her Upon the expiration of his quaestorship he was raised to the rank of commander of a legion seven hundred seventy nine and took the two strong cities of Tarichaea and Gamala in Judaea and having his horse killed under him in a battle he mounted another whose rider he had encountered and slain V Soon afterwards when Galba came to be emperor he was sent to congratulate him and turned the eyes of all people upon himself wherever he came it being the general opinion amongst them that the emperor had sent for him with a design to adopt him for his son But finding all things again in confusion he turned back upon the road and going to consult four hundred sixty seven the oracle of Venus at Paphos about his voyage he received assurances of obtaining the empire for himself These hopes were speedily strengthened and being left to finish the reduction of Judaea in the final assault of Jerusalem he slew seven of its defenders with the like number of arrows and took it upon his daughter s birth day seven hundred eighty So great was the joy and attachment of the soldiers that in their congratulations they unanimously saluted him by the title of Emperor seven hundred eighty one and upon his quitting the province soon afterwards would needs have detained him earnestly begging him and that not without threats either to stay or take them all with him This occurrence gave rise to the suspicion of his being engaged in a design to rebel against his father and claim for himself the government of the East and the suspicion increased when on his way to Alexandria he wore a diadem at the consecration of the ox Apis at Memphis and though he did it only in compliance with an ancient religious usage of the country yet there was some who put a bad construction upon it Making therefore what haste he could into Italy he arrived first at Rhegium and sailing thence in a merchant ship to Puteoli went to Rome with all possible expedition Presenting himself unexpectedly to his father he said by way of contradicting the strange reports raised concerning him I am come father I am come VI From that time he constantly acted as colleague with his father and indeed as regent of the empire He triumphed seven hundred eighty two four hundred sixty eight with his father bore jointly with him the office of censor seven hundred eighty three and was besides his colleague not only in the tribunitian authority seven hundred eighty four but in seven consulships seven hundred eighty five Taking upon himself the care and inspection of all offices he dictated letters wrote proclamations in his father s name and pronounced his speeches in the senate in place of the quaestor He likewise assumed the command of the pretorian guards although no one but a Roman knight had ever before been their prefect In this he conducted himself with great haughtiness and violence taking off without scruple or delay all those he had most reason to suspect after he had secretly sent his emissaries into the theatres and camp to demand as if by general consent that the suspected persons should be delivered up to punishment Among these he invited to supper A Caecina a man of consular rank whom he ordered to be stabbed at his departure immediately after he had gone out of the room To this act indeed he was provoked by an imminent danger for he had discovered a writing under the hand of Caecina containing an account of a plot hatched among the soldiers By these acts though he provided for his future security yet for the present he so much incurred the hatred of the people that scarcely ever any one came to the empire with a more odious character or more universally disliked VII Besides his cruelty he lay under the suspicion of giving four hundred sixty nine way to habits of luxury as he often prolonged his revels till midnight with the most riotous of his acquaintance Nor was he unsuspected of lewdness on account of the swarms of catamites and eunuchs about him and his well known attachment to queen Berenice seven hundred eighty six who received from him as it is reported a promise of marriage He was supposed besides to be of a rapacious disposition for it is certain that in causes which came before his father he used to offer his interest for sale and take bribes In short people publicly expressed an unfavourable opinion of him and said he would prove another Nero This prejudice however turned out in the end to his advantage and enhanced his praises to the highest pitch when he was found to possess no vicious propensities but on the contrary the noblest virtues His entertainments were agreeable rather than extravagant and he surrounded himself with such excellent friends that the succeeding princes adopted them as most serviceable to themselves and the state He immediately sent away Berenice from the city much against both their inclinations Some of his old eunuchs though such accomplished dancers that they bore an uncontrollable sway upon the stage he was so far from treating with any extraordinary kindness that he would not so much as witness their performances in the crowded theatre He violated no private right four hundred seventy and if ever man refrained from injustice he did nay he would not accept of the allowable and customary offerings Yet in munificence he was inferior to none of the princes before him Having dedicated his amphitheatre seven hundred eighty seven and built some warm baths seven hundred eighty eight close by it with great expedition he entertained the people with most magnificent spectacles He likewise exhibited a naval fight in the old Naumachia besides a combat of gladiators and in one day brought into the theatre five thousand wild beasts of all kinds seven hundred eighty nine four hundred seventy one VIII He was by nature extremely benevolent for whereas all the emperors after Tiberius according to the example he had set them would not admit the grants made by former princes to be valid unless they received their own sanction he confirmed them all by one general edict without waiting for any applications respecting them Of all who petitioned for any favour he sent none away without hopes And when his ministers represented to him that he promised more than he could perform he replied No one ought to go away downcast from an audience with his prince Once at supper reflecting that he had done nothing for any that day he broke out into that memorable and justly admired saying My friends I have lost a day seven hundred ninety More particularly he treated the people on all occasions with so much courtesy that on his presenting them with a show of gladiators he declared He should manage it not according to his own fancy but that of the spectators and did accordingly He denied them nothing and very frankly encouraged them to ask what they pleased Espousing the cause of the Thracian party among the gladiators he frequently joined in the popular demonstrations in their favour but without compromising his dignity or doing injustice To omit no opportunity of acquiring popularity he sometimes made use himself of the baths he had erected without excluding the common people There happened in his reign some dreadful accidents an eruption of Mount Vesuvius seven hundred ninety one in Campania and a fire in Rome which continued during three days and three nights seven hundred ninety two besides a plague such as was scarcely ever known before Amidst these many great disasters he not only manifested the concern four hundred seventy two which might be expected from a prince but even the affection of a father for his people one while comforting them by his proclamations and another while relieving them to the utmost of his power He chose by lot from amongst the men of consular rank commissioners for repairing the losses in Campania The estates of those who had perished by the eruption of Vesuvius and who had left no heirs he applied to the repair of the ruined cities With regard to the public buildings destroyed by fire in the City he declared that nobody should be a loser but himself Accordingly he applied all the ornaments of his palaces to the decoration of the temples and purposes of public utility and appointed several men of the equestrian order to superintend the work For the relief of the people during the plague he employed in the way of sacrifice and medicine all means both human and divine Amongst the calamities of the times were informers and their agents a tribe of miscreants who had grown up under the licence of former reigns These he frequently ordered to be scourged or beaten with sticks in the Forum and then after he had obliged them to pass through the amphitheatre as a public spectacle commanded them to be sold for slaves or else banished them to some rocky islands And to discourage such practices for the future amongst other things he prohibited actions to be successively brought under different laws for the same cause or the state of affairs of deceased persons to be inquired into after a certain number of years IX Having declared that he accepted the office of Pontifex Maximus for the purpose of preserving his hands undefiled he faithfully adhered to his promise For after that time he was neither directly nor indirectly concerned in the death of any person though he sometimes was justly irritated He swore that he would perish himself rather than prove the destruction of any man Two men of patrician rank being convicted of aspiring to the empire he only advised them to desist saying that the sovereign power was disposed of by fate and promised them that if there was any thing else they desired of him he would grant it He also immediately sent messengers to the mother of one of them who was at a great distance and in deep anxiety about her son to assure her of his safety Nay he not only invited them to sup with four hundred seventy three him but next day at a show of gladiators purposely placed them close by him and handed to them the arms of the combatants for his inspection It is said likewise that having had their nativities cast he assured them that a great calamity was impending on both of them but from another hand and not from his Though his brother was continually plotting against him almost openly stirring up the armies to rebellion and contriving to get away yet he could not endure to put him to death or to banish him from his presence nor did he treat him with less respect than before But from his first accession to the empire he constantly declared him his partner in it and that he should be his successor begging of him sometimes in private with tears in his eyes to return the affection he had for him X Amidst all these favourable circumstances he was cut off by an untimely death more to the loss of mankind than himself At the close of the public spectacles he wept bitterly in the presence of the people and then retired into the Sabine country seven hundred ninety three rather melancholy because a victim had made its escape while he was sacrificing and loud thunder had been heard while the atmosphere was serene At the first resting place on the road he was seized with a fever and being carried forward in a litter they say that he drew back the curtains and looked up to heaven complaining heavily that his life was taken from him though he had done nothing to deserve it for there was no action of his that he had occasion to repent of but one What that was he neither disclosed himself nor is it easy for us to conjecture Some imagine that he alluded to the connection which he had formerly had with his brother s wife But Domitia solemnly denied it on oath which she would never have done had there been any truth in the report nay she would certainly have gloried in it as she was forward enough to boast of all her scandalous intrigues XI He died in the same villa where his father had died four hundred seventy four before him upon the Ides of September the thirteenth of September two years two months and twenty days after he had succeeded his father and in the one and fortieth year of his age seven hundred ninety four As soon as the news of his death was published all people mourned for him as for the loss of some near relative The senate assembled in haste before they could be summoned by proclamation and locking the doors of their house at first but afterwards opening them gave him such thanks and heaped upon him such praises now he was dead as they never had done whilst he was alive and present amongst them TITUS FLAVIUS VESPASIAN the younger was the first prince who succeeded to the empire by hereditary right and having constantly acted after his return from Judaea as colleague with his father in the administration he seemed to be as well qualified by experience as he was by abilities for conducting the affairs of the empire But with respect to his natural disposition and moral behaviour the expectations entertained by the public were not equally flattering He was immoderately addicted to luxury he had betrayed a strong inclination to cruelty and he lived in the habitual practice of lewdness no less unnatural than intemperate But with a degree of virtuous resolution unexampled in history he had no sooner taken into his hands the entire reins of government than he renounced every vicious attachment Instead of wallowing in luxury as before he became a model of temperance instead of cruelty he displayed the strongest proofs of humanity and benevolence and in the room of lewdness he exhibited a transition to the most unblemished chastity and virtue In a word so sudden and great a change was never known in the character of mortal and he had the peculiar glory to receive the appellation of the darling and delight of mankind Under a prince of such a disposition the government of the empire could not but be conducted with the strictest regard to the public welfare The reform which was begun in the late reign he prosecuted with the most ardent application and had he lived for a longer time it is probable that his authority and example would have produced the most beneficial effects upon the manners of the Romans During the reign of this emperor in the seventy ninth year of four hundred seventy five the Christian era happened the first eruption of Mount Vesuvius which has ever since been celebrated for its volcano Before this time Vesuvius is spoken of by ancient writers as being covered with orchards and vineyards and of which the middle was dry and barren The eruption was accompanied by an earthquake which destroyed several cities of Campania particularly Pompeii and Herculaneum while the lava pouring down the mountain in torrents overwhelmed in various directions the adjacent plains The burning ashes were carried not only over the neighbouring country but as far as the shores of Egypt Libya and even Syria Amongst those to whom this dreadful eruption proved fatal was Pliny the celebrated naturalist whose curiosity to examine the phenomenon led him so far within the verge of danger that he could not afterwards escape PLINY surnamed the Elder was born at Verona of a noble family He distinguished himself early by his military achievements in the German war received the dignity of an Augur at Rome and was afterwards appointed governor of Spain In every public character he acquitted himself with great reputation and enjoyed the esteem of the several emperors under whom he lived The assiduity with which he applied himself to the collection of information either curious or useful surpasses all example From an early hour in the morning until late at night he was almost constantly employed in discharging the duties of his public station in reading or hearing books read by his amanuensis and in extracting from them whatever seemed worthy of notice Even during his meals and while travelling in his carriage upon business he prosecuted with unremitting zeal and diligence his taste for enquiry and compilation No man ever displayed so strong a persuasion of the value of time or availed himself so industriously of it He considered every moment as lost which was not employed in literary pursuits The books which he wrote in consequence of this indefatigable exertion were according to the account transmitted by his nephew Pliny the younger numerous and on various subjects The catalogue of them is as follows a book on Equestrian Archery which discovered much skill in the art the Life of Q Pomponius Secundus twenty books of the Wars of Germany a complete treatise on the Education of an Orator in six volumes eight books of Doubtful Discourses written in the latter part of the reign of Nero when every kind of moral discussion was attended with danger with a hundred and sixty volumes of remarks on the writings of the various authors which he had perused For the last mentioned production only and before it was brought near to its accomplishment we are told that he four hundred seventy six was offered by Largius Licinius four hundred thousand sesterces amounting to upwards of three thousand two hundred pounds sterling an enormous sum for the copyright of a book before the invention of printing But the only surviving work of this voluminous author is his Natural History in thirty seven books compiled from the various writers who had treated of that extensive and interesting subject If we estimate this great work either by the authenticity of the information which it contains or its utility in promoting the advancement of arts and sciences we should not consider it as an object of any extraordinary encomiums but when we view it as a literary monument which displays the whole knowledge of the ancients relative to Natural History collected during a period of about seven hundred years from the time of Thales the Milesian it has a just claim to the attention of every speculative enquirer It is not surprising that the progress of the human mind which in moral science after the first dawn of enquiry was rapid both amongst the Greeks and Romans should be slow in the improvement of such branches of knowledge as depended entirely on observation and facts which were peculiarly difficult of attainment Natural knowledge can only be brought to perfection by the prosecution of enquiries in different climates and by a communication of discoveries amongst those by whom it is cultivated But neither could enquiries be prosecuted nor discoveries communicated with success while the greater part of the world was involved in barbarism while navigation was slow and limited and the art of printing unknown The consideration of these circumstances will afford sufficient apology for the imperfect state in which natural science existed amongst the ancients But we proceed to give an abstract of their extent as they appear in the compilation of Pliny This work is divided into thirty seven books the first of which contains the Preface addressed to the emperor Vespasian probably the father to whom the author pays high compliments The second book treats of the world the elements and the stars In respect to the world or rather the universe the author s opinion is the same with that of several ancient philosophers that it is a Deity uncreated infinite and eternal Their notions however as might be expected on a subject so incomprehensible are vague confused and imperfect In a subsequent chapter of the same book where the nature of the Deity is more particularly considered the author s conceptions of infinite power are so inadequate that by way of consolation for the limited powers of man he observes that there are many things even beyond the power of the Supreme Being such for instance as the annihilation of his own existence to which the author adds the power four hundred seventy seven of rendering mortals eternal and of raising the dead It deserves to be remarked that though a future state of rewards and punishments was maintained by the most eminent among the ancient philosophers the resurrection of the body was a doctrine with which they were wholly unacquainted The author next treats of the planets and the periods of their respective revolutions of the stars comets winds thunder lightning and other natural phenomena concerning all which he delivers the hypothetical notions maintained by the ancients and mentions a variety of extraordinary incidents which had occurred in different parts of the world The third book contains a general system of geography which is continued through the fourth fifth and sixth books The seventh treats of conception and the generation of the human species with a number of miscellaneous observations unconnected with the general subject The eighth treats of quadrupeds the ninth of aquatic animals the tenth of birds the eleventh of insects and reptiles the twelfth of trees the thirteenth of ointments and of trees which grow near the sea coast the fourteenth of vines the fifteenth of fruit trees the sixteenth of forest trees the seventeenth of the cultivation of trees the eighteenth of agriculture the nineteenth of the nature of lint hemp and similar productions the twentieth of the medicinal qualities of vegetables cultivated in gardens the twenty first of flowers the twenty second of the properties of herbs the twenty third of the medicines yielded by cultivated trees the twenty fourth of medicines derived from forest trees the twenty fifth of the properties of wild herbs and the origin of their use the twenty sixth of other remedies for diseases and of some new diseases the twenty seventh of different kinds of herbs the twenty eighth twenty ninth and thirtieth of medicines procured from animals the thirty first and thirty second of medicines obtained from aquatic animals with some extraordinary facts relative to the subject the thirty third of the nature of metals the thirty fourth of brass iron lead and tin the thirty fifth of pictures and observations relative to painting the thirty sixth of the nature of stones and marbles the thirty seventh of the origin of gems To the contents of each book the author subjoins a list of the writers from whom his observations have been collected Of Pliny s talents as a writer it might be deemed presumptuous to form a decided opinion from his Natural History which is avowedly a compilation from various authors and executed with greater regard to the matter of the work than to the elegance of composition Making allowance however for a degree of credulity common to the human mind in the early stage of physical four hundred seventy eight researches he is far from being deficient in the essential qualifications of a writer of Natural History His descriptions appear to be accurate his observations precise his narrative is in general perspicuous and he often illustrates his subject by a vivacity of thought as well as by a happy turn of expression It has been equally his endeavour to give novelty to stale disquisitions and authority to new observations He has both removed the rust and dispelled the obscurity which enveloped the doctrines of many ancient naturalists but with all his care and industry he has exploded fewer errors and sanctioned a greater number of doubtful opinions than was consistent with the exercise of unprejudiced and severe investigation Pliny was fifty six years of age at the time of his death the manner of which is accurately related by his nephew the elegant Pliny the Younger in a letter to Tacitus who entertained a design of writing the life of the naturalist TITUS FLAVIUS DOMITIANUS four hundred seventy nine I Domitian was born upon the ninth of the calends of November twenty fourth October seven hundred ninety five when his father was consul elect being to enter upon his office the month following in the sixth region of the city at the Pomegranate seven hundred ninety six in the house which he afterwards converted into a temple of the Flavian family He is said to have spent the time of his youth in so much want and infamy that he had not one piece of plate belonging to him and it is well known that Clodius Pollio a man of pretorian rank against whom there is a poem of Nero s extant entitled Luscio kept a note in his hand writing which he sometimes produced in which Domitian made an assignation with him for the foulest purposes Some likewise have said that he prostituted himself to Nerva who succeeded him In the war with Vitellius he fled into the Capitol with his uncle Sabinus and a part of the troops they had in the city seven hundred ninety seven But the enemy breaking in and the temple being set on fire he hid himself all night with the sacristan and next morning assuming the disguise of a worshipper of Isis and mixing with the priests of that idle superstition he got over the Tiber seven hundred ninety eight with only one attendant to the house of a woman who was the mother of one of his school fellows and lurked there so close that though the enemy who were at his heels searched very strictly after him they could not discover him At last after the success of his party appearing in public and being unanimously saluted by the title of Caesar he assumed the office of praetor of the City with consular authority but in fact had nothing but the name for the jurisdiction he transferred to his next colleague He used however his absolute four hundred eighty power so licentiously that even then he plainly discovered what sort of prince he was likely to prove Not to go into details after he had made free with the wives of many men of distinction he took Domitia Longina from her husband Aelias Lamia and married her and in one day disposed of above twenty offices in the city and the provinces upon which Vespasian said several times he wondered he did not send him a successor too II He likewise designed an expedition into Gaul and Germany seven hundred ninety nine without the least necessity for it and contrary to the advice of all his father s friends and this he did only with the view of equalling his brother in military achievements and glory But for this he was severely reprimanded and that he might the more effectually be reminded of his age and position was made to live with his father and his litter had to follow his father s and brother s carriage as often as they went abroad but he attended them in their triumph for the conquest of Judaea eight hundred mounted on a white horse Of the six consulships which he held only one was ordinary and that he obtained by the cession and interest of his brother He greatly affected a modest behaviour and above all a taste for poetry insomuch that he rehearsed his performances in public though it was an art he had formerly little cultivated and which he afterwards despised and abandoned Devoted however as he was at this time to poetical pursuits yet when Vologesus king of the Parthians desired succours against the Alani with one of Vespasian s sons to command them he laboured hard to procure for himself that appointment But the scheme proving abortive he endeavoured by presents and promises to engage other kings of the East to make a similar request After his father s death he was for some time in doubt whether he should not offer the soldiers a donative double to that of his brother and made no scruple of saying frequently that he had been left his partner in the empire but that his father s will had been fraudulently set aside From that time forward he was constantly engaged in plots against his brother both publicly and privately until falling dangerously ill he ordered all his attendants to four hundred eighty one leave him under pretence of his being dead before he really was so and at his decease paid him no other honour than that of enrolling him amongst the gods and he often both in speeches and edicts carped at his memory by sneers and insinuations III In the beginning of his reign he used to spend daily an hour by himself in private during which time he did nothing else but catch flies and stick them through the body with a sharp pin When some one therefore inquired whether any one was with the emperor it was significantly answered by Vibius Crispus Not so much as a fly Soon after his advancement his wife Domitia by whom he had a son in his second consulship and whom the year following he complimented with the title of Augusta being desperately in love with Paris the actor he put her away but within a short time afterwards being unable to bear the separation he took her again under pretence of complying with the people s importunity During some time there was in his administration a strange mixture of virtue and vice until at last his virtues themselves degenerated into vices being as we may reasonably conjecture concerning his character inclined to avarice through want and to cruelty through fear IV He frequently entertained the people with most magnificent and costly shows not only in the amphitheatre but the circus where besides the usual races with chariots drawn by two or four horses a breast he exhibited the representation of an engagement between both horse and foot and a sea fight in the amphitheatre The people were also entertained with the chase of wild beasts and the combat of gladiators even in the night time by torch light Nor did men only fight in these spectacles but women also He constantly attended at the games given by the quaestors which had been disused for some time but were revived by him and upon those occasions always gave the people the liberty of demanding two pair of gladiators out of his own school who appeared last in court uniforms Whenever he attended the shows of gladiators there stood at his feet a little boy dressed in scarlet with a prodigiously small head with whom he used to talk very much and sometimes seriously We are assured that he was four hundred eighty two overheard asking him if he knew for what reason he had in the late appointment made Metius Rufus governor of Egypt He presented the people with naval fights performed by fleets almost as numerous as those usually employed in real engagements making a vast lake near the Tiber eight hundred one and building seats round it And he witnessed them himself during a very heavy rain He likewise celebrated the Secular games eight hundred two reckoning not from the year in which they had been exhibited by Claudius but from the time of Augustus s celebration of them In these upon the day of the Circensian sports in order to have a hundred races performed he reduced each course from seven rounds to five He likewise instituted in honour of Jupiter Capitolinus a solemn contest in music to be performed every five years besides horse racing and gymnastic exercises with more prizes than are at present allowed There was also a public performance in elocution both Greek and Latin and besides the musicians who sung to the harp there were others who played concerted pieces or solos without vocal accompaniment Young girls also ran races in the Stadium at which he presided in his sandals dressed in a purple robe made after the Grecian fashion and wearing upon his head a golden crown bearing the effigies of Jupiter Juno and Minerva with the flamen of Jupiter and the college of priests sitting by his side in the same dress excepting only that their crowns had also his own image on them He celebrated also upon the Alban mount every year the festival of Minerva for whom he had appointed a college of priests out of which were chosen by lot persons to preside as governors over the college who were obliged to entertain the people with extraordinary chases of wild beasts and stage plays besides contests for prizes in oratory and poetry He thrice bestowed upon the people a largess of three hundred sesterces each man and at a public show of gladiators a very plentiful feast At the festival of the Seven Hills eight hundred three he distributed large hampers of provisions four hundred eighty three to the senatorian and equestrian orders and small baskets to the common people and encouraged them to eat by setting them the example The day after he scattered among the people a variety of cakes and other delicacies to be scrambled for and on the greater part of them falling amidst the seats of the crowd he ordered five hundred tickets to be thrown into each range of benches belonging to the senatorian and equestrian orders V He rebuilt many noble edifices which had been destroyed by fire and amongst them the Capitol which had been burnt down a second time eight hundred four but all the inscriptions were in his own name without the least mention of the original founders He likewise erected a new temple in the Capitol to Jupiter Custos and a forum which is now called Nerva s eight hundred five as also the temple of the Flavian family eight hundred six a stadium eight hundred seven an odeum eight hundred eight and a naumachia eight hundred nine out of the stone dug from which the sides of the Circus Maximus which had been burnt down were rebuilt VI He undertook several expeditions some from choice and some from necessity That against the Catti eight hundred ten was unprovoked but that against the Sarmatians was necessary an entire legion with its commander having been cut off by them He sent two expeditions against the Dacians the first upon the defeat of Oppius Sabinus a man of consular rank and four hundred eighty four the other upon that of Cornelius Fuscus prefect of the pretorian cohorts to whom he had entrusted the conduct of that war After several battles with the Catti and Daci he celebrated a double triumph But for his successes against the Sarmatians he only bore in procession the laurel crown to Jupiter Capitolinus The civil war begun by Lucius Antonius governor of Upper Germany he quelled without being obliged to be personally present at it with remarkable good fortune For at the very moment of joining battle the Rhine suddenly thawing the troops of the barbarians which were ready to join L Antonius were prevented from crossing the river Of this victory he had notice by some presages before the messengers who brought the news of it arrived For upon the very day the battle was fought a splendid eagle spread its wings round his statue at Rome making most joyful cries And shortly after a rumour became common that Antonius was slain nay many positively affirmed that they saw his head brought to the city VII He made many innovations in common practices He abolished the Sportula eight hundred eleven and revived the old practice of regular suppers To the four former parties in the Circensian games he added two new who were gold and scarlet He prohibited the players from acting in the theatre but permitted them the practice of their art in private houses He forbad the castration of males and reduced the price of the eunuchs who were still left in the hands of the dealers in slaves On the occasion of a great abundance of wine accompanied by a scarcity of corn supposing that the tillage of the ground was neglected for the sake of attending too much to the cultivation of vineyards he published a proclamation forbidding the planting of any new vines in Italy and ordering the vines in the provinces to be cut down nowhere permitting more than one half of them to remain eight hundred twelve But he did not persist in the execution of this project Some of the greatest offices he conferred upon his freedmen and soldiers He forbad two legions to be quartered in the same camp and more than a thousand sesterces to be deposited by any soldier with the standards because it was thought that Lucius Antonius had been encouraged in his late project by the large sum deposited in the military chest by the two legions which he had in the same winter quarters He made an addition to the soldiers pay of three gold pieces a year VIII In the administration of justice he was diligent and assiduous and frequently sat in the Forum out of course to cancel the judgments of the court of The One Hundred which had been procured through favour or interest He occasionally cautioned the judges of the court of recovery to beware of being too ready to admit claims for freedom brought before them He set a mark of infamy upon judges who were convicted of taking bribes as well as upon their assessors He likewise instigated the tribunes of the people to prosecute a corrupt aedile for extortion and to desire the senate to appoint judges for his trial He likewise took such effectual care in punishing magistrates of the city and governors of provinces guilty of malversation that they never were at any time more moderate or more just Most of these since his reign we have seen prosecuted for crimes of various kinds Having taken upon himself the reformation of the public manners he restrained the licence of the populace in sitting promiscuously with the knights in the theatre Scandalous libels published to defame persons of rank of either sex he suppressed and inflicted upon their authors a mark of infamy He expelled a man of quaestorian rank from the senate for practising mimicry and dancing He debarred infamous women the use of litters as also the right of receiving legacies or inheriting estates He struck out of the list of judges a Roman knight for taking again his wife whom he had divorced and prosecuted for adultery He condemned several men of the senatorian and equestrian orders upon the Scantinian law eight hundred thirteen The lewdness of the Vestal Virgins which had been overlooked by his father and brother he punished severely but in different ways viz offences committed before his reign with death and those since its commencement according to ancient custom For to the two sisters called Ocellatae he gave liberty to choose the mode of death which they preferred and banished four hundred eighty six their paramours But Cornelia the president of the Vestals who had formerly been acquitted upon a charge of incontinence being a long time after again prosecuted and condemned he ordered to be buried alive and her gallants to be whipped to death with rods in the Comitium excepting only a man of praetorian rank to whom because he confessed the fact while the case was dubious and it was not established against him though the witnesses had been put to the torture he granted the favour of banishment And to preserve pure and undefiled the reverence due to the gods he ordered the soldiers to demolish a tomb which one of his freedmen had erected for his son out of the stones designed for the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus and to sink in the sea the bones and relics buried in it IX Upon his first succeeding to power he felt such an abhorrence for the shedding of blood that before his father s arrival in Rome calling to mind the verse of Virgil Impia quam caesis gens est epulata juvencis eight hundred fourteen Ere impious man restrain d from blood in vain Began to feast on flesh of bullocks slain he designed to have published a proclamation to forbid the sacrifice of oxen Before his accession to the imperial authority and during some time afterwards he scarcely ever gave the least grounds for being suspected of covetousness or avarice but on the contrary he often afforded proofs not only of his justice but his liberality To all about him he was generous even to profusion and recommended nothing more earnestly to them than to avoid doing anything mean He would not accept the property left him by those who had children He also set aside a legacy bequeathed by the will of Ruscus Caepio who had ordered his heir to make a present yearly to each of the senators upon their first assembling He exonerated all those who had been under prosecution from the treasury for above five years before and would not suffer suits to be renewed unless it was done within a year and on condition that the prosecutor should be banished if he could not make good his cause The secretaries of the quaestors having engaged in trade according to custom but contrary to four hundred eighty seven the Clodian law eight hundred fifteen he pardoned them for what was past Such portions of land as had been left when it was divided amongst the veteran soldiers he granted to the ancient possessors as belonging to then by prescription He put a stop to false prosecutions in the exchequer by severely punishing the prosecutors and this saying of his was much taken notice of that a prince who does not punish informers encourages them X But he did not long persevere in this course of clemency and justice although he sooner fell into cruelty than into avarice He put to death a scholar of Paris the pantomimic eight hundred sixteen though a minor and then sick only because both in person and the practice of his art he resembled his master as he did likewise Hermogenes of Tarsus for some oblique reflections in his History crucifying besides the scribes who had copied the work One who was master of a band of gladiators happening to say that a Thrax was a match for a Marmillo eight hundred seventeen but not so for the exhibitor of the games he ordered him to be dragged from the benches into the arena and exposed to the dogs with this label upon him A Parmularian eight hundred eighteen guilty of talking impiously He put to death many senators and amongst them several men of consular rank In this number were Civica Cerealis when he was proconsul in Africa Salvidienus Orfitus and Acilius Glabrio in exile under the pretence of their planning to revolt against him The rest he punished upon very trivial occasions as Aelius Lamia for some jocular expressions which were of old date and perfectly harmless because upon his commending his voice after he had taken his wife from him eight hundred nineteen he replied Alas I hold my tongue And when Titus advised him to take another wife he answered him thus What have you a mind to marry Salvius Cocceianus was condemned to death for keeping the birth day of his uncle Otho the emperor Metius Pomposianus because he was commonly reported to have an imperial nativity eight hundred twenty and to carry about with four hundred eighty eight him a map of the world upon vellum with the speeches of kings and generals extracted out of Titus Livius and for giving his slaves the names of Mago and Hannibal Sallustius Lucullus lieutenant in Britain for suffering some lances of a new invention to be called Lucullean and Junius Rusticus for publishing a treatise in praise of Paetus Thrasea and Helvidius Priscus and calling them both most upright men Upon this occasion he likewise banished all the philosophers from the city and Italy He put to death the younger Helvidius for writing a farce in which under the character of Paris and Oenone he reflected upon his having divorced his wife and also Flavius Sabinus one of his cousins because upon his being chosen at the consular election to that office the public crier had by a blunder proclaimed him to the people not consul but emperor Becoming still more savage after his success in the civil war he employed the utmost industry to discover those of the adverse party who absconded many of them he racked with a new invented torture inserting fire through their private parts and from some he cut off their hands It is certain that only two of any note were pardoned a tribune who wore the narrow stripe and a centurion who to clear themselves from the charge of being concerned in any rebellious project proved themselves to have been guilty of prostitution and consequently incapable of exercising any influence either over the general or the soldiers XI His cruelties were not only excessive but subtle and unexpected The day before he crucified a collector of his rents he sent for him into his bed chamber made him sit down upon the bed by him and sent him away well pleased and so far as could be inferred from his treatment in a state of perfect security having vouchsafed him the favour of a plate of meat from his own table When he was on the point of condemning to death Aretinus Clemens a man of consular rank and one of his friends and emissaries he retained him about his person in the same or greater favour than ever until at last as they were riding together in the same litter upon seeing the man who had informed against him he said Are you willing that we should hear this base slave tomorrow Contemptuously abusing the patience of men he never pronounced a severe sentence without prefacing it four hundred eighty nine with words which gave hopes of mercy so that at last there was not a more certain token of a fatal conclusion than a mild commencement He brought before the senate some persona accused of treason declaring that he should prove that day how dear he was to the senate and so influenced them that they condemned the accused to be punished according to the ancient usage eight hundred twenty one Then as if alarmed at the extreme severity of their punishment to lessen the odiousness of the proceeding he interposed in these words for it is not foreign to the purpose to give them precisely as they were delivered Permit me Conscript Fathers so far to prevail upon your affection for me however extraordinary the request may seem as to grant the condemned criminals the favour of dying in the manner they choose For by so doing ye will spare your own eyes and the world will understand that I interceded with the senate on their behalf XII Having exhausted the exchequer by the expense of his buildings and public spectacles with the augmentation of pay lately granted to the troops he made an attempt at the reduction of the army in order to lessen the military charges But reflecting that he should by this measure expose himself to the insults of the barbarians while it would not suffice to extricate him from his embarrassments he had recourse to plundering his subjects by every mode of exaction The estates of the living and the dead were sequestered upon any accusation by whomsoever preferred The unsupported allegation of any one person relative to a word or action construed to affect the dignity of the emperor was sufficient Inheritances to which he had not the slightest pretension were confiscated if there was found so much as one person to say he had heard from the deceased when living that he had made the emperor his heir Besides the exactions from others the poll tax on the Jews was levied with extreme rigour both on those who lived after the manner of Jews in the city without publicly professing themselves to be such eight hundred twenty two and on those who by four hundred ninety concealing their origin avoided paying the tribute imposed upon that people I remember when I was a youth to have been present eight hundred twenty three when an old man ninety years of age had his person exposed to view in a very crowded court in order that on inspection the procurator might satisfy himself whether he was circumcised eight hundred twenty four From his earliest years Domitian was any thing but courteous of a forward assuming disposition and extravagant both in his words and actions When Caenis his father s concubine upon her return from Istria offered him a kiss as she had been used to do he presented her his hand to kiss Being indignant that his brother s son in law should be waited on by servants dressed in white eight hundred twenty five he exclaimed ouk agathon polykoiraniae eight hundred twenty six Too many princes are not good XIII After he became emperor he had the assurance to boast in the senate that he had bestowed the empire on his father and brother and they had restored it to him And upon taking his wife again after the divorce he declared by proclamation that he had recalled her to his pulvinar eight hundred twenty seven He was not a little pleased too at hearing the acclamations of the people in the amphitheatre on a day of festival All happiness to our lord and lady But when during the celebration of the Capitoline trial of skill the whole concourse of people entreated him with one voice to restore Palfurius Sura to his place in the senate from which he had been long before expelled he having then carried away the prize of eloquence from all the orators who had contended for it he did not vouchsafe to give them any answer but only commanded silence to be proclaimed by the voice of the crier With equal arrogance when he dictated the form of a letter to be used by his procurators he began it thus Our lord and god commands so and so whence it became a rule that no one should four hundred ninety one style him otherwise either in writing or speaking He suffered no statues to be erected for him in the Capitol unless they were of gold and silver and of a certain weight He erected so many magnificent gates and arches surmounted by representations of chariots drawn by four horses and other triumphal ornaments in different quarters of the city that a wag inscribed on one of the arches the Greek word Axkei It is enough eight hundred twenty eight He filled the office of consul seventeen times which no one had ever done before him and for the seven middle occasions in successive years but in scarcely any of them had he more than the title for he never continued in office beyond the calends of May the first May and for the most part only till the ides of January thirteenth January After his two triumphs when he assumed the cognomen of Germanicus he called the months of September and October Germanicus and Domitian after his own names because he commenced his reign in the one and was born in the other XIV Becoming by these means universally feared and odious he was at last taken off by a conspiracy of his friends and favourite freedmen in concert with his wife eight hundred twenty nine He had long entertained a suspicion of the year and day when he should die and even of the very hour and manner of his death all which he had learned from the Chaldaeans when he was a very young man His father once at supper laughed at him for refusing to eat some mushrooms saying that if he knew his fate he would rather be afraid of the sword Being therefore in perpetual apprehension and anxiety he was keenly alive to the slightest suspicions insomuch that he is thought to have withdrawn the edict ordering the destruction of the vines chiefly because the copies of it which were dispersed had the following lines written upon them Kaen me phagaes epi rizanomos epi kartophoraeso Osson epispeisai Kaisari thuomeno eight hundred thirty Gnaw thou my root yet shall my juice suffice To pour on Caesar s head in sacrifice four hundred ninety two It was from the same principle of fear that he refused a new honour devised and offered him by the senate though he was greedy of all such compliments It was this that as often as he held the consulship Roman knights chosen by lot should walk before him clad in the Trabea with lances in their hands amongst his lictors and apparitors As the time of the danger which he apprehended drew near he became daily more and more disturbed in mind insomuch that he lined the walls of the porticos in which he used to walk with the stone called Phengites eight hundred thirty one by the reflection of which he could see every object behind him He seldom gave an audience to persons in custody unless in private being alone and he himself holding their chains in his hand To convince his domestics that the life of a master was not to be attempted upon any pretext however plausible he condemned to death Epaphroditus his secretary because it was believed that he had assisted Nero in his extremity to kill himself XV His last victim was Flavius Clemens eight hundred thirty two his cousin german a man below contempt for his want of energy whose sons then of very tender age he had avowedly destined for his successors and discarding their former names had ordered one to be called Vespasian and the other Domitian Nevertheless he suddenly put him to death upon some very slight suspicion eight hundred thirty three almost before he was well out of his consulship By this violent act he very much hastened his own destruction During eight months together there was so much lightning at Rome and such accounts of the phaenomenon were brought from other parts that at last he cried out Let him now strike whom he will The Capitol was struck by lightning as well as the temple of the Flavian family with the Palatine house and his own bed chamber The tablet also inscribed upon the base of his triumphal statue was carried away by the violence of the storm and fell upon a neighbouring four hundred ninety three monument The tree which just before the advancement of Vespasian had been prostrated and rose again eight hundred thirty four suddenly fell to the ground The goddess Fortune of Praeneste to whom it was his custom on new year s day to commend the empire for the ensuing year and who had always given him a favourable reply at last returned him a melancholy answer not without mention of blood He dreamt that Minerva whom he worshipped even to a superstitious excess was withdrawing from her sanctuary declaring she could protect him no longer because she was disarmed by Jupiter Nothing however so much affected him as an answer given by Ascletario the astrologer and his subsequent fate This person had been informed against and did not deny his having predicted some future events of which from the principles of his art he confessed he had a foreknowledge Domitian asked him what end he thought he should come to himself To which replying I shall in a short time be torn to pieces by dogs he ordered him immediately to be slain and in order to demonstrate the vanity of his art to be carefully buried But during the preparations for executing this order it happened that the funeral pile was blown down by a sudden storm and the body half burnt was torn to pieces by dogs which being observed by Latinus the comic actor as he chanced to pass that way he told it amongst the other news of the day to the emperor at supper XVI The day before his death he ordered some dates eight hundred thirty five served up at table to be kept till the next day adding If I have the luck to use them And turning to those who were nearest him he said To morrow the moon in Aquarius will be bloody instead of watery and an event will happen which will be much talked of all the world over About midnight he was so terrified that he leaped out of bed That morning he tried and passed sentence on a soothsayer sent from Germany who being consulted about the lightning that had lately four hundred ninety four happened predicted from it a change of government The blood running down his face as he scratched an ulcerous tumour on his forehead he said Would this were all that is to befall me Then upon his asking the time of the day instead of five o clock which was the hour he dreaded they purposely told him it was six Overjoyed at this information as if all danger were now passed and hastening to the bath Parthenius his chamberlain stopped him by saying that there was a person come to wait upon him about a matter of great importance which would admit of no delay Upon this ordering all persons to withdraw he retired into his chamber and was there slain XVII Concerning the contrivance and mode of his death the common account is this The conspirators being in some doubt when and where they should attack him whether while he was in the bath or at supper Stephanus a steward of Domitilla s eight hundred thirty six then under prosecution for defrauding his mistress offered them his advice and assistance and wrapping up his left arm as if it was hurt in wool and bandages for some days to prevent suspicion at the hour appointed he secreted a dagger in them Pretending then to make a discovery of a conspiracy and being for that reason admitted he presented to the emperor a memorial and while he was reading it in great astonishment stabbed him in the groin But Domitian though wounded making resistance Clodianus one of his guards Maximus a freedman of Parthenius s Saturius his principal chamberlain with some gladiators fell upon him and stabbed him in seven places A boy who had the charge of the Lares in his bed chamber and was then in attendance as usual gave these further particulars that he was ordered by Domitian upon receiving his first wound to reach him a dagger which lay under his pillow and call in his domestics but that he found nothing at the head of the bed excepting the hilt of a four hundred ninety five poniard and that all the doors were fastened that the emperor in the mean time got hold of Stephanus and throwing him upon the ground struggled a long time with him one while endeavouring to wrench the dagger from him another while though his fingers were miserably mangled to tear out his eyes He was slain upon the fourteenth of the calends of October eighteenth Sept in the forty fifth year of his age and the fifteenth of his reign eight hundred thirty seven His corpse was carried out upon a common bier by the public bearers and buried by his nurse Phyllis at his suburban villa on the Latin Way But she afterwards privately conveyed his remains to the temple of the Flavian family eight hundred thirty eight and mingled them with the ashes of Julia the daughter of Titus whom she had also nursed XVIII He was tall in stature his face modest and very ruddy he had large eyes but was dim sighted naturally graceful in his person particularly in his youth excepting only that his toes were bent somewhat inward he was at last disfigured by baldness corpulence and the slenderness of his legs which were reduced by a long illness He was so sensible how much the modesty of his countenance recommended him that he once made this boast to the senate Thus far you have approved both of my disposition and my countenance His baldness so much annoyed him that he considered it an affront to himself if any other person was reproached with it either in jest or in earnest though in a small tract he published addressed to a friend concerning the preservation of the hair he uses for their mutual consolation the words following Ouch oraas oios kago kalos te megas te Seest thou my graceful mien my stately form and yet the fate of my hair awaits me however I bear with fortitude this loss of my hair while I am still young Remember that nothing is more fascinating than beauty but nothing of shorter duration XIX He so shrunk from undergoing fatigue that he scarcely ever walked through the city on foot In his four hundred ninety six expeditions and on a march he seldom rode on horse back but was generally carried in a litter He had no inclination for the exercise of arms but was very expert in the use of the bow Many persons have seen him often kill a hundred wild animals of various kinds at his Alban retreat and fix his arrows in their heads with such dexterity that he could in two shots plant them like a pair of horns in each He would sometimes direct his arrows against the hand of a boy standing at a distance and expanded as a mark with such precision that they all passed between the boy s fingers without hurting him XX In the beginning of his reign he gave up the study of the liberal sciences though he took care to restore at a vast expense the libraries which had been burnt down collecting manuscripts from all parts and sending scribes to Alexandria eight hundred thirty nine either to copy or correct them Yet he never gave himself the trouble of reading history or poetry or of employing his pen even for his private purposes He perused nothing but the Commentaries and Acts of Tiberius Caesar His letters speeches and edicts were all drawn up for him by others though he could converse with elegance and sometimes expressed himself in memorable sentiments I could wish said he once that I was but as handsome as Metius fancies himself to be And of the head of some one whose hair was partly reddish and partly grey he said that it was snow sprinkled with mead XXI The lot of princes he remarked was very miserable for no one believed them when they discovered a conspiracy until they were murdered When he had leisure he amused himself with dice even on days that were not festivals and in the morning He went to the bath early and made a plentiful dinner insomuch that he seldom ate more at supper than a Matian apple eight hundred forty to which he added a four hundred ninety seven draught of wine out of a small flask He gave frequent and splendid entertainments but they were soon over for he never prolonged them after sun set and indulged in no revel after For till bed time he did nothing else but walk by himself in private XXII He was insatiable in his lusts calling frequent commerce with women as if it was a sort of exercise klinopalaen bed wrestling and it was reported that he plucked the hair from his concubines and swam about in company with the lowest prostitutes His brother s daughter eight hundred forty one was offered him in marriage when she was a virgin but being at that time enamoured of Domitia he obstinately refused her Yet not long afterwards when she was given to another he was ready enough to debauch her and that even while Titus was living But after she had lost both her father and her husband he loved her most passionately and without disguise insomuch that he was the occasion of her death by obliging her to procure a miscarriage when she was with child by him XXIII The people shewed little concern at his death but the soldiers were roused by it to great indignation and immediately endeavoured to have him ranked among the gods They were also ready to revenge his loss if there had been any to take the lead However they soon after effected it by resolutely demanding the punishment of all those who had been concerned in his assassination On the other hand the senate was so overjoyed that they met in all haste and in a full assembly reviled his memory in the most bitter terms ordering ladders to be brought in and his shields and images to be pulled down before their eyes and dashed in pieces upon the floor of the senate house passing at the same time a decree to obliterate his titles every where and abolish all memory of him A few months before he was slain a raven on the Capitol uttered these words All will be well Some person gave the following interpretation of this prodigy four hundred ninety eight Nuper Tarpeio quae sedit culmine cornix Est bene non potuit dicere dixit Erit Late croaked a raven from Tarpeia s height All is not yet but shall be right They say likewise that Domitian dreamed that a golden hump grew out of the back of his neck which he considered as a certain sign of happy days for the empire after him Such an auspicious change indeed shortly afterwards took place through the justice and moderation of the succeeding emperors If we view Domitian in the different lights in which he is represented during his lifetime and after his decease his character and conduct discover a greater diversity than is commonly observed in the objects of historical detail But as posthumous character is always the most just its decisive verdict affords the surest criterion by which this variegated emperor must be estimated by impartial posterity According to this rule it is beyond a doubt that his vices were more predominant than his virtues and when we follow him into his closet for some time after his accession when he was thirty years of age the frivolity of his daily employment in the killing of flies exhibits an instance of dissipation which surpasses all that has been recorded of his imperial predecessors The encouragement however which the first Vespasian had shown to literature continued to operate during the present reign and we behold the first fruits of its auspicious influence in the valuable treatise of QUINTILIAN Of the life of this celebrated writer little is known upon any authority that has a title to much credit We learn however that he was the son of a lawyer in the service of some of the preceding emperors and was born in Rome though in what consulship or under what emperor it is impossible to determine He married a woman of a noble family by whom he had two sons The mother died in the flower of her age and the sons at the distance of some time from each other when their father was advanced in years The precise time of Quintilian s own death is equally inauthenticated with that of his birth nor can we rely upon an author of suspicious veracity who says that he passed the latter part of his life in a state of indigence which was alleviated by the liberality of his pupil Pliny the Younger Quintilian opened a school of rhetoric at Rome where he not only discharged that labourious employment with great applause four hundred ninety nine during more than twenty years but pleaded at the bar and was the first who obtained a salary from the state for executing the office of a public teacher He was also appointed by Domitian preceptor to the two young princes who were intended to succeed him on the throne After his retirement from the situation of a teacher Quintilian devoted his attention to the study of literature and composed a treatise on the Causes of the Corruption of Eloquence At the earnest solicitation of his friends he was afterwards induced to undertake his Institutiones Oratoriae the most elaborate system of oratory extant in any language This work is divided into twelve books in which the author treats with great precision of the qualities of a perfect orator explaining not only the fundamental principles of eloquence as connected with the constitution of the human mind but pointing out both by argument and observation the most successful method of exercising that admirable art for the accomplishment of its purpose So minutely and upon so extensive a plan has he prosecuted the subject that he delineates the education suitable to a perfect orator from the stage of infancy in the cradle to the consummation of rhetorical fame in the pursuits of the bar or those in general of any public assembly It is sufficient to say that in the execution of this elaborate work Quintilian has called to the assistance of his own acute and comprehensive understanding the profound penetration of Aristotle the exquisite graces of Cicero all the stores of observation experience and practice and in a word the whole accumulated exertions of ancient genius on the subject of oratory It may justly be regarded as an extraordinary circumstance in the progress of scientific improvement that the endowments of a perfect orator were never fully exhibited to the world until it had become dangerous to exercise them for the important purposes for which they were originally cultivated And it is no less remarkable that under all the violence and caprice of imperial despotism which the Romans had now experienced their sensibility to the enjoyment of poetical compositions remained still unabated as if it served to console the nation for the irretrievable loss of public liberty From this source of entertainment they reaped more pleasure during the present reign than they had done since the time of Augustus The poets of this period were Juvenal Statius and Martial JUVENAL was born at Aquinum but in what year is uncertain though from some circumstances it seems to have been in the reign of Augustus Some say that he was the son of a freedman five hundred while others without specifying the condition of his father relate only that he was brought up by a freedman He came at an early age to Rome where he declaimed for many years and pleaded causes in the forum with great applause but at last he betook himself to the writing of satires in which he acquired great fame One of the first and the most constant object of is satire was the pantomime Paris the great favourite of the emperor Nero and afterwards of Domitian During the reign of the former of these emperors no resentment was shown towards the poet but he experienced not the same impunity after the accession of the latter when to remove him from the capital he was sent as governor to the frontiers of Egypt but in reality into an honourable exile According to some authors he died of chagrin in that province but this is not authenticated and seems to be a mistake for in some of Martial s epigrams which appear to have been written after the death of Domitian Juvenal is spoken of as residing at Rome It is said that he lived to upwards of eighty years of age The remaining compositions of this author are sixteen satires all written against the dissipation and enormous vices which prevailed at Rome in his time The various objects of animadversion are painted in the strongest colours and placed in the most conspicuous points of view Giving loose reins to just and moral indignation Juvenal is every where animated vehement petulant and incessantly acrimonious Disdaining the more lenient modes of correction or despairing of their success he neither adopts the raillery of Horace nor the derision of Persius but prosecutes vice and folly with all the severity of sentiment passion and expression He sometimes exhibits a mixture of humour with his invectives but it is a humour which partakes more of virulent rage than of pleasantry broad hostile but coarse and rivalling in indelicacy the profligate manners which it assails The satires of Juvenal abound in philosophical apophthegms and where they are not sullied by obscene description are supported with a uniform air of virtuous elevation Amidst all the intemperance of sarcasm his numbers are harmonious Had his zeal permitted him to direct the current of his impetuous genius into the channel of ridicule and endeavour to put to shame the vices and follies of those licentious times as much as he perhaps exasperated conviction rather than excited contrition he would have carried satire to the highest possible pitch both of literary excellence and moral utility With every abatement of attainable perfection we hesitate not to place him at the head of this arduous department of poetry Of STATIUS no farther particulars are preserved than that he five hundred one was born at Naples that his father s name was Statius of Epirus and his mother s Agelina and that he died about the end of the first century of the Christian era Some have conjectured that he maintained himself by writing for the stage but of this there is no sufficient evidence and if ever he composed dramatic productions they have perished The works of Statius now extant are two poems viz the Thebais and the Achilleis besides a collection named Silvae The Thebais consists of twelve books and the subject of it is the Theban war which happened twelve thirty six years before the Christian era in consequence of a dispute between Eteocles and Polynices the sons of Oedipus and Jocasta These brothers had entered into an agreement with each other to reign alternately for a year at a time and Eteocles being the elder got first possession of the throne This prince refusing to abdicate at the expiration of the year Polynices fled to Argos where marrying Argia the daughter of Adrastus king of that country he procured the assistance of his father in law to enforce the engagement stipulated with his brother Eteocles The Argives marched under the command of seven able generals who were to attack separately the seven gates of Thebes After much blood had been spilt without any effect it was at last agreed between the two parties that the brothers should determine the dispute by single combat In the desperate engagement which ensued they both fell and being burnt together upon the funeral pile it is said that their ashes separated as if actuated by the implacable resentment which they had borne to each other If we except the Aeneid this is the only Latin production extant which is epic in its form and it likewise approaches nearest in merit to that celebrated poem which Statius appears to have been ambitious of emulating In unity and greatness of action the Thebais corresponds to the laws of the Epopea but the fable may be regarded as defective in some particulars which however arise more from the nature of the subject than from any fault of the poet The distinction of the hero is not sufficiently prominent and the poem possesses not those circumstances which are requisite towards interesting the reader s affections in the issue of the contest To this it may be added that the unnatural complexion of the incestuous progeny diffuses a kind of gloom which obscures the splendour of thought and restrains the sympathetic indulgence of fancy to some of the boldest excursions of the poet For grandeur however and animation of sentiment and description as well as for harmony of numbers the Thebais is eminently conspicuous and deserves to be held in a much higher degree of estimation than it has five hundred two generally obtained In the contrivance of some of the episodes and frequently in the modes of expression Statius keeps an attentive eye to the style of Virgil It is said that he was twelve years employed in the composition of this poem and we have his own authority for affirming that he polished it with all the care and assiduity practised by the poets in the Augustan age Quippe te fido monitore nostra Thebais multa cruciata lima Tentat audaci fide Mantuanae Gaudia famae Silvae lib iv seven For taught by you with steadfast care I trim my Song of Thebes and dare With generous rivalry to share The glories of the Mantuan bard The Achilleis relates to the same hero who is celebrated by Homer in the Iliad but it is the previous history of Achilles not his conduct in the Trojan war which forms the subject of the poem of Statius While the young hero is under the care of the Centaur Chiron Thetis makes a visit to the preceptor s sequestered habitation where to save her son from the fate which it was predicted would befall him at Troy if he should go to the siege of that place she orders him to be dressed in the disguise of a girl and sent to live in the family of Lycomedes king of Scyros But as Troy could not be taken without the aid of Achilles Ulysses accompanied by Diomede is deputed by the Greeks to go to Scyros and bring him thence to the Grecian camp The artifice by which the sagacious ambassador detected Achilles amongst his female companions was by placing before them various articles of merchandise amongst which was some armour Achilles no sooner perceived the latter than he eagerly seized a sword and shield and manifesting the strongest emotions of heroic enthusiasm discovered his sex After an affectionate parting with Lycomedes daughter Deidamia whom he left pregnant of a son he set sail with the Grecian chiefs and during the voyage gives them an account of the manner of his education with Chiron This poem consists of two books in heroic measure and is written with taste and fancy Commentators are of opinion that the Achilleis was left incomplete by the death of the author but this is extremely improbable from various circumstances and appears to be founded only upon the word Hactenus in the conclusion of the poem five hundred three Hactenus annorum comites elementa meorum Et memini et meminisse juvat scit caetera mater Thus far companions dear with mindful joy I ve told My youthful deeds the rest my mother can unfold That any consequential reference was intended by hactenus seems to me plainly contradicted by the words which immediately follow scit caetera mater Statius could not propose the giving any further account of Achilles s life because a general narrative of it had been given in the first book The voyage from Scyros to the Trojan coast conducted with the celerity which suited the purpose of the poet admitted of no incidents which required description or recital and after the voyagers had reached the Grecian camp it is reasonable to suppose that the action of the Iliad immediately commenced But that Statius had no design of extending the plan of the Achilleis beyond this period is expressly declared in the exordium of the poem Magnanimum Aeaciden formidatamque Tonanti Progeniem et patrio vetitam succedere coelo Diva refer quanquam acta viri multum inclyta cantu Maeonio sed plura vacant Nos ire per omnem Sic amor est heroa velis Scyroque latentem Dulichia proferre tuba nec in Hectore tracto Sistere sed tota juvenem deducere Troja Aid me O goddess while I sing of him Who shook the Thunderer s throne and for his crime Was doomed to lose his birthright in the skies The great Aeacides Maeonian strains Have made his mighty deeds their glorious theme Still much remains be mine the pleasing task To trace the future hero s young career Not dragging Hector at his chariot wheels But while disguised in Scyros yet he lurked Till trumpet stirred he sprung to manly arms And sage Ulysses led him to the Trojan coast The Silvae is a collection of poems almost entirely in heroic verse divided into five books and for the most part written extempore Statius himself affirms in his Dedication to Stella that the production of none of them employed him more than two days yet many of them consist of between one hundred and two hundred hexameter lines We meet with one of two hundred and sixteen lines one of two hundred and thirty four one of two hundred and sixty two and one of two hundred and seventy seven a rapidity of composition approaching to what Horace mentions of the poet Lucilius It is no small encomium to observe that considered as extemporaneous productions five hundred four the meanest in the collection is far from meriting censure either in point of sentiment or expression and many of them contain passages which command our applause The poet MARTIAL surnamed likewise Coquus was born at Bilbilis in Spain of obscure parents At the age of twenty one he came to Rome where he lived during five and thirty years under the emperors Galba Otho Vitellius the two Vespasians Domitian Nerva and the beginning of the reign of Trajan He was the panegyrist of several of those emperors by whom he was liberally rewarded raised to the Equestrian order and promoted by Domitian to the tribuneship but being treated with coldness and neglect by Trajan he returned to his native country and a few years after ended his days at the age of seventy five He had lived at Rome in great splendour and affluence as well as in high esteem for his poetical talents but upon his return to Bilbilis it is said that he experienced a great reverse of fortune and was chiefly indebted for his support to the gratuitous benefactions of Pliny the Younger whom he had extolled in some epigrams The poems of Martial consist of fourteen books all written in the epigrammatic form to which species of composition introduced by the Greeks he had a peculiar propensity Amidst such a multitude of verses on a variety of subjects often composed extempore and many of them probably in the moments of fashionable dissipation it is not surprising that we find a large number unworthy the genius of the author Delicacy and even decency is often violated in the productions of Martial Grasping at every thought which afforded even the shadow of ingenuity he gave unlimited scope to the exercise of an active and fruitful imagination In respect to composition he is likewise liable to censure At one time he wearies and at another tantalises the reader with the prolixity or ambiguity of his preambles His prelusive sentiments are sometimes far fetched and converge not with a natural declination into the focus of epigram In dispensing praise and censure he often seems to be governed more by prejudice or policy than by justice and truth and he is more constantly attentive to the production of wit than to the improvement of morality But while we remark the blemishes and imperfections of this poet we must acknowledge his extraordinary merits In composition he is in general elegant and correct and where the subject is capable of connection with sentiment his inventive ingenuity never fails to extract from it the essence of delight and surprise His fancy is prolific of beautiful images and his five hundred five judgment expert in arranging them to the greatest advantage He bestows panegyric with inimitable grace and satirises with equal dexterity In a fund of Attic salt he surpasses every other writer and though he seems to have at command all the varied stores of gall he is not destitute of candour With almost every kind of versification he appears to be familiar and notwithstanding a facility of temper too accommodating perhaps on many occasions to the licentiousness of the times we may venture from strong indications to pronounce that as a moralist his principles were virtuous It is observed of this author by Pliny the Younger that though his compositions might perhaps not obtain immortality he wrote as if they would Aeterna quae scripsit non erunt fortasse ille tamen scripsit tanquam futura The character which Martial gives of his epigrams is just and comprehensive Sunt bona sunt quaedam mediocria sunt mala plura Quae legis hic aliter non fit Avite liber Some are good some indifferent and some again still worse Such Avitus you will find is a common case with verse THE END OF THE TWELVE CAESARS LIVES OF EMINENT GRAMMARIANS five hundred six I The science of grammar eight hundred forty two was in ancient times far from being in vogue at Rome indeed it was of little use in a rude state of society when the people were engaged in constant wars and had not much time to bestow on the cultivation of the liberal arts eight hundred forty three At the outset its pretensions were very slender for the earliest men of learning who were both poets and orators may be considered as half Greek I speak of Livius eight hundred forty four and Ennius eight hundred forty five who are acknowledged to have taught both languages as well at Rome as in foreign parts eight hundred forty six But they five hundred seven only translated from the Greek and if they composed anything of their own in Latin it was only from what they had before read For although there are those who say that this Ennius published two books one on Letters and Syllables and the other on Metres Lucius Cotta has satisfactorily proved that they are not the works of the poet Ennius but of another writer of the same name to whom also the treatise on the Rules of Augury is attributed II Crates of Mallos eight hundred forty seven then was in our opinion the first who introduced the study of grammar at Rome He was cotemporary with Aristarchus eight hundred forty eight and having been sent by king Attalus as envoy to the senate in the interval between the second and third Punic wars eight hundred forty nine soon after the death of Ennius eight hundred fifty he had the misfortune to fall into an open sewer in the Palatine quarter of the city and broke his leg After which during the whole period of his embassy and convalescence he gave frequent lectures taking much pains to instruct his hearers and he has left us an example well worthy of imitation It was so far followed that poems hitherto little known the works either of deceased friends or other approved writers were brought to light and being read and commented on were explained to others Thus Caius Octavius Lampadio edited the Punic War of Naevius eight hundred fifty one which having been written in one volume without any break in the manuscript he divided into seven books After that Quintus Vargonteius undertook the Annals of Ennius which he read on certain fixed days to crowded audiences So Laelius Archelaus and Vectius Philocomus read and commented on the Satires of their friend Lucilius eight hundred fifty two which Lenaeus Pompeius a freedman tells us he studied under Archelaus and Valerius Cato under Philocomus Two others also taught and promoted five hundred eight grammar in various branches namely Lucius Aelius Lanuvinus the son in law of Quintus Aelius and Servius Claudius both of whom were Roman knights and men who rendered great services both to learning and the republic III Lucius Aelius had a double cognomen for he was called Praeconius because his father was a herald Stilo because he was in the habit of composing orations for most of the speakers of highest rank indeed he was so strong a partisan of the nobles that he accompanied Quintus Metellus Numidicus eight hundred fifty three in his exile Servius eight hundred fifty four having clandestinely obtained his father in law s book before it was published was disowned for the fraud which he took so much to heart that overwhelmed with shame and distress he retired from Rome and being seized with a fit of the gout in his impatience he applied a poisonous ointment to his feet which half killed him so that his lower limbs mortified while he was still alive After this more attention was paid to the science of letters and it grew in public estimation insomuch that men of the highest rank did not hesitate in undertaking to write something on the subject and it is related that sometimes there were no less than twenty celebrated scholars in Rome So high was the value and so great were the rewards of grammarians that Lutatius Daphnides jocularly called Pan s herd eight hundred fifty five by Lenaeus Melissus was purchased by Quintus Catullus for two hundred thousand sesterces and shortly afterwards made a freedman and that Lucius Apuleius who was taken into the pay of Epicius Calvinus a wealthy Roman knight at the annual salary of ten thousand crowns had many scholars Grammar also penetrated into the provinces and some of the most eminent amongst the learned taught it in foreign parts particularly in Gallia Togata In the number of these we may reckon Octavius five hundred nine Teucer Siscennius Jacchus and Oppius Cares eight hundred fifty six who persisted in teaching to a most advanced period of his life at a time when he was not only unable to walk but his sight failed IV The appellation of grammarian was borrowed from the Greeks but at first the Latins called such persons literati Cornelius Nepos also in his book where he draws a distinction between a literate and a philologist says that in common phrase those are properly called literati who are skilled in speaking or writing with care or accuracy and those more especially deserve the name who translated the poets and were called grammarians by the Greeks It appears that they were named literators by Messala Corvinus in one of his letters when he says that it does not refer to Furius Bibaculus nor even to Sigida nor to Cato the literator eight hundred fifty seven meaning doubtless that Valerius Cato was both a poet and an eminent grammarian Some there are who draw a distinction between a literati and a literator as the Greeks do between a grammarian and a grammatist applying the former term to men of real erudition the latter to those whose pretensions to learning are moderate and this opinion Orbilius supports by examples For he says that in old times when a company of slaves was offered for sale by any person it was not customary without good reason to describe either of them in the catalogue as a literati but only as a literator meaning that he was not a proficient in letters but had a smattering of knowledge The early grammarians taught rhetoric also and we have many of their treatises which include both sciences whence it arose I think that in later times although the two professions had then become distinct the old custom was retained or the grammarians introduced into their teaching some of the elements required for public speaking such as the problem the periphrasis the choice of words description of character and the like in order that they might not transfer five hundred ten their pupils to the rhetoricians no better than ill taught boys But I perceive that these lessons are now given up in some cases on account of the want of application or the tender years of the scholar for I do not believe that it arises from any dislike in the master I recollect that when I was a boy it was the custom of one of these whose name was Princeps to take alternate days for declaiming and disputing and sometimes he would lecture in the morning and declaim in the afternoon when he had his pulpit removed I heard also that even within the memories of our own fathers some of the pupils of the grammarians passed directly from the schools to the courts and at once took a high place in the ranks of the most distinguished advocates The professors at that time were indeed men of great eminence of some of whom I may be able to give an account in the following chapters V SAEVIUS eight hundred fifty eight NICANOR first acquired fame and reputation by his teaching and besides he made commentaries the greater part of which however are said to have been borrowed He also wrote a satire in which he informs us that he was a freedman and had a double cognomen in the following verses Saevius Nicanor Marci libertus negabit Saevius Posthumius idem sed Marcus docebit What Saevius Nicanor the freedman of Marcus will deny The same Saevius called also Posthumius Marcus will assert It is reported that in consequence of some infamy attached to his character he retired to Sardinia and there ended his days VI AURELIUS OPILIUS eight hundred fifty nine the freedman of some Epicurean first taught philosophy then rhetoric and last of all grammar five hundred eleven Having closed his school he followed Rutilius Rufus when he was banished to Asia and there the two friends grew old together He also wrote several volumes on a variety of learned topics nine books of which he distinguished by the number and names of the nine Muses as he says not without reason they being the patrons of authors and poets I observe that its title is given in several indexes by a single letter but he uses two in the heading of a book called Pinax VII MARCUS ANTONIUS GNIPHO eight hundred sixty a free born native of Gaul was exposed in his infancy and afterwards received his freedom from his foster father and as some say was educated at Alexandria where Dionysius Scytobrachion eight hundred sixty one was his fellow pupil This however I am not very ready to believe as the times at which they flourished scarcely agree He is said to have been a man of great genius of singular memory well read in Greek as well as Latin and of a most obliging and agreeable temper who never haggled about remuneration but generally left it to the liberality of his scholars He first taught in the house of Julius Caesar eight hundred sixty two when the latter was yet but a boy and afterwards in his own private house He gave instruction in rhetoric also teaching the rules of eloquence every day but declaiming only on festivals It is said that some very celebrated men frequented his school and among others Marcus Cicero during the time he held the praetorship eight hundred sixty three He wrote a number of works although he did not live beyond his fiftieth year but Atteius the philologist eight hundred sixty four says that he left only two volumes De Latino Sermone and that the other works ascribed to him were composed by his disciples and were not his although his name is sometimes to be found in them VIII M POMPILIUS ANDRONICUS a native of Syria while he professed to be a grammarian was considered an idle follower of the Epicurean sect and little qualified to be a master five hundred twelve of a school Finding therefore that at Rome not only Antonius Gnipho but even other teachers of less note were preferred to him he retired to Cumae where he lived at his ease and though he wrote several books he was so needy and reduced to such straits as to be compelled to sell that excellent little work of his The Index to the Annals for sixteen thousand sesterces Orbilius has informed us that he redeemed this work from the oblivion into which it had fallen and took care to have it published with the author s name IX ORBILIUS PUPILLUS of Beneventum being left an orphan by the death of his parents who both fell a sacrifice to the plots of their enemies on the same day acted at first as apparitor to the magistrates He then joined the troops in Macedonia when he was first decorated with the plumed helmet eight hundred sixty five and afterwards promoted to serve on horseback Having completed his military service he resumed his studies which he had pursued with no small diligence from his youth upwards and having been a professor for a long period in his own country at last during the consulship of Cicero made his way to Rome where he taught with more reputation than profit For in one of his works he says that he was then very old and lived in a garret He also published a book with the title of Perialogos containing complaints of the injurious treatment to which professors submitted without seeking redress at the hands of parents His sour temper betrayed itself not only in his disputes with the sophists opposed to him whom he lashed on every occasion but also towards his scholars as Horace tells us who calls him a flogger eight hundred sixty six and Domitius Marsus eight hundred sixty seven who says of him Si quos Orbilius ferula scuticaque cecidit If those Orbilius with rod or ferule thrashed five hundred thirteen And not even men of rank escaped his sarcasms for before he became noticed happening to be examined as a witness in a crowded court Varro the advocate on the other side put the question to him What he did and by what profession he gained his livelihood He replied That he lived by removing hunchbacks from the sunshine into the shade alluding to Muraena s deformity He lived till he was near a hundred years old but he had long lost his memory as the verse of Bibaculus informs us Orbilius ubinam est literarum oblivio Where is Orbilius now that wreck of learning lost His statue is shown in the Capitol at Beneventum It stands on the left hand and is sculptured in marble eight hundred sixty eight representing him in a sitting posture wearing the pallium with two writing cases in his hand He left a son named also Orbilius who like his father was a professor of grammar X ATTEIUS THE PHILOLOGIST a freedman was born at Athens Of him Capito Atteius eight hundred sixty nine the well known jurisconsult says that he was a rhetorician among the grammarians and a grammarian among the rhetoricians Asinius Pollio eight hundred seventy in the book in which he finds fault with the writings of Sallust for his great affectation of obsolete words speaks thus In this work his chief assistant was a certain Atteius a man of rank a splendid Latin grammarian the aider and preceptor of those who studied the practice of declamation in short one who claimed for himself the cognomen of Philologus Writing to Lucius Hermas he says that he had made great proficiency in Greek literature and some in Latin that he had been a hearer of Antonius Gnipho and his Hermas eight hundred seventy one and afterwards began to teach others Moreover that he had for pupils many illustrious youths among whom were the two five hundred fourteen brothers Appius and Pulcher Claudius and that he even accompanied them to their province He appears to have assumed the name of Philologus because like Eratosthenes eight hundred seventy two who first adopted that cognomen he was in high repute for his rich and varied stores of learning which indeed is evident from his commentaries though but few of them are extant Another letter however to the same Hermas shews that they were very numerous Remember it says to recommend generally our Extracts which we have collected as you know of all kinds into eight hundred books He afterwards formed an intimate acquaintance with Caius Sallustius and on his death with Asinius Pollio and when they undertook to write a history he supplied the one with short annals of all Roman affairs from which he could select at pleasure and the other with rules on the art of composition I am therefore surprised that Asinius Pollio should have supposed that he was in the habit of collecting old words and figures of speech for Sallust when he must have known that his own advice was that none but well known and common and appropriate expressions should be made use of and that above all things the obscurity of the style of Sallust and his bold freedom in translations should be avoided XI VALERIUS CATO was as some have informed us the freedman of one Bursenus a native of Gaul He himself tells us in his little work called Indignatio that he was born free and being left an orphan was exposed to be easily stripped of his patrimony during the licence of Sylla s administrations He had a great number of distinguished pupils and was highly esteemed as a preceptor suited to those who had a poetical turn as appears from these short lines Cato grammaticus Latina Siren Qui solus legit ac facit poetas Cato the Latin Siren grammar taught and verse To form the poet skilled and poetry rehearse Besides his Treatise on Grammar he composed some poems five hundred fifteen of which his Lydia and Diana are most admired Ticida mentions his Lydia Lydia doctorum maxima cura liber Lydia a work to men of learning dear Cinna eight hundred seventy three thus notices the Diana Secula permaneat nostri Diana Catonis Immortal be our Cato s song of Dian He lived to extreme old age but in the lowest state of penury and almost in actual want having retired to a small cottage when he gave up his Tusculan villa to his creditors as Bibaculus tells us Si quis forte mei domum Catonis Depictas minio assulas et illos Custodis vidit hortulos Priapi Miratur quibus ille disciplinis Tantam sit sapientiam assecutus Quam tres cauliculi et selibra farris Racemi duo tegula sub una Ad summam prope nutriant senectam If perchance any one has seen the house of my Cato with marble slabs of the richest hues and his gardens worthy of having Priapus eight hundred seventy four for their guardian he may well wonder by what philosophy he has gained so much wisdom that a daily allowance of three coleworts half a pound of meal and two bunches of grapes under a narrow roof should serve for his subsistence to extreme old age And he says in another place Catonis modo Galle Tusculanum Tota creditor urbe venditahat Mirati sumus unicum magistrum Summum grammaticum optimum poetam Omnes solvere posse quaestiones Unum difficile expedire nomen En cor Zenodoti en jecur Cratetis We lately saw my Gallus Cato s Tusculan villa exposed to public sale by his creditors and wondered that such an unrivalled master of five hundred sixteen the schools most eminent grammarian and accomplished poet could solve all propositions and yet found one question too difficult for him to settle how to pay his debts We find in him the genius of Zenodotus eight hundred seventy five the wisdom of Crates eight hundred seventy six XII CORNELIUS EPICADIUS a freedman of Lucius Cornelius Sylla the dictator was his apparitor in the Augural priesthood and much beloved by his son Faustus so that he was proud to call himself the freedman of both He completed the last book of Sylla s Commentaries which his patron had left unfinished eight hundred seventy seven XIII LABERIUS HIERA was bought by his master out of a slave dealer s cage and obtained his freedom on account of his devotion to learning It is reported that his disinterestedness was such that he gave gratuitous instruction to the children of those who were proscribed in the time of Sylla XIV CURTIUS NICIA was the intimate friend of Cneius Pompeius and Caius Memmius but having carried notes from Memmius to Pompey s wife eight hundred seventy eight when she was debauched by Memmius Pompey was indignant and forbad him his house He was also on familiar terms with Marcus Cicero who thus speaks of him in his epistle to Dolabella eight hundred seventy nine I have more need of receiving letters from you than you have of desiring them from me For there is nothing going on at Rome in which I think you would take any interest except perhaps that you may like to know that I am appointed umpire between our friends Nicias and Vidius The one it appears alleges in two short verses that Nicias owes him five hundred seventeen money the other like an Aristarchus cavils at them I like an old critic am to decide whether they are Nicias s or spurious Again in a letter to Atticus eight hundred eighty he says As to what you write about Nicias nothing could give me greater pleasure than to have him with me if I was in a position to enjoy his society but my province is to me a place of retirement and solitude Sicca easily reconciled himself to this state of things and therefore I would prefer having him Besides you are well aware of the feebleness and the nice and luxurious habits of our friend Nicias Why should I be the means of making him uncomfortable when he can afford me no pleasure At the same time I value his goodwill XV LENAEUS was a freedman of Pompey the Great and attended him in most of his expeditions On the death of his patron and his sons he supported himself by teaching in a school which he opened near the temple of Tellus in the Carium in the quarter of the city where the house of the Pompeys stood eight hundred eighty one Such was his regard for his patron s memory that when Sallust described him as having a brazen face and a shameless mind he lashed the historian in a most bitter satire eight hundred eighty two as a bull s pizzle a gormandizer a braggart and a tippler a man whose life and writings were equally monstrous besides charging him with being a most unskilful plagiarist who borrowed the language of Cato and other old writers It is related that in his youth having escaped from slavery by the contrivance of some of his friends he took refuge in his own country and that after he had applied himself to the liberal arts he brought the price of his freedom to his former master who however struck by his talents and learning gave him manumission gratuitously XVI QUINTUS CAECILIUS an Epirot by descent but born at Tusculum was a freedman of Atticus Satrius a Roman five hundred eighteen knight to whom Cicero addressed his Epistles eight hundred eighty three He became the tutor of his patron s daughter eight hundred eighty four who was contracted to Marcus Agrippa but being suspected of an illicit intercourse with her and sent away on that account he betook himself to Cornelius Gallus and lived with him on terms of the greatest intimacy which indeed was imputed to Gallus as one of his heaviest offences by Augustus Then after the condemnation and death of Gallus eight hundred eighty five he opened a school but had few pupils and those very young nor any belonging to the higher orders excepting the children of those he could not refuse to admit He was the first it is said who held disputations in Latin and who began to lecture on Virgil and the other modern poets which the verse of Domitius Marcus eight hundred eighty six points out Epirota tenellorum nutricula vatum The Epirot who With tender care our unfledged poets nursed XVII VERRIUS FLACCUS eight hundred eighty seven a freedman distinguished himself by a new mode of teaching for it was his practice to exercise the wits of his scholars by encouraging emulation among them not only proposing the subjects on which they were to write but offering rewards for those who were successful in the contest These consisted of some ancient handsome or rare book Being in consequence selected by Augustus as preceptor to his grandsons he transferred his entire school to the Palatium but with the understanding that he should admit no fresh scholars The hall in Catiline s house five hundred nineteen which had then been added to the palace was assigned him for his school with a yearly allowance of one hundred thousand sesterces He died of old age in the reign of Tiberius There is a statue of him at Praeneste in the semi circle at the lower side of the forum where he had set up calendars arranged by himself and inscribed on slabs of marble XVIII LUCIUS CRASSITIUS a native of Tarentum and in rank a freedman had the cognomen of Pasides which he afterwards changed for Pansa His first employment was connected with the stage and his business was to assist the writers of farces After that he took to giving lessons in a gallery attached to a house until his commentary on The Smyrna eight hundred eighty eight so brought him into notice that the following lines were written on him Uni Crassitio se credere Smyrna probavit Desinite indocti conjugio hanc petere Soli Crassitio se dixit nubere velle Intima cui soli nota sua exstiterint Crassitius only counts on Smyrna s love Fruitless the wooings of the unlettered prove Crassitius she receives with loving arms For he alone unveiled her hidden charms However after having taught many scholars some of whom were of high rank and amongst others Julius Antonius the triumvir s son so that he might be even compared with Verrius Flaccus he suddenly closed his school and joined the sect of Quintus Septimius the philosopher XIX SCRIBONIUS APHRODISIUS the slave and disciple of Orbilius who was afterwards redeemed and presented with his freedom by Scribonia eight hundred eighty nine the daughter of Libo who had been the wife of Augustus taught in the time of Verrius whose books on Orthography he also revised not without some severe remarks on his pursuits and conduct XX C JULIUS HYGINUS a freedman of Augustus was a native of Spain although some say he was born at Alexandria five hundred twenty and that when that city was taken Caesar brought him then a boy to Rome He closely and carefully imitated Cornelius Alexander eight hundred ninety a Greek grammarian who for his antiquarian knowledge was called by many Polyhistor and by some History He had the charge of the Palatine library but that did not prevent him from having many scholars and he was one of the most intimate friends of the poet Ovid and of Caius Licinius the historian a man of consular rank eight hundred ninety one who has related that Hyginus died very poor and was supported by his liberality as long as he lived Julius Modestus eight hundred ninety two who was a freedman of Hyginus followed the footsteps of his patron in his studies and learning XXI CAIUS MELISSUS eight hundred ninety three a native of Spoletum was free born but having been exposed by his parents in consequence of quarrels between them he received a good education from his foster father by whose care and industry he was brought up and was made a present of to Mecaenas as a grammarian Finding himself valued and treated as a friend he preferred to continue in his state of servitude although he was claimed by his mother choosing rather his present condition than that which his real origin entitled him to In consequence his freedom was speedily given him and he even became a favourite with Augustus By his appointment he was made curator of the library in the portico of Octavia eight hundred ninety four and as he himself informs us undertook to compose when he was a sexagenarian his books of Witticisms which are now called The Book of Jests Of these he accomplished one hundred and fifty to which he afterwards added several more He five hundred twenty one also composed a new kind of story about those who wore the toga and called it Trabeat eight hundred ninety five XXII MARCUS POMPONIUS MARCELLUS a very severe critic of the Latin tongue who sometimes pleaded causes in a certain address on the plaintiff s behalf persisted in charging his adversary with making a solecism until Cassius Severus appealed to the judges to grant an adjournment until his client should produce another grammarian as he was not prepared to enter into a controversy respecting a solecism instead of defending his client s rights On another occasion when he had found fault with some expression in a speech made by Tiberius Atteius Capito eight hundred ninety six affirmed that if it was not Latin at least it would be so in time to come Capito is wrong cried Marcellus it is certainly in your power Caesar to confer the freedom of the city on whom you please but you cannot make words for us Asinius Gallus eight hundred ninety seven tells us that he was formerly a pugilist in the following epigram Qui caput ad laevam deicit glossemata nobis Praecipit os nullum vel potius pugilis Who ducked his head to shun another s fist Though he expound old saws yet well I wist With pummelled nose and face he s but a pugilist XXIII REMMIUS PALAEMON eight hundred ninety eight of Vicentia eight hundred ninety nine the offspring of a bond woman acquired the rudiments of learning first as the companion of a weaver s and then of his master s son at school Being afterwards made free he taught at Rome where he stood highest in the rank of the grammarians but he was so infamous for every sort of vice that Tiberius and his successor Claudius publicly denounced him as an improper person to have the education of boys and young men entrusted to him Still his powers of narrative and agreeable style of speaking made him very popular besides which he had the gift of making extempore verses He also wrote a great many in five hundred twenty two various and uncommon metres His insolence was such that he called Marcus Varro a hog and bragged that letters were born and would perish with him and that his name was not introduced inadvertently in the Bucolics nine hundred as Virgil divined that a Palaemon would some day be the judge of all poets and poems He also boasted that having once fallen into the hands of robbers they spared him on account of the celebrity his name had acquired He was so luxurious that he took the bath many times in a day nor did his means suffice for his extravagance although his school brought him in forty thousand sesterces yearly and he received not much less from his private estate which he managed with great care He also kept a broker s shop for the sale of old clothes and it is well known that a vine nine hundred one he planted himself yielded three hundred and fifty bottles of wine But the greatest of all his vices was his unbridled licentiousness in his commerce with women which he carried to the utmost pitch of foul indecency nine hundred two They tell a droll story of some one who met him in a crowd and upon his offering to kiss him could not escape the salute Master said he do you want to mouth every one you meet with in a hurry XXIV MARCUS VALERIUS PROBUS of Berytus nine hundred three after long aspiring to the rank of centurion being at last tired of waiting devoted himself to study He had met with some old authors at a bookseller s shop in the provinces where the memory of ancient times still lingers and is not quite forgotten as it is at Rome Being anxious carefully to reperuse these and afterwards to make acquaintance with other works of the same kind he found himself an object of contempt and was laughed five hundred twenty three at for his lectures instead of their gaining him fame or profit Still however he persisted in his purpose and employed himself in correcting illustrating and adding notes to many works which he had collected his labours being confined to the province of a grammarian and nothing more He had properly speaking no scholars but some few followers For he never taught in such a way as to maintain the character of a master but was in the habit of admitting one or two perhaps at most three or four disciples in the afternoon and while he lay at ease and chatted freely on ordinary topics he occasionally read some book to them but that did not often happen He published a few slight treatises on some subtle questions besides which he left a large collection of observations on the language of the ancients LIVES OF EMINENT RHETORICIANS five hundred twenty four I Rhetoric also as well as Grammar 
2587-163454-0000	train-other-500	was not introduced amongst us till a late period and with still more difficulty
none	none	 inasmuch as we find that at times 
2587-163454-0001	train-other-500	the practice of it was even prohibited In order to leave no doubt of this I will subjoin an ancient decree of the senate as well as an edict of the censors In the consulship of Caius Fannius Strabo
none	none	 and Marcus Palerius Messala nine hundred four the praetor Marcus Pomponius moved the senate 
2587-163454-0002	train-other-500	that an act be passed respecting Philosophers and Rhetoricians In this matter they have decreed as follows

2587-163454-0003	train-other-500	as the good of the Republic and the duty of his office require that no Philosophers or Rhetoricians be suffered at Rome After some interval
none	none	 the censor Cnaeus Domitius Aenobarbus and Lucius Licinius Crassus 
2587-163454-0004	train-other-500	issued the following edict upon the same subject It is reported to us that certain persons have instituted a new kind of discipline that our youth resort to their schools that they have assumed the title of Latin Rhetoricians
2587-163454-0005	train-other-500	and that young men waste their time there for whole days together Our ancestors have ordained what instruction it is fitting their children should receive and what schools they should attend These novelties

none	none	 and those who are in the practice of frequenting them that they meet our disapprobation However by slow degrees rhetoric manifested itself to be a five hundred twenty five useful and honourable study and many persons devoted themselves to it both as a means of defence and of acquiring reputation Cicero declaimed in Greek until his praetorship 
2587-163454-0007	train-other-500	but afterwards as he grew older in Latin also
none	none	 and even in the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa nine hundred five whom he calls his great and noble disciples Some historians state that Cneius Pompey 
2587-163454-0008	train-other-500	resumed the practice of declaiming even during the civil war in order to be better prepared to argue against Caius Curio a young man of great talents to whom the defence of Caesar was entrusted They say likewise that it was not forgotten by Mark Antony
none	none	 nor by Augustus even during the war of Modena Nero also declaimed nine hundred six even after he became emperor in the first year of his reign which he had done before in public but twice 
2587-163454-0009	train-other-500	Many speeches of orators were also published In consequence public favour
none	none	 was so much attracted to the study of rhetoric 
2587-163454-0010	train-other-500	that a vast number of professors and learned men devoted themselves to it and it flourished to such a degree that some of them raised themselves by it to the rank of senators and the highest offices But the same mode of teaching was not adopted by all
2587-163454-0011	train-other-500	nor indeed did individuals always confine themselves to the same system but each varied his plan of teaching according to circumstances For they were accustomed in stating their argument with the utmost clearness to use figures and apologies
2587-163454-0012	train-other-500	to put cases as circumstances required and to relate facts sometimes briefly and succinctly and at other times more at large and with greater feeling Nor did they omit on occasion to resort to translations from the Greek
2587-163454-0013	train-other-500	and to expatiate in the praise or to launch their censures on the faults of illustrious men They also dealt with matters connected with every day life pointing out such as are useful and necessary and such as are hurtful and needless
2587-163454-0014	train-other-500	They had occasion often to support the authority of fabulous accounts and to detract from that of historical narratives which sort the Greeks call Propositions Refutations and Corroboration
none	none	 until by a gradual process they have exhausted these topics 
2587-163454-0015	train-other-500	and arrive at the gist of the argument Among the ancients subjects of controversy were drawn either from history as indeed some are even now
none	none	 or from five hundred twenty six actual facts of recent occurrence 
2587-163454-0016	train-other-500	It was therefore the custom to state them precisely

2587-163454-0017	train-other-500	We certainly so find them collected and published
none	none	 and it may be well to give one or two of them literally by way of example

none	none	 it would not be easy to find many others than those of whom I shall now proceed to give an account II LUCIUS PLOTIUS GALLUS Of him Marcus Tullius Cicero thus writes to Marcus Titinnius nine hundred eight I remember well that when we were boys one Lucius Plotius first began to teach Latin and as great numbers flocked to his school so that all who were most devoted to study were eager to take lessons from him it was a great trouble to me that I too was not allowed to do so I was prevented however by the decided opinion five hundred twenty seven of men of the greatest learning who considered that it was best to cultivate the genius by the study of Greek This same Gallus for he lived to a great age was pointed at by M Caelius in a speech which he was forced to make in his own cause as having supplied his accuser Atracinus nine hundred nine with materials for his charge Suppressing his name he says that such a rhetorician was like barley bread nine hundred ten compared to a wheaten loaf windy chaffy and coarse III LUCIUS OCTACILIUS PILITUS is said to have been a slave and according to the old custom chained to the door like a watch dog nine hundred eleven until having been presented with his freedom for his genius and devotion to learning he drew up for his patron the act of accusation in a cause he was prosecuting After that becoming a professor of rhetoric he gave instructions to Cneius Pompey the Great 
2587-163454-0025	train-other-500	and composed an account of his actions
none	none	 as well as of those of his father being the first freedman according to the opinion of Cornelius Nepos nine hundred twelve who ventured to write history 
2587-163454-0026	train-other-500	which before his time had not been done by any one
none	none	 who was not of the highest ranks in society IV About this time EPIDIUS nine hundred thirteen having fallen into disgrace for bringing a false accusation 
2587-163454-0027	train-other-500	opened a school of instruction in which he taught among others Mark Antony and Augustus
none	none	 On one occasion Caius Canutius jeered them for presuming to belong to the party of the consul Isauricus nine hundred fourteen in his administration of the republic 
2587-163454-0028	train-other-500	upon which he replied that he would rather be the disciple of Isauricus
none	none	 than of Epidius the false accuser This Epidius claimed to be descended from Epidius Nuncio who as five hundred twenty eight ancient traditions assert fell into the fountain of the river Sarnus nine hundred fifteen when the streams were overflown and not being afterwards found was reckoned among the number of the gods V SEXTUS CLODIUS a native of Sicily a professor both of Greek and Latin eloquence had bad eyes and a facetious tongue It was a saying of his that he lost a pair of eyes from his intimacy with Mark Antony the triumvir nine hundred sixteen Of his wife Fulvia when there was a swelling in one of her cheeks he said that she tempted the point of his style nine hundred seventeen nor did Antony think any the worse of him for the joke but quite enjoyed it and soon afterwards when Antony was consul nine hundred eighteen he even made him a large grant of land which Cicero charges him with in his Philippics nine hundred nineteen You patronize he said a master of the schools for the sake of his buffoonery and make a rhetorician one of your pot companions allowing him to cut his jokes on any one he pleased a witty man no doubt but it was an easy matter to say smart things of such as you and your companions But listen Conscript Fathers while I tell you what reward was given to this rhetorician and let the wounds of the republic be laid bare to view You assigned two thousand acres of the Leontine territory nine hundred twenty to Sextus Clodius the rhetorician and not content with that exonerated the estate from all taxes Hear this and learn from the extravagance of the grant how little wisdom is displayed in your acts VI CAIUS ALBUTIUS SILUS of Novara nine hundred twenty one while in the execution five hundred twenty nine of the office of edile in his native place he was sitting for the administration of justice was dragged by the feet from the tribunal by some persons against whom he was pronouncing a decree In great indignation at this usage he made straight for the gate of the town and proceeded to Rome There he was admitted to fellowship and lodged with Plancus the orator nine hundred twenty two whose practice it was before he made a speech in public to set up some one to take the contrary side in the argument The office was undertaken by Albutius with such success that he silenced Plancus who did not venture to put himself in competition with him This bringing him into notice he collected an audience of his own and it was his custom to open the question proposed for debate sitting but as he warmed with the subject 
2587-163454-0029	train-other-500	he stood up and made his peroration in that posture His declamations were of different kinds sometimes brilliant and polished at others that they might not be thought to savour too much of the schools he curtailed them of all ornament
2587-163454-0030	train-other-500	and used only familiar phrases He also pleaded causes but rarely
none	none	 being employed in such as were of the highest importance and in every case undertaking the peroration only In the end he gave up practising in the forum partly from shame partly from fear For in a certain trial before the court of the One Hundred nine hundred twenty three having lashed the defendant as a man void of natural affection for his parents he called upon him by a bold figure of speech to swear by the ashes of his father and mother which lay unburied his adversary taking him up for the suggestion and the judges frowning upon it he lost his cause and was much blamed At another time on a trial for murder at Milan before Lucius Piso the proconsul having to defend the culprit he worked himself up to such a pitch of vehemence that in a crowded court who loudly applauded him notwithstanding all the efforts of the lictor to maintain order he broke out into a lamentation on the miserable state of Italy nine hundred twenty four then in danger of being again reduced he said into five hundred thirty the form of a province and turning to the statue of Marcus Brutus which stood in the Forum he invoked him as the founder and vindicator of the liberties of the people For this he narrowly escaped a prosecution 
2587-163454-0031	train-other-500	Suffering at an advanced period of life from an ulcerated tumour he returned to Novara and calling the people together in a public assembly addressed them in a set speech of considerable length explaining the reasons which induced him to put an end to existence
none	none	 and this he did by abstaining from food END OF THE LIVES OF GRAMMARIANS AND RHETORICIANS LIVES OF THE POETS five hundred thirty one THE LIFE OF TERENCE Publius Terentius Afer a native of Carthage was a slave at Rome of the senator Terentius Lucanus who struck by his abilities and handsome person gave him not only a liberal education in his youth but his freedom when he arrived at years of maturity Some say that he was a captive taken in war but this as Fenestella nine hundred twenty five informs us could by no means have been the case since both his birth and death took place in the interval between the termination of the second Punic war and the commencement of the third nine hundred twenty six nor even supposing that he had been taken prisoner by the Numidian or Getulian tribes could he have fallen into the hands of a Roman general as there was no commercial intercourse between the Italians and Africans until after the fall of Carthage nine hundred twenty seven Terence lived in great familiarity with many persons of high station and especially with Scipio Africanus and Caius Delius whose favour he is even supposed to have purchased by the foulest means But Fenestella reverses the charge contending that Terence was older than either of them Cornelius Nepos however five hundred thirty two informs us that they were all of nearly equal age and Porcias intimates a suspicion of this criminal commerce in the following passage While Terence plays the wanton with the great and recommends himself to them by the meretricious ornaments of his person while with greedy ears he drinks in the divine melody of Africanus s voice while he thinks of being a constant guest at the table of Furius and the handsome Laelius while he thinks that he is fondly loved by them and often invited to Albanum for his youthful beauty he finds himself stripped of his property and reduced to the lowest state of indigence Then withdrawing from the world he betook himself to Greece where he met his end dying at Strymphalos a town in Arcadia What availed him the friendship of Scipio of Laelius or of Furius three of the most affluent nobles of that age They did not even minister to his necessities so much as to provide him a hired house to which his slave might return with the intelligence of his master s death He wrote comedies the earliest of which The Andria having to be performed at the public spectacles given by the aediles nine hundred twenty eight he was commanded to read it first before Caecilius nine hundred twenty nine Having been introduced while Caecilius was at supper and being meanly dressed he is reported to have read the beginning of the play seated on a low stool near the great man s couch But after reciting a few verses he was invited to take his place at table and having supped with his host went through the rest to his great delight This play and five others were received by the public with similar applause although Volcatius in his enumeration of them says that The Hecyra nine hundred thirty must not be reckoned among these The Eunuch was even acted twice the same day nine hundred thirty one and earned more money than any comedy whoever was the writer had five hundred thirty three ever done before namely eight thousand sesterces nine hundred thirty two besides which a certain sum accrued to the author for the title But Varro prefers the opening of The Adelphi nine hundred thirty three to that of Menander It is very commonly reported that Terence was assisted in his works by Laelius and Scipio nine hundred thirty four with whom he lived in such great intimacy He gave some currency to this report himself nor did he ever attempt to defend himself against it except in a light way as in the prologue to The Adelphi Nam quod isti dicunt malevoli homines nohiles Hunc adjutare assidueque una scribere Quod illi maledictun vehemens existimant Eam laudem hic ducit maximam cum illis placet Qui vobis universis et populo placent Quorum opera in bello in otio in negotio Suo quisque tempore usus est sine superbia For this Which malice tells that certain noble persons Assist the bard and write in concert with him That which they deem a heavy slander he Esteems his greatest praise that he can please Those who in war in peace as counsellors Have rendered you the dearest services And ever borne their faculties so meekly Colman He appears to have protested against this imputation with less earnestness because the notion was far from being disagreeable to Laelius and Scipio It therefore gained ground and prevailed in after times Quintus Memmius in his speech in his own defence says Publius Africanus who borrowed from Terence a character which he had acted in private brought it on the stage in his name Nepos tells us he found in some book that C Laelius when he was on some occasion at Puteoli on the calends the first of March nine hundred thirty five being requested by his wife to rise early five hundred thirty four begged her not to suffer him to be disturbed as he had gone to bed late having been engaged in writing with more than usual success On her asking him to tell her what he had been writing he repeated the verses which are found in the Heautontimoroumenos Satis pol proterve me Syri promessa Heauton IV iv one I faith the rogue Syrus s impudent pretences Santra nine hundred thirty six is of opinion that if Terence required any assistance in his compositions nine hundred thirty seven he would not have had recourse to Scipio and Laelius who were then very young men but rather to Sulpicius Gallus nine hundred thirty eight an accomplished scholar who had been the first to introduce his plays at the games given by the consuls or to Q Fabius Labeo or Marcus Popilius nine hundred thirty nine both men of consular rank as well as poets It was for this reason that in alluding to the assistance he had received he did not speak of his coadjutors as very young men but as persons of whose services the people had full experience in peace in war and in the administration of affairs After he had given his comedies to the world at a time when he had not passed his thirty fifth year in order to avoid suspicion as he found others publishing their works under his name or else to make himself acquainted with the modes of life and habits of the Greeks for the purpose of exhibiting them in his plays he withdrew from home to which he never returned Volcatius gives this account of his death Sed ut Afer sei populo dedit comoedias Iter hic in Asiam fecit Navem cum semel Conscendit visus nunquam est Sic vita vacat five hundred thirty five When Afer had produced six plays for the entertainment of the people He embarked for Asia but from the time he went on board ship He was never seen again Thus he ended his life Q Consentius reports that he perished at sea on his voyage back from Greece and that one hundred and eight plays of which he had made a version from Menander nine hundred forty were lost with him Others say that he died at Stymphalos in Arcadia or in Leucadia during the consulship of Cn Cornelius Dolabella and Marcus Fulvius Nobilior nine hundred forty one worn out with a severe illness and with grief and regret for the loss of his baggage which he had sent forward in a ship that was wrecked and contained the last new plays he had written In person Terence is reported to have been rather short and slender with a dark complexion He had an only daughter who was afterwards married to a Roman knight and he left also twenty acres of garden ground nine hundred forty two on the Appian Way at the Villa of Mars I therefore wonder the more how Porcius could have written the verses nihil Publius Scipio profuit nihil et Laelius nihil Furius Tres per idem tempus qui agitabant nobiles facillime Eorum ille opera ne domum quidem habuit conductitiam Saltem ut esset quo referret obitum domini servulus nine hundred forty three Afranius places him at the head of all the comic writers declaring in his Compitalia Terentio non similem dices quempiam Terence s equal cannot soon be found On the other hand Volcatius reckons him inferior not only five hundred thirty six to Naevius Plautus and Caecilius but also to Licinius Cicero pays him this high compliment in his Limo Tu quoque qui solus lecto sermone Terenti Conversum expressumque Latina voce Menandrum In medio populi sedatis vocibus offers Quidquid come loquens ac omnia dulcia dicens You only Terence translated into Latin and clothed in choice language the plays of Menander and brought them before the public who in crowded audiences hung upon hushed applause Grace marked each line and every period charmed So also Caius Caesar Tu quoque tu in summis O dimidiate Menander Poneris et merito puri sermonis amator Lenibus atque utinam scriptis adjuncta foret vis Comica ut aequato virtus polleret honore Cum Graecis neque in hoc despectus parte jaceres Unum hoc maceror et doleo tibi deesse Terenti You too who divide your honours with Menander will take your place among poets of the highest order and justly too such is the purity of your style Would only that to your graceful diction was added more comic force that your works might equal in merit the Greek masterpieces and your inferiority in this particular should not expose you to censure This is my only regret in this Terence I grieve to say you are wanting THE LIFE OF JUVENAL D JUNIUS JUVENALIS who was either the son nine hundred forty four of a wealthy freedman or brought up by him it is not known which declaimed till the middle of life nine hundred forty five more from the bent of his inclination than from any desire to prepare himself either for the schools or the forum But having composed a short satire nine hundred forty six which was clever enough on Paris nine hundred forty seven the actor of pantomimes five hundred thirty seven and also on the poet of Claudius Nero who was puffed up by having held some inferior military rank for six months only he afterwards devoted himself with much zeal to that style of writing For a while indeed he had not the courage to read them even to a small circle of auditors but it was not long before he recited his satires to crowded audiences and with entire success and this he did twice or thrice inserting new lines among those which he had originally composed Quod non dant proceres dabit histrio tu Camerinos Et Bareas tu nobilium magna atria curas Praefectos Pelopea facit Philomela tribunos Behold an actor s patronage affords A surer means of rising than a lord s And wilt thou still the Camerino s nine hundred forty eight court Or to the halls of Bareas resort When tribunes Pelopea can create And Philomela praefects who shall rule the state nine hundred forty nine At that time the player was in high favour at court and many of those who fawned upon him were daily raised to posts of honour Juvenal therefore incurred the suspicion of having covertly satirized occurrences which were then passing and although eighty years old at that time nine hundred fifty he was immediately removed from the city being sent into honourable banishment as praefect of a cohort which was under orders to proceed to a station at the extreme frontier of Egypt nine hundred fifty one That five hundred thirty eight sort of punishment was selected as it appeared severe enough for an offence which was venial and a mere piece of drollery However he died very soon afterwards worn down by grief and weary of his life THE LIFE OF PERSIUS AULUS PERSIUS FLACCUS was born the day before the Nones of December fourth Dec nine hundred fifty two in the consulship of Fabius Persicus and L Vitellius He died on the eighth of the calends of December twenty fourth Nov nine hundred fifty three in the consulship of Rubrius Marius and Asinius Gallus Though born at Volterra in Etruria he was a Roman knight allied both by blood and marriage to persons of the highest rank nine hundred fifty four He ended his days at an estate he had at the eighth milestone on the Appian Way His father Flaccus who died when he was barely six years old left him under the care of guardians and his mother Fulvia Silenna who afterwards married Fusius a Roman knight buried him also in a very few years Persius Flaccus pursued his studies at Volterra till he was twelve years old and then continued them at Rome under Remmius Palaemon the grammarian and Verginius Flaccus the rhetorician Arriving at the age of twenty one he formed a friendship with Annaeus Cornutus nine hundred fifty five which lasted through life and from him he learned the rudiments of philosophy Among his earliest friends were Caesius Bassus nine hundred fifty six and Calpurnius Statura the latter of whom died while Persius himself was yet in his youth Servilius five hundred thirty nine Numanus nine hundred fifty seven he reverenced as a father Through Cornutus he was introduced to Annaeus as well as to Lucan who was of his own age and also a disciple of Cornutus At that time Cornutus was a tragic writer he belonged to the sect of the Stoics and left behind him some philosophical works Lucan was so delighted with the writings of Persius Flaccus that he could scarcely refrain from giving loud tokens of applause while the author was reciting them and declared that they had the true spirit of poetry It was late before Persius made the acquaintance of Seneca and then he was not much struck with his natural endowments At the house of Cornutus he enjoyed the society of two very learned and excellent men who were then zealously devoting themselves to philosophical enquiries namely Claudius Agaternus a physician from Lacedaemon and Petronius Aristocrates of Magnesia men whom he held in the highest esteem and with whom he vied in their studies as they were of his own age being younger than Cornutus During nearly the last ten years of his life he was much beloved by Thraseas so that he sometimes travelled abroad in his company and his cousin Arria was married to him Persius was remarkable for gentle manners for a modesty amounting to bashfulness a handsome form and an attachment to his mother sister and aunt which was most exemplary He was frugal and chaste He left his mother and sister twenty thousand sesterces requesting his mother in a written codicil to present to Cornutus as some say one hundred sesterces or as others twenty pounds of wrought silver nine hundred fifty eight besides about seven hundred books which indeed included his whole library Cornutus however would only take the books and gave up the legacy to the sisters whom his brother had constituted his heirs He wrote nine hundred fifty nine seldom and not very fast even the work we possess he left incomplete Some verses are wanting at the end of the book nine hundred sixty but Cornutus thoughtlessly recited it as if five hundred forty it was finished and on Caesius Bassus requesting to be allowed to publish it he delivered it to him for that purpose In his younger days Persius had written a play as well as an Itinerary with several copies of verses on Thraseas father in law and Arria s nine hundred sixty one mother who had made away with herself before her husband But Cornutus used his whole influence with the mother of Persius to prevail upon her to destroy these compositions As soon as his book of Satires was published all the world began to admire it and were eager to buy it up He died of a disease in the stomach in the thirtieth year of his age nine hundred sixty two But no sooner had he left school and his masters than he set to work with great vehemence to compose satires from having read the tenth book of Lucilius and made the beginning of that book his model presently launching his invectives all around with so little scruple that he did not spare cotemporary poets and orators and even lashed Nero himself who was then the reigning prince The verse ran as follows Auriculas asini Mida rex habet King Midas has an ass s ears but Cornutus altered it thus Auriculas asini quis non hahet Who has not an ass s ears in order that it might not be supposed that it was meant to apply to Nero THE LIFE OF HORACE HORATIUS FLACCUS was a native of Venusium nine hundred sixty three his father having been by his own account nine hundred sixty four a freedman and collector of taxes but as it is generally believed a dealer in salted five hundred forty one provisions for some one with whom Horace had a quarrel jeered him by saying How often have I seen your father wiping his nose with his fist In the battle of Philippi he served as a military tribune nine hundred sixty five which post he filled at the instance of Marcus Brutus nine hundred sixty six the general and having obtained a pardon on the overthrow of his party he purchased the office of scribe to a quaestor Afterwards insinuating himself first into the good graces of Mecaenas and then of Augustus he secured no small share in the regard of both And first how much Mecaenas loved him may be seen by the epigram in which he says Ni te visceribus meis Horati Plus jam diligo Titium sodalem Ginno tu videas strigosiorem nine hundred sixty seven But it was more strongly exhibited by Augustus in a short sentence uttered in his last moments Be as mindful of Horatius Flaccus as you are of me Augustus offered to appoint him his secretary signifying his wishes to Mecaenas in a letter to the following effect Hitherto I have been able to write my own epistles to friends but now I am too much occupied and in an infirm state of health I wish therefore to deprive you of our Horace let him leave therefore your luxurious table and come to the palace and he shall assist me in writing my letters And upon his refusing to accept the office he neither exhibited the smallest displeasure nor ceased to heap upon him tokens of his regard Letters of his are extant from which I will make some short extracts to establish this Use your influence over me with the same freedom as you would do if we were living together as friends In so doing you will be perfectly right and guilty of no impropriety for I could wish that our intercourse should be on that footing if your health admitted of it And again How I hold you in memory you may learn five hundred forty two from our friend Septimius nine hundred sixty eight for I happened to mention you when he was present And if you are so proud as to scorn my friendship that is no reason why I should lightly esteem yours in return Besides this among other drolleries he often called him his most immaculate penis and his charming little man and loaded him from time to time with proofs of his munificence He admired his works so much and was so convinced of their enduring fame that he directed him to compose the Secular Poem as well as that on the victory of his stepsons Tiberius and Drusus over the Vindelici nine hundred sixty nine and for this purpose urged him to add after a long interval a fourth book of Odes to the former three After reading his Sermones in which he found no mention of himself he complained in these terms You must know that I am very angry with you because in most of your works of this description you do not choose to address yourself to me Are you afraid that in times to come your reputation will suffer in case it should appear that you lived on terms of intimate friendship with me And he wrung from him the eulogy which begins with Cum tot sustineas et tanta negotia solus Res Italas armis tuteris moribus ornes Legibus emendes in publica commoda peccem Si longo sermone morer tua tempora Caesar Epist ii i While you alone sustain the important weight Of Rome s affairs so various and so great While you the public weal with arms defend Adorn with morals and with laws amend Shall not the tedious letter prove a crime That steals one moment of our Caesar s time Francis In person Horace was short and fat as he is described by himself in his Satires nine hundred seventy and by Augustus in the following letter Dionysius has brought me your small volume which little as it is not to blame you for that I shall judge favourably You seem to me however to be afraid lest your volumes should be bigger than yourself But if you are short in stature you are corpulent enough You may therefore five hundred forty three if you will write in a quart when the size of your volume is as large round as your paunch It is reported that he was immoderately addicted to venery For he is said to have had obscene pictures so disposed in a bedchamber lined with mirrors that whichever way he looked lascivious images might present themselves to his view nine hundred seventy one He lived for the most part in the retirement of his farm nine hundred seventy two on the confines of the Sabine and Tiburtine territories and his house is shewn in the neighbourhood of a little wood not far from Tibur Some Elegies ascribed to him and a prose Epistle apparently written to commend himself to Mecaenas have been handed down to us but I believe that neither of them are genuine works of his for the Elegies are commonplace and the Epistle is wanting in perspicuity a fault which cannot be imputed to his style He was born on the sixth of the ides of December twenty seventh December in the consulship of Lucius Cotta nine hundred seventy three and Lucius Torquatus and died on the fifth of the calends of December twenty seventh November in the consulship of Caius Marcius Censorinus and Caius Asinius Gallus nine hundred seventy four having completed his fifty ninth year He made a nuncupatory will declaring Augustus his heir not being able from the violence of his disorder to sign one in due form He was interred and lies buried on the skirts of the Esquiline Hill near the tomb of Mecaenas nine hundred seventy five five hundred forty four M ANNAEUS LUCANUS a native of Corduba nine hundred seventy six first tried the powers of his genius in an encomium on Nero at the Quinquennial games He afterwards recited his poem on the Civil War carried on between Pompey and Caesar His vanity was so immense and he gave such liberty to his tongue that in some preface comparing his age and his first efforts with those of Virgil he had the assurance to say And what now remains for me is to deal with a gnat In his early youth after being long informed of the sort of life his father led in the country in consequence of an unhappy marriage nine hundred seventy seven he was recalled from Athens by Nero who admitted him into the circle of his friends and even gave him the honour of the quaestorship but he did not long remain in favour Smarting at this and having publicly stated that Nero had withdrawn all of a sudden without communicating with the senate and without any other motive than his own recreation after this he did not cease to assail the emperor both with foul words and with acts which are still notorious So that on one occasion when easing his bowels in the common privy there being a louder explosion than usual he gave vent to the nemistych of Nero One would suppose it was thundering under ground in the hearing of those who were sitting there for the same purpose and who took to their heels in much consternation nine hundred seventy eight In a poem also which was in every one s hands he severely lashed both the emperor and his most powerful adherents At length he became nearly the most active leader in Piso s conspiracy nine hundred seventy nine and while he dwelt without reserve in many quarters on the glory of those who dipped their hands in the five hundred forty five blood of tyrants he launched out into open threats of violence and carried them so far as to boast that he would cast the emperor s head at the feet of his neighbours When however the plot was discovered he did not exhibit any firmness of mind A confession was wrung from him without much difficulty and humbling himself to the most abject entreaties he even named his innocent mother as one of the conspirators nine hundred eighty hoping that his want of natural affection would give him favour in the eyes of a parricidal prince Having obtained permission to choose his mode of death nine hundred eighty one he wrote notes to his father containing corrections of some of his verses and having made a full meal allowed a physician to open the veins in his arm nine hundred eighty two I have also heard it said that his poems were offered for sale and commented upon not only with care and diligence but also in a trifling way nine hundred eighty three THE LIFE OF PLINY nine hundred eighty four PLINIUS SECUNDUS a native of New Como nine hundred eighty five having served in five hundred forty six the wars with strict attention to his duties in the rank of a knight distinguished himself also by the great integrity with which he administered the high functions of procurator for a long period in the several provinces intrusted to his charge But still he devoted so much attention to literary pursuits that it would not have been an easy matter for a person who enjoyed entire leisure to have written more than he did He comprised in twenty volumes an account of all the various wars carried on in successive periods with the German tribes Besides this he wrote a Natural History which extended to seven books He fell a victim to the calamitous event which occurred in Campania For having the command of the fleet at Misenum when Vesuvius was throwing up a fiery eruption he put to sea with his gallies for the purpose of exploring the causes of the phenomenon close on the spot nine hundred eighty six But being prevented by contrary winds from sailing back he was suffocated in the dense cloud of dust and ashes Some however think that he was killed by his slave having implored him to put an end to his sufferings when he was reduced to the last extremity by the fervent heat nine hundred eighty seven THE END OF LIVES OF THE POETS FOOTNOTES Footnote one Plin Epist i eighteen twenty four iii eight v eleven ix thirty four x ninety five Footnote two Lycee part I liv III c i Footnote three Julius Caesar Divus Romulus the founder of Rome had the honour of an apotheosis conferred on him by the senate under the title of Quirinus to obviate the people s suspicion of his having been taken off by a conspiracy of the patrician order Political circumstances again concurred with popular superstition to revive this posthumous adulation in favour of Julius Caesar the founder of the empire who also fell by the hands of conspirators It is remarkable in the history of a nation so jealous of public liberty that in both instances they bestowed the highest mark of human homage upon men who owed their fate to the introduction of arbitrary power Footnote four Pliny informs us that Caius Julius the father of Julius Caesar a man of pretorian rank died suddenly at Pisa Footnote five A U C in the year from the foundation of Rome six hundred seventy A C before Christ about ninety two Footnote six Flamen Dialis This was an office of great dignity but subjected the holder to many restrictions He was not allowed to ride on horseback nor to absent himself from the city for a single night His wife was also under particular restraints and could not be divorced If she died the flamen resigned his office because there were certain sacred rites which he could not perform without her assistance Besides other marks of distinction he wore a purple robe called laena and a conical mitre called apex Footnote seven Two powerful parties were contending at Rome for the supremacy Sylla being at the head of the faction of the nobles while Marius espoused the cause of the people Sylla suspected Julius Caesar of belonging to the Marian party because Marius had married his aunt Julia Footnote eight He wandered about for some time in the Sabine territory Footnote nine Bithynia in Asia Minor was bounded on the south by Phrygia on the west by the Bosphorus and Propontis and on the north by the Euxine sea Its boundaries towards the east are not clearly ascertained Strabo Pliny and Ptolemy differing from each other on the subject Footnote ten Mitylene was a city in the island of Lesbos famous for the study of philosophy and eloquence According to Pliny it remained a free city and in power one thousand five hundred years It suffered much in the Peloponnesian war from the Athenians and in the Mithridatic from the Romans by whom it was taken and destroyed But it soon rose again having recovered its ancient liberty by the favour of Pomnpey and was afterwards much embellished by Trajan who added to it the splendour of his own name This was the country of Pittacus one of the seven wise men of Greece as well as of Alcaeus and Sappho The natives showed a particular taste for poetry and had as Plutarch informs us stated times for the celebration of poetical contests Footnote eleven The civic crown was made of oak leaves and given to him who had saved the life of a citizen The person thus decorated wore it at public spectacles and sat next the senators When he entered the audience rose up as a mark of respect Footnote twelve A very extensive country of Hither Asia lying between Pamphylia to the west Mount Taurus and Amanus to the north Syria to the east and the Mediterranean to the south It was anciently famous for saffron and hair cloth called by the Romans ciliciun was the manufacture of this country Footnote thirteen A city and an island near the coast of Caria famous for the huge statue of the Sun called the Colossus The Rhodians were celebrated not only for skill in naval affairs but for learning philosophy and eloquence During the latter periods of the Roman republic and under some of the emperors numbers resorted there to prosecute their studies and it also became a place of retreat to discontented Romans Footnote fourteen Pharmacusa an island lying off the coast of Asia near Miletus It is now called Parmosa Footnote fifteen The ransom too large for Caesar s private means was raised by the voluntary contributions of the cities in the Asiatic province who were equally liberal from their public funds in the case of other Romans who fell into the hands of pirates at that period Footnote sixteen From Miletus as we are informed by Plutarch Footnote seventeen Who commanded in Spain Footnote eighteen Rex it will be easily understood was not a title of dignity in a Roman family but the surname of the Marcii Footnote nineteen The

Alexander the Great was only thirty three years at the time of his death Footnote twenty two The proper office of the master of the horse was to command the knights and execute the orders of the dictator He was usually nominated from amongst persons of consular and praetorian dignity and had the use of a horse which the dictator had not without the order of the people Footnote twenty three

insupportable tyranny Footnote twenty seven An honourable banishment Footnote twenty eight The assemblies of the people were at first held in the open Forum Afterwards a covered building called the Comitium was erected for that purpose There are no remains of it but Lumisden thinks that it probably stood on the south side of the Forum on the site of the present church of The Consolation Antiq of Rome p three hundred fifty seven Footnote twenty nine Basilicas from Basileus a king They were indeed the palaces of the sovereign people stately and spacious buildings with halls which served the purpose of exchanges council chambers and courts of justice Some of the Basilicas were afterwards converted into Christian churches The form was oblong the middle was an open space to walk in called Testudo and which we now call the nave On each side of this were rows of pillars which formed what we should call the side aisles and which the ancients called Porticus The end of the Testudo was curved like the apse of some of our churches and was called Tribunal from causes being heard there Hence the term Tribune is applied to that part of the Roman churches which is behind the high altar Burton s Antiq of Rome p two hundred four Footnote thirty Such as statues and pictures the works of Greek artists Footnote thirty one It appears to have stood at the foot of the Capitoline hill

Pollux Footnote thirty two Ptolemy Auletes the son of Cleopatra Footnote thirty three Lentulus Cethegus and others Footnote thirty four The temple of Jupiter Capitolinus was commenced and completed by the Tarquins kings of Rome but not dedicated till the year after their expulsion when that honour devolved on M Horatius Fulvillus the first of the consuls Having been burnt down during the civil wars A U C six hundred seventy Sylla restored it on the same foundations but did not live to consecrate it Footnote thirty five Meaning Pompey not so much for the sake of the office as having his name inserted in the inscription recording the repairs of the Capitol instead of Catulus The latter however secured the honour and his name is still seen inscribed in an apartment at the Capitol as its restorer Footnote thirty six It being the calends of January the first day of the year on which the magistrates solemnly entered on their offices surrounded by their friends Footnote thirty seven Among others one for recalling Pompey from Asia under the pretext that the commonwealth was in danger Cato was one of the colleagues who saw through the design and opposed the decree Footnote thirty eight See before p five This was in A U C six hundred ninety three Footnote thirty nine Plutarch informs us that Caesar before he came into office owed his creditors thirteen hundred talents somewhat more than five hundred sixty five thousand pounds of our money But his debts increased so much after this period if we may believe Appian that upon his departure for Spain at the expiration of his praetorship he is reported to have said Bis millies et quingenties centena minis sibi adesse oportere ut nihil haberet i e That he was two million and nearly twenty thousand sesterces worse than penniless Crassus became his security for eight hundred thirty talents about eight hundred seventy one thousand five hundred pounds Footnote forty For his victories in Gallicia and Lusitania having led his army to the shores of the ocean which had not before been reduced to submission Footnote forty one Caesar was placed in this dilemma that if he aspired to a triumph he must remain outside the walls until it took place while as a candidate for the consulship he must be resident in the city Footnote forty two Even the severe censor was biassed by political expediency to sanction a system under which what little remained of public virtue and the love of liberty at Rome were fast decaying The strict laws against bribery at elections were disregarded and it was practised openly and accepted without a blush Sallust says that everything was venal and that Rome itself might be bought if any one was rich enough to purchase it Jugurth viii twenty three Footnote forty three A U C six hundred ninety five Footnote forty four The proceedings of the senate were reported in short notes taken by one of their own order strangers not being admitted at their sittings These notes included speeches as well as acts These and the proceedings of the assemblies of the people were daily published in journals Footnote diurna which contained also accounts of the trials at law with miscellaneous intelligence of births and deaths marriages and divorces The practice of publishing the proceedings of the senate introduced by Julius Caesar was discontinued by Augustus Footnote forty five Within the city the lictors walked before only one of the consuls and that commonly for a month alternately A public officer called Accensus preceded the other consul and the lictors followed This custom had long been disused but was now restored by Caesar Footnote forty six In order that he might be a candidate for the tribuneship of the people it was done late in the evening at an unusual hour for public business Footnote forty seven Gaul was divided into two provinces Transalpine or Gallia Ulterior and Cisalpina or Citerior The Citerior having nearly the same limits as Lombardy in after times was properly a part of Italy occupied by colonists from Gaul and having the Rubicon the ancient boundary of Italy on the south It was also called Gallia Togata from the use of the Roman toga the inhabitants being after the social war admitted to the right of citizens The Gallia Transalpina or Ulterior was called Comata from the people wearing their hair long while the Romans wore it short and the southern part afterwards called Narbonensis came to have the epithet Braccata from the use of the braccae which were no part of the Roman dress Some writers suppose the braccae to have been breeches but Aldus in a short disquisition on the subject affirms that they were a kind of upper dress And this opinion seems to be countenanced by the name braccan being applied by the modern Celtic nations the descendants of the Gallic Celts to signify their upper garment or plaid Footnote forty eight Alluding probably to certain scandals of a gross character which were rife against Caesar See before c ii p two and see also c xlix Footnote forty nine So called from the feathers on their helmets resembling the crest of a lark Alauda Fr Alouette Footnote fifty Days

Roman Forum became too little for transacting it and could not be enlarged without clearing away the buildings with which it was surrounded Hence the enormous sum which its site is said to have cost amounting it is calculated to eight hundred nine thousand two hundred ninety one pounds of our money It stood near the old forum behind the temple of Romulus and Remus but not a vestige of it remains Footnote fifty five Comum was a town of the Orobii of ancient standing and formerly powerful Julius Caesar added to it five thousand new colonists whence it was generally called Novocomum But in time

was a very ancient law of the republic forbidding any general returning from the wars to cross the Rubicon with his troops under arms Footnote fifty nine The ring was worn on the finger next to the little finger of the left hand Footnote sixty Suetonius here accounts for the mistake of the soldiers with great probability The class to which they imagined they were to be promoted was that of the equites or knights who wore a gold ring and were possessed of property to the amount stated in the text Great as was the liberality of Caesar to his legions the performance of this imaginary promise was beyond all reasonable expectation Footnote sixty one A U C seven hundred six Footnote sixty two Elephants were first introduced at Rome by Pompey the Great in his African triumph Footnote sixty three VENI VIDI VICI Footnote sixty four A U C seven hundred eight Footnote sixty five Gladiators were first publicly exhibited at Rome by two brothers called Bruti at the funeral of their father A U C four hundred ninety and for some time they were exhibited only on such occasions But afterwards they were also employed by the magistrates to entertain the people particularly at the Saturnalia and feasts of Minerva These cruel spectacles were prohibited by Constantine but not entirely suppressed until the time of Honorius Footnote sixty six The Circensian games were shews exhibited in the Circus Maximus and consisted of various kinds first chariot and horse races of which the Romans were extravagantly fond The charioteers were distributed into four parties distinguished by the colour of their dress The spectators without regarding the speed of the horses or the skill of the men were attracted merely by one or the other of the colours as caprice inclined them In the time of Justinian no less than thirty thousand men lost their lives at Constantinople in a tumult raised by a contention amongst the partizans of the several colours Secondly contests of agility and strength of which there were five kinds hence called Pentathlum These were running leaping boxing wrestling and throwing the discus or quoit Thirdly Ludus Trojae a mock fight performed by young noblemen on horseback revived by Julius Caesar and frequently celebrated by the succeeding emperors We meet with a description of it in the fifth book of the Aeneid beginning with the following lines Incedunt pueri pariterque ante ora parentum Fraenatis lucent in equis quos omnis euntes Trinacriae mirata fremit Trojaeque juventus Fourthly Venatio which was the fighting of wild beasts with one another or with men called Bestiarii who were either forced to the combat by way of punishment as the primitive Christians were or fought voluntarily either from a natural ferocity of disposition or induced by hire An incredible number of animals of various kinds were brought from all quarters at a prodigious expense for the entertainment of the people Pompey in his second consulship exhibited at once five hundred lions which were all dispatched in five days also eighteen elephants Fifthly the representation of a horse and foot battle with that of an encampment or a siege Sixthly the representation of a sea fight Naumachia which was at first made in the Circus Maximus but afterwards elsewhere The combatants were usually captives or condemned malefactors who fought to death unless saved by the clemency of the emperor If any thing unlucky happened at the games they were renewed and often more than once Footnote sixty seven A meadow beyond the Tiber in which an excavation was made supplied with water from the river Footnote sixty eight Julius Caesar was assisted by Sosigenes an Egyptian philosopher in correcting the calendar For this purpose he introduced an additional day every fourth year making February to consist of twenty nine days instead of twenty eight and of course the whole year to consist of three hundred and sixty six days The fourth year was denominated Bissextile or leap year because the sixth day before the calends or first of March was reckoned twice The Julian year was introduced throughout the Roman empire and continued in general use till the year fifteen eighty two But the true correction was not six hours but five hours forty nine minutes hence the addition was too great by eleven minutes This small fraction would amount in one hundred years to three fourths of a day and in a thousand years to more than seven days It had in fact amounted since the Julian correction in fifteen eighty two to more than seven days Pope Gregory XIII therefore again reformed the calendar first bringing forward the year ten days by reckoning the fifth of October the fifteenth and then prescribing the rule which has gradually been adopted throughout Christendom except in Russia and the Greek church generally Footnote sixty nine Principally Carthage and Corinth Footnote seventy The Latus Clavus was a broad stripe of purple on the front of the toga Its width distinguished it from that of the knights who wore it narrow Footnote seventy one The Suburra lay between the Celian and Esquiline hills It was one of the most frequented quarters of Rome Footnote

asparagus Every traveller knows that in those climates oil takes the place of butter as an ingredient in cookery and it needs no experience to fancy what it is when rancid Footnote seventy nine Meritoria rheda a light four wheeled carriage apparently hired either for the journey or from town to town They were tolerably commodious for Cicero writes to Atticus v seventeen Hanc epistolam dictavi sedens in rheda cum in castra proficiscerer Footnote eighty Plutarch informs us that Caesar travelled with such expedition that he reached the Rhone on the eighth day after he left Rome Footnote eighty one Caesar tells us himself that he employed C Volusenus to reconnoitre the coast of Britain sending him forward in a long ship with orders to return and make his report before the expedition sailed Footnote eighty two Religione that is the omens being unfavourable Footnote eighty three The standard of the Roman legions was an eagle fixed on the head of a spear It was silver small in size with expanded wings and clutching a golden thunderbolt in its claw Footnote eighty four To save them from the torture of a lingering death Footnote eighty five Now Lerida in Catalonia Footnote eighty six The title of emperor was not new in Roman history one It was sometimes given by the acclamations of the soldiers to those who commanded them two It was synonymous with conqueror and the troops hailed him by that title after a victory In both these cases it was merely titular and not permanent and was generally written after the proper name as Cicero imperator Lentulo imperatore three It assumed a permanent and royal character first in the person of Julius Caesar and was then generally prefixed to the emperor s name in inscriptions as IMP CAESAR DIVI et cetera Footnote eighty seven Cicero was the first who received the honour of being called Pater patriae Footnote eighty eight Statues were placed in the Capitol of each of the seven kings of Rome to which an eighth was added in honour of Brutus who expelled the last The statue of Julius Caesar was afterwards raised near them Footnote eighty nine The white fillet was one of the insignia of royalty Plutarch on this occasion uses the expression diadaemati basiliko a royal diadem Footnote ninety The Lupercalia was a festival celebrated in a place called the Lupercal in the month of February in honour of Pan During the solemnity the Luperci or priests of that god ran up and down the city naked with only a girdle of goat s skin round their waist and thongs of the same in their hands with which they struck those they met particularly married women who were thence supposed to be rendered prolific Footnote ninety one Persons appointed to inspect and expound the Sibylline books Footnote ninety two A

Pompey spoliis Orientis Onustus to the magnificent theatre which he built A U C six hundred ninety eight in his second consulship His statue at the foot of which Caesar fell as Plutarch tells us was placed in it We shall find that Augustus caused it to be removed Footnote ninety five The stylus or graphium was an iron pen broad at one end with a sharp point at the other used for writing upon waxen tables the leaves or bark of trees plates of brass or lead et cetera For writing upon paper or parchment the Romans employed a reed sharpened and split in the point like our pens called calamus arundo or canna This they dipped in the black liquor emitted by the cuttle fish which served for ink Footnote ninety six It was customary among the ancients in great extremities to shroud the face in order to conceal any symptoms of horror or alarm which the countenance might express The skirt of the toga was drawn round the lower extremities that there might be no exposure in falling as the Romans at this period wore no covering for the thighs and legs Footnote ninety seven Caesar s dying apostrophe to Brutus is represented in all the editions of Suetonius as uttered in Greek but with some variations The words as here translated are Kai su ei ekeinon kai su teknon The Salmasian manuscript omits the latter clause Some commentators suppose that the words my son were not merely expressive of the difference of age or former familiarity between them but an avowal that Brutus was the fruit of the connection between Julius and Servilia mentioned before see p thirty three But it appears very improbable that Caesar who had never before acknowledged Brutus to be his son should make so unnecessary an avowal at the moment of his death Exclusively of this objection the apostrophe seems too verbose both for the suddenness and urgency of the occasion But this is not all Can we suppose that Caesar though a perfect master of Greek would at such a time have expressed himself in that language rather than in Latin his familiar tongue and in which he spoke with peculiar elegance Upon the whole the probability is that the words uttered by Caesar were Et tu Brute which while equally expressive of astonishment with the other version and even of tenderness are both more natural and more emphatic Footnote ninety eight Men me servasse ut essent qui me perderent Footnote ninety nine The Bulla generally made of gold was a hollow globe which boys wore upon their breast pendant from a string or ribbon put round the neck The sons of freedmen and poor citizens used globes

the four regions into which the city was divided from the time of Servius Tullius the sixth king of Rome to that of Augustus the others being the Suburra Esquilina and Collina Footnote one hundred twelve There were seven streets or quarters in the Palatine region one of which was called Ad Capita Bubula either from the butchers stalls at which ox heads are hung up for sale or from their being

their wars only in cases of great emergency and with much reluctance After the great slaughter at the battle of Cannae eight thousand were bought and armed by the republic Augustus was the first who manumitted them and employed them as rowers in his gallies Footnote one hundred twenty four In the triumvirate consisting of Augustus Mark Antony and Lepidus Footnote one hundred twenty five A U C seven hundred twenty three Footnote one hundred twenty six There is no other authority for Augustus having viewed Antony s corpse Plutarch informs us that on hearing his death Augustus retired into the interior of his tent and wept over the fate of his colleague and friend his associate in so many former struggles both in war and the administration of affairs Footnote one hundred twenty seven The poison proved fatal as every one knows see Velleius ii twenty seven Florus iv eleven The Psylli were a people of Africa celebrated for sucking the poison from wounds inflicted by serpents with which that country anciently abounded They pretended to be endowed with an antidote which rendered their bodies insensible to the virulence of that species of poison and the ignorance of those times gave credit to the physical immunity which they arrogated But Celsus who flourished about fifty years after the period we speak of has exploded the vulgar prejudice which prevailed in their favour He justly observes that the venom of serpents like some other kinds of poison proves noxious only when applied to the naked fibre and that provided there is no ulcer in the gums or palate the poison may be received into the mouth with perfect safety Footnote one hundred twenty eight Strabo informs us that Ptolemy caused it to be deposited in a golden sarcophagus which was afterwards exchanged for one

candidates to endeavour to gain popularity by the usual arts They would therefore go to the houses of the citizens shake hands with those they met and address them in a kindly manner It being of great consequence upon those occasions to know the names of persons they were commonly attended by a nomenclator who whispered into their ears that information wherever it was wanted Though this kind of officer was generally an attendant on men we meet with instances of their having been likewise employed in the service of ladies either with the view of serving candidates to whom they were allied or of gaining the affections of the people Footnote one hundred thirty five Not a bridge over a river but a military engine used for gaining admittance into a fortress Footnote one hundred thirty six

Philippi It stood in the Forum which he built mentioned in chap xxxix There are no remains of either Footnote one hundred forty one The Ovatio was an inferior kind of Triumph granted in cases where the victory was not of great importance or had been obtained without difficulty The general entered the city on foot or on horseback crowned with myrtle not with laurel and instead of bullocks the sacrifice was performed with a sheep whence this procession acquired its name Thomson Footnote one hundred forty two The greater Triumph in which the victorious general and his army advanced in solemn procession through the city to the Capitol was the highest military honour which could be obtained in the Roman state Foremost in the procession went musicians of various kinds singing and playing triumphal songs Next were led the oxen to be sacrificed having their horns gilt and their heads adorned with fillets and garlands Then in carriages were brought the spoils taken from the enemy statues pictures plate armour gold and silver and brass with golden crowns and other gifts sent by the allied and tributary states The captive princes and generals followed in chains with their children and attendants After them came the lictors having their fasces wreathed with laurel followed by a great company of musicians and dancers dressed like Satyrs and wearing crowns of gold in the midst of whom was one in a female dress whose business it was with his looks and gestures to insult the vanquished Next followed a long train of persons carrying perfumes Then came the victorious general dressed in purple embroidered with gold with a crown of laurel on his head a branch of laurel in his right hand and in his left an ivory sceptre with an eagle on the top having his face painted with vermilion in the same manner as the statue of Jupiter on festival days and a golden Bulla hanging on his breast and containing some amulet or magical preservative against envy He stood in a gilded chariot adorned with ivory and drawn by four white horses sometimes by elephants attended by his relations and a great crowd of citizens all in white His children used to ride in the chariot with him and that he might not be too much elated a slave carrying a golden crown sparkling with gems stood behind him and frequently whispered in his ear Remember that thou art a man After the general followed the consuls and senators on foot at least according to the appointment of Augustus for they formerly used to go before him His Legati and military Tribunes commonly rode by his side The victorious army horse and foot came last crowned with laurel and decorated with the gifts which they had received for their valour singing their own and their general s praises but sometimes throwing out railleries against him and often exclaiming Io Triumphe in which they were joined by all the citizens as they passed along The oxen having been sacrificed the general gave a magnificent entertainment in the Capitol to his friends and the chief men of the city after which he was conducted home by the people with music and a great number of lamps and torches Thomson Footnote one hundred forty three The Sella Curulis was a chair on which the principal magistrates sat in the tribunal upon solemn occasions It had no back but stood on four crooked feet fixed to the extremities of cross pieces of wood joined by a common axis somewhat in the form of the letter X was covered with leather and inlaid with ivory From its construction it might be occasionally folded together for the convenience of

Lustrum was a period of five years at the end of which the census of the people was taken It was first made by the Roman kings then by the consuls but after the year three hundred ten from the building of the city by the censors who were magistrates created for that purpose It appears however that the census was not always held at stated periods and sometimes long intervals intervened Footnote one hundred forty eight Augustus appears to have been in earnest on these occasions at least in his desire to retire into private life and release himself from the cares of government if we may believe Seneca De Brev Vit c five Of his two intimate advisers Agrippa gave this counsel while Mecaenas was for continuing his career of ambition Eutrop one fifty three Footnote one hundred forty nine The Tiber has been always remarkable for the frequency of its inundations and the ravages they occasioned as remarked by Pliny iii five Livy mentions several such occurrences as well as one extensive fire which destroyed great part of the city Footnote one hundred fifty The well known saying of Augustus recorded by Suetonius that he found a city of bricks but left it of marble has another version given it by Dio who applies it to his consolidation of the government to the following effect That Rome which I found built of mud I shall leave you firm as a rock Dio lvi p five hundred eighty nine Footnote one hundred fifty one The same motive which engaged Julius Caesar to build a new forum induced Augustus to erect another See his life c xx It stood behind the present churches of saint Adrian and saint Luke and was almost parallel with the public forum but there are no traces of it remaining The temple of Mars Ultor adjoining has been mentioned before p eighty four Footnote one hundred fifty two The temple of the Palatine Apollo stood according to Bianchini a little beyond the triumphal arch of Titus It appears from the reverse of a medal of Augustus to have been a rotondo with an open portico something like the temple of Vesta The statues of the fifty daughters of Danae surrounded the portico and opposite to them were their husbands on horseback In this temple were preserved some of the finest works of the Greek artists both in sculpture and painting Here in the presence of Augustus Horace s Carmen Seculare was sung by twenty seven noble youths and as many virgins And here as our author informs us Augustus towards the end of his reign often assembled the senate Footnote one hundred fifty three The library adjoined the temple and was under the protection of Apollo Caius Julius Hegenus a freedman of Augustus and an eminent grammarian was the librarian Footnote one hundred fifty four The three fluted Corinthian columns of white marble which stand on the declivity of the Capitoline hill are commonly supposed to be the remains of the temple of Jupiter Tonans erected by Augustus Part of the frieze and cornice are attached to them which with the capitals of the columns are finely wrought Suetonius tells us on what occasion this temple was erected Of all the epithets given to Jupiter none conveyed more terror to superstitious minds than that of the Thunderer Coelo tonantem credidimus Jovem Regnare Hor one iii Ode five We shall find this temple mentioned again in c xci of the life of Augustus Footnote one hundred fifty five The Portico of Octavia stood between the Flaminian circus and the theatre of Marcellus enclosing the temples of Jupiter and Juno said to have been built in the time of the republic Several remains of them exist in the Pescheria or fish market they were of the Corinthian order and have been traced and engraved by Piranesi Footnote one hundred fifty six The magnificent theatre of Marcellus was built on the site where Suetonius has before informed us that Julius Caesar intended to erect one p thirty It stood between the portico of Octavia and the hill of the Capitol Augustus gave it the name of his nephew Marcellus though he was then dead Its ruins are still to be seen in the Piazza Montanara where the Orsini family have a palace erected on the site Footnote one hundred fifty seven The theatre of Balbus was the third of the three permanent theatres of Rome Those of Pompey and Marcellus have been already mentioned Footnote one hundred fifty eight Among these were at least the noble portico if not the whole of the Pantheon still the pride of Rome under the name of the Rotondo on the frieze of which may be seen the inscription M AGRIPPA L F COS TERTIUM FECIT Agrippa also built the temple of Neptune and the portico of the Argonauts Footnote one hundred fifty nine To whatever extent Augustus may have cleared out the bed of the Tiber the process of its being encumbered with an alluvium of ruins and mud has been constantly going on Not many years ago a scheme was set on foot for clearing it by private enterprise principally for the sake of the valuable remains of art which it is supposed to contain Footnote one hundred sixty The Via Flaminia was probably undertaken by the censor Caius Flaminius and finished by his son of the same name who was consul A U C five hundred sixty six and employed his soldiers in forming it after subduing the Ligurians It led from the Flumentan gate now the Porta del Popolo through Etruria and Umbria into the Cisalpine Gaul ending at Ariminum the frontier town of the territories of the republic now Rimini on the Adriatic and is travelled by every tourist who takes the route north of the Appenines through the States of the Church to Rome Every one knows that the great highways not only in Italy but in the provinces were among the most magnificent and enduring works of the Roman people Footnote one hundred sixty one It had formed a sort of honourable retirement in which Lepidus was shelved to use a familiar expression when Augustus got rid of him quietly from the Triumvirate Augustus assumed it A U C seven hundred forty thus centring the last of all the great offices of the state in his own person that of Pontifex Maximus being of high importance from the sanctity attached to it and the influence it gave him over the

See JULIUS c xl Footnote one hundred sixty three Sextilis the sixth month reckoning from March in which the year of Romulus commenced Footnote one hundred sixty four So Cicero called the day on which he returned from exile the day of his nativity and his new birth paligennesian a word which had afterwards a theological sense from its use in the New Testament Footnote one hundred sixty five Capi There is a peculiar force in the word here adopted by Suetonius the form used by the Pontifex Maximus when he took the novice from the hand of her father being Te capio amata I have you my dear implying the forcible breach of former ties as in the case of a captive taken in war Footnote one hundred sixty six At times when the temple of Janus was shut and then only certain divinations were made preparatory to solemn supplication for the public health as if says Dio even that could not be implored from the gods unless the signs were propitious It would be an inquiry of some interest now that the care of the public health is becoming a department of the state with what sanatory measures these becoming solemnities were attended Footnote one hundred sixty seven Theophrastus mentions the spring and summer flowers most suited for these chaplets Among the former were hyacinths roses and white violets among the latter lychinis amaryllis iris and some species of lilies Footnote one hundred sixty eight Ergastulis These were subterranean strong rooms with narrow windows like dungeons in the country houses where incorrigible slaves were confined in fetters in the intervals of the severe tasks in grinding at the hand mills quarrying stones drawing water and other hard agricultural labour in which they were employed Footnote one hundred sixty nine These months were not only the Long Vacation of the lawyers but during them there was a general cessation of business at Rome the calendar exhibiting a constant succession of festivals The month of December in particular was devoted to pleasure and relaxation Footnote one hundred seventy Causes are mentioned the hearing of which was so protracted that lights were required in the court and sometimes they lasted we are told as long as eleven or twelve days Footnote one hundred seventy one Orcini They were also called Charonites the point of the sarcasm being that they owed their elevation to a dead man one who was gone to Orcus namely Julius Caesar after whose death Mark Antony introduced into the senate many persons of low rank who were designated for that honour in a document left by the deceased emperor Footnote one hundred seventy two Cordus Cremutius wrote a History of the Civil Wars and the Times of Augustus as we are informed by Dio six fifty two Footnote one hundred seventy three In front of the

Italy it begins in September and in the worst aspects the grapes are generally cleared before the end of October In elevated districts they hung on the trees as we have witnessed till the month of November Footnote one hundred seventy six Julius Caesar had introduced the contrary practice See JULIUS c xx Footnote one hundred seventy seven A U C three hundred twelve two magistrates were created under the name of Censors whose office at first was to take an account of the number of the people and the value of their estates Power was afterwards granted them to inspect the morals of the people and from this period the office became of great importance After Sylla the election of censors was intermitted for about seventeen years Under the emperors the office of censor was abolished but the chief functions of it were exercised by the emperors themselves and frequently both with caprice and severity Footnote one hundred seventy eight Young men until they were seventeen years of age and young women until they were married wore a white robe bordered with purple called Toga Praetexta The former when they had completed this period laid aside the dress of minority and assumed the Toga Virilis or manly habit The ceremony of changing the Toga was performed with great solemnity before the images of the Lares to whom the Bulla was consecrated On this occasion they went either to the Capitol or to some temple to pay their devotions to the Gods Footnote one hundred seventy nine Transvectio a procession of the equestrian order which they made with great splendour through the city every year on the fifteenth of July They rode on horseback from the temple of Honour or of Mars without the city to the Capitol with wreaths of olive on their heads dressed in robes of scarlet and bearing in their hands the military ornaments which they had received from their general as a reward of their valour The knights rode up to the censor seated on his curule chair in front of the Capitol and dismounting led their horses in review before him If any of the knights was corrupt in his morals had diminished his fortune below the legal standard or even had not taken proper care of his horse the censor ordered him to sell his horse by which he was considered as degraded from the equestrian order Footnote one hundred eighty Pugillaria were a kind of pocket book so called because memorandums were written or impinged by the styli on their waxed surface They appear to have been of very ancient origin for we read of them in Homer under the name of pinokes II z one hundred sixty

academical dress or officers in garrisons out of their regimentals Footnote one hundred eighty two Aen i one hundred eighty six Footnote one hundred eighty three It is hardly necessary to direct the careful reader s attention to views of political economy so worthy of an enlightened prince But it was easier to make the Roman people wear the toga than to forego the cry of Panem et Circenses Footnote one hundred eighty four Septa were enclosures made with boards commonly for the purpose of distributing the people into distinct classes and erected occasionally like our hustings Footnote one hundred eighty five The Thensa was a splendid carriage with four wheels and four horses adorned with ivory and silver in which at the Circensian games the images of the gods were drawn in solemn procession from their shrines to a place in the circus called the Pulvinar where couches were prepared for their reception It received its name from thongs lora tensa stretched before it and was attended in the procession by persons of the first rank in their most magnificent apparel The attendants took delight in putting their hands to the traces and if a boy happened to let go the thong which he held it was an indispensable rule that the procession should be renewed Footnote one hundred eighty six The Cavea was the name of the whole of that part of the theatre where the spectators

hundred more who were called Patres minorum gentium those created by Romulus being distinguished by the name of Patres majorum gentium Those who were chosen into the senate by Brutus after the expulsion of Tarquin the Proud to supply the place of those whom that king had slain were called Conscripti i e persons written or enrolled among the old senators who alone were properly styled Patres Hence arose the custom of summoning to the senate those who were Patres and those who were Conscripti and hence also was applied to the senators in general the designation of Patres Conscripti the particle et and being understood to connect the two classes of senators In the time of Julius Caesar the number of senators was increased to nine hundred and after his death to a thousand many

sixty one Footnote two hundred eight Cybele Gallus was either the name of a river in Phrygia supposed to cause a certain frenzy in those who drank of its waters or the proper name of the first priest of Cybele Footnote two hundred nine A small drum beat by the finger or thumb was used by the priests of Cybele in their lascivious rites and in other orgies of a similar description These drums were made of inflated skin circular in shape so that they had some resemblance to the orb which in the statues of the emperor he is represented as holding in his hand The populace with the coarse humour which was permitted to vent itself freely at the spectacles did not hesitate to apply what was said in the play of the lewd priest of Cybele to Augustus in reference to the scandals attached to his private character The word cinaedus translated wanton might have been rendered by a word in vulgar use the coarsest in the English language and there is probably still more in the allusion too indelicate to be dwelt upon Footnote two hundred ten Mark Antony makes use of fondling diminutives of the names of Tertia Terentia and Rufa some of Augustus s favourites Footnote two hundred eleven

thus at liberty and the left supported a flap of the toga which was drawn up and thrown back over the left shoulder forming what is called the Sinus a fold or cavity upon the breast in which things might be carried and with which the face or head might be occasionally covered When a person did any work he tucked up his toga and girt it round him The toga of the rich and noble was finer and larger than that of others and a new toga was called Pexa None but Roman citizens were permitted to wear the toga and banished persons were prohibited the use of it The colour of the toga was white The clavus was a purple border by which the senators and other orders with the magistrates were distinguished the breadth of the stripe corresponding with their rank Footnote two hundred twenty five

known in some places as Adam s fig We have gathered them in those climates of the latter crop as late as the month of November Footnote two hundred twenty eight Sabbatis Jejunium Augustus might have been better informed of the Jewish rites from his familiarity with Herod and others for it is certain that their sabbath was not a day of fasting Justin however fell into the same error he says that Moses appointed the sabbath day to be kept for ever by the Jews as a fast in memory of their fasting for seven days in the deserts of Arabia xxxvi two fourteen But we find that there was a weekly fast among the Jews which is perhaps what is here meant the Sabbatis Jejunium being equivalent to the Naesteuo dis tou sabbatou I fast twice in the week of the Pharisee in saint Luke xviii twelve Footnote

Feminalibus et tibialibus Neither the ancient Romans or the Greeks wore breeches trews or trowsers which they despised as barbarian articles of dress The coverings here mentioned were swathings for the legs and thighs used mostly in cases of sickness or infirmity and when otherwise worn reckoned effeminate But soon after the Romans became acquainted with the German and Celtic nations the habit of covering the lower extremities barbarous as it had been held was generally adopted Footnote two hundred thirty five Albula On the left of the road to Tivoli near the ruins of Adrian s villa The

was derived from the Egyptians Thomson A fact if well founded of some importance Footnote two hundred forty six The Romans divided their months into calends nones and ides The first day of the month was the calends of that month whence they reckoned backwards distinguishing the time by the day before the calends the second day before the calends and so on to the ides of the preceding month In eight months of the year the nones were the fifth day and the ides the thirteenth but in March May July and October the nones fell on the seventh and the ides on the fifteenth From the nones they reckoned backwards to the calends as they also did from the ides to the nones Ib Footnote two hundred forty seven The early Christians shared with the Jews the aversion of the Romans to their religion more than that of others arising probably from its monotheistic and exclusive character But we find from Josephus and Philo that Augustus was in other respects favourable to the Jews Footnote two

holding an assembly of the people for reviewing his army in the plain near the lake of Capra a storm suddenly rose attended with great thunder and lightning and enveloped the king in so dense a mist that it took all sight of him from the assembly Nor was Romulus after this seen on earth The consternation being at length over and fine clear weather succeeding so turbulent a day when the Roman youth saw the royal seat empty though they readily believed the Fathers who had stood nearest him that he was carried aloft by the storm yet struck with the dread as it were of orphanage they preserved a sorrowful silence for a considerable time Then a commencement having been made by a few the whole multitude salute Romulus a god son of a god the king and parent of the Roman city they implore his favour with prayers that he would be pleased always propitiously to preserve his own offspring I believe that even then there were some who silently surmised that the king had been torn in pieces by the hands of the Fathers for this rumour also spread but was not credited their admiration of the man and the consternation felt at the moment attached importance to the other report By the contrivance also of one individual additional credit is said to have been gained to the matter For Proculus Julius whilst the state was still troubled with regret for the king and felt incensed against the senators a person of weight as we are told in any matter however important comes forward to the assembly Romans he said Romulus the father of this city suddenly descending from heaven appeared to me this day at day break While I stood covered with awe and filled with a religious dread beseeching him to allow me to see him face to face he said Go tell the Romans that the gods do will that my Rome should become the capital of the world Therefore let them cultivate the art of war and let them know and hand down to posterity that no human power shall be able to withstand the Roman arms Having said this he ascended up to heaven It is surprising what credit was given to the man on his making this announcement and how much the regret of the common people and army for the loss of Romulus was assuaged upon the assurance of his immortality Footnote two hundred seventy two Padua Footnote two hundred seventy three Commentators seem to have given an erroneous and unbecoming sense to Cicero s exclamation when they suppose that the object understood as connected with altera related to himself Hope is never applied in this signification but to a young person of whom something good or great is expected and accordingly Virgil who adopted the expression has very properly applied it to Ascanius Et juxta Ascanius magmae spes altera Romae Aeneid xii And by his side Ascanius took his place The second hope of Rome s immortal race Cicero at the time when he could have heard a specimen of Virgil s Eclogues must have been near his grand climacteric besides that his virtues and talents had long been conspicuous and were past the state of hope It is probable therefore that altera referred to some third person spoken of immediately before as one who promised to do honour to his country It might refer to Octavius of whom Cicero at this time entertained a high opinion or it may have been spoken in an absolute manner without reference to any person Footnote two

on one of the mouths of the Danube about sixty five miles E N E from Silistria The neighbouring bay of the Black Sea is still called the Gulf of Baba Footnote two hundred eighty three It appears to me

privilege that individuals who had deserved well of the state and certain distinguished families were permitted to have tombs within the city Footnote two hundred eighty five Among the Romans all the descendants from one common stock were called Gentiles being of the same race or kindred however remote The Gens as they termed this general relation or clanship was subdivided into families in Familias vel Stirpes and those of the same family were called Agnati Relations by the father s side were also called Agnati to distinguish them from Cognati relations only by the mother s side An Agnatus might also be called Cognatus but not the contrary To mark the different gentes and familiae and to distinguish the individuals of the same family the Romans had commonly three names the Praenomen Nomen and Cognomen The praenomen was put first and marked the individual It was usually written with one letter as A for Aulus C Caius D Decimus sometimes with two letters as Ap for Appius Cn Cneius and sometimes with three as Mam for Mamercus The Nomen was put after the Praenomen and marked the gens It commonly ended in ius as Julius Tullius Cornelius The Cognomen was put last and marked the familia as Cicero Caesar et cetera Some gentes appear to have had no surname as the Marian and gens and familia seem sometimes to be put one for the other as the Fabia gens or Fabia familia Sometimes there was a fourth name properly called the Agnomen but sometimes likewise Cognomen which was added on account of some illustrious action or remarkable event Thus Scipio was named Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus from the conquest of Carthage In the same manner his brother was called Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus Thus also Quintus Fabius Maximus received the Agnomen of Cunctator

continued for upwards of twelve miles After this both were conveyed under ground but at the distance of six miles from the city they were united and carried upon arches all the rest of the way This is

net with which he attempted to entangle his adversary by casting it over his head and suddenly drawing it together when with his trident he usually slew him But if he missed his aim by throwing the net either too short or too far he instantly betook himself to flight and endeavoured to prepare his net for a second cast His antagonist in the mean time pursued to prevent his design by dispatching

higher position than a concubine but for some reason could not acquire the legal rights of a wife as in the case of slaves of either sex A man of rank also could not marry a slave or a freedwoman however much he might be attached to her Footnote seven hundred thirty two Nearly the same phrases are applied by Suetonius to Drusilla see CALIGULA c xxiv and to Marcella the concubine of Commodus by Herodian I xvi nine where he says that she had all the honours of an empress except that the incense was not offered to her These connections resembled the left hand marriages of the German princes

gained by his lieutenant Agricola Vespasian s own conquests while he served in Britain were principally in the territories of the Brigantes lying north of the Humber and including the present counties of York and Durham Footnote seven hundred thirty four A U C eight hundred four Footnote seven hundred thirty five Tacitus Hist V xiii three mentions this ancient prediction and its currency through the East in nearly the same terms as Suetonius The coming power is in both instances described in the plural number profecti those shall come forth and Tacitus applies it to Titus as well as Vespasian The prophecy is commonly supposed to have reference to a passage in Micah v two Out of thee Bethlehem Ephrata shall He come forth to be ruler in Israel Earlier prophetic intimations of a similar character and pointing to a more extended dominion have been traced in the sacred records of the Jews and there is reason to believe that these books were at this time not unknown in the heathen world particularly at Alexandria and through the Septuagint version These predictions in their literal sense point to the establishment of a universal monarchy which should take its rise in Judaea The Jews looked for their accomplishment in the person of one of their own nation the expected Messiah to which character there were many pretenders in those times The first disciples of Christ during the whole period of his ministry supposed that they were to be fulfilled in him The Romans thought that the conditions were answered by Vespasian and Titus having been called from Judaea to the seat of empire The expectations entertained by the Jews and naturally participated in and appropriated by the first converts to Christianity having proved groundless the prophecies were subsequently interpreted in a spiritual sense Footnote seven hundred thirty six Gessius Florus was at that time governor of Judaea with the title and rank of prepositus it not being a proconsular province as the

mentioned hereafter c vii predicted his success from an inspection of the entrails Footnote seven hundred forty one Josephus the celebrated Jewish historian who was engaged in these wars having been taken prisoner was confined in the dungeon at Jotapata the castle referred to in the preceding chapter before which Vespasian was wounded De Bell cxi fourteen Footnote seven hundred forty two The

our author after his apotheosis Divus Julius Footnote seven hundred forty four The battle at Bedriacum secured the Empire for Vitellius See OTHO c ix VITELLIUS c x Footnote seven hundred forty five Alexandria may well be called the key claustra of Egypt which was the granary of Rome It was of the first importance that Vespasian should secure it at this juncture Footnote seven hundred forty six Tacitus describes Basilides as a man of rank among the Egyptians and he appears also to have been a priest as we find him officiating at Mount Carmel c v This is so incompatible with his being a Roman freedman that commentators concur in supposing that the word libertus although found in all the copies now extant has crept into the text by some inadvertence of an early transcriber Basilides appears like Philo Judaeus who lived about the same period to have been half Greek half Jew and to have belonged to the celebrated Platonic school of Alexandria Footnote seven hundred forty seven Tacitus informs us that Vespasian himself believed Basilides to have been at this time not only in an infirm state of health but at the distance of several days journey from Alexandria But for his greater satisfaction he strictly examined the priests whether Basilides had entered the temple on that day he made inquiries of all he met whether he had been seen in the city nay further he dispatched messengers on horseback who ascertained that at the time specified Basilides was more than eighty miles from Alexandria Then Vespasian comprehended that the appearance of Basilides and the answer to his prayers given through him were by divine interposition Tacit Hist iv eighty two two Footnote seven hundred forty eight The account given by Tacitus of the miracles of Vespasian is fuller than that of Suetonius but does not materially vary in the details except that in his version of the story he describes the impotent man to be lame in the hand instead of the leg or the knee and adds an important circumstance in the case of the blind man that he was notus tabe occulorum notorious for the disease in his eyes He also winds up the narrative with the following statement They who were present relate both these cures even at this time when there is nothing to be gained by lying Both the historians lived within a few years of the occurrence but their works were not published until advanced periods of their lives The closing remark of Tacitus seems to indicate that at least he did not entirely discredit the account and as for Suetonius his pages are as full of prodigies of all descriptions related apparently in all good faith as a monkish chronicle of the Middle Ages The story has the more interest as it is one of the examples of successful imposture selected by Hume in his Essay on Miracles with the reply to which by Paley in his Evidences of Christianity most readers are familiar The commentators on Suetonius agree with Paley in considering the whole affair as a juggle between the priests the patients and probably the emperor But what will perhaps strike the reader as most remarkable is the singular coincidence of the story with the accounts given of several of the miracles of Christ whence it has been supposed that the scene was planned in imitation of them It did not fall within the scope of doctor Paley s argument to advert to this and our own brief illustration must be strictly confined within the limits of historical disquisition Adhering to this principle we may point out that if the idea of plagiarism be accepted it receives some confirmation from the incident related by our author in a preceding paragraph forming it may be considered another scene of the same drama where we find Basilides appearing to Vespasian in the temple of Serapis under circumstances which cannot fail to remind us of Christ s suddenly standing in the midst of his disciples when the doors were shut This incident also has very much the appearance of a parody on the evangelical history But if the striking similarity of the two narratives be thus accounted for it is remarkable that while the priests of Alexandria or perhaps Vespasian himself from his residence in Judaea were in possession of such exact details of two of Christ s miracles if not of a third striking incident in his history we should find not the most distant allusion in the works of such cotemporary writers as Tacitus and Suetonius to any one of the still more stupendous occurrences which had recently taken place in a part of the world with which the Romans had now very intimate relations The character of these authors induces us to hesitate in adopting the notion that either contempt or disbelief would have led them to pass over such events as altogether unworthy of notice and the only other inference from their silence is that they had never heard of them But as this can scarcely be reconciled with the plagiarism attributed to Vespasian or the Egyptian priests it is safer to conclude that the coincidence however singular was merely fortuitous It may be added that Spartianus who wrote the lives of Adrian and succeeding emperors gives an account of a similar miracle performed by that prince in healing a blind man Footnote seven hundred forty nine A U C eight hundred twenty three eight hundred thirty three excepting eight hundred twenty six and eight

towards the end of the reign of Commodus in the year one hundred ninety one It stood in the Forum where some ruins on a prodigious scale still remaining were traditionally considered to be those of the Temple of Peace until Piranesi contended that they are part of Nero s Golden House Others suppose that they are the remains of a Basilica A beautiful fluted Corinthian column forty seven feet high

consists of four stories of the three orders of architecture the Corinthian being repeated in the two highest Some of the bas reliefs still in good preservation represent the table of the shew bread the seven branched golden candlestick the vessel of incense and the silver trumpets which were taken by Titus from the Temple at Jerusalem and with the book of the law the veil of the temple and other spoils were carried in the triumph The fate of these sacred relics is rather interesting Josephus says that the veil and books of the law were deposited in the Palatium and the rest of the spoils in the Temple of Peace When that was burnt in the reign of Commodus these treasures were saved and they were afterwards carried off by Genseric to Africa Belisarius recovered them and brought them to Constantinople A D five hundred twenty Procopius informs us that a Jew who saw them told an acquaintance of the emperor that it would not be advisable to carry them to the palace at Constantinople as they could not remain anywhere else but where Solomon had placed them This he said was the reason why Genseric had taken the Palace at Rome and the Roman army had in turn taken that of the Vandal

shield herself from the charge of incest she prevailed on Polemon king of Cilicia to submit to be circumcised become a Jew and marry her That union also proving unfortunate she appears to have returned to Jerusalem and having attracted Vespasian by magnificent gifts and the young Titus by her extraordinary beauty she followed them to Rome after the termination of the Jewish war and had apartments in the palace where she lived with Titus to all appearance as his wife as Xiphilinus informs us and there seems no doubt that he would have married her but for the strong prejudices of the

Titus at the dedication of the Colosseum here mentioned by Suetonius seems to have been the largest ever made Xiphilinus even adds to the number and says that including wild boars cranes and other animals no less than nine thousand were killed In the reigns of succeeding emperors a new feature was given to these spectacles the Circus being converted into a temporary forest by planting large trees in which wild animals were turned loose and the people were allowed to enter the wood and take what they pleased In this instance the game consisted principally of beasts of chase and on one occasion one thousand stags as many of the ibex wild sheep mouflions from Sardinia and other grazing animals besides one thousand wild boars and as many ostriches were turned loose by the emperor

of Flavius Clemens c xv both of whom were condemned by Domitian for their impiety by which it is probably meant that they were suspected of favouring Christianity Eusebius makes Flavia Domitilla the

volumes were burnt and Gellius states that in his time the number of volumes amounted to nearly seventy thousand Footnote eight hundred forty This favourite apple mentioned by Columella and Pliny took its name from C Matius a Roman knight and friend of Augustus who first introduced it Pliny tells us that Matius was also the first who brought into vogue the practice of clipping groves Footnote eight

in modern use See the beginning of c iv Footnote eight hundred forty three Suetonius s account of the rude and unlettered state of society in the early times of Rome is consistent with what we might infer and with the accounts which have come down to us of a community composed of the most daring and adventurous spirits thrown off by the neighbouring tribes and whose sole occupations were rapine and war But Cicero discovers the germs of mental cultivation among the Romans long before the period assigned to it by Suetonius tracing them to the teaching of Pythagoras who visited the Greek cities on the coast of Italy in the reign of Tarquinius Superbus Tusc Quaest iv one Footnote eight hundred forty four Livius whose cognomen Andronicus intimates his extraction was born of Greek parents He began to teach at Rome in the consulship of Claudius Cento the son of Appius Caecus and Sempronius Tuditanus A U C five hundred fourteen He must not be confounded with Titus Livius the historian who flourished in the Augustan age Footnote eight hundred forty five Ennius was a native of Calabria He was born the year after the consulship mentioned in the preceding note and lived to see at least his seventy sixth year for Gellius informs us that at that age he wrote the twelfth book of his Annals Footnote eight hundred forty six Porcius Cato found Ennius in Sardinia when he conquered that island during his praetorship He learnt Greek from Ennius there and brought him to Rome on his return Ennius taught Greek at Rome for a long course of years having M Cato among his pupils Footnote eight

Cicero Fam Epist ix sixteen and his singular death mentioned by Pliny xxv four Footnote eight hundred fifty five Daphnis a shepherd the son of Mercury was said to have been brought up by Pan The humorous turn given by Lenaeus to Lutatius s cognomen is not very clear Daphnides is the plural of Daphnis therefore the herd or company agaema and Pan was the god of rustics and the inventor of the rude music of the reed Footnote eight hundred fifty six Oppius Cares is said by Macrobius to have written a book on Forest Trees Footnote eight hundred fifty seven Quintilian enumerates Bibaculus among the Roman poets in the same line with Catullus and Horace Institut x one Of Sigida we know nothing even the name is supposed to be incorrectly given Apuleius mentions a Ticida who is also noticed by Suetonius hereafter in c xi where likewise he gives an account of Valerius Cato Footnote eight hundred fifty eight Probably Suevius of whom Macrobius informs us that he was the learned author of an Idyll which had the title of the Mulberry Grove observing that the peach which Suevius reckons as a species of the nuts rather belongs to the tribe of apples Footnote eight hundred fifty

Cicero addressed his Epistles was Titus Pomponius Atticus Although Satrius was the name of a family at Rome no connection between it and Atticus can be found so that the text is supposed to be corrupt Quintus Caecilius was an uncle of Atticus and adopted him The freedman mentioned in this chapter probably assumed his name he having been the property of Caecilius as it was the custom for freedmen to adopt the names of their patrons Footnote eight hundred eighty four Suetonius TIBERIUS c viii Her name was Pomponia Footnote eight hundred eighty five See AUGUSTUS c lxvi Footnote eight hundred eighty

conjecture from the large produce that it is a mistake for vineam a vineyard in which case the word vasa might be rendered not bottles but casks The amphora held about nine gallons Pliny mentions that Remmius bought a farm near the turning on the Nomentan road at the tenth mile stone from Rome Footnote nine hundred two Usque ad infamiam oris See TIBERIUS p two hundred twenty and the notes Footnote

founded Lyons during the time he governed that part of the Roman provinces in Gaul Footnote nine hundred twenty three See AUGUSTUS c xxxvi Footnote nine hundred twenty four He meant to speak of Cisalpine Gaul which though geographically a part of Italy did not till a late period enjoy the privileges of the other territories united to Rome and was administered by a praetor under the forms of a dependent province It was admitted to equal rights by the triumvirs after the death of Julius Caesar Albutius intimated that those rights were now in danger Footnote nine hundred twenty five Lucius

Acilius Glabrio A U C five hundred eighty seven Footnote nine hundred twenty nine saint Jerom also states that Terence read the Andria to Caecilius who was a comic poet at Rome but it is clearly an anachronism as he died two years before this period It is proposed therefore to amend the text by substituting Acilius the aedile a correction recommended by all the circumstances and approved by Pitiscus and Ernesti Footnote nine hundred thirty The Hecyra The Mother in law is one of Terence s plays Footnote nine hundred thirty one The Eunuch was not brought out till five years after the Andria A U C five hundred ninety two Footnote nine hundred thirty two About eighty pounds sterling the price paid for the two performances What further right of authorship is meant by the words

was the festival of married women See before VESPASIAN c xix Footnote nine hundred thirty six Santra who wrote biographies of celebrated characters is mentioned as a man of learning by saint Jerom in his preface to the book on the Ecclesiastical Writers Footnote nine hundred thirty seven The idea seems to have prevailed that Terence originally an African slave could not have attained that purity of style in Latin composition which is found in his plays without some assistance The style of Phaedrus however who was a slave from Thrace and lived in the reign of Tiberius is equally pure although no such suspicion attaches to his work Footnote nine hundred thirty eight Cicero de Clar Orat c two hundred seven gives Sulpicius Gallus a high character as a finished orator and elegant scholar He was consul when the Andria was first produced Footnote nine hundred thirty nine Labeo and Popilius are also spoken of by Cicero in high terms Ib cc twenty one and twenty four Q Fabius Labeo was consul with M Claudius Marcellus A U C five hundred seventy and Popilius with L Postumius Albinus A U C five hundred eighty Footnote nine hundred forty The story of Terence s having converted into Latin plays this large number of Menander s Greek comedies is beyond all probability considering the age at which he died and other circumstances Indeed Menander never wrote so many as are here stated Footnote nine hundred forty one They were consuls A U C five hundred ninety four Terence was therefore thirty four years old at the time of his death Footnote nine hundred forty two Hortulorum in the plural number This term often found in Roman authors not inaptly describes the vast number of little inclosures consisting of vineyards orchards of fig trees peaches et cetera with patches of tillage in which maize legumes melons pumpkins and other vegetables are cultivated for sale still found on small properties in the south of Europe particularly in the neighbourhood of towns Footnote nine

favourite of Nero who was put to death by that prince see NERO c liv but another person of the same name who was patronised by the emperor Domitian The name of the poet joined with him is not known

Camerinus had been proconsul in Africa Bareas Soranus in Asia Tacit Annal xiii fifty two xvi twenty three Both of them are said to have been corrupt in their administration and the satirist introduces

six A D thirty four Footnote nine hundred fifty three A U C eight hundred fourteen A D sixty two Footnote nine hundred fifty four Persius was one of the few men of rank and affluence among the Romans who acquired distinction as writers the greater part of them having been freedmen as appears not only from these lives of the poets but from our author s notices of the grammarians and rhetoricians A Caius Persius is mentioned with distinction by Livy in the second Punic war Hist xxvi thirty nine and another of the same name by Cicero de Orat ii six and by Pliny but whether the poet was descended from either of them we have no means of ascertaining Footnote nine hundred fifty five Persius addressed his fifth satire to Annaeus Cornutus He was a native of Leptis in Africa and lived at Rome in the time of Nero by whom he was banished Footnote nine hundred fifty six Caesius Bassus a lyric poet flourished during the reigns of Nero and Galba Persius dedicated his sixth Satire to him Footnote nine hundred fifty seven Numanus It should be Servilius Nonianus who is mentioned by Pliny xxviii two and xxxvii six Footnote nine hundred fifty eight Commentators are not agreed about these sums the text varying both in the manuscripts and editions Footnote nine hundred fifty nine See doctor Thomson s remarks on Persius before p three hundred ninety eight Footnote nine hundred sixty There is no appearance of any want of finish in the sixth Satire of Persius as it has come down to us but it has been conjectured that it was followed by another which was left imperfect Footnote nine hundred

precipitate retreat relicta non bene parmula Ode xi seven nine Footnote nine hundred sixty six See Ode xi seven one Footnote nine hundred sixty seven The editors of Suetonius give different versions of this epigram It seems to allude to some passing occurrence and in its present form the sense is to this effect If I love you not Horace to my very heart s core may you see the priest of the college of Titus leaner than his mule Footnote nine hundred sixty eight Probably the Septimius to whom Horace addressed the ode beginning Septimi Gades aditure mecum Ode xl b i Footnote nine hundred sixty nine See AUGUSTUS c xxi and Horace Ode iv four Footnote nine hundred seventy See Epist i iv xv Me pinguem et nitidum bene curata cute vises Footnote nine hundred seventy one It is satisfactory to find that the best commentators consider the words between brackets as an interpolation in the work of Suetonius Some including Bentley reject the preceding sentence also Footnote nine hundred seventy two The works of Horace abound with references to his Sabine farm which must be familiar to many readers Some remains are still shewn consisting of a ruined wall and a tesselated pavement in a vineyard about eight miles from Tivoli which are supposed with reason to mark its site At least the features of the neighbouring country as often sketched by the poet and they are very beautiful cannot be mistaken Footnote nine hundred seventy three Aurelius Cotta and L Manlius Torquatus were consuls A U C six hundred eighty eight The genial Horace in speaking of his old wine agrees with Suetonius in fixing the date of his own birth O nata mecum consule Manlio Testa Ode iii twenty one And again Tu vina Torquato move Consule pressa meo Epod xiii eight Footnote nine hundred seventy four A U C seven hundred forty five So that Horace was in his fifty seventh not his fifty ninth year at the time of his death Footnote nine hundred seventy five It may be concluded that Horace died at Rome under the hospitable roof of his patron Mecaenas whose villa and gardens stood on the Esquiline hill which had formerly been the burial ground of the lower classes but as he tells us Nunc licet Esquiliis habitare salubribus atque Aggere in aprico spatiare Sat i eight Footnote nine hundred seventy six Cordova Lucan was the son of Annaeus Mella Seneca s brother Footnote nine hundred seventy seven This

hundred forty seven where it is said that he died with philosophical firmness Footnote nine hundred eighty two We find it stated ib p three hundred ninety six that Lucan expired while pronouncing some verses from his own Pharsalia for which we have the authority of Tacitus Annal xv twenty one Lucan it appears employed his last hours in revising his poems on the contrary Virgil we are told when his death was imminent renewed his directions that the Aeneid should be committed to the flames Footnote nine hundred eighty three The text of the concluding sentence of Lucan s life is corrupt and neither of the modes proposed for correcting it make the sense intended very clear Footnote nine hundred eighty four Although this brief memoir of Pliny is inserted in all the editions of Suetonius it was unquestionably not written by him The author whoever he was has confounded the two Plinys the uncle and nephew into which error Suetonius could not have fallen as he lived on intimate terms with the younger Pliny nor can it be supposed that he would have composed the memoir of his illustrious friend in so cursory a manner Scaliger and other learned men consider that the life of Pliny attributed to Suetonius was composed more than four centuries after that historian s death Footnote nine hundred eighty five See JULIUS c xxviii Caius Plinius Caecilius Secundus the younger Pliny was
