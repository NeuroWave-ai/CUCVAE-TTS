The shuttle plane from the port of Philadelphia to Hospital Seattle had already gone when Dal Timgar arrived at the loading platform even though he had taken great pains to be at least thirty minutes early for the boarding You ll just have to wait for the next one the clerk at the dispatcher s desk told him unsympathetically There s nothing else you can do But I can t wait Dal said I have to be in Hospital Seattle by morning He pulled out the flight schedule and held it under the clerk s nose Look there The shuttle wasn t supposed to leave for another forty five minutes The clerk blinked at the schedule and shrugged The seats were full so it left he said Graduation time you know Everybody has to be somewhere else right away The next shuttle goes in three hours But I had a reservation on this one Dal insisted Don t be silly the clerk said sharply Only graduates can get reservations this time of year He broke off to stare at Dal Timgar a puzzled frown on his face Let me see that reservation Dal fumbled in his pants pocket for the yellow reservation slip He was wishing now that he d kept his mouth shut He was acutely conscious of the clerk s suspicious stare and suddenly he felt extremely awkward The Earth cut trousers had never really fit Dal very well his legs were too long and spindly and his hips too narrow to hold the pants up properly The tailor in the Philadelphia shop had tried three times to make a jacket fit across Dal s narrow shoulders and finally had given up in despair Now as he handed the reservation slip across the counter Dal saw the clerk staring at the fine gray fur that coated the back of his hand and arm Here it is he said angrily See for yourself The clerk looked at the slip and handed it back indifferently It s a valid reservation all right but there won t be another shuttle to Hospital Seattle for three hours he said unless you have a priority card of course No I m afraid I don t Dal said It was a ridiculous suggestion and the clerk knew it Only physicians in the Black Service of Pathology and a few Four star Surgeons had the power to commandeer public aircraft whenever they wished Can I get on the next shuttle You can try the clerk said but you d better be ready when they start loading You can wait up on the ramp if you want to Dal turned and started across the main concourse of the great airport He felt a stir of motion at his side and looked down at the small pink fuzz ball sitting in the crook of his arm Looks like we re out of luck pal he said gloomily If we don t get on the next plane we ll miss the hearing altogether Not that it s going to do us much good to be there anyway The little pink fuzz ball on his arm opened a pair of black shoe button eyes and blinked up at him and Dal absently stroked the tiny creature with a finger The fuzz ball quivered happily and clung closer to Dal s side as he started up the long ramp to the observation platform Automatic doors swung open as he reached the top and Dal shivered in the damp night air He could feel the gray fur that coated his back and neck rising to protect him from the coldness and dampness that his body was never intended by nature to endure Below him the bright lights of the landing fields and terminal buildings of the port of Philadelphia spread out in panorama and he thought with a sudden pang of the great space port in his native city so very different from this one and so unthinkably far away The field below was teeming with activity alive with men and vehicles Moments before one of Earth s great hospital ships had landed returning from a cruise deep into the heart of the galaxy bringing in the gravely ill from a dozen star systems for care in one of Earth s hospitals Dal watched as the long line of stretchers poured from the ship s hold with white clad orderlies in nervous attendance Some of the stretchers were encased in special atmosphere tanks a siren wailed across the field as an emergency truck raced up with fresh gas bottles for a chlorine breather from the Betelgeuse system and a derrick crew spent fifteen minutes lifting down the special liquid ammonia tank housing a native of Aldebaran s massive sixteenth planet All about the field were physicians supervising the process of disembarcation resplendent in the colors that signified their medical specialties At the foot of the landing crane a Three star Internist in the green cape of the Medical Service obviously the commander of the ship was talking with the welcoming dignitaries of Hospital Earth Half a dozen doctors in the Blue Service of Diagnosis were checking new lab supplies ready to be loaded aboard Three young Star Surgeons swung by just below Dal with their bright scarlet capes fluttering in the breeze headed for customs and their first Earthside liberty in months Dal watched them go by and felt the sick bitter feeling in the pit of his stomach that he had felt so often in recent months He had dreamed once of wearing the scarlet cape of the Red Service of Surgery too with the silver star of the Star Surgeon on his collar That had been a long time ago over eight Earth years ago the dream had faded slowly but now the last vestige of hope was almost gone He thought of the long years of intensive training he had just completed in the medical school of Hospital Philadelphia the long nights of studying for exams the long days spent in the laboratories and clinics in order to become a physician of Hospital Earth and a wave of bitterness swept through his mind A dream he thought hopelessly a foolish idea and nothing more They knew before I started that they would never let me finish They had no intention of doing so it just amused them to watch me beat my head on a stone wall for these eight years But then he shook his head and felt a little ashamed of the thought It wasn t quite true and he knew it He had known that it was a gamble from the very first Black Doctor Arnquist had warned him the day he received his notice of admission to the medical school I can promise you nothing the old man had said except a slender chance There are those who will fight to the very end to prevent you from succeeding and when it s all over you may not win But if you are willing to take that risk at least you have a chance Dal had accepted the risk with his eyes wide open He had done the best he could do and now he had lost True he had not received the final irrevocable word that he had been expelled from the medical service of Hospital Earth but he was certain now that it was waiting for him when he arrived at Hospital Seattle the following morning The loading ramp was beginning to fill up and Dal saw half a dozen of his classmates from the medical school burst through the door from the station below shifting their day packs from their shoulders and chattering among themselves Several of them saw him standing by himself against the guard rail One or two nodded coolly and turned away the others just ignored him Nobody greeted him nor even smiled Dal turned away and stared down once again at the busy activity on the field below Why so gloomy friend a voice behind him said You look as though the ship left without you Dal looked up at the tall dark haired young man towering at his side and smiled ruefully Hello Tiger As a matter of fact it did leave I m waiting for the next one Where to Frank Martin frowned down at Dal Known as Tiger to everyone but the professors the young man s nickname fit him well He was big even for an Earthman and his massive shoulders and stubborn jaw only served to emphasize his bigness Like the other recent graduates on the platform he was wearing the colored cuff and collar of the probationary physician in the bright green of the Green Service of Medicine He reached out a huge hand and gently rubbed the pink fuzz ball sitting on Dal s arm What s the trouble Dal Even Fuzzy looks worried Where s your cuff and collar I didn t get any cuff and collar Dal said Didn t you get an assignment Tiger stared at him Or are you just taking a leave first Dal shook his head A permanent leave I guess he said bitterly There s not going to be any assignment for me Let s face it Tiger I m washed out Oh now look here I mean it I ve been booted and that s all there is to it But you ve been in the top ten in the class right through Tiger protested You know you passed your finals What is this anyway Dal reached into his jacket and handed Tiger a blue paper envelope I should have expected it from the first They sent me this instead of my cuff and collar Tiger opened the envelope From Doctor Tanner he grunted The Black Plague himself But what is it Read it Dal said You are hereby directed to appear before the medical training council in the council chambers in Hospital Seattle at ten zero A M Friday June twenty four twenty three seventy five in order that your application for assignment to a General Practice Patrol ship may be reviewed Insignia will not be worn Signed Hugo Tanner Physician Black Service of Pathology Tiger blinked at the notice and handed it back to Dal I don t get it he said finally You applied you re as qualified as any of us Except in one way Dal said and that s the way that counts They don t want me Tiger They have never wanted me They only let me go through school because Black Doctor Arnquist made an issue of it and they didn t quite dare to veto him But they never intended to let me finish not for a minute For a moment the two were silent staring down at the busy landing procedures below A warning light was flickering across the field signaling the landing of an incoming shuttle ship and the supply cars broke from their positions in center of the field and fled like beetles for the security of the garages A loudspeaker blared announcing the incoming craft Dal Timgar turned lifting Fuzzy gently from his arm into a side jacket pocket and shouldering his day pack I guess this is my flight Tiger I d better get in line Tiger Martin gripped Dal s slender four fingered hand tightly Look he said intensely this is some sort of mistake that the training council will straighten out I m sure of it Lots of guys have their applications reviewed It happens all the time but they still get their assignments Do you know of any others in this class Or the last class Maybe not Tiger said But if they were washing you out why would the council be reviewing it Somebody must be fighting for you But Black Doctor Tanner is on the council Dal said He s not the only one on the council It s going to work out You ll see I hope so Dal said without conviction He started for the loading line then turned But where are you going to be What ship Tiger hesitated Not assigned yet I m taking a leave But you ll be hearing from me The loading call blared from the loudspeaker The tall Earthman seemed about to say something more but Dal turned away and headed across toward the line for the shuttle plane Ten minutes later he was aloft as the tiny plane speared up through the black night sky and turned its needle nose toward the west He tried to sleep but couldn t The shuttle trip from the Port of Philadelphia to Hospital Seattle was almost two hours long because of passenger stops at Hospital Cleveland Eisenhower City New Chicago and Hospital Billings In spite of the help of the pneumatic seats and a sleep cap Dal could not even doze It was one of the perfect clear nights that often occurred in midsummer now that weather control could modify Earth s air currents so well the stars glittered against the black velvet backdrop above and the North American continent was free of clouds Dal stared down at the patchwork of lights that flickered up at him from the ground below Passing below him were some of the great cities the hospitals the research and training centers the residential zones and supply centers of Hospital Earth medical center to the powerful Galactic Confederation physician in charge of the health of a thousand intelligent races on a thousand planets of a thousand distant star systems Here he knew was the ivory tower of galactic medicine the hub from which the medical care of the confederation arose From the huge hospitals research centers and medical schools here the physicians of Hospital Earth went out to all corners of the galaxy In the permanent outpost clinics in the gigantic hospital ships that served great sectors of the galaxy and in the General Practice Patrol ships that roved from star system to star system they answered the calls for medical assistance from a multitude of planets and races wherever and whenever they were needed Dal Timgar had been on Hospital Earth for eight years and still he was a stranger here To him this was an alien planet different in a thousand ways from the world where he was born and grew to manhood For a moment now he thought of his native home the second planet of a hot yellow star which Earthmen called Garv because they couldn t pronounce its full name in the Garvian tongue Unthinkably distant yet only days away with the power of the star drive motors that its people had developed thousands of years before Garv II was a warm planet teeming with activity the trading center of the galaxy and the governmental headquarters of the powerful Galactic Confederation of Worlds Dal could remember the days before he had come to Hospital Earth and the many times he had longed desperately to be home again He drew his fuzzy pink friend out of his pocket and rested him on his shoulder felt the tiny silent creature rub happily against his neck It had been his own decision to come here Dal knew there was no one else to blame His people were not physicians Their instincts and interests lay in trading and politics not in the life sciences and plague after plague had swept across his home planet in the centuries before Hospital Earth had been admitted as a probationary member of the Galactic Confederation But as long as Dal could remember he had wanted to be a doctor From the first time he had seen a General Practice Patrol ship landing in his home city to fight the plague that was killing his people by the thousands he had known that this was what he wanted more than anything else to be a physician of Hospital Earth to join the ranks of the doctors who were serving the galaxy Many on Earth had tried to stop him from the first He was a Garvian alien to Earth s climate and Earth s people The physical differences between Earthmen and Garvians were small but just enough to set him apart and make him easily identifiable as an alien He had one too few digits on his hands his body was small and spindly weighing a bare ninety pounds and the coating of fine gray fur that covered all but his face and palms annoyingly grew longer and thicker as soon as he came to the comparatively cold climate of Hospital Earth to live The bone structure of his face gave his cheeks and nose a flattened appearance and his pale gray eyes seemed abnormally large and wistful And even though it had long been known that Earthmen and Garvians were equal in range of intelligence his classmates still assumed just from his appearance that he was either unusually clever or unusually stupid The gulf that lay between him and the men of Earth went beyond mere physical differences however Earthmen had differences of skin color facial contour and physical size among them yet made no sign of distinction Dal s alienness went deeper His classmates had been civil enough yet with one or two exceptions they had avoided him carefully Clearly they resented his presence in their lecture rooms and laboratories Clearly they felt that he did not belong there studying medicine From the first they had let him know unmistakably that he was unwelcome an intruder in their midst the first member of an alien race ever to try to earn the insignia of a physician of Hospital Earth And now Dal knew he had failed after all He had been allowed to try only because a powerful physician in the Black Service of Pathology had befriended him If it had not been for the friendship and support of another Earthman in the class Tiger Martin the eight years of study would have been unbearably lonely But now he thought it would have been far easier never to have started than to have his goal snatched away at the last minute The notice of the council meeting left no doubt in his mind He had failed There would be lots of talk some perfunctory debate for the sake of the record and the medical council would wash their hands of him once and for all The decision he was certain was already made It was just a matter of going through the formal motions Dal felt the motors change in pitch and the needle nosed shuttle plane began to dip once more toward the horizon Ahead he could see the sprawling lights of Hospital Seattle stretching from the Cascade Mountains to the sea and beyond north to Alaska and south toward the great California metropolitan centers Somewhere down there was a council room where a dozen of the most powerful physicians on Hospital Earth now sleeping soundly would be meeting tomorrow for a trial that was already over to pass a judgment that was already decided He slipped Fuzzy back into his pocket shouldered his pack and waited for the ship to come down for its landing It would be nice he thought wryly if his reservations for sleeping quarters in the students barracks might at least be honored but now he wasn t even sure of that In the port of Seattle he went through the customary baggage check He saw the clerk frown at his ill fitting clothes and not quite human face and then read his passage permit carefully before brushing him on through Then he joined the crowd of travelers heading for the city subways He didn t hear the loudspeaker blaring until the announcer had stumbled over his name half a dozen times Doctor Dal Timgar please report to the information booth He hurried back to central information You were paging me What is it Telephone message sir the announcer said his voice surprisingly respectful A top priority call Just a minute Moments later he had handed Dal the yellow telephone message sheet and Dal was studying the words with a puzzled frown CALL AT MY QUARTERS ON ARRIVAL REGARDLESS OF HOUR STOP URGENT THAT I SEE YOU STOP REPEAT URGENT The message was signed THORVOLD ARNQUIST BLACK SERVICE and carried the priority seal of the Four star Pathologist Dal read it again shifted his pack and started once more for the subway ramp He thrust the message into his pocket and his step quickened as he heard the whistle of the pressure tube trains up ahead Black Doctor Arnquist the man who had first defended his right to study medicine on Hospital Earth now wanted to see him before the council meeting took place For the first time in days Dal Timgar felt a new flicker of hope CHAPTER two HOSPITAL SEATTLE It was a long way from the students barracks to the pathology sector where Black Doctor Arnquist lived Dal Timgar decided not to try to go to the barracks first It was after midnight and even though the message had said regardless of hour Dal shrank from the thought of awakening a physician of the Black Service at two o clock in the morning He was already later arriving at Hospital Seattle than he had expected to be and quite possibly Black Doctor Arnquist would be retiring It seemed better to go there without delay But one thing took priority He found a quiet spot in the waiting room near the subway entrance and dug into his day pack for the pressed biscuit and the canister of water he had there He broke off a piece of the biscuit and held it up for Fuzzy to see Fuzzy wriggled down onto his hand and a tiny mouth appeared just below the shoe button eyes Bit by bit Dal fed his friend the biscuit with squirts of water in between bites Finally when the biscuit was gone Dal squirted the rest of the water into Fuzzy s mouth and rubbed him between the eyes Feel better now he asked The creature seemed to understand he wriggled in Dal s hand and blinked his eyes sleepily All right then Dal said Off to sleep Dal started to tuck him back into his jacket pocket but Fuzzy abruptly sprouted a pair of forelegs and began struggling fiercely to get out again Dal grinned and replaced the little creature in the crook of his arm Don t like that idea so well eh Okay friend If you want to watch that suits me He found a map of the city at the subway entrance and studied it carefully Like other hospital cities on Earth Seattle was primarily a center for patient care and treatment rather than a supply or administrative center Here in Seattle special facilities existed for the care of the intelligent marine races that required specialized hospital care The depths of Puget Sound served as a vast aquatic ward system where creatures which normally lived in salt water oceans on their native planets could be cared for and the specialty physicians who worked with marine races had facilities here for research and teaching in their specialty The dry land sectors of the hospital were organized to support the aquatic wards the surgeries the laboratories the pharmacies and living quarters all were arranged on the periphery of the salt water basin and rapid transit tubes carried medical workers orderlies nurses and physicians to the widespread areas of the hospital city The pathology sector lay to the north of the city and Black Doctor Arnquist was the chief pathologist of Hospital Seattle Dal found a northbound express tube climbed into an empty capsule and pressed the buttons for the pathology sector Presently the capsule was shifted automatically into the pressure tube that would carry him thirty miles north to his destination It was the first time Dal had ever visited a Black Doctor in his quarters and the idea made him a little nervous Of all the medical services on Hospital Earth none had the power of the Black Service of Pathology Traditionally in Earth medicine the pathologists had always occupied a position of power and discipline The autopsy rooms had always been the Temples of Truth where the final inarguable answers in medicine were ultimately found and for centuries pathologists had been the judges and inspectors of the profession of medicine And when Earth had become Hospital Earth with status as a probationary member of the Galactic Confederation of Worlds it was natural that the Black Service of Pathology had become the governors and policy makers regimenting every aspect of the medical services provided by Earth physicians Dal knew that the medical training council which would be reviewing his application in just a few hours was made up of physicians from all the services the Green Service of Medicine the Blue Service of Diagnosis the Red Service of Surgery as well as the Auxiliary Services but the Black Doctors who sat on the council would have the final say the final veto power He wondered now why Black Doctor Arnquist wanted to see him At first he had thought there might be special news for him word perhaps that his assignment had come through after all that the interview tomorrow would not be held But on reflection he realized that didn t make sense If that were the case Doctor Arnquist would have said so and directed him to report to a ship More likely he thought the Black Doctor wanted to see him only to soften the blow to help him face the decision that seemed inevitable He left the pneumatic tube and climbed on the jitney that wound its way through the corridors of the pathology sector and into the quiet austere quarters of the resident pathologists He found the proper concourse and moments later he was pressing his thumb against the identification plate outside the Black Doctor s personal quarters Black Doctor Thorvold Arnquist looked older now than when Dal had last seen him His silvery gray hair was thinning and there were tired lines around his eyes and mouth that Dal did not remember from before The old man s body seemed more wispy and frail than ever and the black cloak across his shoulders rustled as he led Dal back into a book lined study The Black Doctor had not yet gone to bed On a desk in the corner of the study several books lay open and a roll of paper was inserted in the dicto typer I knew you would get the message when you arrived he said as he took Dal s pack and I thought you might be later than you planned A good trip I trust And your friend here He enjoys shuttle travel He smiled and stroked Fuzzy with a gnarled finger I suppose you wonder why I wanted to see you Dal Timgar nodded slowly About the interview tomorrow Ah yes The interview The Black Doctor made a sour face and shook his head A bad business for you that interview How do you feel about it Dal spread his hands helplessly As always the Black Doctor s questions cut through the trimming to the heart of things They were always difficult questions to answer I I suppose it s something that s necessary he said finally Oh the Black Doctor frowned But why necessary for you if not for the others How many were there in your class including all the services Three hundred And out of the three hundred only one was refused assignment He looked up sharply at Dal his pale blue eyes very alert in his aged face Right Yes sir And you really feel it s just normal procedure that your application is being challenged No sir How do you feel about it Dal Angry maybe Dal squirmed Yes sir You might say that Perhaps even bitter the Black Doctor said I did as good work as anyone else in my class Dal said hotly I did my part as well as anyone could I didn t let up once all the way through Bitter Wouldn t you feel bitter The Black Doctor nodded slowly Yes I imagine I would he said sinking down into the chair behind the desk with a sigh As a matter of fact I do feel a little bitter about it even though I was afraid that it might come to this in the end I can t blame you for your feelings He took a deep breath I wish I could promise you that everything would be all right tomorrow but I m afraid I can t The council has a right to review your qualifications and it holds the power to assign you to a patrol ship on the spot if it sees fit Conceivably a Black Doctor might force the council s approval if he were the only representative of the Black service there But I will not be the only Black Doctor sitting on the council tomorrow I know that Dal said Doctor Arnquist looked up at Dal for a long moment Why do you want to be a doctor in the first place Dal This isn t the calling of your people You must be the one Garvian out of millions with the patience and peculiar mental make up to permit you to master the scientific disciplines involved in studying medicine Either you are different from the rest of your people which I doubt or else you are driven to force yourself into a pattern foreign to your nature for very compelling reasons What are they Why do you want medicine It was the hardest question of all the question Dal had dreaded He knew the answer just as he had known for most of his life that he wanted to be a doctor above all else But he had never found a way to put the reasons into words I can t say he said slowly I know but I can t express it and whenever I try it just sounds silly Maybe your reasons don t make reasonable sense the old man said gently But they do At least to me they do Dal said I ve always wanted to be a doctor There s nothing else I want to do To work at home among my people There was a plague on Garv II wasn t there Doctor Arnquist said A cyclic thing that came back again and again The cycle was broken just a few years ago when the virus that caused it was finally isolated and destroyed By the physicians of Hospital Earth Dal said It s happened again and again the Black Doctor said We ve seen the same pattern repeated a thousand times across the galaxy and it has always puzzled us just a little He smiled You see our knowledge and understanding of the life sciences here on Earth have always grown hand in hand with the physical sciences We had always assumed that the same thing would happen on any planet where a race has developed intelligence and scientific methods of study We were wrong of course which is the reason for the existence of Hospital Earth and her physicians today but it still amazes us that with all the technology and civilization in the galaxy we Earthmen are the only people yet discovered who have developed a broad knowledge of the processes of life and illness and death The old man looked up at his visitor and Dal felt his pale blue eyes searching his face How badly do you want to be a doctor Dal More than anything else I know Dal said Badly enough to do anything to achieve your goal Dal hesitated and stroked Fuzzy s head gently Well almost anything The Black Doctor nodded And that of course is the reason I had to see you before this interview my friend I know you ve played the game straight right from the beginning up to this point Now I beg of you not to do the thing that you are thinking of doing For a moment Dal just stared at the little old man in black and felt the fur on his arms and back rise up A wave of panic flooded his mind He knows he thought frantically He must be able to read minds But he thrust the idea away There was no way that the Black Doctor could know No race of creatures in the galaxy had that power And yet there was no doubt that Black Doctor Arnquist knew what Dal had been thinking just as surely as if he had said it aloud Dal shook his head helplessly I I don t know what you mean I think you do Doctor Arnquist said Please Dal Trust me This is not the time to lie The thing that you were planning to do at the interview would be disastrous even if it won you an assignment It would be dishonest and unworthy Then he does know Dal thought But how I couldn t have told him or given him any hint He felt Fuzzy give a frightened shiver on his arm and then words were tumbling out of his mouth I don t know what you re talking about there wasn t anything I was thinking of I mean what could I do If the council wants to assign me to a ship they will and if they don t they won t I don t know what you re thinking of Please Black Doctor Arnquist held up his hand Naturally you defend yourself he said I can t blame you for that and I suppose this is an unforgivable breach of diplomacy even to mention it to you but I think it must be done Remember that we have been studying and observing your people very carefully over the past two hundred years Dal It is no accident that you have such a warm attachment to your little pink friend here and it is no accident that wherever a Garvian is found his Fuzzy is with him isn t that so And it is no accident that your people are such excellent tradesmen that you are so remarkably skillful in driving bargains favorable to yourselves that you are in fact the most powerful single race of creatures in the whole Galactic Confederation The old man walked to the bookshelves behind him and brought down a thick bound manuscript He handed it across the desk as Dal watched him You may read this if you like at your leisure Don t worry it s not for publication just a private study which I have never mentioned before to anyone but the pattern is unmistakable This peculiar talent of your people is difficult to describe not really telepathy but an ability to create the emotional responses in others that will be most favorable to you Just what part your Fuzzies play in this ability of your people I am not sure but I m quite certain that without them you would not have it He smiled at Dal s stricken face A forbidden topic eh And yet perfectly true You know right now that if you wanted to you could virtually paralyze me with fright render me helpless to do anything but stand here and shiver couldn t you Or if I were hostile to your wishes you could suddenly force me to sympathize with you and like you enormously until I was ready to agree to anything you wanted No Dal broke in Please you don t understand I ve never done it not once since I came to Hospital Earth I know that I ve been watching you And I wouldn t think of doing it Not even at the council interview Never Then let me have Fuzzy now He is the key to this special talent of your people Give him to me now and go to the interview without him Dal drew back trembling trying to fight down panic He brought his hand around to the soft fur of the little pink fuzz ball I can t do that he said weakly Not even if it meant your assignment to a patrol ship Dal hesitated then shook his head Not even then But I won t do what you re saying I promise you For a long moment Black Doctor Arnquist stared at him Then he smiled Will you give me your word Yes I promise Then I wish you good luck I will do what I can at the interview But now there is a bed for you here You will need sleep if you are to present your best appearance CHAPTER three THE INQUISITION The interview was held in the main council chambers of Hospital Seattle and Dal could feel the tension the moment he stepped into the room He looked at the long semicircular table and studied the impassive faces of the four star Physicians across the table from him Each of the major medical services was represented this morning In the center presiding over the council was a physician of the White Service a Four star Radiologist whose insignia gleamed on his shoulders There were two physicians each representing the Red Service of Surgery the Green Service of Medicine the Blue Service of Diagnosis and finally seated at either end of the table the representatives of the Black Service of Pathology Black Doctor Thorvold Arnquist sat to Dal s left he smiled faintly as the young Garvian stepped forward then busied himself among the papers on the desk before him To Dal s right sat another Black Doctor who was not smiling Dal had seen him before the chief company ordinator of medical education on Hospital Earth the Black Plague of the medical school jokes Black Doctor Hugo Tanner was large and florid of face blinking owlishly at Dal over his heavy horn rimmed glasses The glasses were purely decorative with modern eye cultures and transplant techniques no Earthman had really needed glasses to correct his vision for the past two hundred years but on Hugo Tanner s angry face they added a look of gravity and solemnity that the Black Doctor could not achieve without them Still glaring at Dal Doctor Tanner leaned over to speak to the Blue Doctor on his right and they nodded and laughed unpleasantly at some private joke There was no place for him to sit so Dal stood before the table as straight as his five foot height would allow him He had placed Fuzzy almost defiantly on his shoulder and from time to time he could feel the little creature quiver and huddle against his neck as though to hide from sight under his collar The White Doctor opened the proceedings and at first the questions were entirely medical We are meeting to consider this student s application for assignment to a General Practice Patrol ship as a probationary physician in the Red Service of Surgery I believe you are all acquainted with his educational qualifications There was an impatient murmur around the table The White Doctor looked up at Dal Your name please Dal Timgar sir Your full name Black Doctor Tanner rumbled from the right hand end of the table Dal took a deep breath and began to give his full Garvian name It was untranslatable and unpronounceable to Earthmen who could not reproduce the sequence of pops and whistles that made up the Garvian tongue The doctors listened blinking as the complex family structure and ancestry which entered into every Garvian s full name continued to roll from Dal s lips He was entering into the third generation removed of his father s lineage when Doctor Tanner held up his hand All right all right We will accept the abbreviated name you have used on Hospital Earth Let it be clear on the record that the applicant is a native of the second planet of the Garv system The Black Doctor settled back in his chair and began whispering again to the Blue Doctor next to him A Green Doctor cleared his throat Doctor Timgar what do you consider to be the basic principle that underlies the work and services of physicians of Hospital Earth It was an old question a favorite on freshman medical school examinations The principle that environments and life forms in the universe may be dissimilar but that biochemical reactions are universal throughout creation Dal said slowly Well memorized Black Doctor Tanner said sourly What does it mean It means that the principles of chemistry physiology pathology and the other life sciences once understood can be applied to any living creature in the universe and will be found valid Dal said As different as the various life forms may be the basic life processes in one life form are the same under different conditions as the life processes in any other life form just as hydrogen and oxygen will combine to form water anywhere in the universe where the proper physical conditions prevail Very good very good the Green Doctor said But tell me this what in your opinion is the place of surgery in a Galactic practice of medicine A more difficult question but one that Dal s training had prepared him well to answer He answered it and faced another question and another One by one the doctors interrogated him Black Doctor Arnquist among them The questions came faster and faster some were exceedingly difficult Once or twice Dal was stopped cold and forced to admit that he did not know the answer Other questions which he knew would stop other students happened to fall in fields he understood better than most and his answers were full and succinct But finally the questioning tapered off and the White Doctor shuffled his papers impatiently If there are no further medical questions we can move on to another aspect of this student s application Certain questions of policy have been raised Black Doctor Tanner had some things to say I believe as company ordinator of medical education The Black Doctor rose ponderously to his feet I have some things to say you can be sure of that he said but they have nothing to do with this Dal Timgar s educational qualifications for assignment to a General Practice Patrol ship Black Doctor Tanner paused to glare in Dal s direction He has been trained in a medical school on Hospital Earth and apparently has passed his final qualifying examinations for the Red Service of Surgery I can t argue about that Black Doctor Arnquist s voice came across the room Then why are we having his review Hugo Dal Timgar s classmates all received their assignments automatically Because there are other things to consider here than educational qualifications Hugo Tanner said Gentlemen consider our position for a moment We have thousands of probationary physicians abroad in the galaxy at the present time fine young men and women who have been trained in medical schools on Hospital Earth and now are gaining experience and judgment while fulfilling our medical service contracts in every part of the confederation They are probationers but we must not forget that we physicians of Hospital Earth are also probationers We are seeking a permanent place in this great Galactic Confederation which was in existence many thousands of years before we even knew of its existence It was not until our own scientists discovered the Koenig star drive enabling us to break free of our own solar system that we were met face to face with a confederation of intelligent races inhabiting the galaxy among others the people from whom this same Dal Timgar has come The history is interesting Black Doctor Arnquist broke in but really Hugo I think most of us know it already Maybe we do Doctor Tanner said flushing a little But the history is significant Permanent membership in the confederation is contingent on two qualifications First we must have developed a star drive of our own a qualification of intelligence if you will The confederation has ruled that only races having a certain level of intelligence can become members A star drive could only be developed with a far reaching understanding of the physical sciences so this is a valid criterion of intelligence But the second qualification for confederation membership is nothing more nor less than a question of usefulness The presiding White Doctor looked up frowning Usefulness Exactly The Galactic Confederation with its exchange of ideas and talents and all the wealth of civilization it has to offer is based on a division of labor Every member must have something to contribute some special talent For Earthmen the talent was obvious very early Our technology was primitive our manufacturing skills mediocre our transport and communications systems impossible But in our understanding of the life sciences we have far outstripped any other race in the galaxy We had already solved the major problems of disease and longevity among our own people while some of the most advanced races in the confederation were being reduced to helplessness by cyclic plagues which slaughtered their populations and were caused by nothing more complex than a simple parasitic virus Garv II is an excellent example One of the Red Doctors cleared his throat I m afraid I don t quite see the connection Nobody is arguing about our skill as doctors Of course not Black Doctor Tanner said The point is that in all the galaxy Earthmen are by their very nature the best doctors outstripping the most advanced physicians on any other planet And this gentlemen is our bargaining point We are useful to the Galactic Confederation only as physicians The confederation needed us badly enough to admit us to probational membership but if we ever hope to become full members of the confederation we must demonstrate our usefulness our unique skill as physicians We have worked hard to prove ourselves We have made Hospital Earth the galactic center of study and treatment of diseases of many races Earthmen on the General Practice Patrol ships visit planets in the remotest sections and their reputation as physicians has grown Every year new planets are writing full medical service contracts with us as Earthmen serving the galaxy As physicians serving the galaxy Black Doctor Arnquist s voice shot across the room As far as the confederation has been concerned the two have been synonymous Hugo Tanner roared Until now But now we have an alien among us We have allowed a non Earthman to train in our medical schools He has completed the required work his qualifications are acceptable and now he proposes to go out on a patrol ship as a physician of the Red Service of Surgery But think of what you are doing if you permit him to go You will be proving to every planet in the confederation that they don t really need Earthmen after all that any race from any planet might produce physicians just as capable as Earthmen The Black Doctor turned slowly to face Dal his mouth set in a grim line As he talked his face had grown dark with anger Understand that I have nothing against this creature as an individual Perhaps he would prove to be a competent physician although I cannot believe it Perhaps he would carry on the traditions of medical service we have worked so long to establish although I doubt it But I do know that if we permit him to become a qualified physician it will be the beginning of the end for Hospital Earth We will be selling out our sole bargaining position We can forget our hopes for membership in the confederation because one like him this year will mean two next year and ten the next and there will be no end to it We should have stopped it eight years ago but certain ones prevailed to admit Dal Timgar to training If we do not stop it now for all time we will never be able to stop it Slowly the Black Doctor sat down motioning to an orderly at the rear of the room The orderly brought a glass of water and a small capsule which Black Doctor Tanner gulped down The other doctors were talking heatedly among themselves as Black Doctor Arnquist rose to his feet Then you are claiming that our highest calling is to keep medicine in the hands of Earthmen alone he asked softly Doctor Tanner flushed Our highest calling is to provide good medical care for our patients he said The best possible medical care I never said otherwise And yet you deny the ancient tradition that a physician s duty is to help his patients help themselves Black Doctor Arnquist said I said no such thing Hugo Tanner cried jumping to his feet But we must protect ourselves We have no other power nothing else to sell And I say that if we must sell our medical skill for our own benefit first then we are not worthy to be physicians to anyone Doctor Arnquist snapped You make a very convincing case but if we examine it closely we see that it amounts to nothing but fear and selfishness Fear Doctor Tanner cried What do we have to fear if we can maintain our position But if we must yield to a Garvian who has no business in medicine in the first place what can we have left but fear If I were really convinced that Earthmen were the best physicians in the galaxy Black Doctor Arnquist replied I don t think I d have to be afraid The Black Doctor at the end of the table stood up shaking with rage Listen to him he cried to the others Once again he is defending this creature and turning his back on common sense All I ask is that we keep our skills among our own people and avoid the contamination that will surely result Doctor Tanner broke off his face suddenly white He coughed clutching at his chest and sank down groping for his medicine box and the water glass After a moment he caught his breath and shook his head There s nothing more I can say he said weakly I have done what I could and the decision is up to the rest of you He coughed again and slowly the color came back into his face The Blue Doctor had risen to help him but Tanner waved him aside No no it s nothing I allowed myself to become angry Black Doctor Arnquist spread his hands Under the circumstances I won t belabor the point he said although I think it would be good if Doctor Tanner would pause in his activities long enough for the surgery that would make his anger less dangerous to his own life But he represents a view and his right to state it is beyond reproach Doctor Arnquist looked from face to face along the council table The decision is yours gentlemen I would ask only that you consider what our highest calling as physicians really is a duty that overrides fear and selfishness I believe Dal Timgar would be a good physician and that this is more important than the planet of his origin I think he would uphold the honor of Hospital Earth wherever he went and give us his loyalty as well as his service I will vote to accept his application and thus cancel out my colleague s negative vote The deciding votes will be cast by the rest of you He sat down and the White Doctor looked at Dal Timgar It would be good if you would wait outside he said We will call you as soon as a decision is reached Dal waited in an anteroom feeding Fuzzy and trying to put out of his mind for a moment the heated argument still raging in the council chamber Fuzzy was quivering with fright unable to speak the tiny creature nevertheless clearly experienced emotions even though Dal himself did not know how he received impressions nor why But Dal knew that there was a connection between the tiny pink creature s emotions and the peculiar talent that Black Doctor Arnquist had spoken of the night before It was not a telepathic power that Dal and his people possessed Just what it was was difficult to define yet Dal knew that every Garvian depended upon it to some extent in dealing with people around him He knew that when Fuzzy was sitting on his arm he could sense the emotions of those around him the anger the fear the happiness the suspicion and he knew that under certain circumstances in a way he did not clearly understand he could wilfully change the feelings of others toward himself Not a great deal perhaps nor in any specific way but just enough to make them look upon him and his wishes more favorably than they otherwise might Throughout his years on Hospital Earth he had vigilantly avoided using this strange talent Already he was different enough from Earthmen in appearance in ways of thinking in likes and dislikes But these differences were not advantages and he had realized that if his classmates had ever dreamed of the advantage that he had minor as it was his hopes of becoming a physician would have been destroyed completely And in the council room he had kept his word to Doctor Arnquist He had felt Fuzzy quivering on his shoulder he had sensed the bitter anger in Black Doctor Tanner s mind and the temptation deliberately to mellow that anger had been almost overwhelming but he had turned it aside He had answered questions that were asked him and listened to the debate with a growing sense of hopelessness And now the chance was gone The decision was being made He paced the floor trying to remember the expressions of the other doctors trying to remember what had been said how many had seemed friendly and how many hostile but he knew that only intensified the torture There was nothing he could do now but wait At last the door opened and an orderly nodded to him Dal felt his legs tremble as he walked into the room and faced the semi circle of doctors He tried to read the answer on their faces but even Black Doctor Arnquist sat impassively doodling on the pad before him refusing to meet Dal s eyes The White Doctor took up a sheet of paper We have considered your application and have reached a decision You will be happy to know that your application for assignment has been tentatively accepted Dal heard the words and it seemed as though the room were spinning around him He wanted to shout for joy and throw his arms around Black Doctor Arnquist but he stood perfectly still and suddenly he noticed that Fuzzy was very quiet on his shoulder You will understand that this acceptance is not irrevocable the White Doctor went on We are not willing to guarantee your ultimate acceptance as a fully qualified Star Surgeon at this point You will be allowed to wear a collar and cuff uniform and insignia of a probationary physician in the Red Service and will be assigned aboard the General Practice Patrol ship Lancet leaving from Hospital Seattle next Tuesday If you prove your ability in that post your performance will once again be reviewed by this board but you alone will determine our decision then Your final acceptance as a Star Surgeon will depend entirely upon your conduct as a member of the patrol ship s crew He smiled at Dal and set the paper down The council wishes you well Do you have any questions Just one Dal managed to say Who will my crewmates be As is customary a probationer from the Green Service of Medicine and one from the Blue Service of Diagnosis Both have been specially selected by this council Your Blue Doctor will be Jack Alvarez who has shown great promise in his training in diagnostic medicine And the Green Doctor A young man named Frank Martin the White Doctor said Known to his friends I believe as Tiger CHAPTER four THE GALACTIC PILL PEDDLERS The ship stood tall and straight on her launching pad with the afternoon sunlight glinting on her hull Half a dozen crews of check out men were swarming about her inspecting her engine and fuel supplies riding up the gantry crane to her entrance lock and guiding the great cargo nets from the loading crane into her afterhold High up on her hull Dal Timgar could see a golden caduceus emblazoned the symbol of the General Practice Patrol and beneath it the ship s official name GPPS two hundred thirty eight LANCET Dal shifted his day pack down from his shoulders ridiculously pleased with the gleaming scarlet braid on the collar and cuff of his uniform and lifted Fuzzy up on his shoulder to see It seemed to Dal that everyone he had passed in the terminal had been looking at the colorful insignia it was all he could do to keep from holding his arm up and waving it like a banner You ll get used to it Tiger Martin chuckled as they waited for the jitney to take them across to the launching pad At first you think everybody is impressed by the colors until you see some guy go past with the braid all faded and frazzled at the edges and then you realize that you re just the latest greenhorn in a squad of two hundred thousand men It s still good to be wearing it Dal said I couldn t really believe it until Black Doctor Arnquist turned the collar and cuff over to me He looked suspiciously at Tiger You must have known a lot more about that interview than you let on Or was it just coincidence that we were assigned together Not coincidence exactly Tiger grinned I didn t know what was going to happen I d requested assignment with you on my application and then when yours was held up Doctor Arnquist asked me if I d be willing to wait for assignment until the interview was over So I said okay He seemed to think you had a pretty good chance I d never have made it without his backing Dal said Well anyway he figured that if you were assigned it would be a good idea to have a friend on the patrol ship team I won t argue about that Dal said But who is the Blue Service man Tiger s face darkened I don t know much about him he said He trained in California and I met him just once at a diagnosis and therapy conference He s supposed to be plenty smart according to the grapevine I guess he d have to be to pass Diagnostic Service finals Tiger chuckled Any dope can make it in the Medical or Surgical Services but diagnosis is something else again Will he be in command On the Lancet Why should he We ll share command just like any patrol ship crew If we run into problems we can t agree on we holler for help But if he acts like most of the Blue Doctors I know he ll think he s in command A jitney stopped for them and then zoomed out across the field toward the ship The gantry platform was just clanging to the ground unloading three technicians and a Four bar Electronics Engineer Tiger and Dal rode the platform up again and moments later stepped through the entrance lock of the ship that would be their home base for months and perhaps years They found the bunk room to the rear of the control and lab sections A duffel bag was already lodged on one of the bunks one of the foot lockers was already occupied and a small but expensive camera and a huge pair of field glasses were hanging from one of the wall brackets Looks like our man has already arrived Tiger said tossing down his own duffel bag and looking around the cramped quarters Not exactly a luxury suite I d say Wonder where he is Let s look up forward Dal said We ve plenty to do before we take off Maybe he s just getting an early start They explored the ship working their way up the central corridor past the communications and computer rooms and the laboratory into the main control and observation room Here they found a thin dark haired young man in a bright blue collar and cuff sitting engrossed with a tape reader For a moment they thought he hadn t heard them Then as though reluctant to tear himself away the Blue Doctor sighed snapped off the reader and turned on the swivel stool So he said I was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to get here We ran into some delays Tiger said He grinned and held out his hand Jack Alvarez Tiger Martin We met each other at that conference in Chicago last year Yes I remember the Blue Doctor said You found some holes in a paper I gave Matter of fact I ve plugged them up very nicely since then You d have trouble finding fault with the work now Jack Alvarez turned his eyes to Dal And I suppose this is the Garvian I ve been hearing about complete with his little pink stooge The moment they had walked in the door Dal had felt Fuzzy crouch down tight against his shoulder Now a wave of hostility struck his mind like a shower of ice water He had never seen this thin dark haired youth before or even heard of him but he recognized this sharp impression of hatred and anger unmistakably He had felt it a thousand times among his medical school classmates during the past eight years and just hours before he had felt it in the council room when Black Doctor Tanner had turned on him It s really a lucky break that we have Dal for a Red Doctor Tiger said We almost didn t get him Yes I heard all about how lucky we are Jack Alvarez said sourly He looked Dal over from the gray fur on the top of his head to the spindly legs in the ill fitting trousers Then the Blue Doctor shrugged in disgust and turned back to the tape reader A Garvian and his Fuzzy he muttered Let s hope one or the other knows something about surgery I think we ll do all right Dal said slowly I think you d better Jack Alvarez replied Dal and Tiger looked at each other and Tiger shrugged It s all right he said We know our jobs and we ll manage Dal nodded and started back for the bunk room No doubt he thought they would manage But if he had thought before that the assignment on the Lancet was going to be easy he knew now that he was wrong Tiger Martin may have been Doctor Arnquist s selection as a crewmate for him but there was no question in his mind that the Blue Doctor on the Lancet s crew was Black Doctor Hugo Tanner s choice The first meeting with Jack Alvarez hardly seemed promising to either Dal or Tiger but if there was trouble coming it was postponed for the moment by common consent In the few days before blast off there was no time for conflict or even for much talk Each of the three crewmen had two full weeks of work to accomplish in two days each knew his job and buried himself in it with a will The ship s medical and surgical supplies had to be inventoried and missing or required supplies ordered up New supplies coming in had to be checked tested and stored in the ship s limited hold space It was like preparing for an extended pack trip into wilderness country once the Lancet left its home base on Hospital Earth it was a world to itself equipped to support its physician crew and provide the necessary equipment and data they would need to deal with the problems they would face Like all patrol ships the Lancet was equipped with automatic launching navigation and drive mechanisms no crew other than the three doctors was required and in the event of mechanical failures maintenance ships were on continual call The ship was responsible for patrolling an enormous area including hundreds of stars and their planetary systems yet its territory was only a tiny segment of the galaxy Landings were to be made at various specified planets maintaining permanent clinic outposts of Hospital Earth certain staple supplies were carried for each of these check points Aside from these lonely clinic contacts the nearest port of call for the Lancet was one of the hospital ships that continuously worked slow orbits through the star systems of the confederation But a hospital ship with its staff of Two star and Three star Physicians was not to be called except in cases of extreme need The probationers on the patrol ships were expected to be self sufficient Their job was to handle diagnosis and care of all but the most difficult problems that arose in their travels They were the first to answer the medical calls from any planet with a medical service contract with Hospital Earth It was an enormous responsibility for doctors in training to assume but over the years it had proven the best way to train and weed out new doctors for the greater responsibilities of hospital ship and Hospital Earth assignments There was no set period of duty on the patrol ships how long a young doctor remained in the General Practice Patrol depended to a large extent upon how well he handled the problems and responsibilities that faced him and since the first years of Hospital Earth the fledgling doctors in the General Practice Patrol the self styled Galactic Pill Peddlers had lived up to their responsibilities The reputation of Hospital Earth rested on their shoulders and they never forgot it As he worked on his inventories Dal Timgar thought of Doctor Arnquist s words to him after the council had handed down its decision Remember that judgment and skill are two different things he had said Without skill in the basic principles of diagnosis and treatment medical judgment isn t much help but skill without the judgment to know how and when to use it can be downright dangerous You ll be judged both on the judgment you use in deciding the right thing to do and on the skill you use in doing it He had given Dal the box with the coveted collar and cuff The colors are pretty but never forget what they stand for Until you can convince the council that you have both the skill and the judgment of a good physician you will never get your Star And you will be watched closely Black Doctor Tanner and certain others will be waiting for the slightest excuse to recall you from the Lancet If you give them the opportunity nothing I can do will stop it And now as they worked to prepare the ship for service Dal was determined that the opportunity would not arise When he was not working in the storerooms he was in the computer room reviewing the thousands of tapes that carried the basic information about the contract planets where they would be visiting and the races that inhabited them If errors and fumbles and mistakes were made by the crew of the Lancet he thought grimly it would not be Dal Timgar who made them The first night they met in the control room to divide the many extracurricular jobs involved in maintaining a patrol ship Tiger s interest in electronics and communications made him the best man to handle the radio he accepted the post without comment Jack you should be in charge of the computer he said because you ll be the one who ll need the information first The lab is probably your field too Dal can be responsible for stores and supplies as well as his own surgical instruments Jack shrugged I d just as soon handle supplies too he said Well there s no need to overload one man Tiger said I wouldn t mind that But when there s something I need I want to be sure it s going to be there without any goof ups Jack said I can handle it all right Dal said Jack just scowled What about the contact man when we make landings he asked Tiger Seems to me Dal would be the one for that too Tiger said His people are traders and bargainers right Dal And first contact with the people on unfamiliar planets can be important It sure can Jack said Too important to take chances with Look this is a ship from Hospital Earth When somebody calls for help they expect to see an Earthman turn up in response What are they going to think when a patrol ship lands and he walks out Tiger s face darkened They ll be able to see his collar and cuff won t they Maybe But they may wonder what he s doing wearing them Well they ll just have to learn Tiger snapped And you ll have to learn too I guess Dal had been sitting silently Now he shook his head I think Jack is right on this one he said It would be better for one of you to be contact man Why Tiger said angrily You re as much of a doctor from Hospital Earth as we are and the sooner we get your position here straight the better We aren t going to have any ugly ducklings on this ship and we aren t going to hide you in the hold every time we land on a planet If we want to make anything but a mess of this cruise we ve got to work as a team and that means everybody shares the important jobs That s fine Dal said but I still think Jack is right on this point If we are walking into a medical problem on a planet where the patrol isn t too well known the contact man by rights ought to be an Earthman Tiger started to say something and then spread his hands helplessly Okay he said If you re satisfied with it let s get on to these other things But obviously he wasn t satisfied and when Jack disappeared toward the storeroom Tiger turned to Dal You shouldn t have given in he said If you give that guy as much as an inch you re just asking for trouble It isn t a matter of giving in Dal insisted I think he was right that s all Don t let s start a fight where we don t have to Tiger yielded the point but when Jack returned Tiger avoided him keeping to himself the rest of the evening And later as he tried to get to sleep Dal wondered for a moment Maybe Tiger was right Maybe he was just dodging a head on clash with the Blue Doctor now and setting the stage for a real collision later Next day the argument was forgotten in the air of rising excitement as embarkation orders for the Lancet came through Preparations were completed and only last minute double checks were required before blast off But an hour before count down began a jitney buzzed across the field and a Two star Pathologist climbed aboard with his three black cloaked orderlies Shakedown inspection he said curtly Just a matter of routine And with that he stalked slowly through the ship checking the storage holds the inventories the lab the computer with its information banks and the control room As he went along he kept firing medical questions at Dal and Tiger hardly pausing long enough for the answers and ignoring Jack Alvarez completely What s the normal range of serum cholesterol in a vegetarian race with Terran environment How would you run a Wenberg electrophoresis How do you determine individual radiation tolerance How would you prepare a heart culture for cardiac transplant on board this ship The questions went on until Tiger and Dal were breathless as count down time grew closer and closer Finally the Black Doctor turned back toward the entrance lock He seemed vaguely disappointed as he checked the record sheets the orderlies had been keeping With an odd look at Dal he shrugged All right here are your clearance papers he said to Jack Your supply of serum globulin fractions is up to black book requirements but you ll run short if you happen to hit a virus epidemic better take on a couple of more cases And check central information just before leaving We ve signed two new contracts in the past week and the company ordinator s office has some advance information on both of them When the inspector had gone Tiger wiped his forehead and sighed That was no routine shakedown he said What is a Wenberg electrophoresis A method of separating serum proteins Jack Alvarez said You ran them in third year biochemistry And if we do hit a virus epidemic you d better know how too He gave Tiger an unpleasant smile and started back down the corridor as the count down signal began to buzz But for all the advance arrangements they had made to divide the ship s work it was Dal Timgar who took complete control of the Lancet for the first two weeks of its cruise Neither Tiger nor Jack challenged his command not a word was raised in protest The Earthmen were too sick to talk much less complain about anything For Dal the blast off from the port of Seattle and the conversion into Koenig star drive was nothing new His father owned a fleet of Garvian trading ships that traveled to the far corners of the galaxy by means of a star drive so similar to the Koenig engines that only an electronic engineer could tell them apart All his life Dal had traveled on the outgoing freighters with his father star drive conversion was no surprise to him But for Jack and Tiger it was their first experience in a star drive ship The Lancet s piloting and navigation were entirely automatic its destination was simply coded into the drive computers and the ship was ready to leap across light years of space in a matter of hours But the conversion to star drive as the Lancet was wrenched crew and all out of the normal space time continuum was far outside of normal human experience The physical and emotional shock of the conversion hit Jack and Tiger like a sledge hammer and during the long hours while the ship was traveling through the time less distance less universe of the drive to the pre set company ordinates where it materialized again into conventional space time the Earthmen were retching violently too sick to budge from the bunk room It took over two weeks with stops at half a dozen contract planets before Jack and Tiger began to adjust themselves to the frightening and confusing sensations of conversion to star drive During this time Dal carried the load of the ship s work alone while the others lay gasping and exhausted in their bunks trying to rally strength for the next shift To his horror Dal discovered that the first planetary stop over was traditionally a hazing stop It had been a well kept patrol secret the outpost clinic on Tempera VI was waiting eagerly for the arrival of the new green crew knowing full well that the doctors aboard would hardly be able to stumble out of their bunks much less to cope with medical problems The outpost men had concocted a medical crisis of staggering proportions to present to the Lancet s crew they were so clearly disappointed to find the ship s Red Doctor in full command of himself that Dal obligingly became violently ill too and did his best to mimick Jack and Tiger s floundering efforts to pull themselves together and do something about the problem that suddenly descended upon them Later there was a party and celebration with music and food as the clinic staff welcomed the pale and shaken doctors into the joke The outpost men plied Dal for the latest news from Hospital Earth They were surprised to see a Garvian aboard the Lancet but no one at the outpost showed any sign of resentment at the scarlet braid on Dal s collar and cuff Slowly Jack and Tiger got used to the peculiarities of popping in and out of hyperspace It was said that immunity to star drive sickness was hard to acquire but lasted a lifetime and would never again bother them once it was achieved Bit by bit the Earthmen crept out of their shells to find the ship in order and a busy Dal Timgar relieved and happy to have them aboard again Fortunately the medical problems that came to the Lancet in the first few weeks were largely routine The ship stopped at the specified contact points some far out near the rim of the galactic constellation others in closer to the densely star populated center At each outpost clinic the Lancet was welcomed with open arms The outpost men were hungry for news from home and happy to see fresh supplies but they were also glad to review the current medical problems on their planets with the new doctors exchanging opinions and arguing diagnosis and therapy into the small hours of the night Occasionally calls came in to the ship from contract planets in need of help Usually the problems were easy to handle On Singall III a tiny planet of a cooling giant star help was needed to deal with a new outbreak of a smallpox like plague that had once decimated the population the disease had finally been controlled after a Hospital Earth research team had identified the organism that caused it determined its molecular structure and synthesized an antibiotic that could destroy it without damaging the body of the host But now a flareup had occurred The Lancet brought in supplies of the antibiotic and Tiger Martin spent two days showing Singallese physicians how to control further outbreaks with modern methods of immunization and antisepsis Another planet called for a patrol ship when a bridge building disaster occurred one of the beetle like workmen had been badly crushed under a massive steel girder Dal spent over eighteen hours straight with the patient in the Lancet s surgery carefully repairing the creature s damaged exoskeleton and grafting new segments of bone for regeneration of the hopelessly ruined parts with Tiger administering anaesthesia and Jack preparing the grafts from the freezer On another planet Jack faced his first real diagnostic challenge and met the test with flying colors Here a new cancer like degenerative disease had been appearing among the natives of the planet It had never before been noted Initial attempts to find a causative agent had all three of the Lancet s crew spending sleepless nights for a week but Jack s careful study of the pattern of the disease and the biochemical reactions that accompanied it brought out the answer the disease was caused by a rare form of genetic change which made crippling alterations in an essential enzyme system Knowing this Tiger quickly found a drug which could be substituted for the damaged enzyme and the problem was solved They left the planet assuring the planetary government that laboratories on Hospital Earth would begin working at once to find a way actually to rebuild the damaged genes in the embryonic cells and thus put a permanent end to the disease These were routine calls the kind of ordinary general medical work that the patrol ships were expected to handle But the visits to the various planets were welcome breaks in the pattern of patrol ship life The Lancet was fully equipped but her crew s quarters and living space were cramped Under the best conditions the crewmen on patrol ships got on each other s nerves on the Lancet there was an additional focus of tension that grew worse with every passing hour From the first Jack Alvarez had made no pretense of pleasure at Dal s company but now it seemed that he deliberately sought opportunities to annoy him The thin Blue Doctor s face set into an angry mold whenever Dal was around He would get up and leave when Dal entered the control room and complained loudly and bitterly at minor flaws in Dal s shipboard work Nothing Dal did seemed to please him But Tiger had a worse time controlling himself at the Blue Doctor s digs and slights than Dal did It s like living in an armed camp he complained one night when Jack had stalked angrily out of the bunk room Can t even open your mouth without having him jump down your throat I know Dal said And he s doing it on purpose Maybe so But it won t help to lose your temper Tiger clenched a huge fist and slammed it into his palm He s just deliberately picking at you and picking at you he said You can t take that forever Something s got to break It s all right Dal assured him I just ignore it But when Jack began to shift his attack to Fuzzy Dal could ignore it no longer One night in the control room Jack threw down the report he was writing and turned angrily on Dal Tell your friend there to turn the other way before I lose my temper and splatter him all over the wall he said pointing to Fuzzy All he does is sit there and stare at me and I m getting fed up with it Fuzzy drew himself up tightly shivering on Dal s shoulder Dal reached up and stroked the tiny creature and Fuzzy s shoe button eyes disappeared completely There Dal said Is that better Jack stared at the place the eyes had been and his face darkened suspiciously Well what happened to them he demanded What happened to what To his eyes you idiot Dal looked down at Fuzzy I don t see any eyes Jack jumped up from the stool He scowled at Fuzzy as if commanding the eyes to come back again All he saw was a small ball of pink fur Look he s been blinking them at me for a week he snarled I thought all along there was something funny about him Sometimes he s got legs and sometimes he hasn t Sometimes he looks fuzzy and other times he hasn t got any hair at all He s a pleomorph Dal said No cellular structure at all just a protein colloid matrix Jack glowered at the inert little pink lump Don t be silly he said curious in spite of himself What holds him together Who knows I don t Some kind of electro chemical cohesive force The only reason he has eyes is because he thinks I want him to have eyes If you don t like it he won t have them any more Well that s very obliging Jack said But why do you keep him around What good does he do you anyhow All he does is eat and drink and sleep Does he have to do something Dal said evasively He isn t bothering you Why pick on him He just seems to worry you an awful lot Jack said unpleasantly Let s see him a minute He reached out for Fuzzy then jerked his finger back with a yelp Blood dripped from the finger tip Jack s face slowly went white Why he he bit me Yes and you re lucky he didn t take a finger off Dal said trembling with anger He doesn t like you any more than I do and you ll get bit every time you come near him so you d better keep your hands to yourself Don t worry Jack Alvarez said he won t get another chance You can just get rid of him Not a chance Dal said You leave him alone and he won t bother you that s all And the same thing goes for me If he isn t out of here in twelve hours I ll get a warrant Jack said tightly There are laws against keeping dangerous pets on patrol ships Somewhere in the main corridor an alarm bell began buzzing For a moment Dal and Jack stood frozen glaring at each other Then the door burst open and Tiger Martin s head appeared Hey you two let s get moving We ve got a call coming in and it looks like a tough one Come on back here They headed back toward the radio room The signal was coming through frantically as Tiger reached for the pile of punched tape running out on the floor But as they crowded into the radio room Dal felt Jack s hand on his arm If you think I was fooling you re wrong the Blue Doctor said through his teeth You ve got twelve hours to get rid of him CHAPTER five CRISIS ON MORUA VIII The three doctors huddled around the teletype watching as the decoded message was punched out on the tape It started coming in just now Tiger said And they ve been beaming the signal in a spherical pattern apparently trying to pick up the nearest ship they could get There s certainly some sort of trouble going on The message was brief repeated over and over REQUIRE MEDICAL AID URGENT REPLY AT ONCE This was followed by the code letters that designated the planet its location and the number of its medical service contract Jack glanced at the code Morua VIII he said I think that s a grade I contract He began punching buttons on the reference panel and several screening cards came down the slot from the information bank Yes The eighth planet of a large Sol type star the only inhabited planet in the system with a single intelligent race ursine evolutionary pattern He handed the cards to Tiger Teddy bears yet Mammals Tiger said Looks like it And they even hibernate What about the contract Dal asked Grade I said Tiger And they ve had a thorough survey Moderately advanced in their own medical care but they have full medical coverage any time they think they need it We d better get an acknowledgment back to them Jack get the ship ready to star jump while Dal starts digging information out of the bank If this race has its own doctors they d only be hollering for help if they re up against a tough one Tiger settled down with earphones and transmitter to try to make contact with the Moruan planet while Jack went forward to control and Dal started to work with the tape reader There was no argument now and no dissension The procedure to be followed was a well established routine acknowledge the call estimate arrival time relay the call and response to the programmers on Hospital Earth prepare for star drive and start gathering data fast With no hint of the nature of the trouble their job was to get there equipped with as much information about the planet and its people as time allowed The Moruan system was not distant from the Lancet s present location Tiger calculated that two hours in Koenig drive would put the ship in the vicinity of the planet with another hour required for landing procedures He passed the word on to the others and Dal began digging through the mass of information in the tape library on Morua VIII and its people There was a wealth of data Morua VIII had signed one of the first medical service contracts with Hospital Earth and a thorough medical biochemical social and psychological survey had been made on the people of that world Since the original survey much additional information had been amassed based on patrol ship reports and dozens of specialty studies that had been done there And out of this data a picture of Morua VIII and its inhabitants began to emerge The Moruans were moderately intelligent creatures warm blooded air breathers with an oxygen based metabolism Their planet was cold with seventeen per cent oxygen and much water vapor in its atmosphere With its vast snow fields and great mountain ranges the planet was a popular resort area for oxygen breathing creatures most of the natives were engaged in some work related to winter sports They were well fitted anatomically for their climate with thick black fur broad flat hind feet and a four inch layer of fat between their skin and their vital organs Swiftly Dal reviewed the emergency file checking for common drugs and chemicals that were poisonous to Moruans accidents that were common to the race and special problems that had been met by previous patrol ships The deeper he dug into the mass of data the more worried he became Where should he begin Searching in the dark there was no way to guess what information would be necessary and what part totally useless He buzzed Tiger Any word on the nature of the trouble he asked Just got through to them Tiger said Not too much to go on but they re really in an uproar Sounds like they ve started some kind of organ transplant surgery and their native surgeon got cold feet halfway through and wants us to bail him out Tiger paused I think this is going to be your show Dal Better check up on Moruan anatomy It was better than no information but not much better Fuzzy huddled on Dal s shoulder as if he could sense his master s excitement Very few races under contract with Hospital Earth ever attempted their own major surgery If a Moruan surgeon had walked into a tight spot in the operating room it could be a real test of skill to get him and his patient out of it even on a relatively simple procedure But organ transplantation with the delicate vascular surgery and micro surgery that it entailed was never simple In incompetent hands it could turn into a nightmare Dal took a deep breath and began running the anatomical atlas tapes through the reader checking the critical points of Moruan anatomy Oxygen transfer system circulatory system renal filtration system at first glance there was little resemblance to any of the typical oxygen breathing mammals Dal had studied in medical school But then something struck a familiar note and he remembered studying the peculiar Moruan renal system in which the creature s chemical waste products were filtered from the bloodstream in a series of tubules passing across the peritoneum and re absorbed into the intestine for excretion Bit by bit other points of the anatomy came clear and in half an hour of intense study Dal began to see how the inhabitants of Morua VIII were put together Satisfied for the moment he then pulled the tapes that described the Moruans own medical advancement What were they doing attempting organ transplantation anyway That was the kind of surgery that even experienced Star Surgeons preferred to take aboard the hospital ships or back to Hospital Earth where the finest equipment and the most skilled assistants were available There was a signal buzzer the two minute warning before the Koenig drive took over Dal tossed the tape spools back into the bin for refiling and went forward to the control room Just short of two hours later the Lancet shifted back to normal space drive and the cold yellow sun of the Moruan system swam into sight in the viewscreen Far below the tiny eighth planet glistened like a snowball in the reflection of the sun with only occasional rents in the cloud blanket revealing the ragged surface below The doctors watched as the ship went into descending orbit skimming the outer atmosphere and settling into a landing pattern Beneath the cloud blanket the frigid surface of the planet spread out before them Great snow covered mountain ranges rose up on either side A forty mile gale howled across the landing field sweeping clouds of powdery snow before it A huge gawky vehicle seemed to be waiting for the ship to land it shot out from the huddle of gray buildings almost the moment they touched down Jack slipped into the furs that he had pulled from stores and went out through the entrance lock and down the ladder to meet the dark furry creatures that were bundling out of the vehicle below The electronic language translator was strapped to his chest Five minutes later he reappeared frost forming on his blue collar his face white as he looked at Dal You d better get down there right away he said and take your micro surgical instruments Tiger give me a hand with the anaesthesia tanks They re keeping a patient alive with a heart lung machine right now and they can t finish the job It looks like it might be bad The Moruan who escorted them across the city to the hospital was a huge shaggy creature who left no question of the evolutionary line of his people Except for the flattened nose the high forehead and the fur less hand with opposing thumb he looked for all the world like a mammoth edition of the Kodiak bears Dal had seen displayed at the natural history museum in Hospital Philadelphia Like all creatures with oxygen and water based metabolisms the Moruans could trace their evolutionary line to minute one celled salt water creatures but with the bitter cold of the planet the first land creatures to emerge from the primeval swamp of Morua VIII had developed the heavy furs and the hibernation characteristics of bear like mammals They towered over Dal and even Tiger seemed dwarfed by their immense chest girth and powerful shoulders As the surface car hurried toward the hospital Dal probed for more information The Moruan s voice was a hoarse growl which nearly deafened the Earthmen in the confined quarters of the car but Dal with the aid of the translator could piece together what had happened More sophisticated in medical knowledge than most races in the galaxy the Moruans had learned a great deal from their contact with Hospital Earth physicians They actually did have a remarkable grasp of physiology and biochemistry and constantly sought to learn more They had already found ways to grow replacement organs from embryonic grafts the Moruan said and by copying the techniques used by the surgeons of Hospital Earth their own surgeons had attempted the delicate job of replacing a diseased organ with a new healthy one in a young male afflicted with cancer Dal looked up at the Moruan doctor What organ were you replacing he asked suspiciously Oh not the entire organ just a segment the Moruan said The tumor had caused an obstructive pneumonia Are you talking about a segment of lung Dal said almost choking Of course That s where the tumor was Dal swallowed hard So you just decided to replace a segment Yes But something has gone wrong we don t know what I see It was all Dal could do to keep from shouting at the huge creature The Moruans had no duplication of organs such as Earthmen and certain other races had A tumor of the lung would mean death but the technique of grafting a culture grown lung segment to a portion of natural lung required enormous surgical skill and the finest microscopic instruments that could be made in order to suture together the tiny capillary walls and air tubules And if one lung were destroyed a Moruan had no other to take its place Do you have any micro surgical instruments at all Oh yes the Moruan rumbled proudly We made them ourselves just for this case You mean you ve never attempted this procedure before This was the first time We don t know where we went wrong You went wrong when you thought about trying it Dal muttered What anaesthesia Oxygen and alcohol vapor This was no surprise With many species alcohol vapor was more effective and less toxic than other anaesthetic gases And you have a heart lung machine The finest available on lease from Hospital Earth All the way through the city Dal continued the questioning and by the time they reached the hospital he had an idea of the task that was facing him He knew now that it was going to be bad he didn t realize just how bad until he walked into the operating room The patient was barely alive Recognizing too late that they were in water too deep for them the Moruan surgeons had gone into panic and neglected the very fundamentals of physiological support for the creature on the table Dal had to climb up on a platform just to see the operating field the faithful wheeze of the heart lung machine that was sustaining the creature continued in Dal s ears as he examined the work already done first with the naked eye then scanning the operative field with the crude microscopic eyepiece How long has he been anaesthetized he asked the shaggy operating surgeon Over eighteen hours already And how much blood has he received A dozen liters Any more on hand Perhaps six more Well you d better get it into him He s in shock right now The surgeon scurried away while Dal took another look at the micro field The situation was bad the anaesthesia had already gone on too long and the blood chemistry record showed progressive failure He stepped down from the platform trying to clear his head and decide the right thing to do He had done micro surgery before plenty of it and he knew the techniques necessary to complete the job but the thought of attempting it chilled him At best he was on unfamiliar ground with a dozen factors that could go wrong By now the patient was a dreadful risk for any surgeon If he were to step in now and the patient died how would he explain not calling for help He stepped out to the scrub room where Tiger was waiting Where s Jack he said Went back to the ship for the rest of the surgical pack Dal shook his head I don t know what to do I think we should get him to a hospital ship Is it more than you can handle Tiger said I could probably do it all right but I could lose him too A frown creased Tiger s face Dal it would take six hours for a hospital ship to get here I know that But on the other hand Dal spread his hands He felt Fuzzy crouching in a tight frightened lump in his pocket He thought again of the delicate painstaking microscopic work that remained to be done to bring the new section of lung into position to function and he shook his head Look these creatures hibernate he said If we could get him cooled down enough we could lighten the anaesthesia and maintain him as is indefinitely This is up to you Tiger said I don t know anything about surgery If you think we should just hold tight that s what we ll do All right I think we d better Have them notify Jack to signal for a hospital ship We ll just try to stick it out Tiger left to pass the word and Dal went back into the operating room Suddenly he felt as if a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders There would be Three star Surgeons on a Hospital Ship to handle this it seemed an enormous relief to have the task out of his hands Yet something was wriggling uncomfortably in the back of his mind a quiet little voice saying this isn t right you should be doing this yourself right now instead of wasting precious time He thrust the thought away angrily and ordered the Moruan physicians to bring in ice packs to cool the patient s huge hulk down to hibernation temperatures We re going to send for help Dal told the Moruan surgeon who had met them at the ship This man needs specialized care and we d be taking too much chance to try to do it this way You mean you re sending for a hospital ship That s right Dal said This news seemed to upset the Moruans enormously They began growling among themselves moving back from the operating table Then you can t save him the operating surgeon said I think he can be saved certainly But we thought you could just step in I could but that would be taking chances that we don t need to take We can maintain him until the hospital ship arrives The Moruans continued to growl ominously but Dal brushed past them checking the vital signs of the patient as his body temperature slowly dropped Tiger had taken over the anaesthesia keeping the patient under as light a dosage of medication as was possible What s eating them he asked Dal quietly They don t want a hospital ship here very much Dal said Afraid they ll look like fools all over the Confederation if the word gets out But that s their worry Ours is to keep this bruiser alive until the ship gets here They settled back to wait It was an agonizing time for Dal Even Fuzzy didn t seem to be much comfort The patient was clearly not doing well even with the low body temperatures Dal had induced His blood pressure was sagging and at one time Tiger sat up sharply staring at his anaesthesia dials and frowning in alarm as the nervous system reactions flagged The Moruan physicians hovered about increasingly uneasy as they saw the doctors from Hospital Earth waiting and doing nothing One of them unable to control himself any longer tore off his sterile gown and stalked angrily out of the operating suite A dozen times Dal was on the verge of stepping in It was beginning to look now like a race with time and precious minutes were passing by He cursed himself inwardly for not taking the bit in his teeth at the beginning and going ahead the best he could it had been a mistake in judgment to wait Now as minutes passed into hours it looked more and more like a mistake that was going to cost the life of a patient Then there was a murmur of excitement outside the operating room and word came in that another ship had been sighted making landing maneuvers Dal clenched his fists praying that the patient would last until the hospital ship crew arrived But the ship that was landing was not a hospital ship Someone turned on a TV scanner and picked up the image of a small ship hardly larger than a patrol ship with just two passengers stepping down the ladder to the ground Then the camera went close up Dal saw the faces of the two men and his heart sank One was a Four star Surgeon resplendent in flowing red cape and glistening silver insignia Dal did not recognize the man but the four stars meant that he was a top ranking physician in the Red Service of Surgery The other passenger gathering his black cloak and hood around him as he faced the blistering wind on the landing field was Black Doctor Hugo Tanner Moments after the Four star Surgeon arrived at the hospital he was fully and unmistakably in command of the situation He gave Dal an icy stare then turned to the Moruan operating surgeon whom he seemed to know very well After a short barrage of questions and answers he scrubbed and gowned and stalked past Dal to the crude Moruan micro surgical control table It took him exactly fifteen seconds to scan the entire operating field through the viewer discussing the anatomy as the Moruan surgeon watched on a connecting screen Then without hesitation he began manipulating the micro instruments Once or twice he murmured something to Tiger at the anaesthesia controls and occasionally he nodded reassurance to the Moruan surgeon He did not even invite Dal to observe Ten minutes later he rose from the control table and threw the switch to stop the heart lung machine The patient took a gasping breath on his own then another and another The Four star Surgeon stripped off his gown and gloves with a flourish It will be all right he said to the Moruan physician An excellent job Doctor excellent he said Your technique was flawless except for the tiny matter you have just observed It was not until they were outside the operating room and beyond earshot of the Moruan doctors that the Four star surgeon turned furiously to Dal Didn t you even bother to examine the operating field Doctor Where did you study surgery Couldn t you tell that the fools had practically finished the job themselves All that was needed was a simple great vessel graft which an untrained idiot could have done blindfolded And for this you call me clear from Hospital Earth The surgeon threw down his mask in disgust and stalked away leaving Dal and Tiger staring at each other in dismay CHAPTER six TIGER MAKES A PROMISE I think Black Doctor Hugo Tanner said ominously that an explanation is in order I would now like to hear it And believe me gentlemen it had better be a very sensible explanation too The pathologist was sitting in the control room of the Lancet his glasses slightly askew on his florid face He had climbed through the entrance lock ten minutes before shaking snow off his cloak and wheezing like a boiler about to explode now he faced the patrol ship s crew like a small but ominous black thundercloud Across the room Jack Alvarez was staring through the viewscreen at the blizzard howling across the landing field below a small satisfied smile on his face while Tiger sulked with his hands jammed into his trousers Dal sat by himself feeling very much alone with Fuzzy peering discreetly out of his jacket pocket He knew the Black Doctor was speaking to him but he didn t try to reply He had known from the moment the surgeon came out of the operating room that he was in trouble It was just a matter of time before he would have to answer for his decision here and it was even something of a relief that the moment came sooner rather than later And the more Dal considered his position the more indefensible it appeared Time after time he had thought of doctor Arnquist s words about judgment and skill Without one the other was of little value to a doctor and whatever his skill as a surgeon might have been in the Moruan operating room he now realized that his judgment had been poor He had allowed himself to panic at a critical moment and had failed to see how far the surgery had really progressed By deciding to wait for help to arrive instead of taking over at once he had placed the patient in even greater jeopardy than before In looking back Dal could see clearly that it would have been far better judgment to proceed on his own But that was how it looked now not then and there was an old saying that the retrospectoscope was the only infallible instrument in all medicine In any event the thing was done and couldn t be changed and Dal knew that he could only stand on what he had done right or wrong Well I m waiting Black Doctor Tanner said scowling at Dal through his thick rimmed glasses I want to know who was responsible for this fiasco and why it occurred in the first place Dal spread his hands hopelessly What do you want me to say he asked I took a careful history of the situation as soon as we arrived here and then I examined the patient in the operating room I thought the surgery might be over my head and couldn t see attempting it if a hospital ship could be reached in time I thought the patient could be maintained safely long enough for us to call for help I see the Black Doctor said You ve done micro surgery before Yes sir And organ transplant work Yes sir The Black Doctor opened a folder and peered at it over his glasses As a matter of fact you spent two solid years in micro surgical training in Hospital Philadelphia with all sorts of glowing reports from your preceptors about what a flair you had for the work Dal shook his head I I did some work in the field yes but not on critical cases under field conditions You mean that this case required some different kind of technique than the cases you ve worked on before No not really but But you just couldn t quite shoulder the responsibility the job involved when you got into a pinch without any help around the Black Doctor growled I just thought it would be safer to wait Dal said helplessly A good conservative approach doctor Tanner sneered Of course you realized that prolonged anaesthesia in itself could threaten that patient s life Yes sir And you saw the patient s condition steadily deteriorating while you waited did you not It was too late to change my mind then Dal said desperately We d sent for you We knew that it would be only a matter of hours before you arrived Indeed the Black Doctor said Unfortunately it takes only seconds for a patient to cross the line between life and death not hours And I suppose you would have stood there quietly and allowed him to expire if we had not arrived at the time we did Dal shook his head miserably There was nothing he could answer to that and he realized it What could he say That the situation seemed quite different now than it had under pressure in the Moruan operating room That he would have been blamed just as much if he had gone ahead and then lost the case His fingers stole down to Fuzzy s soft warm body for comfort and he felt the little creature cling closer to his side The Black Doctor looked up at the others Well What do the rest of you have to say Jack Alvarez shrugged his shoulders I m not a surgeon he said but even I could see that something should be done without delay And what does the Green Doctor think Tiger shrugged We misjudged the situation that s all It came out fortunately for the patient why make all this fuss about it Because there are other things at stake than just medical considerations the Black Doctor shot back This planet has a grade I contract with Hospital Earth We guarantee them full medical coverage of all situations and promise them immediate response to any call for medical help that they may send us It is the most favorable kind of contract we have when Morua VIII calls for help they expect their call to be answered by expert medical attention not by inept bungling The Black Doctor leafed through the folder in his hands We have built our reputation in the Galactic Confederation on this kind of contract and our admission to full membership in the Confederation will ultimately depend upon how we fulfill our promises Poor medical judgment cannot be condoned under any circumstances but above all we cannot afford to jeopardize a contract Dal stared at him I I had no intention of jeopardizing a contract he faltered Perhaps not the Black Doctor said But you were the doctor on the spot and you were so obviously incompetent to handle the situation that even these clumsy Moruan surgeons could see it Their faith in the doctors from Hospital Earth has been severely shaken They are even talking of letting their contract lapse at the end of this term Tiger Martin jumped to his feet Doctor Tanner even Four star Surgeons lose patients sometimes These people should be glad that the doctor they call has sense enough to call for help if he needs it But no help was needed the Black Doctor said angrily Any half decent surgeon would have handled the case If the Moruans see a patrol ship bring in one incompetent doctor what are they going to expect the next time they have need for help How can they feel sure that their medical needs are well taken care of He shook his head grimly This is the sort of responsibility that doctors on the patrol ships are expected to assume If you call for help where there is need for help no one will ever complain but when you turn and run the moment things get tough you are not fit for patrol ship service The Black Doctor turned to Dal Timgar You had ample warning he said It was clearly understood that your assignment on this ship depended upon the fulfillment of the duties of Red Doctor here and now at the first real test you turn and run instead of doing your job All right You had your opportunity You can t complain that we haven t given you a chance According to the conduct code of the General Practice Patrol section XIV paragraph two any physician in the patrol on probationary status who is found delinquent in executing his duties may be relieved of his assignment at the order of any Black Doctor or any other physician of four star rank Doctor Tanner closed the folder with a snap of finality It seems to me that the case is clear Dal Timgar on the authority of the Code I am now relieving you of duty Just a minute Tiger Martin burst out The Black Doctor looked up at him Well This is ridiculous Tiger said Why are you picking on him Or do you mean that you re relieving all three of us Of course I m not relieving all three of you the Black Doctor snapped You and doctor Alvarez will remain on duty and conduct the ship s program without a Red Doctor until a man is sent to replace this bungler That also is provided for in the code But I understood that we were operating as a diagnostic and therapeutic team Tiger protested And I seem to remember something in the code about fixing responsibility before a man can be relieved There s no question where the responsibility lies the Black Doctor said his face darkening This was a surgical problem and Dal Timgar made the decisions I don t see anything to argue There s plenty to argue Tiger said Dal don t you see what he s trying to do Across the room Dal shook his head wearily You d better keep out of it Tiger he said Why should I keep out of it and let you be drummed out of the patrol for something that wasn t even your fault Tiger said He turned angrily to the Black Doctor Dal wasn t the one that wanted the hospital ship called he said I was If you re going to relieve somebody you d better make it me The Black Doctor pulled off his glasses and glared at Tiger Whatever are you talking about he said Just what I said We had a conference after he d examined the patient in the operating room and I insisted that we call the hospital ship Why Dal Dal wanted to go ahead and try to finish the case right then and I wouldn t let him Tiger blundered on I didn t think the patient could take it I thought that it would be too great a risk with the facilities we had here Dal was staring at Tiger and he felt Fuzzy suddenly shivering violently in his pocket Tiger don t be foolish The Black Doctor slammed the file down on the table again Is this true what he s saying he asked Dal No not a word of it Dal said I wanted to call the hospital ship Of course he won t admit it Tiger said angrily He s afraid you ll kick me out too but it s true just the same in spite of what he says And what do you say the Black Doctor said turning to Jack Alvarez I say it s carrying this big brother act too far Jack said I didn t notice any conferences going on You were back at the ship getting the surgical pack Tiger said You didn t know anything about it You didn t hear us talking and we didn t see any reason to consult you about it The Black Doctor stared from Dal to Tiger his face growing angrier by the minute He jerked to his feet and stalked back and forth across the control room glaring at them Then he took a capsule from his pocket gulped it down with some water and sat back down I ought to throw you both out on your ears he snarled But I am forced to control myself I mustn t allow myself to get angry He crashed his fist down on the control panel I suppose that you would swear to this statement of yours if it came to that he asked Tiger Tiger nodded and swallowed hard Yes sir I certainly would All right the Black Doctor said tightly Then you win this one The code says that two opinions can properly decide any course of action If you insist that two of you agreed on this decision then I am forced to support you officially I will make a report of the incident to patrol headquarters and it will go on the permanent records of all three of this ship s crew including my personal opinion of the decision He looked up at Dal But be very careful my young friend Next time you may not have a technicality to back you up and I ll be watching for the first plausible excuse to break you and your Green Doctor friend as well One misstep and you re through And I assure you that is not just an idle threat I mean every word of it And trembling with rage the Black Doctor picked up the folder wrapped his cape around him and marched out of the control room Well you put on a great show Jack Alvarez said later as they prepared the ship for launching from the snow swept landing field on Morua VIII An hour before the ground had trembled as the Black Doctor s ship took off with doctor Tanner and the Four star Surgeon aboard now Jack broke the dark silence in the Lancet s control room for the first time A really great show You missed your calling Tiger You should have been on the stage If you think you fooled doctor Tanner with that story for half a second you re crazy but I guess you got what you wanted You kept your pal s cuff and collar for him and you put a black mark on all of our records including mine I hope you re satisfied Tiger Martin took off his earphones and set them carefully on the control panel You know he said to Jack you re lucky Really You re lucky I don t wipe that sneer off your face and scrub the walls with it And you d better not crowd your luck because all I need right now is an invitation He stood up towering over the dark haired Blue Doctor You bet I m satisfied And if you got a black mark along with the rest of us you earned it all the way That still doesn t make it right Dal said from across the room You just keep out of this for a minute Tiger said Jack has got to get a couple of things straight and this is the time for it right now Dal shook his head I can t keep out of it he said You got me off the hook by shifting the blame but you put yourself in trouble doing it doctor Tanner could just as well have thrown us both out of the service as not Tiger snorted On what grounds For a petty little error like this He wouldn t dare You ought to read the log books of some of the other GPP ships some time and see the kind of bloopers they pull without even a reprimand Don t worry he was mad enough to throw us both out if he thought he could make it stick but he knew he couldn t He knew the council would just review the case and reverse his decision It was still my error not yours Dal protested I should have gone ahead and finished the case on the spot I knew it at the time and I just didn t quite dare So you made a mistake Tiger said You ll make a dozen more before you get your Star and if none of them amount to any more than this one you can be very happy He scowled at Jack It s only thanks to our friend here that the Black Doctor heard about this at all A hospital ship would have come to take the patient aboard and the local doctors would have been quieted down and that would have been all there was to it This business about losing a contract is a lot of nonsense Then you think this thing was just used as an excuse to get at me Ask him Tiger said looking at Jack again Ask him why a Black Doctor and a Four star Surgeon turned up when we just called for a hospital ship I called the hospital ship Jack said sullenly But you called doctor Tanner too said Tiger Your nose has been out of joint ever since Dal came aboard this ship You ve made things as miserable for him as you could and you just couldn t wait for a chance to come along to try to scuttle him All right Jack said but he was making a mistake Anybody could see that What if the patient had died while he was standing around waiting Isn t that important Tiger started to answer and then threw up his hands in disgust It s important but something else is more important We ve got a job to do on this ship and we can t do it fighting each other Dal misjudged a case and got in trouble Fine he won t make that mistake again It could just as well have been you or me We ll all make mistakes but if we can t work as a team we re sunk We ll all be drummed out of the patrol before a year is out Tiger stopped to catch his breath his face flushed with anger Well I m fed up with this back stabbing business I don t want a fight any more than Dal does but if I have to fight I ll fight to get it over with and you d better be careful If you pull any more sly ones you d better include me in the deal because if Dal goes I go too And that s a promise There was silence for a moment as Jack stared up at Tiger s angry face He shook his head and blinked as though he couldn t quite believe what he was hearing He looked across at Dal and then back at Tiger again You mean you d turn in your collar and cuff he said If it came to that I see Jack sat down at the control panel still shaking his head I think you really mean it he said soberly This isn t just a big brother act You really like the guy don t you Maybe I do Tiger said but I don t like to watch anybody get kicked around just because somebody else doesn t happen to like him The control room was very quiet Then somewhere below a motor clicked on and the ventilation fan made a quiet whirring sound The teletype clicked sporadically down the corridor in the communications room Dal sat silently rubbing Fuzzy between the eyes and watching the two Earthmen It seemed suddenly as if they were talking about somebody a million miles away as if he were not even in the room Then the Blue Doctor shrugged and rose to his feet All right he said to Tiger I guess I just didn t understand where you stood and I suppose it wasn t my job to let the Black Doctor know about the situation here I don t plan to be making all the mistakes you think we re going to make and I won t take the blame for anybody else s but I guess we ve got to work together in the tight spots He gave Dal a lop sided grin Welcome aboard he said We d better get this crate airborne before the people here come and cart it away They moved then and the subject was dropped Half an hour later the Lancet lifted through the atmospheric pull of the Moruan planet and moved on toward the next contact point leaving the recovering patient in the hands of the native physicians It was not until hours later that Dal noticed that Fuzzy had stopped quivering and was resting happily and securely on his shoulder even when the Blue Doctor was near CHAPTER seven ALARUMS AND EXCURSIONS Once more the crew of the Lancet settled down to routine and the incident on Morua VIII seemed almost forgotten But a change had come about in the relations between the three doctors and in every way the change was for the better If Jack Alvarez was not exactly cordial to Dal Timgar at least he had dropped the open antagonism that he had shown before Apparently Tiger s angry outburst had startled Jack as though he had never really considered that the big Earthman might honestly be attached to his friend from Garv II and the Blue Doctor seemed sincere in his agreement to work with Dal and Tiger as a team But bit by bit Dal could sense that the change in Jack s attitude went deeper than the surface You know I really think he was scared of me Dal said one night when he and Tiger were alone Sounds silly but I think it s true He pretends to be so sure of himself but I think he s as worried about doing things wrong as we are and just won t admit it And he really thought I was a threat when I came aboard He probably had a good thorough briefing from Black Doctor Tanner before he got the assignment Tiger said grimly Maybe but somehow I don t think he cares for the Black Doctor much more than we do But whatever the reason much of the tension was gone when the Lancet had left the Moruan system behind A great weight seemed to have been lifted and if there was not quite peace on board at least there was an uneasy truce Tiger and Jack were almost friendly talking together more often and getting to know each other better Jack still avoided Dal and seldom included him in conversations but the open contempt of the first few weeks on the ship now seemed tempered somewhat Once again the Lancet s calls fell into a pattern Landings on the outpost planets became routine bright spots in a lonely and wandering existence The calls that came in represented few real problems The ship stopped at one contract planet to organize a mass inoculation program against a parasitic infestation resembling malaria They paused at another place to teach the native doctors the use of some new surgical instruments that had been developed in Hospital Earth laboratories just for them Frantic emergency calls usually proved to involve trivial problems but once or twice potentially serious situations were spotted early before they could develop into real trouble And as the three doctors got used to the responsibilities of a patrol ship s rounds and grew more confident of their ability to handle the problems thrust upon them they found themselves working more and more efficiently as a team This was the way the General Practice Patrol was supposed to function Each doctor had unsuspected skills that came to light There was no questioning Jack Alvarez s skill as a diagnostician but it seemed uncanny to Dal the way the slender dark haired Earthman could listen carefully to a medical problem of an alien race on a remote planet and then seem to know exactly which questions to ask to draw out the significant information about the situation Tiger was not nearly as quick and clever as Jack he needed more time to ponder a question of medical treatment and he would often spend long hours poring over the data tapes before deciding what to do in a given case but he always seemed to come up with an answer and his answers usually worked Above all Tiger s relations with the odd life forms they encountered were invariably good the creatures seemed to like him and would follow his instructions faithfully Dal too had opportunities to demonstrate that his surgical skill and judgment was not universally faulty in spite of the trouble on Morua VIII More than once he succeeded in almost impossible surgical cases where there was no time to call for help and little by little he could sense Jack s growing confidence in his abilities grudging though it might be Dal had ample time to mull over the thing that had happened on Morua VIII and to think about the interview with Black Doctor Tanner afterward He knew he was glad that Tiger had intervened even on the basis of a falsehood until Tiger had spoken up Dal had been certain that the Black Doctor fully intended to use the incident as an excuse to discharge him from the General Practice Patrol There was no question in his mind that the Black Doctor s charges had been exaggerated into a trumped up case against him and there was no question that Tiger s insistence on taking the blame had saved him he could not help being thankful Yet there was something about it that disturbed Dal nibbling away persistently at his mind He couldn t throw off the feeling that his own acceptance of Tiger s help had been wrong Part of it he knew was his native inbred loathing for falsehood Fair or unfair Dal had always disliked lying Among his people the truth might be bent occasionally but frank lying was considered a deep disgrace and there was a Garvian saying that a false tongue wins no true friends Garvian traders were known throughout the Galaxy as much for their rigid adherence to their word as they were for the hard bargains they could drive Dal had been enormously confused during his first months on Hospital Earth by the way Earthmen seemed to accept lying as part of their daily life unconcerned about it as long as the falsehood could not be proven But something else about Tiger s defense of him bothered Dal far more than the falsehood something that had vaguely disturbed him ever since he had known the big Earthman and that now seemed to elude him every time he tried to pinpoint it Lying in his bunk during a sleep period Dal remembered vividly the first time he had met Tiger early in the second year of medical school Dal had almost despaired by then of making friends with his hostile and resentful classmates and had begun more and more to avoid contact with them building up a protective shell and relying on Fuzzy for company or comfort Then Tiger had found him eating lunch by himself in the medical school lounge one day and flopped down in the seat beside him and began talking as if Dal were just another classmate Tiger s open friendliness had been like a spring breeze to Dal who was desperately lonely in this world of strangers their friendship had grown rapidly and gradually others in the class had begun to thaw enough at least to be civil when Dal was around Dal had sensed that this change of heart was largely because of Tiger and not because of him yet he had welcomed it as a change from the previous intolerable coldness even though it left him feeling vaguely uneasy Tiger was well liked by the others in the class Dal had been grateful more than once when Tiger had risen in hot defense of the Garvian s right to be studying medicine among Earthmen in the school on Hospital Earth But that had been in medical school among classmates Somehow that had been different from the incident that occurred on Morua VIII and Dal s uneasiness grew stronger than ever the more he thought of it Talking to Tiger about it was no help Tiger just grinned and told him to forget it but even in the rush of shipboard activity it stubbornly refused to be forgotten One minor matter also helped to ease the tension between the doctors as they made their daily rounds Tiger brought a pink dispatch sheet in to Dal one day grinning happily This is from the weekly news capsule he said It ought to cheer you up It was a brief news note listed under incidental items The Black Service of Pathology it said has announced that Black Doctor Hugo Tanner will enter Hospital Philadelphia within the next week for prophylactic heart surgery In keeping with usual Hospital Earth administrative policy the Four star Black Doctor will undergo a total cardiac transplant to halt the Medical education administrator s progressively disabling heart disease The note went on to name the surgeons who would officiate at the procedure Dal smiled and handed back the dispatch Maybe it will improve his temper he said even if it does give him another fifty years of active life Well at least it will take him out of our hair for a while Tiger said He won t have time to keep us under too close scrutiny Which Dal was forced to admit did not make him too unhappy Shipboard rounds kept all three doctors busy Often with contact landings calls and studying it seemed only a brief time from sleep period to sleep period but still they had some time for minor luxuries Dal was almost continuously shivering with the ship kept at a temperature that was comfortable for Tiger and Jack he missed the tropical heat of his home planet and sometimes it seemed that he was chilled down to the marrow of his bones in spite of his coat of gray fur With a little home made plumbing and ingenuity he finally managed to convert one of the ship s shower units into a steam bath Once or twice each day he would retire for a blissful half hour warming himself up to Garv II normal temperatures Fuzzy also became a part of shipboard routine Once he grew accustomed to Tiger and Jack and the surroundings aboard the ship the little creature grew bored sitting on Dal s shoulder and wanted to be in the middle of things Since the early tension had eased he was willing to be apart from his master from time to time so Dal and Tiger built him a platform that hung from the ceiling of the control room There Fuzzy would sit and swing by the hour blinking happily at the activity going on all around him But for all the appearance of peace and agreement there was still an undercurrent of tension on board the Lancet which flared up from time to time when it was least expected between Dal and Jack It was on one such occasion that a major crisis almost developed and once again Fuzzy was the center of the contention Dal Timgar knew that disaster had struck at the very moment it happened but he could not tell exactly what was wrong All he knew was that something fearful had happened to Fuzzy There was a small sound proof cubicle in the computer room with a chair desk and a tape reader for the doctors when they had odd moments to spend reading up on recent medical bulletins or reviewing their textbooks Dal spent more time here than the other two the temperature of the room could be turned up and he had developed a certain fondness for the place with its warm gray walls and its soft relaxing light Here on the tapes were things that he could grapple with things that he could understand If a problem here eluded him he could study it out until he had mastered it The hours he spent here were a welcome retreat from the confusing complexities of getting along with Jack and Tiger These long study periods were boring for Fuzzy who wasn t much interested in the oxygen exchange mechanism of the intelligent beetles of Aldebaran VI Frequently Dal would leave him to swing on his platform or explore about the control cabin while he spent an hour or two at the tape reader Today Dal had been working for over an hour deeply immersed in a review of the intermediary metabolism of chlorine breathing mammals when something abruptly wrenched his attention from the tape It was as though a light had snapped off in his mind or a door slammed shut There was no sound no warning yet suddenly he felt dreadfully frighteningly alone as if in a split second something inside him had been torn away He sat bolt upright staring and he felt his skin crawl and his fingers tremble as he listened trying to spot the source of the trouble And then almost instinctively he knew what was wrong He leaped to his feet tore open the door to the cubicle and dashed down the hallway toward the control room Fuzzy he shouted Fuzzy where are you Tiger and Jack were both at the control panel dictating records for filing They looked up in surprise as the Red Doctor burst into the room Fuzzy s platform was hanging empty gently swaying back and forth Dal peered frantically around the room There was no sign of the small pink creature Where is he he demanded What s happened to Fuzzy Jack shrugged in disgust He s up on his perch Where else He s not either Where is he Jack blinked at the empty perch He was there just a minute ago I saw him Well he s not there now and something s wrong In a panic Dal began searching the room knocking over stools scattering piles of paper peering in every corner where Fuzzy might be concealed For a moment the others sat frozen watching him Then Tiger jumped to his feet Hold it hold it He probably just wandered off for a minute He does that all the time No it s something worse than that Dal was almost choking on the words Something terrible has happened I know it Jack Alvarez tossed the recorder down in disgust You and your miserable pet he said I knew we shouldn t have kept him on board Dal stared at Jack Suddenly all the anger and bitterness of the past few weeks could no longer be held in Without warning he hurled himself at the Blue Doctor s throat Where is he he cried What have you done with him What have you done to Fuzzy You ve done something to him You ve hated him every minute just like you hate me only he s easier to pick on Now where is he What have you done to him Jack staggered back trying to push the furious little Garvian away Wait a minute Get away from me I didn t do anything You did too Where is he I don t know Jack struggled to break free but there was powerful strength in Dal s fingers for all his slight body build I tell you he was here just a minute ago Dal felt a hand grip his collar then and Tiger was dragging them apart like two dogs in a fight Now stop this he roared holding them both at arm s length I said stop it Jack didn t do anything to Fuzzy he s been sitting here with me ever since you went back to the cubicle He hasn t even budged But he s gone Dal panted Something s happened to him I know it How do you know I I just know I can feel it All right then let s find him Tiger said He s got to be somewhere on the ship If he s in trouble we re wasting time fighting Tiger let go and Jack brushed off his shirt his face very white I saw him just a little while ago he said He was sitting up on that silly perch watching us and then swinging back and forth and swinging over to that cabinet and back Well let s get started looking Tiger said They fanned out with Jack still muttering to himself and searched the control room inch by inch There was no sign of Fuzzy Dal had control of himself now but he searched with a frantic intensity He s not in here he said at last he must have gone out somewhere There was only one door open Tiger said The one you just came through from the rear corridor Dal you search the computer room Jack check the lab and I ll go back to the reactors They started searching the compartments off the rear corridor For ten minutes there was no sound in the ship but the occasional slamming of a hatch the grate of a desk drawer the bang of a cabinet door Dal worked through the maze of cubby holes in the computer room with growing hopelessness The frightening sense of loneliness and loss in his mind was overwhelming he was almost physically ill The warm comfortable feeling of contact that he had always had before with Fuzzy was gone As the minutes passed hopelessness gave way to despair Then Jack gave a hoarse cry from the lab Dal tripped and stumbled in his haste to get down the corridor and almost collided with Tiger at the lab door I think we re too late Jack said He s gotten into the formalin He lifted one of the glass beakers down from the shelf to the work bench It was obvious what had happened Fuzzy had gone exploring and had found the laboratory a fascinating place Several of the reagents bottles had been knocked over as if he had been sampling them The glass lid to the beaker of formalin which was kept for tissue specimens had been pushed aside just enough to admit the little creature s two inch girth Now Fuzzy lay in the bottom of the beaker immersed in formalin a formless shapeless blob of sickly gray jelly Are you sure it s formalin Dal asked Jack poured off the fluid and the acrid smell of formaldehyde that filled the room answered the question It s no good Dal he said almost gently The stuff destroys protein and that s about all he was I m sorry I was beginning to like the little punk even if he did get on my nerves But he picked the one thing to fall into that could kill him Unless he had some way to set up a protective barrier Dal took the beaker Get me some saline he said tightly And some nutrient broth Jack pulled out two jugs and poured their contents into an empty beaker Dal popped the tiny limp form into the beaker and began massaging it Layers of damaged tissue peeled off in his hand but he continued massaging and changing the solutions first saline then nutrient broth Get me some sponges and a blade Tiger brought them in Carefully Dal began debriding the damaged outer layers Jack and Tiger watched then Jack said Look there s a tinge of pink in the middle Slowly the faint pink in the center grew more ruddy Dal changed solutions again and sank down on a stool I think he ll make it he said He has enormous regenerative powers as long as any fragment of him is left He looked up at Jack who was still watching the creature in the beaker almost solicitously I guess I made a fool of myself back there when I jumped you Jack s face hardened as though he had been caught off guard I guess you did all right Well I m sorry I just couldn t think straight It was the first time I d ever been apart from him I still say he doesn t belong aboard Jack said This is a medical ship not a menagerie And if you ever lay your hands on me again you ll wish you hadn t I said I was sorry Dal said I heard you Jack said I just don t believe you that s all He gave Fuzzy a final glance and then headed back to the control room Fuzzy recovered a much abashed and subdued Fuzzy clinging timorously to Dal s shoulder and refusing to budge for three days but apparently basically unharmed by his inadvertent swim in the deadly formalin bath Presently he seemed to forget the experience altogether and once again took his perch on the platform in the control room But Dal did not forget He said little to Tiger and Jack but the incident had shaken him severely For as long as he could remember he had always had Fuzzy close at hand He had never before in his life experienced the dreadful feeling of emptiness and desertion the almost paralyzing fear and helplessness that he had felt when Fuzzy had lost contact with him It had seemed as though a vital part of him had suddenly been torn away and the memory of the panic that followed sent chills down his back and woke him up trembling from his sleep He was ashamed of his unwarranted attack on Jack yet even this seemed insignificant in comparison to the powerful fear that had been driving him Happily the Blue Doctor chose to let the matter rest where it was and if anything seemed more willing than before to be friendly For the first time he seemed to take an active interest in Fuzzy chatting with him when he thought no one was around and bringing him occasional tid bits of food after meals were over Once more life on the Lancet settled back to routine only to have it shattered by an incident of quite a different nature It was just after they had left a small planet in the Procyon system one of the routine check in points that they made contact with the Garvian trading ship Dal recognized the ship s design and insignia even before the signals came in and could hardly contain his excitement He had not seen a fellow countryman for years except for an occasional dull luncheon with the Garvian ambassador to Hospital Earth during medical school days The thought of walking the corridors of a Garvian trading ship again brought an overwhelming wave of homesickness He was so excited he could hardly wait for Jack to complete the radio sighting formalities What ship is she he wanted to know What house Jack handed him the message transcript The ship is the Teegar he said Flagship of the SinSin trading fleet They want permission to approach us Dal let out a whoop Then it s a space trader and a big one You ve never seen ships like these before Tiger joined them staring at the message transcript A SinSin ship Send them the word Jack and be quick before they get disgusted and move on Jack sent out the approach authorization and they watched with growing excitement as the great trading vessel began its close approach maneuvers The name of the house of SinSin was famous throughout the galaxy It was one of the oldest and largest of the great trading firms that had built Garv II into its position of leadership in the Confederation and the SinSin ships had penetrated to every corner of the galaxy to every known planet harboring an intelligent life form Tiger and Jack had seen the multitudes of exotic products in the Hospital Earth stores that came from the great Garvian ships on their frequent visits But this was more than a planetary trader loaded with a few items for a single planet The space traders roamed from star system to star system their holds filled with treasures beyond number Such ships as these might be out from Garv II for decades at a time tempting any ship they met with the magnificent variety of wares they carried Slowly the trader approached and Dal took the speaker addressing the commander of the Teegar in Garvian This is the General Practice Patrol Ship Lancet he said out from Hospital Earth with three physicians aboard including a countryman of yours Is that Dal Timgar the reply came back By the Seven Moons We d heard that there was now a Garvian physician and couldn t believe our ears Come aboard all of you you ll be welcome We ll send over a lifeboat The Teegar was near now a great gleaming ship with the sign of the house of SinSin on her hull A lifeboat sprang from a launching rack and speared across to the Lancet Moments later the three doctors were climbing into the sleek little vessel and moving across the void of space to the huge Garvian ship It was like stepping from a jungle outpost village into a magnificent glittering city The Garvian ship was enormous she carried a crew of several hundred and the wealth and luxury of the ship took the Earthmen s breath away The cabins and lounges were paneled with expensive fabrics and rare woods the furniture inlaid with precious metals Down the long corridors goods of the traders were laid out in resplendent display surpassing the richest show cases in the shops on Hospital Earth They received a royal welcome from the commander of the Teegar an aged smiling little Garvian with a pink fuzz ball on his shoulder that could have been Fuzzy s twin He bowed low to Tiger and Jack leading them into the reception lounge where a great table was spread with foods and pastries of all varieties Then he turned to Dal and embraced him like a long lost brother Your father Jai Timgar has long been an honored friend of the house of SinSin and anyone of the house of Timgar is the same as my own son and my son s son But this collar This cuff Is it really possible that a man of Garv has become a physician of Hospital Earth Dal touched Fuzzy to the commander s fuzz ball in the ancient Garvian greeting It s possible and true he said I studied there I am the Red Doctor on this patrol ship Ah but this is good the commander said What better way to draw our worlds together eh But come you must look and see what we have in our storerooms feast your eyes on the splendors we carry For all of you a thousand wonders are to be found here Jack hesitated as the commander led them back toward the display corridors We d be glad to see the ship but you should know that patrol ship physicians have little money to spend Who speaks of money the commander cried Did I speak of it Come and look Money is nothing The Garvian traders are not mere money changers Look and enjoy if there is something that strikes your eye something that would fulfill the desires of your heart it will be yours He gave Dal a smile and a sly wink Surely our brother here has told you many times of the wonders to be seen in a space trader and terms can be arranged that will make any small purchase a painless pleasure He led them off like a head of state conducting visiting dignitaries on a tour with a retinue of Garvian underlings trailing behind them For two delirious hours they wandered the corridors of the great ship staring hungrily at the dazzling displays They had been away from Hospital Earth and its shops and stores for months now it seemed they were walking through an incredible treasure trove stocked with everything that they could possibly have wanted For Jack there was a dress uniform specially tailored for a physician in the Blue Service of Diagnosis the insignia woven into the cloth with gold and platinum thread Reluctantly he turned away from it a luxury he could never dream of affording For Tiger who had been muttering for weeks about getting out of condition in the sedentary life of the ship there was a set of bar bells and gymnasium equipment ingeniously designed to collapse into a unit no larger than one foot square yet opening out into a completely equipped gym Dal s eyes glittered at the new sets of surgical instruments designed to the most rigid Hospital Earth specifications which appeared almost without his asking to see them There were clothes and games precious stones and exotic rings watches set with Arcturian dream stones and boots inlaid with silver They made their way through the corridors reluctant to leave one display for the next Whenever something caught their eyes the commander snapped his fingers excitedly and the item was unobtrusively noted down by one of the underlings Finally exhausted and glutted just from looking they turned back toward the reception room The things are beautiful Tiger said wistfully but impossible Still you were very kind to take your time Time I have nothing but time The commander smiled again at Dal And there is an old Garvian proverb that to the wise man impossible has no meaning Wait you will see They came out into the lounge and the doctors stopped short in amazement Spread out before them were all of the items that had captured their interest earlier But this is ridiculous Jack said staring at the dress uniform We couldn t possibly buy these things it would take our salaries for twenty years to pay for them Have we mentioned price even once the commander protested You are the crewmates of one of our own people We would not dream of setting prices that we would normally set for such trifles as these And as for terms you have no worry Take the goods aboard your ship they are already yours We have drawn up contracts for you which require no payment whatever for five years and then payments of only a fiftieth of the value for each successive year And for each of you with the compliments of the house of SinSin a special gift at no charge whatever He placed in Jack s hands a small box with the lid tipped back Against a black velvet lining lay a silver star and the official insignia of a Star Physician in the Blue Service You cannot wear it yet of course the commander said But one day you will need it Jack blinked at the jewel like star You are very kind he said I I mean perhaps He looked at Tiger and then at the display of goods on the table Perhaps there are some things Already two of the Garvian crewmen were opening the lock to the lifeboat preparing to move the goods aboard Then Dal Timgar spoke up sharply I think you d better wait a moment he said And for you the commander continued turning to Dal so smoothly that there seemed no break in his voice at all as one of our own people and an honored son of Jai Timgar who has been kind to the house of SinSin for many years I have something out of the ordinary I m sure your crewmates would not object to a special gift at my personal expense The commander lifted a scarf from the table and revealed the glittering set of surgical instruments neatly displayed in a velvet lined carrying case The commander took it up from the table and thrust it into Dal s hands It is yours my friend And for this there will be no contract whatever Dal stared down at the instruments They were beautiful He longed just to touch them to hold them in his hands but he shook his head and set the case back on the table He looked up at Tiger and Jack You should be warned that the prices on these goods are four times what they ought to be and the deferred payment contracts he wants you to sign will permit as much as twenty four per cent interest on the unpaid balance with no closing out clause That means you would be paying many times the stated price for the goods before the contract is closed You can go ahead and sign if you want but understand what you re signing The Garvian commander stared at him and then shook his head laughing Of course your friend is not serious he said These prices can be compared on any planet and you will see their fairness Here read the contracts see what they say and decide for yourselves He held out a sheaf of papers The contracts may sound well enough Dal said but I m telling you what they actually say Jack looked stricken But surely just one or two things Tiger shook his head Dal knows what he s talking about I don t think we d better buy anything at all The Garvian commander turned to Dal angrily What are you telling them There is nothing false in these contracts I didn t say there was I just can t see them taking a beating with their eyes shut that s all Your contracts are legal enough but the prices and terms are piracy and you know it The commander glared at him for a moment Then he turned away scornfully So what I have heard is true after all he said You really have thrown in your lot with these pill peddlers these idiots from Earth who can t even wipe their noses without losing in a trade He signaled the lifeboat pilot Take them back to their ship we re wasting our time There are better things to do than to deal with traitors The trip back to the Lancet was made in silence Dal could sense the pilot s scorn as he dumped them off in their entrance lock and dashed back to the Teegar with the lifeboat Gloomily Jack and Tiger followed Dal into the control room a drab little cubby hole compared to the Teegar s lounge Well it was fun while it lasted Jack said finally looking up at Dal But the way that guy slammed you I wish we d never gone I know Dal said The commander just thought he saw a perfect setup He figured you d never question the contracts if I backed him up It would have been easy enough Why didn t you Dal looked at the Blue Doctor Maybe I just don t like people who give away surgical sets he said Remember I m not a Garvian trader any more I m a doctor from Hospital Earth Moments later the great Garvian ship was gone and the red light was blinking on the call board Tiger started tracking down the call while Jack went back to work on the daily log book and Dal set up food for dinner The pleasant dreams were over they were back in the harness of patrol ship doctors once again Jack and Dal were finishing dinner when Tiger came back with a puzzled frown on his face Finally traced that call At least I think I did Anybody ever hear of a star called thirty one Brucker Brucker Jack said It isn t on the list of contracts What s the trouble I m not sure Tiger said I m not even certain if it s a call or not Come on up front and see what you think 
1311_134170_000001_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER eight
none	none	 PLAGUE In the control room the interstellar radio and teletype translator were silent The red light on the call board was still blinking Tiger turned it off with a snap Here s the message that just came in as near as I can make out he said and if you can make sense of it you re way ahead of me The message was a single word teletyped in the center of a blue dispatch sheet 
1311_134170_000005_000000	train-clean-360	GREETINGS
1311_134170_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 This is all Jack said 
none	none	That s every bit of it They repeated it half a dozen times just like that Who repeated it Dal asked Where are the identification symbols There weren t any said Tiger Our own computer designated thirty one Brucker from the direction and intensity of the signal The question is what do we do 
1311_134170_000010_000000	train-clean-360	The message stared up at them cryptically 
none	none	Dal shook his head Doesn t give us much to go on that s certain Even the location could be wrong if the signal came in on an odd frequency or from a long distance Let s beam back at the same direction and intensity and see what happens Tiger took the earphones and speaker and turned the signal beam to coincide with the direction of the incoming message We have your contact 
1311_134170_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Can you hear me 
1311_134170_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 Who are you 
none	none	and what do you want There was a long delay and they thought the contact was lost 
1311_134170_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Then a voice came whispering through the static 
none	none	Where is your ship now Are you near to us
1311_134170_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 We need your company ordinates in order to tell Tiger said 
none	none	Who are you Again a long pause and a howl of static Then If you are far away it will be too late We have no time left we are dying Abruptly the voice message broke off and company ordinates began coming through between bursts of static Tiger scribbled them down piecing them together through several repetitions
1311_134170_000016_000002	train-clean-360	 Check these out fast he told Jack 
none	none	This sounds like real trouble He tossed Dal another pair of earphones and turned back to the speaker Are you a contract planet he signaled Do we have a survey on you There was a much longer pause Then the voice came back No we have no contract 
1311_134170_000017_000002	train-clean-360	We are all dying but if you must have a contract to come 
none	none	Not at all Tiger sent back
1311_134170_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 We re coming 
none	none	Keep your frequency open We will contact again when we are closer He tossed down the earphones and looked excitedly at Dal Did you hear that 
1311_134170_000019_000002	train-clean-360	A planet calling for help with no Hospital Earth contract 
1311_134170_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 They sound desperate Dal said 
none	none	We d better go there contract or no contract Of course we ll go there you idiot See if Jack has those company ordinates charted and start digging up information on them everything you can find We need all of the dope we can get and we need it fast This is our golden chance to seal a contract with a new planet All three of the doctors fell to work trying to identify the mysterious caller Dal began searching the information file for data on thirty one Brucker punching all the reference tags he could think of as well as the galactic company ordinates of the planet He could hardly control his fingers as the tapes with possible references began plopping down into the slots 
1311_134170_000022_000003	train-clean-360	Tiger was right this was almost too good to be true 
none	none	When a planet without a medical service contract called a GPP Ship for help there was always hope that a brand new contract might be signed if the call was successful And no greater honor could come to a patrol craft crew than to be the originators of a new contract for Hospital Earth But there were problems in dealing with uncontacted planets Many star systems had never been explored by ships of the Confederation Many races like Earthmen at the time their star drive was discovered had no inkling of the existence of a Galactic Confederation of worlds There might be no information whatever about the special anatomical and physiological characteristics of the inhabitants of an uncontacted planet and often a patrol crew faced insurmountable difficulties coming in blind to solve a medical problem Dal had his information gathered first a disappointingly small amount indeed Among the billions of notes on file in the Lancet s data bank there were only two scraps of data available on the thirty one Brucker system Is this all you could find Tiger said staring at the information slips There s just nothing else there Dal said This one is a description and classification of the star and it doesn t sound like the one who wrote it had even been near it He hadn t Tiger said This is a routine radio telescopic survey report The star is a red giant Big and cold with three possibly four planets inside the outer envelope of the star itself and only one outside it Nothing about satellites None of the planets thought to be habitable by man What s the other item An exploratory report on the outer planet done eight hundred years ago 
1311_134170_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Says it s an Earth type planet and not much else 
1311_134170_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Gives reference to the full report in the Confederation files 
none	none	Not a word about an intelligent race living there Well maybe Jack s got a bit more for us Tiger said If the place has been explored there must be some information about the inhabitants But Jack also came up with a blank Central Records on Hospital Earth sent back a physical description of a tiny outer planet of the star with a thin oxygen nitrogen atmosphere very little water and enough methane mixed in to make the atmosphere deadly to Earthmen Then there s never been a medical service contract Tiger asked
1311_134170_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Contract Jack said 
1311_134170_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 It doesn t even say there are any people there Not a word about any kind of life form 
none	none	Well that s ridiculous Dal said If we re getting messages from there somebody must be sending them But if a Confederation ship explored there there s a way to find out How soon can we convert to star drive As soon as we can get strapped down Tiger said Then send our reconversion company ordinates to the Confederation headquarters on Garv II and request the Confederation records on the place 
1311_134170_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Jack stared at him 
none	none	You mean just ask to see Confederation records 
1311_134170_000036_000002	train-clean-360	We can t do that they d skin us alive 
none	none	Those records are closed to everyone except full members of the Confederation Tell them it s an emergency Dal said If they want to be legal about it give them my Confederation serial number Garv II is a member of the Confederation and I m a native born citizen 
1311_134170_000038_000000	train-clean-360	Tiger got the request off while Jack and Dal strapped down for the conversion to Koenig drive 
none	none	Five minutes later Tiger joined them grinning from ear to ear Didn t even have to pull rank he said When they started to argue I just told them it was an emergency and if they didn t let us see any records they had we would file their refusal against claims that might come up later They quit arguing We ll have the records as soon as we reconvert The star that they were seeking was a long distance from the current location of the Lancet The ship was in Koenig drive for hours before it reconverted and even Dal was beginning to feel the first pangs of drive sickness before they felt the customary jolting vibration of the change to normal space and saw bright stars again in the viewscreen The star called thirty one Brucker was close then It was indeed a red giant long tenuous plumes of gas spread out for hundreds of millions of miles on all sides of its glowing red core This mammoth star did not look so cold now as they stared at it in the viewscreen yet among the family of stars it was a cold dying giant with only a few moments of life left on the astronomical time scale From the Lancet s position no planets at all were visible to the naked eye but with the telescope Jack soon found two inside the star s envelope of gas and one tiny one outside They would have to be searched for and the one that they were hoping to reach located before centering and landing maneuvers could be begun Already the radio was chattering with two powerful signals coming in One came from the Galactic Confederation headquarters on Garv II the other was a good clear signal from very close range unquestionably beamed to them from the planet in distress They watched as the Confederation report came clacking off the teletype and they stared at it unbelieving It just doesn t make sense Jack said There must be intelligent creatures down there They re sending radio signals Then why a report like this Tiger said This was filed by a routine exploratory ship that came here eight hundred years ago You can t tell me that any intelligent race could develop from scratch in less than eight centuries time Dal picked up the report and read it again This red giant star he read was studied in the usual fashion It was found to have seven planets all but one lying within the tenuous outer gas envelope of the star itself The seventh planet has an atmosphere of its own and travels an orbit well outside the star surface This planet was selected for landing and exploration Following this was a long detailed and exceedingly dull description of the step by step procedure followed by a Confederation exploratory ship making a first landing on a barren planet There was a description of the atmosphere the soil surface the land masses and major water bodies Physically the planet was a desert hot and dry and barren of vegetation excepting in two or three areas of jungle along the equator The planet is inhabited by numerous small unintelligent animal species which seem well adapted to the semi arid conditions Of higher animals and mammals only two species were discovered and of these the most highly developed was an erect biped with an integrated central nervous system and the intelligence level of a Garvian drachma How small is that Jack said Idiot level Dal said glumly I Q of about twenty on the human scale I guess the explorers weren t much impressed they didn t even put the planet down for a routine colonization survey Well something has happened down there since then Idiots can t build interstellar radios Jack turned to Tiger Are you getting them Tiger nodded A voice was coming over the speaker hesitant and apologetic using the common tongue of the Galactic Confederation How soon can you come the voice was asking clearly still with the sound of great reticence There is not much time But who are you Tiger asked What s wrong down there We are sick dying thousands of us But if you have other work that is more pressing we would not want to delay you Jack shook his head frowning I don t get this he said What are they afraid of Tiger spoke into the microphone again We will be glad to help but we need information about you You have our position can you send up a spokesman to tell us your problem A long pause and then the voice came back wearily It will be done Stand by to receive him Tiger snapped off the radio receiver and looked up triumphantly at the others Now we re getting somewhere If the people down there can send a ship out with a spokesman to tell us about their troubles we ve got a chance to sew up a contract and that could mean a Star for every one of us Yes but who are they Dal said And where were they when the Confederation ship was here I don t know Jack said but I ll bet you both that we have quite a time finding out Why Tiger said What do you mean I mean we d better be very careful here Jack said darkly I don t know about you but I think this whole business has a very strange smell There was nothing strange about the Bruckian ship when it finally came into view It was a standard design surface launching interplanetary craft with separated segments on either side suggesting atomic engines They saw the side jets flare as the ship maneuvered to come in alongside the Lancet Grapplers were thrown out to bind the emissary ship to the Lancet s hull and Jack threw the switches to open the entrance lock and decontamination chambers They had taken pains to describe the interior atmosphere of the patrol ship and warn the spokesman to keep himself in a sealed pressure suit On the intercom viewscreens they saw the small suited figure cross from his ship into the Lancet s lock and watched as the sprays of formalin washed down the outside of the suit Moments later the creature stepped out of the decontamination chamber He was small and humanoid with tiny fragile bones and pale hairless skin He stood no more than four feet high More than anything else he looked like a very intelligent monkey with a diminutive space suit fitting his fragile body When he spoke the words came through the translator in English but Dal recognized the flowing syllables of the universal language of the Galactic Confederation How do you know the common tongue he said There is no record of your people in our Confederation yet you use our own universal language The Bruckian nodded We know the language well My people dread outside contact it is a racial characteristic but we hear the Confederation broadcasts and have learned to understand the common tongue The space suited stranger looked at the doctors one by one We also know of the good works of the ships from Hospital Earth and now we appeal to you Why Jack said You gave us no information nothing to go on There was no time the creature said Death is stalking our land and the people are falling at their plows Thousands of us are dying tens of thousands Even I am infected and soon will be dead Unless you can find a way to help us quickly it will be too late and my people will be wiped from the face of the planet Jack looked grimly at Tiger and Dal Well he said I guess that answers our question all right It looks as if we have a plague planet on our hands whether we like it or not CHAPTER nine THE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE Slowly and patiently they drew the story from the emissary from the seventh planet of thirty one Brucker The small monkey like creature was painfully shy he required constant reassurance that the doctors did not mind being called that they wanted to help and that a contract was not necessary in an emergency Even at that the spokesman was reluctant to give details about the plague and about his stricken people Every bit of information had to be extracted with patient questioning By tacit consent the doctors did not even mention the strange fact that this very planet had been explored by a Confederation ship eight hundred years before and no sign of intelligent life had been found The little creature before them seemed ready to turn and bolt at the first hint of attack or accusation But bit by bit a picture of the current situation on the planet developed Whoever they were and wherever they had been when the Confederation ship had landed there was unquestionably an intelligent race now inhabiting this lonely planet in the outer reaches of the solar system of thirty one Brucker There was no doubt of their advancement a few well selected questions revealed that they had control of atomic power a working understanding of the nature and properties of contra terrene matter and a workable star drive operating on the same basic principle as Earth s Koenig drive but which the Bruckians had never really used because of their shyness and fear of contact with other races They also had an excellent understanding thanks to their eavesdropping on Confederation interstellar radio chatter of the existence and functions of the Galactic Confederation of worlds and of Hospital Earth s work as physician to the galaxy But about Bruckian anatomy physiology or biochemistry the little emissary would tell them nothing He seemed genuinely frightened when they pressed him about the physical make up of his people as though their questions were somehow scraping a raw nerve He insisted that his people knew nothing about the nature of the plague that had stricken them and the doctors could not budge him an inch from his stand But a plague had certainly struck It had begun six months before striking great masses of the people It had walked the streets of the cities and the hills and valleys of the countryside First three out of ten had been stricken then four then five The course of the disease once started was invariably the same first illness weakness loss of energy and interest then gradually a fading away of intelligent responses leaving thousands of creatures walking blank faced and idiot like about the streets and countryside Ultimately even the ability to take food was lost and after an interval of a week or so death invariably ensued Finally the doctors retired to the control room for a puzzled conference It s got to be an organism of some sort that s doing it Dal said There couldn t be an illness like this that wasn t caused by some kind of a parasitic germ or virus But how do we know Jack said We know nothing about these people except what we can see We re going to have to do a complete biochemical and medical survey before we can hope to do anything But we aren t equipped for a real survey Tiger protested We ve got to do it anyway Jack said If we can just learn enough to be sure it s an infectious illness we might stand a chance of finding a drug that will cure it Or at least a way to immunize the ones that aren t infected yet If this is a virus infection we might only need to find an antibody for inoculation to stop it in its tracks But first we need a good look at the planet and some more of the people both infected and healthy ones We d better make arrangements as fast as we can An hour later they had reached an agreement with the Bruckian emissary The Lancet would be permitted to land on the planet s surface as soon as the doctors were satisfied that it was safe For the time being the initial landings would be made in the patrol ship s lifeboats with the Lancet in orbit a thousand miles above the surface Unquestionably the first job was diagnosis discovering the exact nature of the illness and studying the afflicted people This responsibility rested squarely on Jack s shoulders he was the diagnostician and Dal and Tiger willingly yielded to him in organizing the program It was decided that Jack and Tiger would visit the planet s surface at once while Dal stayed on the ship and set up the reagents and examining techniques that would be needed to measure the basic physical and biochemical characteristics of the Bruckians Yet in all the excitement of planning Dal could not throw off the lingering shadow of doubt in his mind some instinctive voice of caution that seemed to say watch out be careful go slowly This may not be what it seems to be you may be walking into a trap But it was only a faint voice and easy to thrust aside as the planning went ahead full speed It did not take very long for the crew of the Lancet to realize that there was something very odd indeed about the small self effacing inhabitants of thirty one Brucker VII In fact odd was not really quite the proper word for these creatures at all No one knew better than the doctors of Hospital Earth that oddness was the rule among the various members of the galactic civilization All sorts and varieties of life forms had been discovered described and studied each with its singular differences each with certain similarities and each quite odd in reference to any of the others In Dal this awareness of the oddness and difference of other races was particularly acute He knew that to Tiger and Jack he himself seemed odd both anatomically and in other ways His fine gray fur and his four fingered hands set him apart from them he would never be mistaken for an Earthman even in the densest fog But these were comprehensible differences His close attachment to Fuzzy was something else and still seemed beyond their ability to understand He had spent one whole evening patiently trying to make Jack understand just how his attachment to the little pink creature was more than just the fondness of a man for his dog Well what would you call it then Symbiosis is probably the best word for it Dal had replied Two life forms live together and each one helps the other that s all symbiosis is Together each one is better off than either one would be alone We all of us live in symbiosis with the bacteria in our digestive tracts don t we We provide them with a place to live and grow and they help us digest our food It s a kind of a partnership and Fuzzy and I are partners in the same sort of way Jack had argued and then lost his temper and finally grudgingly agreed that he supposed he would have to tolerate it even if it didn t make sense to him But the creatures on thirty one Brucker VII were odd far beyond the reasonable limits of oddness so far beyond it that the doctors could not believe the things that their eyes and their instruments were telling them When Tiger and Jack came back to the Lancet after their first trip to the planet s surface they were visibly shaken Geographically they had found it just as it had been described in the exploratory reports a barren desert land with only a few large islands of vegetation in the equatorial regions But the people Jack said They don t fit into any kind of pattern They ve got houses at least I guess you d call them houses but every one of them is like every other one and they re all crammed together in tight little bunches with nothing for miles in between They ve got an advanced technology a good communications system manufacturing techniques and everything but they just don t use them It s more than that Tiger said They don t seem to want to use them Well it doesn t add up to me Jack said There are thousands of towns and cities down there all of them miles apart and yet they had to go dig an old rusty jet scooter out of storage and get the motor rebuilt just specially to take us from one place to another I know things can get disorganized with a plague in the land but this plague just hasn t been going on that long What about the sickness Dal asked Is it as bad as it sounded Worse if anything Tiger said gloomily They re dying by the thousands and I hope we got those suits of ours decontaminated because I don t want any part of this disease Graphically he described the conditions they had found among the stricken people There was no question that a plague was stalking the land In the rutted mud roads of the villages and towns the dead were piled in gutters and in all of the cities a deathly stillness hung over the streets Those who had not yet succumbed to the illness were nursing and feeding the sick ones but these unaffected ones were growing scarcer and scarcer The whole living population seemed resigned to hopelessness hardly noticing the strangers from the patrol ship But worst of all were those in the final stages of the disease wandering vaguely about the street their faces blank and their jaws slack as though they were living in a silent world of their own cut off from contact with the rest One of them almost ran into me Jack said I was right in front of him and he didn t see me or hear me But don t they have any knowledge of antisepsis or isolation Dal asked Tiger shook his head Not that we could see They don t know what s causing this sickness They think that it s some kind of curse and they never dreamed that it might be kept from spreading Already Tiger and Jack had taken the first routine steps to deal with the sickness They gave orders to move the unaffected people in every town and village into isolated barracks and stockades For half a day Tiger tried to explain ways to prevent the spread of a bacteria or virus borne disease The people had stared at him as if he were talking gibberish finally he gave up trying to explain and just laid down rules which the people were instructed to follow Together they had collected standard testing specimens of body fluids and tissue from both healthy and afflicted Bruckians and come back to the Lancet for a breather Now all three doctors began work on the specimens Cultures were inoculated with specimens from respiratory tract blood and tissue taken from both sick and well Half a dozen fatal cases were brought to the ship under specially controlled conditions for autopsy examination to reveal both the normal anatomical characteristics of this strange race of people and the damage the disease was doing Down on the surface Tiger had already inoculated a dozen of the healthy ones with various radioactive isotopes to help outline the normal metabolism and biochemistry of the people After a short sleep period on the Lancet he went back down alone to follow up on these leaving Dal and Jack to carry on the survey work in the ship s lab It was a gargantuan task that faced them They knew that in any race of creatures they could not hope to recognize the abnormal unless they knew what the normal was That was the sole reason for the extensive biomedical surveys that were done on new contract planets Under normal conditions a survey crew with specialists in physiology biochemistry anatomy radiology pharmacology and pathology might spend months or even years on a new planet gathering base line information But here there was neither time nor facilities for such a study Even in the twenty four hours since the patrol ship arrived the number of dead had increased alarmingly Alone on the ship Dal and Jack found themselves working as a well organized team There was no time here for argument or duplicated efforts everything the two doctors did was closely company ordinated Jack seemed to have forgotten his previous antagonism completely There was a crisis here and more work than three men could possibly do in the time available You handle anatomy and pathology Jack told Dal at the beginning You can get the picture five times as fast as I can and your pathology slides are better than most commercial ones I can do the best job on the cultures once I get the growth media all set up Bit by bit they divided the labor checking in with Tiger by radio on the results of the isotopes studies he was running on the planet s surface Bit by bit the data was collected and Earthman and Garvian worked more closely than ever before as the task that faced them appeared more and more formidable But the results of their tests made no sense whatever Tiger returned to the ship after forty eight hours with circles under his eyes looking as though he had been trampled in a crowd No sleep that s all he said breathlessly as he crawled out of his decontaminated pressure suit No time for it I swear I ran those tests a dozen times and I still didn t get any answers that made sense The results you were sending up sounded plenty strange Jack said What was the trouble I don t know Tiger said but if we re looking for a biological pattern here we haven t found it yet as far as I can see No we certainly haven t Dal exploded I thought I was doing something wrong somehow because these blood chemistries I ve been doing have been ridiculous I can t even find a normal level for blood sugar and as for the enzyme systems He tossed a sheaf of notes down on the counter in disgust I don t see how these people could even be alive with a botched up metabolism like this I ve never heard of anything like it What kind of pathology did you find Tiger wanted to know Nothing Dal said Nothing at all I did autopsies on the six that you brought up here and made slides of every different kind of tissue I could find The anatomy is perfectly clear cut no objections there These people are very similar to Earth type monkeys in structure with heart and lungs and vocal cords and all But I can t find any reason why they should be dying Any luck with the cultures Jack shook his head glumly No growth on any of the plates At first I thought I had something going but if I did it died and I can t find any sign of it in the filtrates But we ve got to have something to work on Tiger said desperately Look there are some things that always measure out the same in any intelligent creature no matter where he comes from That s the whole basis of galactic medicine Creatures may develop and adapt in different ways but the basic biochemical reactions are the same Not here they aren t Dal said Take a look at these tests They carried the heap of notes they had collected out into the control room and began sifting and organizing the data just as a survey team would do trying to match it with the pattern of a thousand other living creatures that had previously been studied Hours passed and they were farther from an answer than when they began Because this data did not fit a pattern It was different No two individuals showed the same reactions In every test the results were either flatly impossible or completely the opposite of what was expected Carefully they retraced their steps trying to pinpoint what could be going wrong There s got to be a laboratory error Dal said wearily We must have slipped up somewhere But I don t see where Jack said Let s see those culture tubes again And put on a pot of coffee I can t even think straight any more Of the three of them Jack was beginning to show the strain the most This was his special field the place where he was supposed to excel and nothing was happening Reports coming up from the planet were discouraging the isolation techniques they had tried to institute did not seem to be working and the spread of the plague was accelerating The communiques from the Bruckians were taking on a note of desperation Jack watched each report with growing apprehension He moved restlessly from lab to control room checking and rechecking things trying to find some sign of order in the chaos Try to get some sleep Dal urged him A couple of hours will freshen you up a hundred per cent I can t I ve already tried it Jack said Go ahead Tiger and I can keep working on these things for a while No no it s not that Jack said Without a diagnosis we can t do a thing Until we have that our hands are tied and we aren t even getting close to it We don t even know whether this is a bacteria or a virus or what Maybe the Bruckians are right Maybe it s a curse I don t think the Black Service of Pathology would buy that for a diagnosis Tiger said sourly The Black Service would choke on it but what other answer do we have You two have been doing all you can but diagnosis is my job I m supposed to be good at it but the more we dig into this the farther away we seem to get Do you want to call for help Tiger said Jack shook his head helplessly I m beginning to think we should have called for help a long time ago he said We re into this over our heads now and we re still going down At the rate those people are dying down there we don t have time to call for help now He stared at the piles of notes on the desk and his face was very white I don t know I just don t know he said The diagnosis on this thing should have been duck soup I thought it was going to be a real feather in my cap just walking in and nailing it down in a few hours Well I m whipped I don t know what to do If either of you can think of an answer it s all yours and I ll admit it to Black Doctor Tanner himself It was bitter medicine for Blue Doctor Jack Alvarez to swallow but that fact gave no pleasure to Dal or Tiger now They were as baffled as Jack was and would have welcomed help from anyone who could offer it And ironically the first glimpse of the truth came from the direction they least expected From the very beginning Fuzzy had been watching the proceedings from his perch on the swinging platform in the control room If he sensed that Dal Timgar was ignoring him and leaving him to his own devices much of the time he showed no sign of resentment The tiny creature seemed to realize that something important was consuming his master s energy and attention and contented himself with an affectionate pat now and then as Dal went through the control room Everyone assumed without much thought that Fuzzy was merely being tolerant of the situation It was not until they had finally given up in desperation and Tiger was trying to contact a Hospital Ship for help that Dal stared up at his little pink friend with a puzzled frown Tiger put the transmitter down for a moment What s wrong he said to Dal You look as though you just bit into a rotten apple I just remembered that I haven t fed him for twenty four hours Dal said Who Fuzzy Tiger shrugged He could see you were busy Dal shook his head That wouldn t make any difference to Fuzzy When he gets hungry he gets hungry and he s pretty self centered It wouldn t matter what I was doing he should have been screaming for food hours ago Dal walked over to the platform and peered down at his pink friend in alarm He took him up and rested him on his shoulder a move that invariably sent Fuzzy into raptures of delight Now the little creature just sat there trembling and rubbing half heartedly against Dal s neck Dal held him out at arm s length Fuzzy what s the matter with you Do you think something s wrong with him Jack said looking up suddenly Looks like he s having trouble keeping his eyes open His color isn t right either Tiger said He looks kind of blue Quite suddenly the little black eyes closed and Fuzzy began to tremble violently He drew himself up into a tight pink globule as the fuzz like hair disappeared from view Something was unmistakably wrong As he held the shivering creature Dal was suddenly aware that something had been nibbling at the back of his mind for hours Not a clear cut thought merely an impression of pain and anguish and sickness and now as he looked at Fuzzy the impression grew so strong it almost made him cry out Abruptly Dal knew what he had to do Where the thought came from he didn t know but it was crystal clear in his mind Jack where is our biggest virus filter he asked quietly Jack stared at him Virus filter I just took it out of the autoclave an hour ago Get it Dal said and the suction machine too Quickly Jack went down the corridor like a shot and reappeared a moment later with the big porcelain virus filter and the suction tubing attached to it Swiftly Dal dumped the limp little creature in his hand into the top of the filter jar poured in some sterile saline and started the suction Tiger and Jack watched him in amazement What are you doing Tiger said Filtering him Dal said He s infected He must have been exposed to the plague somehow maybe when our little Bruckian visitor came on board the other day And if it s a virus that s causing this plague the virus filter ought to hold it back and still let Fuzzy s molecular structure through They watched and sure enough a bluish pink fluid began moving down through the porcelain filter and dripping through the funnel into the beaker below Each drop coalesced in the beaker as it fell until Fuzzy s whole body had been sucked through the filter and into the jar below He was still not quite his normal pink color but as the filter went dry a pair of frightened shoe button eyes appeared and he poked up a pair of ears Presently the fuzz began appearing on his body again And on the top of the filter lay a faint gray film Don t touch it Dal said That s real poison He slipped on a mask and gloves and scraped a bit of the film from the filter with a spatula I think we have it he said The virus that s causing the plague on this planet CHAPTER ten THE BOOMERANG CLUE It was a virus beyond doubt The electron microscope told them that now that they had the substance isolated and could examine it In the culture tubes in the Lancet s incubators it would begin to grow nicely and then falter and die but when guinea pigs were inoculated in the ship s laboratory the substance proved its virulence The animals injected with tiny bits of the substance grew sick within hours and very quickly died The call to the Hospital Ship was canceled as the three doctors worked in feverish excitement Here at last was something they could grapple with something so common among the races of the galaxy that the doctors felt certain that they could cope with it Very few if any higher life forms existed that did not have some sort of submicroscopic parasite afflicting them Bacterial infection was a threat on every inhabited world and the viruses the tiniest of all submicroscopic organisms were the most difficult and dangerous of them all And yet virus plagues had been stopped before and they could be stopped again Jack radioed down to the planet s surface that the diagnosis had been made as soon as the proper medications could be prepared the doctors would land to begin treatment There was a new flicker of hopefulness in the Bruckian s response and an appeal to hurry With renewed energy the doctors went back to the lab to start working on the new data But trouble continued to dog them This was no ordinary virus It proved resistant to every one of the antibiotics and antiviral agents in the Lancet s stockroom No drug seemed to affect it and its molecular structure was different from any virus that had ever been recorded before If one of the drugs would only just slow it up a little we d be ahead Tiger said in perplexity We don t have anything that even touches it not even the purified globulins What about antibodies from the infected people Jack suggested In every virus disease I ve ever heard of the victim s own body starts making antibodies against the invading virus If enough antibodies are made fast enough the virus dies and the patient is immune from then on Well these people don t seem to be making any antibodies at all Tiger said At least not as far as I can see If they were at least some of them would be recovering from the disease So far not a single one has recovered once the thing started They all just go ahead and die I wonder Dal said if Fuzzy had any defense Jack looked up How do you mean Well Fuzzy was infected we know that He might have died too if we hadn t caught it in time but as it worked out he didn t In fact he looks pretty healthy right now That s fine for Fuzzy Jack said impatiently but I don t see how we can push the whole population of thirty one Brucker VII through a virus filter They re flesh and blood creatures That s not what I mean Dal said Maybe Fuzzy s body developed antibodies against the virus while he was infected Remember he doesn t have a rigid body structure like we do He s mostly just basic protein and he can synthesize pretty much anything he wants to or needs to Jack blinked It s an idea at least Is there any way we can get some of his body fluid away from him Without getting bit I mean No problem there Dal said He can regenerate pretty fast if he has enough of the right kind of food He won t miss an ounce or two of excess tissue He took a beaker over to Fuzzy s platform and began squeezing off a little blob of pink material Fuzzy seemed to sense what Dal wanted obligingly he thrust out a little pseudopod which Dal pinched off into the beaker With the addition of a small amount of saline solution the tissue dissolved into thin pink suspension In the laboratory they found two or three of the guinea pigs in the last stages of the infection and injected them with a tiny bit of the pink solution The effect was almost unbelievable Within twenty minutes all of the injected animals began to perk up their eyes brighter nibbling at the food in their cages while the ones that had not been injected got sicker and sicker Well there s our answer Jack said eagerly If we can get some of this stuff injected into our friends down below we may be able to protect the healthy ones from getting the plague and cure the sick ones as well If we still have enough time that is They had landing permission from the Bruckian spokesman within minutes and an hour later the Lancet made an orderly landing on a newly repaved landing field near one of the central cities on the seventh planet of thirty one Brucker Tiger and Jack had obviously not exaggerated the strange appearance of the towns and cities on this plague ridden planet and Dal was appalled at the ravages of the disease that they had come to fight Only one out of ten of the Bruckians was still uninfected and another three out of the ten were clearly in the late stages of the disease walking about blankly and blindly stumbling into things in their paths falling to the ground and lying mute and helpless until death came to release them Under the glaring red sun weary parties of stretcher bearers went about the silent streets moving their grim cargo out to the mass graves at the edge of the city The original spokesman who had come up to the Lancet was dead but another had taken his place as negotiator with the doctors an older thinner Bruckian who looked as if he carried the total burden of his people on his shoulders He greeted them eagerly at the landing field You have found a solution he cried You have found a way to turn the tide but hurry Every moment now is precious During the landing procedures Dal had worked to prepare enough of the precious antibody suspension with Fuzzy s company operation to handle a large number of inoculations By the time the ship touched down he had a dozen flasks and several hundred syringes ready Hundreds of the unafflicted people were crowding around the ship staring in open wonder as Dal Jack and Tiger came down the ladder and went into close conference with the spokesman It took some time to explain to the spokesman why they could not begin then and there with the mass inoculations against the plague First they needed test cases in order to make certain that what they thought would work in theory actually produced the desired results Controls were needed to be certain that the antibody suspension alone was bringing about the changes seen and not something else At last orders went out from the spokesman Two hundred uninfected Bruckians were admitted to a large roped off area near the ship and another two hundred in late stages of the disease were led stumbling into another closed area Preliminary skin tests of the antibody suspension showed no sign of untoward reaction Dal began filling syringes while Tiger and Jack started inoculating the two groups If it works with these cases it will be simple to immunize the whole population Tiger said From the amounts we used on the guinea pigs it looks as if only tiny amounts are needed We may even be able to train the Bruckians to give the injections themselves And if it works we ought to have a brand new medical service contract ready for signature with Hospital Earth Jack added eagerly It won t be long before we have those Stars you wait and see If we can only get this done fast enough They worked feverishly particularly with the group of terminal cases Many were dying even as the shots were being given while the first symptoms of the disease were appearing in some of the unafflicted ones Swiftly Tiger and Jack went from patient to patient while Dal kept check of the names numbers and locations of those that were inoculated And even before they were finished with the inoculations it was apparent that they were taking effect Not one of the infected patients died after inoculation was completed The series took three hours and by the time the four hundred doses were administered one thing seemed certain that the antibody was checking the deadly march of the disease in some way The Bruckian spokesman was so excited he could hardly contain himself he wanted to start bringing in the rest of the population at once We ve almost exhausted this first batch of the material Dal told him We will have to prepare more but we will waste time trying to move a whole planet s population here Get a dozen aircraft ready and a dozen healthy intelligent workers to help us We can show them how to use the material and let them go out to the other population centers all at once Back aboard the ship they started preparing a larger quantity of the antibody suspension Fuzzy had regenerated back to normal weight again and much to Dal s delight had been splitting off small segments of pink protoplasm in a circle all around him as though anticipating further demands on his resources A quick test run showed that the antibody was also being regenerated Fuzzy was voraciously hungry but the material in the second batch was still as powerful as in the first The doctors were almost ready to go back down loaded with enough inoculum and syringes to equip themselves and a dozen field workers when Jack suddenly stopped what he was doing and cocked an ear toward the entrance lock What s wrong Dal said Listen a minute They stopped to listen I don t hear anything Tiger said Jack nodded I know That s what I mean They were hollering their heads off when we came back aboard Why so quiet now He crossed over to the viewscreen scanning the field below and flipped on the switch For a moment he just stared Then he said Come here a minute I don t like the looks of this at all Dal and Tiger crowded up to the screen What s the matter Tiger said I don t see wait a minute Yes you d better look again Jack said 
1311_134176_000020_000002	train-clean-360	What do you think 
none	none	Dal We d better get down there fast Dal said and see what s going on It looks to me like we ve got a tiger by the tail They climbed down the ladder once again with the antibody flasks and sterile syringes strapped to their backs But this time the greeting was different from before The Bruckian spokesman and the others who had not yet been inoculated drew back from them in terror as they stepped to the ground Before the people on the field had crowded in eagerly around the ship now they were standing in silent groups staring at the doctors fearfully and muttering among themselves But the doctors could see only the inoculated people in the two roped off areas Off to the right among the infected Bruckians who had received the antibody there were no new dead but there was no change for the better either The sick creatures drifted about aimlessly milling like animals in a cage their faces blank their jaws slack hands wandering foolishly Not one of them had begun reacting normally not one showed any sign of recognition or recovery But the real horror was on the other side of the field Here were the healthy ones the uninfected ones who had received preventative inoculations A few hours before they had been left standing in quiet happy groups talking among themselves laughing and joking But now they weren t talking any more They stared across at the doctors with slack faces and dazed eyes their feet shuffling aimlessly in the dust All were alive but only half alive The intelligence and alertness were gone from their faces they were like the empty shells of the creatures they had been a few hours before indistinguishable from the infected creatures in the other compound Jack turned to the Bruckian spokesman in alarm What s happened here he asked What s become of the ones we inoculated Where have you taken them The spokesman shrank back as though afraid Jack might reach out to touch him Taken them he cried We have moved none of them Those are the ones you poisoned with your needles What have you done to make them like this It it must be some sort of temporary reaction to the injection Jack faltered There was nothing that we used that could possibly have given them the disease we only used a substance to help them fight it off The Bruckian was shaking his fist angrily It s no reaction it is the plague itself What kind of evil are you doing You came here to help us and instead you bring us more misery Do we not have enough of that to please you Swiftly the doctors began examining the patients in both enclosures and on each side they found the same picture One by one they checked the ones that had previously been untouched by the plague and found only the sagging jaws and idiot stares There s no sense examining every one Tiger said finally They re all the same every one But this is impossible Jack said glancing apprehensively at the growing mob of angry Bruckians outside the stockades What could have happened What have we done I don t know Tiger said But whatever we ve done has turned into a boomerang We knew that the antibody might not work and the disease might just go right ahead but we didn t anticipate anything like this Maybe some foreign protein got into the batch Dal said Tiger shook his head It wouldn t behave like this And we were careful getting it ready All we ve done was inject an antibody against a specific virus All it could have done was to kill the virus but these people act as though they re infected now But they re not dying Dal said And the sick ones we injected stopped dying too So what do we do now Jack said Get one of these that changed like this aboard ship and go over him with a fine toothed comb We ve got to find out what s happened He led one of the stricken Bruckians by the hand like a mindless dummy across the field toward the little group where the spokesman and his party stood The crowd on the field were moving in closer an angry cry went up when Dal touched the sick creature You ll have to keep this crowd under control Dal said to the spokesman We re going to take this one aboard the ship and examine him to see what this reaction could be but this mob is beginning to sound dangerous They re afraid the spokesman said They want to know what you ve done to them what this new curse is that you bring in your syringes It s not a curse but something has gone wrong We need to learn what in order to deal with it The people are afraid and angry the spokesman said I don t know how long I can control them And indeed the attitude of the crowd around the ship was very strange They were not just fearful they were terrified As the doctors walked back to the ship leading the stricken Bruckian behind them the people shrank back with dreadful cries holding up their hands as if to ward off some monstrous evil Before in the worst throes of the plague there had been no sign of this kind of reaction The people had seemed apathetic and miserable resigned hopelessly to their fate but now they were reacting in abject terror It almost seemed that they were more afraid of these walking shells of their former selves than they were of the disease itself But as the doctors started up the ladder toward the entrance lock the crowd surged in toward them with fists raised in anger We d better get help and fast Jack said as he slammed the entrance lock closed behind them I don t like the looks of this a bit Dal we d better see what we can learn from this poor creature here As Tiger headed for the earphones Dal and Jack went to work once again checking the blood and other body fluids from the stricken Bruckian But now incredibly the results of their tests were quite different from those they had obtained before The blood sugar and protein determinations fell into the pattern they had originally expected for a creature of this type Even more surprising the level of the antibody against the plague virus was high far higher than it could have been from the tiny amount that was injected into the creature They must have been making it themselves Dal said and our inoculation was just the straw that broke the camel s back All of those people must have been on the brink of symptoms of the infection and all we did was add to the natural defenses they were already making Then why did the symptoms appear Jack said If that s true we should have been helping them and look at them now Tiger appeared at the door scowling We ve got real trouble now he said I can t get through to a hospital ship In fact I can t get a message out at all These people are jamming our radios But why Dal said I don t know but take a look outside there Through the viewscreen it seemed as though the whole field around the ship had filled up with the crowd The first reaction of terror now seemed to have given way to blind fury the people were shouting angrily waving their clenched fists at the ship as the spokesman tried to hold them back Then there was a resounding crash from somewhere below and the ship lurched throwing the doctors to the floor They staggered to their feet as another blow jolted the ship and another Let s get a screen up Tiger shouted Jack get the engines going They re trying to board us and I don t think it ll be much fun if they ever break in In the control room they threw the switches that activated a powerful protective energy screen around the ship It was a device that was carried by all GPP Ships as a means of protection against physical attack When activated an energy screen was virtually impregnable but it could only be used briefly the power it required placed an enormous drain on a ship s energy resources and a year s nuclear fuel could be consumed in a few hours Now the screen served its purpose The ship steadied still vibrating from the last assault and the noise from below ceased abruptly But when Jack threw the switches to start the engines nothing happened at all Look at that he cried staring at the motionless dials They re jamming our electrical system somehow I can t get any turn over Try it again Tiger said We ve got to get out of here If they break in we re done for They can t break through the screen Dal said Not as long as it lasts But we can t keep it up indefinitely Once again they tried the radio equipment There was no response but the harsh static of the jamming signal from the ground below It s no good Tiger said finally We re stuck here and we can t even call for help You d think if they were so scared of us they d be glad to see us go I think there s more to it than that Dal said thoughtfully This whole business has been crazy from the start This just fits in with all the rest He picked Fuzzy off his perch and set him on his shoulder as if to protect him from some unsuspected threat Maybe they re afraid of us I don t know But I think they re afraid of something else a whole lot worse There was nothing to be done but wait and stare hopelessly at the mass of notes and records that they had collected on the people of thirty one Brucker VII and the plague that afflicted them Until now the Lancet s crew had been too busy to stop and piece the data together to try to see the picture as a whole But now there was ample time and the realization of what had been happening here began to dawn on them They had followed the well established principles step by step in studying these incredible people and nothing had come out as it should In theory the steps they had taken should have yielded the answer They had come to a planet where an entire population was threatened with a dreadful disease They had identified the disease found and isolated the virus that caused it and then developed an antibody that effectively destroyed the virus in the laboratory But when they had tried to apply the antibody in the afflicted patients the response had been totally unexpected They had stopped the march of death among those they had inoculated and had produced instead a condition that the people seemed to dread far more than death Let s face it Dal said we bungled it somehow We should have had help here right from the start I don t know where we went wrong but we ve done something Well it wasn t your fault Jack said gloomily If we had the right diagnosis this wouldn t have happened And I still can t see the diagnosis All I ve been able to come up with is a nice mess We re missing something that s all Dal said The information is all here We just aren t reading it right somehow Somewhere in here is a key to the whole thing and we just can t see it They went back to the data again going through it step by step This was Jack Alvarez s specialty the technique of diagnosis the ability to take all the available information about a race and about its illness and piece it together into a pattern that made sense Dal could see that Jack was now bitterly angry with himself yet at every turn he seemed to strike another obstacle some fact that didn t jibe a missing fragment here a wrong answer there With Dal and Tiger helping he started back over the sequence of events trying to make sense out of them and came up squarely against a blank wall The things they had done should have worked instead they had failed A specific antibody used against a specific virus should have destroyed the virus or slowed its progress and there seemed to be no rational explanation for the dreadful response of the uninfected ones who had been inoculated for protection And as the doctors sifted through the data the Bruckian they had brought up from the enclosure sat staring off into space making small noises with his mouth and moving his arms aimlessly After a while they led him back to a bunk gave him a medicine for sleep and left him snoring gently Another hour passed as they pored over their notes with Tiger stopping from time to time to mop perspiration from his forehead All three were aware of the moving clock hands marking off the minutes that the force screen could hold out And then Dal Timgar was digging into the pile of papers searching frantically for something he could not find That first report we got he said hoarsely There was something in the very first information we ever saw on this planet You mean the Confederation s data It s in the radio log Tiger pulled open the thick log book But what It s there plain as day I m sure of it Dal said He read through the report swiftly until he came to the last paragraph a two line description of the largest creatures the original Exploration Ship had found on the planet described by them as totally unintelligent and only observed on a few occasions in the course of the exploration Dal read it and his hands were trembling as he handed the report to Jack I knew the answer was there he said Take a look at that again and think about it for a minute Jack read it through I don t see what you mean he said I mean that I think we ve made a horrible mistake Dal said and I think I see now what it was We ve had this whole thing exactly one hundred per cent backward from the start and that explains everything that s happened here Tiger peered over Jack s shoulder at the report Backward As backward as we could get it Dal said We ve assumed all along that these flesh and blood creatures down there were the ones that were calling us for help because of a virus plague that was attacking and killing them All right look at it the other way Just suppose that the intelligent creature that called us for help was the virus and that those flesh and blood creatures down there with the blank stupid faces are the real plague we ought to have been fighting all along CHAPTER eleven DAL BREAKS A PROMISE For a moment the others just stared at their Garvian crewmate Then Jack Alvarez snorted You d better go back and get some rest he said This has been a tougher grind than I thought You re beginning to show the strain No I mean it Dal said earnestly I think that is exactly what s been happening Tiger looked at him with concern Dal this is no time for double talk and nonsense It s not nonsense Dal said It s the answer if you ll only stop and think An intelligent virus Jack said Who ever heard of such a thing There s never been a life form like that reported since the beginning of the galactic exploration But that doesn t mean there couldn t be one Dal said And how would an exploratory crew ever identify it if it existed How would they ever even suspect it They d miss it completely unless it happened to get into trouble itself and try to call for help Dal jumped up in excitement Look I ve seen a dozen articles showing how such a thing was theoretically possible a virus life form with billions of submicroscopic parts acting together to form an intelligent colony The only thing a virus creature would need that other intelligent creatures don t need would be some kind of a host some sort of animal body to live in so that it could use its intelligence It s impossible Jack said scornfully Why don t you give it up and get some rest Here we sit with our feet in the fire and all you can do is dream up foolishness like this I m not so sure it s foolishness Tiger Martin said slowly Jack maybe he s got something A couple of things would fit that don t make sense at all All sorts of things would fit Dal said The viruses we know have to have a host some other life form to live in Usually they are parasites damaging or destroying their hosts and giving nothing in return but some set up real partnership housekeeping with their hosts so that both are better off You mean a symbiotic relationship Jack said Of course Dal said Now suppose these virus creatures were intelligent and came from some other place looking for a new host they could live with They wouldn t look for an intelligent creature they would look for some unintelligent creature with a good strong body that would be capable of doing all sorts of things if it only had an intelligence to guide it Suppose these virus creatures found a simple minded unintelligent race on this planet and tried to set up a symbiotic relationship with it The virus creatures would need a host to provide a home and a food supply Maybe they in turn could supply the intelligence to raise the host to a civilized level of life and performance Wouldn t that be a fair basis for a sound partnership Jack scratched his head doubtfully And you re saying that these virus creatures came here after the exploratory ship had come and gone They must have Maybe they only came a few years ago maybe only months ago But when they tried to invade the unintelligent creatures the exploratory ship found here they discovered that the new host s body couldn t tolerate them His body reacted as if they were parasitic invaders and built up antibodies against them And those body defenses were more than the virus could cope with Dal pointed to the piles of notes on the desk Don t you see how it adds up Right from the beginning we ve been assuming that these monkey like creatures here on this planet were the dominant intelligent life forms Anatomically they were ordinary cellular creatures like you and me and when we examined them we expected to find the same sort of biochemical reactions we d find with any such creatures And all our results came out wrong because we were dealing with a combination of two creatures the host and a virus Maybe the creatures on thirty one Brucker VII were naturally blank faced idiots before the virus came or maybe the virus was forced to damage some vital part just in order to fight back but it was the virus that was being killed by its own host not the other way around Jack studied the idea no longer scornful So you think the virus creatures called for help hoping we could find some way to free them from the hosts that were killing them And when Fuzzy developed a powerful antibody against them and we started using the stuff Jack broke off shaking his head in horror Dal if you re right we were literally slaughtering our own patients when we gave those injections down there Exactly Dal said Is it any wonder they re so scared of us now It must have looked like a deliberate attempt to wipe them out and now they re afraid that we ll go get help and really move in against them Tiger nodded Which was precisely what we were planning if you stop to think about it Maybe that was why they were so reluctant to tell us anything about themselves Maybe they ve already been mistaken for parasitic invaders before wherever in the universe they came from But if this is true then we re really in a jam Jack said What can we possibly do for them We can t even repair the damage that we ve already done What sort of treatment can we use Dal shook his head I don t know the answer to that one but I do know we ve got to find out if we re right An intelligent virus creature has as much right to life as any other intelligent life form If we ve guessed right then there s a lot that our intelligent friends down there haven t told us Maybe there ll be some clue there We ve just got to face them with it and see what they say Jack looked at the viewscreen at the angry mob milling around on the ground held back from the ship by the energy screen You mean just go out there and say Look fellows it was all a mistake we didn t really mean to do it He shook his head Maybe you want to tell them Not me Dal s right though Tiger said We ve got to contact them somehow They aren t even responding to radio communication and they ve scrambled our outside radio and fouled our drive mechanism somehow We ve got to settle this while we still have an energy screen There was a long silence as the three doctors looked at each other Then Dal stood up and walked over to the swinging platform He lifted Fuzzy down onto his shoulder It ll be all right he said to Jack and Tiger I ll go out They ll tear you to ribbons Tiger protested Dal shook his head I don t think so he said quietly I don t think they ll touch me They ll greet me with open arms when I go down there and they ll be eager to talk to me Are you crazy Jack cried leaping to his feet We can t let you go out there Don t worry Dal said I know exactly what I m doing I ll be able to handle the situation believe me He hesitated a moment and gave Fuzzy a last nervous pat settling him more firmly on his shoulder Then he started down the corridor for the entrance lock He had promised himself long before many years before that he would never do what he planned to do now but now he knew that there was no alternative The only other choice was to wait helplessly until the power failed and the protective screen vanished and the creatures on the ground outside tore the ship to pieces As he stood in the airlock waiting for the pressure to shift to outside normal he lifted Fuzzy down into the crook of his arm and rubbed the little creature between the shoe button eyes You ve got to back me up now he whispered softly It s been a long time I know that but I need help now It s going to be up to you Dal knew the subtle strength of his people s peculiar talent From the moment he had stepped down to the ground the second time with Tiger and Jack even with Fuzzy waiting back on the ship he had felt the powerful wave of horror and fear and anger rising up from the Bruckians and he had glimpsed the awful idiot vacancy of the minds of the creatures in the enclosure in whom the intelligent virus was already dead This had required no effort it just came naturally into his mind and he had known instantly that something terrible had gone wrong In the years on Hospital Earth he had carefully forced himself never to think in terms of his special talent He had diligently screened off the impressions and emotions that struck at him constantly from his classmates and from others that he came in contact with Above all he had fought down the temptation to turn his power the other way to use it to his own advantage But now as the lock opened and he started down the ladder he closed his mind to everything else Hugging Fuzzy close to his side he turned his mind into a single tight channel He drove the thought out at the Bruckians with all the power he could muster I come in peace I mean you no harm I have good news joyful news You must be happy to see me eager to welcome me He could feel the wave of anger and fear strike him like a physical blow as soon as he appeared in the entrance lock The cries rose up in a wave and the crowd surged in toward the ship With the energy field released there was nothing to stop them they were tripping over each other to reach the bottom of the ladder first shouting threats and waving angry fists reaching up to grab at Dal s ankles as he came down And then as if by magic the cries died in the throats of the ones closest to the ladder The angry fists unclenched and extended into outstretched hands to help him down to the ground As though an ever widening wave was spreading out around him the aura of peace and good will struck the people in the crowd And as it spread the anger faded from the faces the hard lines gave way to puzzled frowns then to smiles Dal channeled his thoughts more rigidly and watched the effect spread out from him like ripples in a pond as anger and suspicion and fear melted away to be replaced by confidence and trust Dal had seen it occur a thousand times before He could remember his trips on Garvian trading ships with his father when the traders with their fuzzy pink friends on their shoulders faced cold hostile suspicious buyers It had seemed almost miraculous the way the suspicions melted away and the hostile faces became friendly as the buyers minds became receptive to bargaining and trading He had even seen it happen on the Teegar with Tiger and Jack and it was no coincidence that throughout the galaxy the Garvians always accompanied by their fuzzy friends had assumed the position of power and wealth and leadership that they had And now once again the pattern was being repeated The Bruckians who surrounded Dal were smiling and talking eagerly they made no move to touch him or harm him The spokesman they had talked to before was there at his elbow and Dal heard himself saying We have found the answer to your problem We know now the true nature of your race and the nature of your intelligence You were afraid that we would find out but your fears were groundless We will not turn our knowledge against you We only want to help you An expression almost like despair had crossed the spokesman s face as Dal spoke Now he said It would be good if we could believe you But how can we We have been driven for so long and come so far and now you would seek to wipe us out as parasites and disease carriers Dal saw the Bruckian creature s eyes upon him saw the frail body tremble and the lips move but he knew now that the intelligence that formed the words and the thoughts behind them the intelligence that made the lips speak the words was the intelligence of a creature far different from the one he was looking at a creature formed of billions of submicroscopic units imbedded in every one of the Bruckian s body cells trapped there now and helpless against the antibody reaction that sought to destroy them This was the intelligence that had called for help in its desperate plight but had not quite dared to trust its rescuers with the whole truth But was this strange virus creature good or evil hostile or friendly Dal s hand lay on Fuzzy s tiny body but he felt no quiver no vibration of fear He looked across the face of the crowd trying with all his strength to open his mind to the feelings and emotions of these people Often enough with Fuzzy nearby he had felt the harsh impact of hostile cruel brutal minds even when the owners of those minds had tried to conceal their feelings behind smiles and pleasant words But here there was no sign of the sickening feeling that kind of mind produced no hint of hostility or evil He shook his head Why should we want to destroy you he said You are good and peaceful We know that why should we harm you All you want is a place to live and a host to join with you in a mutually valuable partnership But you did not tell us everything you could about yourselves and as a result we have destroyed some of you in our clumsy attempts to learn your true nature They talked then and bit by bit the story came out The life form was indeed a virus unimaginably ancient and intelligent throughout millions of years of its history Driven by over population a pure culture of the virus creatures had long ago departed from their original native hosts and traveled like encapsulated spores across space from a distant galaxy The trip had been long and exhausting the virus creatures had retained only the minimum strength necessary to establish themselves in a new host some unintelligent creature living on an uninhabited planet a creature that could benefit by the great intelligence of the virus creatures and provide food and shelter for both Finally after thousands of years of searching they had found this planet with its dull minded fruit gathering inhabitants These creatures had seemed perfect as hosts and the virus creatures had thought their long search for a perfect partner was finally at an end It was not until they had expended the last dregs of their energy in anchoring themselves into the cells and tissues of their new hosts that they discovered to their horror that the host creatures could not tolerate them Unlike their original hosts the bodies of these creatures began developing deadly antibodies that attacked the virus invaders In their desperate attempts to hold on and fight back the virus creatures had destroyed vital centers in the new hosts and one by one they had begun to die There was not enough energy left for the virus creatures to detach themselves and move on without some way to stem the onslaught of the antibodies they were doomed to total destruction We were afraid to tell you doctors the truth the spokesman said As we wandered and searched we discovered that creatures like ourselves were extreme rarities in the universe that most creatures similar to us were mindless unintelligent parasites that struck down their hosts and destroyed them Wherever we went life forms of your kind regarded us as disease bearers and their doctors taught them ways to destroy us We had hoped that from you we might find a way to save ourselves then you unleashed on us the one weapon we could not fight But not maliciously Dal said Only because we did not understand And now that we do there may be a way to help A difficult way but at least a way The antibodies themselves can be neutralized but it may take our biochemists and virologists and all their equipment months or even years to develop and synthesize the proper antidote The spokesman looked at Dal and turned away with a hopeless gesture Then it is too late after all he said We are dying too fast Even those of us who have not been affected so far are beginning to feel the early symptoms of the antibody attack He smiled sadly and reached out to stroke the small pink creature on Dal s arm Your people too have a partner I see We envy you Dal felt a movement on his arm and looked down at Fuzzy He had always taken his little friend for granted but now he thought of the feeling of emptiness and loss that had come across him when Fuzzy had been almost killed He had often wondered just what Fuzzy might be like if his almost fluid infinitely adaptable physical body had only been endowed with intelligence He had wondered what kind of a creature Fuzzy might be if he were able to use his remarkable structure with the guidance of an intelligent mind behind it He felt another movement on his arm and his eyes widened as he stared down at his little friend A moment before there had been a single three inch pink creature on his elbow But now there were two each just one half the size of the original As Dal watched one of the two drew away from the other creeping in to snuggle closer to Dal s side and a pair of shoe button eyes appeared and blinked up at him trustingly But the other creature was moving down his arm straining out toward the Bruckian spokesman Dal realized instantly what was happening He started to draw back but something stopped him Deep in his mind he could sense a gentle voice reassuring him saying It s all right there is nothing to fear no harm will come to me These creatures need help and this is the way to help them He saw the Bruckian reach out a trembling hand The tiny pink creature that had separated from Fuzzy seemed almost to leap across to the outstretched hand And then the spokesman held him close and the new Fuzzy shivered happily The virus creatures had found a host Here was the ideal kind of body for their intelligence to work with and mold a host where antibody formation could be perfectly controlled Dal knew now that the problem had almost been solved once before when the virus creature had reached Fuzzy on the ship if they had only waited a little longer they would have seen Fuzzy recover from his illness a different creature entirely than before Already the new creature was dividing again with half going on to the next of the Bruckians To a submicroscopic virus the body of the host would not have to be large soon there would be a sufficient number of hosts to serve the virus creatures needs forever As he started back up the ladder to the ship Dal knew that the problem on thirty one Brucker VII had found a happy and permanent solution Back in the control room Dal related what had happened from beginning to end There was only one detail that he concealed He could not bring himself to tell Tiger and Jack of the true nature of his relationship with Fuzzy of the odd power over the emotions of others that Fuzzy s presence gave him He could tell by their faces that they realized that he was leaving something out they had watched him go down to face a blood thirsty mob and had seen that mob become docile as lambs as though by magic Clearly they could not understand what had happened yet they did not ask him So it was Fuzzy s idea to volunteer as a new host for the creatures Jack said Dal nodded I knew that he could reproduce of course he said Every Garvian has a Fuzzy and whenever a new Garvian is born the father s Fuzzy always splits so that half can join the new born child It s like the division of a cell within hours the Fuzzy that stayed down there will have divided to provide enough protoplasm for every one of the surviving intelligent Bruckians And your diagnosis was the right one Jack said We ll see Dal said Tomorrow we ll know better But clearly the problem had been solved The next day there was an excited conference between the spokesman and the doctors on the Lancet The Bruckians had elected to maintain the same host body as before They had gotten used to it with the small pink creatures serving as a shelter to protect them against the deadly antibodies they could live in peace and security But they were eager before the Lancet disembarked to sign a full medical service contract with the doctors from Hospital Earth A contract was signed subject only to final acceptance and ratification by the Hospital Earth officials Now that their radio was free again the three doctors jubilantly prepared a full account of the problem of thirty one Brucker and its solution and dispatched the news of the new contract to the first relay station on its way back to Hospital Earth Then weary to the point of collapse they retired for the first good sleep in days eagerly awaiting an official response from Hospital Earth on the completed case and the contract It ought to wipe out any black mark doctor Tanner has against any of us Jack said happily And especially in Dal s case He grinned at the Red Doctor This one has been yours all the way You pulled it out of the fire after I flubbed it completely and you re going to get the credit if I have anything to say about it We should all get credit Dal said A new contract isn t signed every day of the year But the way we all fumbled our way into it Hospital Earth shouldn t pay much attention to it anyway But Dal knew that he was only throwing up his habitual shield to guard against disappointment Traditionally a new contract meant a Star rating for each of the crew that brought it in All through medical school Dal had read the reports of other patrol ships that had secured new contracts with uncontacted planets and he had seen the fanfare and honor that were heaped on the doctors from those ships And for the first time since he had entered medical school years before Dal now allowed himself to hope that his goal was in sight He wanted to be a Star Surgeon more than anything else It was the one thing that he had wanted and worked for since the cruel days when the plague had swept his homeland destroying his mother and leaving his father an ailing cripple And since his assignment aboard the Lancet one thought had filled his mind to turn in the scarlet collar and cuff in return for the cape and silver star of the full fledged physician in the Red Service of Surgery Always before there had been the half conscious dread that something would happen that in the end after all the work the silver star would still remain just out of reach that somehow he would never quite get it But now there could be no question Even Black Doctor Tanner could not deny a new contract The crew of the Lancet would be called back to Hospital Earth for a full report on the newly contacted race and their days as probationary doctors in the General Practice patrol would be over After they had slept themselves out the doctors prepared the ship for launching and made their farewells to the Bruckian spokesman When the contract is ratified Jack said a survey ship will come here They will have all of the information that we have gathered and they will spend many months gathering more Tell them everything they want to know Don t conceal anything because once they have completed their survey any General Practice Patrol ship in the galaxy will be able to answer a call for help and have the information they need to serve you They delayed launching hour by hour waiting for a response from Hospital Earth but the radio was silent They thought of a dozen reasons why the message might have been delayed but the radio silence continued Finally they strapped down and lifted the ship from the planet still waiting for a response When it finally came there was no message of congratulations nor even any acknowledgment of the new contract Instead there was only a terse message PROCEED TO REFERENCE POINT forty three thousand six hundred twenty one SECTION XIX AND STAND BY FOR INSPECTION PARTY Tiger took the message and read it in silence then handed it to Dal What do they say Jack said Read it Dal said They don t mention the contract just an inspection party Inspection party Is that the best they can do for us They don t sound too enthusiastic Tiger said At least you d think they could acknowledge receipt of our report It s probably just part of the routine Dal said Maybe they want to confirm our reports from our own records before they commit themselves But he knew that he was only whistling in the dark The moment he saw the terse message he knew something had gone wrong with the contract There would be no notes of congratulation no returning in triumph and honor to Hospital Earth Whatever the reason for the inspection party Dal felt certain who the inspector was going to be It had been exciting to dream but the scarlet cape and the silver star were still a long way out of reach CHAPTER twelve THE SHOWDOWN It was hours later when their ship reached the contact point company ordinates There had been little talk during the transit each of them knew already what the other was thinking and there wasn t much to be said The message had said it for them Dal s worst fears were realized when the inspection ship appeared converting from Koenig drive within a few miles of the Lancet He had seen the ship before a sleek handsomely outfitted patrol class ship with the insignia of the Black Service of Pathology emblazoned on its hull the private ship of a Four star Black Doctor But none of them anticipated the action taken by the inspection ship as it drew within lifeboat range of the Lancet A scooter shot away from its storage rack on the black ship and a crew of black garbed technicians piled into the Lancet s entrance lock dressed in the special decontamination suits worn when a ship was returning from a plague spot into uninfected territory What is this Tiger demanded as the technicians started unloading decontamination gear into the lock What are you doing with that stuff The squad leader looked at him sourly You re in quarantine Doc he said Class I all precautions contact with unidentified pestilence If you don t like it argue with the Black Doctor I ve just got a job to do He started shouting orders to his men and they scattered throughout the ship with blowers and disinfectants driving antiseptic sprays into every crack and cranny of the ship s interior scouring the hull outside in the rigid pattern prescribed for plague ships They herded the doctors into the decontamination lock stripped them of their clothes scrubbed them down and tossed them special sterilized fatigues to wear with masks and gloves This is idiotic Jack protested We aren t carrying any dangerous organisms The squad leader shrugged indifferently Tell it to the Black Doctor not me All I know is that this ship is under quarantine until it s officially released and from what I hear it s not going to be released for quite some time At last the job was done and the scooter departed back to the inspection ship A few moments later they saw it returning this time carrying just three men In addition to the pilot and one technician there was a single passenger a portly figure dressed in a black robe horn rimmed glasses and cowl The scooter grappled the Lancet s side and Black Doctor Hugo Tanner climbed wheezing into the entrance lock followed by the technician He stopped halfway into the lock to get his breath and paused again as the lock swung closed behind him Dal was shocked at the physical change in the man in the few short weeks since he had seen him last The Black Doctor s face was gray every effort of movement brought on paroxysms of coughing He looked sick and he looked tired yet his jaw was still set in angry determination The doctors stood at attention as he stepped into the control room hardly able to conceal their surprise at seeing him Well the Black Doctor snapped at them What s the trouble with you You act like you ve seen a ghost or something We we d heard that you were in the hospital sir Did you now the Black Doctor snorted Hospital Bah I had to tell the press something to get the hounds off me for a while These young puppies seem to think that a Black Doctor can just walk away from his duties any time he chooses to undergo their fancy surgical procedures And you know who s been screaming the loudest to get their hands on me The Red Service of Surgery that s who The Black Doctor glared at Dal Timgar Well I dare say the Red Doctors will have their chance at me all in good time But first there are certain things which must be taken care of He looked up at the attendant You re quite certain that the ship has been decontaminated The attendant nodded Yes sir And the crewmen It s safe to talk to them sir as long as you avoid physical contact The Black Doctor grunted and wheezed and settled himself down in a seat All right now gentlemen he said to the three let s have your story of this affair in the Brucker system right from the start But we sent in a full report Tiger said I m aware of that you idiot I have waded through your report all thirty five pages of it and I only wish you hadn t been so long winded Now I want to hear what happened directly from you Well The three doctors looked at each other Then Jack began the story starting with the first hesitant greeting that had come through to them He told everything that had happened without embellishments their first analysis of the nature of the problem the biochemical and medical survey that they ran on the afflicted people his own failure to make the diagnosis the incident of Fuzzy s sudden affliction and the strange solution that had finally come from it As he talked the Black Doctor sat back with his eyes half closed his face blank listening and nodding from time to time as the story proceeded And Jack was carefully honest and fair in his account We were all of us lost until Dal Timgar saw the significance of what had happened to Fuzzy he said His idea of putting the creature through the filter gave us our first specimen of the isolated virus and showed us how to obtain the antibody Then after we saw what happened with our initial series of injections we were really at sea and by then we couldn t reach a hospital ship for help of any kind He went on to relate Dal s idea that the virus itself might be the intelligent creature and recounted the things that happened after Dal went down to talk to the spokesman again with Fuzzy on his shoulder Through it all the Black Doctor listened sourly glancing occasionally at Dal and saying nothing So is that all he said when Jack had finished Not quite Jack said I want it to be on the record that it was my failure in diagnosis that got us into trouble I don t want any misunderstanding about that If I d had the wit to think beyond the end of my nose there wouldn t have been any problem I see the Black Doctor said He pointed to Dal So it was this one who really came up with the answers and directed the whole program on this problem is that right That s right Jack said firmly He should get all the credit Something stirred in Dal s mind and he felt Fuzzy snuggling in tightly to his side He could feel the cold hostility in the Black Doctor s mind and he started to say something but the Black Doctor cut him off Do you agree to that also doctor Martin he asked Tiger I certainly do Tiger said I ll back up the Blue Doctor right down the line

none	none	unpleasantly and nodded Well I m certainly happy to hear you say that gentlemen I might say that it is a very great relief to me to hear it from your own testimony Because this time there shouldn t be any argument from either of you as to just where the responsibility lies and I m relieved to know that I can completely exonerate you two at any rate Jack Alvarez s jaw went slack and he stared at the Black Doctor as though he hadn t heard him properly Exonerate us he said Exonerate us from what From the charges of incompetence malpractice and conduct unbecoming to a physician which I am lodging against your colleague in the Red Service here the Black Doctor said angrily Of course I was confident that neither of you two could have contributed very much to this bungling mess but it is reassuring to have your own statements of that fact on the record They should carry more weight in a Council hearing than any plea I might make in your behalf But but what do you mean by a Council hearing Tiger stammered I don t understand you This this problem is solved We solved it as a patrol team all of us We sent in a brand new medical service contract from those people Oh yes That The Black Doctor drew a long pink dispatch sheet from an inner pocket and opened it out The doctors could see the photo reproductions of their signatures at the bottom Fortunately for you two this bit of nonsense was brought to my attention at the first relay station that received it I personally accepted it and withdrew it from the circuit before it could reach Hospital Earth for filing Slowly as they watched him he ripped the pink dispatch sheet into a dozen pieces and tossed it into the disposal vent So much for that he said slowly I can choose to overlook your foolishness in trying to cloud the important issues with a so called contract to divert attention but I m afraid I can t pay much attention to it nor allow it to appear in the general report And of course I am forced to classify the Lancet as a plague ship until a bacteriological and virological examination has been completed on both ship and crew The planet itself will be considered a galactic plague spot until proper measures have been taken to insure its decontamination The Black Doctor drew some papers from another pocket and turned to Dal Timgar As for you the charges are clear enough You have broken the most fundamental rules of good judgment and good medicine in handling the thirty one Brucker affair You have permitted a General Practice Patrol ship to approach a potentially dangerous plague spot without any notification of higher authorities You have undertaken a biochemical and medical survey for which you had neither the proper equipment nor the training qualifications and you exposed your ship and your crewmates to an incredible risk in landing on such a planet You are responsible for untold possibly fatal damage to over two hundred individuals of the race that called on you for help You have even subjected the creature that depends upon your own race for its life and support to virtual slavery and possible destruction and finally you had the audacity to try to cover up your bungling with claims of arranging a medical service contract with an uninvestigated race The Black Doctor broke off as an attendant came in the door and whispered something in his ear Doctor Tanner shook his head angrily I can t be bothered now They say it s urgent sir Yes it s always urgent The Black Doctor heaved to his feet If it weren t for this miserable incompetent here I wouldn t have to be taking precious time away from my more important duties He scowled at the Lancet crewmen You will excuse me for a moment he said and disappeared into the communications room The moment he was gone from the room Jack and Tiger were talking at once He couldn t really be serious Tiger said It s impossible Not one of those charges would hold up under investigation Well I think it s a frame up Jack said his voice tight with anger I knew that some people on Hospital Earth were out to get you but I don t see how a Four star Black Doctor could be a party to such a thing Either someone has been misinforming him or he just doesn t understand what happened Dal shook his head He understands all right and he s the one who s determined to get me out of medicine This is a flimsy excuse but he has to use it because it s now or never He knows that if we bring in a contract with a new planet and it s formally ratified we ll all get our Stars and he d never be able to block me again And Black Doctor Tanner is going to be certain that I don t get that Star or die trying But this is completely unfair Jack protested He s turning our own words against you You can bet that he ll have a survey crew down on that planet in no time bringing home a contract just the same as the one we wrote and there won t be any questions asked about it Except that I ll be out of the service Dal said Don t worry You ll get the credit in the long run When all the dust settles he ll be sure that you two are named as agents for the contract He doesn t want to hurt you it s me that he s out to get Well he won t get away with it Tiger said We can see to that It s not too late to retract our stories If he thinks he can get rid of you with something that wasn t your fault he s going to find out that he has to get rid of a lot more than just you But Dal was shaking his head Not this time Tiger This time you keep out of it What do you mean keep out of it Tiger cried Do you think I m going to stand by quietly and watch him cut you down That s exactly what you re going to do Dal said sharply I meant what I said I want you to keep your mouth shut Don t say anything more at all just let it be But I can t stand by and do nothing When a friend of mine needs help Can t you get it through your thick skull that this time I don t want your help Dal said Do me a favor this time Leave me alone Don t stick your thumb in the pie Tiger just stared at the little Garvian Look Dal all I m trying to do I know what you re trying to do Dal snapped and I don t want any part of it I don t need your help I don t want it Why do you have to force it down my throat There was a long silence Then Tiger spread his hands helplessly Okay he said if that s the way you want it He turned away from Dal his big shoulders slumping I ve only been trying to make up for some of the dirty breaks you ve been handed since you came to Hospital Earth I know that Dal said and I ve appreciated it Sometimes it s been the only thing that s kept me going But that doesn t mean that you own me Friendship is one thing proprietorship is something else I m not your private property He saw the look on Tiger s face as though he had suddenly turned and slapped him viciously across the face Look I know it sounds awful but I can t help it I don t want to hurt you and I don t want to change things with us but I m a person just like you are I can t go on leaning on you any longer Everybody has to stand on his own somewhere along the line You do and I do too And that goes for Jack too They heard the door to the communications shack open and the Black Doctor was back in the room Well he said Am I interrupting something He glanced sharply at the tight lipped doctors The call was from the survey section he went on blandly A survey crew is on its way to thirty one Brucker to start gathering some useful information on the situation But that is neither here nor there You have heard the charges against the Red Doctor here Is there anything any of you want to say Tiger and Jack looked at each other The silence in the room was profound The Black Doctor turned to Dal And 
1311_134176_000032_000005	train-clean-360	what about you 
none	none	I have something to say but I d like to talk to you alone As you wish You two will return to your quarters and stay there The attendant too Dal said The Black Doctor s eyes glinted and met Dal s for a moment Then he shrugged and nodded to his attendant Step outside please We have a private matter to discuss The Black Doctor turned his attention to the papers on the desk as Dal stood before him with Fuzzy sitting in the crook of his arm From the moment that the notice of the inspection ship s approach had come to the Lancet Dal had known what was coming He had been certain what the purpose of the detainment was and who the inspector would be yet he had not really been worried In the back of his mind a small comfortable thought had been sustaining him It didn t really matter how hostile or angry Black Doctor Tanner might be he knew that in a last ditch stand there was one way the Black Doctor could be handled He remembered the dramatic shift from hostility to friendliness among the Bruckians when he had come down from the ship with Fuzzy on his shoulder Before then he had never considered using his curious power to protect himself and gain an end but since then without even consciously bringing it to mind he had known that the next time would be easier If it ever came to a showdown with Black Doctor Tanner a trap from which he couldn t free himself there was still this way The Black Doctor would never know what happened he thought It would just seem to him suddenly that he had been looking at things the wrong way No one would ever know But he knew even as the thought came to mind that this was not so Now face to face with the showdown he knew that it was no good One person would know what had happened himself On thirty one Brucker he had convinced himself that the end justified the means here it was different For a moment as Black Doctor Tanner stared up at him through the horn rimmed glasses Dal wavered Why should he hesitate to protect himself he thought angrily This attack against him was false and unfair trumped up for the sole purpose of destroying his hopes and driving him out of the Service Why shouldn t he grasp at any means fair or unfair to fight it But he could hear the echo of Black Doctor Arnquist s words in his mind I beg of you not to use it No matter what happens don t use it Of course Doctor Arnquist would never know for sure that he had broken faith but he would know Well Black Doctor Tanner was saying speak up I can t waste much more time dealing with you If you have something to say say it Dal sighed He lifted Fuzzy down and slipped him gently into his jacket pocket These charges against me are not true he said The Black Doctor shrugged Your own crewmates support them with their statements That s not the point They re not true and you know it as well as I do You ve deliberately rigged them up to build a case against me The Black Doctor s face turned dark and his hands clenched on the papers on the desk Are you suggesting that I have nothing better to do than to rig false charges against one probationer out of seventy five thousand traveling the galaxy I m suggesting that we are alone here Dal said Nobody else is listening Just for once right now we can be honest We both know what you re trying to do to me I d just like to hear you admit it once The Black Doctor slammed his fist down on the table I don t have to listen to insolence like this he roared Yes you do Dal said Just this once Then I ll be through Suddenly Dal s words were tumbling out of control and his whole body was trembling with anger You have been determined from the very beginning that I should never finish the medical training that I started You ve tried to block me time after time in every way you could think of You ve almost succeeded but never quite made it until this time But now you have to make it If that contract were to go through I d get my Star and you d never again be able to do anything about it So it s now or never if you re going to break me Nonsense the Black Doctor stormed I wouldn t lower myself to meddle with your kind The charges speak for themselves Not if you look at them carefully You claim I failed to notify Hospital Earth that we had entered a plague area but our records of our contact with the planet prove that we did only what any patrol ship would have done when the call came in We didn t have enough information to know that there was a plague there and when we finally did know the truth we could no longer make contact with Hospital Earth You claim that I brought harm to two hundred of the natives there yet if you study our notes and records you will see that our errors there were unavoidable We couldn t have done anything else under the circumstances and if we hadn t done what we did we would have been ignoring the basic principles of diagnosis and treatment which we ve been taught And your charges don t mention that by possibly harming two hundred of the Bruckians we found a way to save two million of them from absolute destruction The Black Doctor glared at him The charges will stand up I ll see to that Oh I m sure you will You can ram them through and make them stick before anybody ever has a chance to examine them carefully You have the power to do it And by the time an impartial judge could review all the records your survey ship will have been there and gathered so much more data and muddied up the field so thoroughly that no one will ever be certain that the charges aren t true But you and I know that they wouldn t really hold up under inspection We know that they re false right down the line and that you re the one who is responsible for them The Black Doctor grew darker and he trembled with rage as he drew himself to his feet Dal could feel his hatred almost like a physical blow and his voice was almost a shriek All right he said if you insist then the charges are lies made up specifically to break you and I m going to push them through if I have to jeopardize my reputation to do it You could have bowed out gracefully at any time along the way and saved yourself dishonor and disgrace but you wouldn t do it Now I m going to force you to I ve worked my lifetime long to build the reputation of Hospital Earth and of the Earthmen that go out to all the planets as representatives I ve worked to make the Confederation respect Hospital Earth and the Earthmen who are her doctors You don t belong here with us You forced yourself in you aren t an Earthman and you don t have the means or resources to be a doctor from Hospital Earth If you succeed a thousand others will follow in your footsteps chipping away at the reputation that we have worked to build and I m not going to allow one incompetent alien bungler pretending to be a surgeon to walk in and destroy the thing I ve fought to build The Black Doctor s voice had grown shrill almost out of control But now suddenly he broke off his mouth still working and his face went deathly white The finger he was pointing at Dal wavered and fell He clutched at his chest his breath coming in great gasps and staggered back into the chair Something s happened his voice croaked I can t breathe Dal stared at him in horror for a moment then leaped across the room and jammed his thumb against the alarm bell CHAPTER thirteen THE TRIAL Red Doctor Dal Timgar knew at once that there would be no problem in diagnosis here The Black Doctor slumped back in his seat gasping for air his face twisted in pain as he labored just to keep on breathing Tiger and Jack burst into the room and Dal could tell that they knew instantly what had happened Coronary Jack said grimly Dal nodded The question is just how bad Get the cardiograph in here We ll soon see But the electrocardiograph was not needed to diagnose the nature of the trouble All three doctors had seen the picture often enough the sudden massive blockage of circulation to the heart that was so common to creatures with central circulatory pumps the sort of catastrophic accident which could cause irreparable crippling or sudden death within a matter of minutes Tiger injected some medicine to ease the pain and started oxygen to help the labored breathing but the old man s color did not improve He was too weak to talk he just lay helplessly gasping for air as they lifted him up onto a bed Then Jack took an electrocardiograph tracing and shook his head We d better get word back to Hospital Earth and fast he said quietly He just waited a little too long for that cardiac transplant that s all This is a bad one Tell them we need a surgeon out here just as fast as they can move or the Black Service is going to have a dead physician on its hands There was a sound across the room and the Black Doctor motioned feebly to Tiger The cardiogram he gasped Let me see it There s nothing for you to see Tiger said You mustn t do anything to excite yourself Let me see it doctor Tanner took the thin strip of paper and ran it quickly through his fingers Then he dropped it on the bed and lay his head back hopelessly Too late he said so softly they could hardly hear him Too late for help now Tiger checked his blood pressure and listened to his heart It will only take a few hours to get help he said You rest and sleep now There s plenty of time He joined Dal and Jack in the corridor I m afraid he s right this time he said The damage is severe and he hasn t the strength to hold out very long He might last long enough for a surgeon and operating team to get here but I doubt it We d better get the word off A few moments later he put the earphones aside It ll take six hours for the nearest help to get here he said Maybe five and a half if they really crowd it But when they get a look at that cardiogram on the screen they ll just throw up their hands He s got to have a transplant nothing less and even if we can keep him alive until a surgical team gets here the odds are a thousand to one against his surviving the surgery Well he s been asking for it Jack said They ve been trying to get him into the hospital for a cardiac transplant for years Everybody s known that one of those towering rages would get him sooner or later Maybe he ll hold on better than we think Dal said Let s watch and wait But the Black Doctor was not doing well Moment by moment he grew weaker laboring harder for air as his blood pressure crept slowly down Half an hour later the pain returned Tiger took another tracing while Dal checked his venous pressure and shock level As he finished Dal felt the Black Doctor s eyes on him It s going to be all right he said There ll be time for help to come Feebly the Black Doctor shook his head No time he said Can t wait that long Dal could see the fear in the old man s eyes His lips began to move again as though there were something more he wanted to say but then his face hardened and he turned his head away helplessly Dal walked around the bed and looked down at the tracing comparing it with the first one that was taken What do you think Tiger It s no good He ll never make it for five more hours What about right now Tiger shook his head It s a terrible surgical risk But every minute of waiting makes it worse right That s right Then I think we ll stop waiting Dal said We have a prosthetic heart in condition for use don t we Of course Good Get it ready now It seemed as though someone else were talking You ll have to be first assistant Tiger We ll get him onto the heart lung machine and if we don t have help available by then we ll have to try to complete the transplant Jack you ll give anaesthesia and it will be a tricky job Try to use local blocks as much as you can and have the heart lung machine ready well in advance We ll only have a few seconds to make the shift Now let s get moving Tiger stared at him Are you sure that you want to do this I never wanted anything less in my life Dal said fervently But do you think he can survive until a Hospital Ship arrives No Then it seems to me that I don t have any choice You two don t need to worry This is a surgical problem now and I ll take full responsibility The Black Doctor was watching him and Dal knew he had heard the conversation Now the old man lay helplessly as they moved about getting the surgical room into preparation Jack prepared the anaesthetics checked and rechecked the complex heart lung machine which could artificially support circulation and respiration at the time that the damaged heart was separated from its great vessels The transplant prosthetic heart had been grown in the laboratories on Hospital Earth from embryonic tissue Tiger removed it from the frozen specimen locker and brought it to normal body temperature in the special warm saline bath designed for the purpose Throughout the preparations the Black Doctor lay watching still conscious enough to recognize what was going on attempting from time to time to shake his head in protest but not quite succeeding Finally Dal came to the bedside Don t be afraid he said gently to the old man It isn t safe to try to delay until the ship from Hospital Earth can get here Every minute we wait is counting against you I think I can manage the transplant if I start now I know you don t like it but I am the Red Doctor in authority on this ship If I have to order you I will The Black Doctor lay silent for a moment staring at Dal Then the fear seemed to fade from his face and the anger disappeared With a great effort he moved his head to nod All right son he said softly Do the best you know how Dal knew from the moment he made the decision to go ahead that the thing he was undertaking was all but hopeless There was little or no talk as the three doctors worked at the operating table The overhead light in the ship s tiny surgery glowed brightly the only sound in the room was the wheeze of the anaesthesia apparatus the snap of clamps and the doctors own quiet breathing as they worked desperately against time Dal felt as if he were in a dream working like an automaton going through mechanical motions that seemed completely unrelated to the living patient that lay on the operating table In his training he had assisted at hundreds of organ transplant operations he himself had done dozens of cardiac transplants with experienced surgeons assisting and guiding him until the steps of the procedure had become almost second nature On Hospital Earth with the unparalleled medical facilities available there and with well trained teams of doctors anaesthetists and nurses the technique of replacing an old worn out damaged heart with a new and healthy one had become commonplace It posed no more threat to a patient than a simple appendectomy had posed three centuries before But here in the patrol ship s operating room under emergency conditions there seemed little hope of success Already the Black Doctor had suffered violent shock from the damage that had occurred in his heart Already he was clinging to life by a fragile thread the additional shock of the surgery of the anaesthesia and the necessary conversion to the heart lung machine while the delicate tissues of the new heart were fitted and sutured into place vessel by vessel was more than any patient could be expected to survive Yet Dal had known when he saw the second cardiogram that the attempt would have to be made Now he worked swiftly his frail body engulfed in the voluminous surgical gown his thin fingers working carefully with the polished instruments Speed and skill were all that could save the Black Doctor now to offer him the one chance in a thousand that he had for survival But the speed and skill had to be Dal s Dal knew that and the knowledge was like a lead weight strapped to his shoulders If Black Doctor Hugo Tanner was fighting for his life now Dal knew that he too was fighting for his life the only kind of life that he wanted the life of a physician Black Doctor Tanner s antagonism to him as an alien as an incompetent as one who was unworthy to wear the collar and cuff of a physician from Hospital Earth was common knowledge Dal realized with perfect clarity that if he failed now his career as a physician would be over no one not even himself would ever be entirely certain that he had not somehow in some dim corner of his mind allowed himself to fail Yet if he had not made the attempt and the Black Doctor had died before help had come there would always be those who would accuse him of delaying on purpose His mouth was dry he longed for a drink of water even though he knew that no water could quench this kind of thirst His fingers grew numb as he worked and moment by moment the sense of utter hopelessness grew stronger in his mind Tiger worked stolidly across the table from him inexpert help at best because of the sketchy surgical training he had had Even his solid presence in support here did not lighten the burden for Dal There was nothing that Tiger could do or say that would help things or change things now Even Fuzzy waiting alone on his perch in the control room could not help him now Nothing could help now but his own individual skill as a surgeon and his bitter determination that he must not and would not fail But his fingers faltered as a thousand questions welled up in his mind Was he doing this right This vessel here clamp it and tie it Or dissect it out and try to preserve it This nerve plexus which one was it How important How were the blood pressure and respirations doing Was the Black Doctor holding his own under the assault of the surgery The more Dal tried to hurry the more he seemed to be wading through waist deep mud unable to make his fingers do what he wanted them to do How could he save ten seconds twenty seconds a half a minute That half a minute might make the difference between success or failure yet the seconds ticked by swiftly and the procedure was going slowly Too slowly He reached a point where he thought he could not go on His mind was searching desperately for help any kind of help something to lean on something to brace him and give him support And then quite suddenly he understood something clearly that had been nibbling at the corners of his mind for a long time It was as if someone had snapped on a floodlight in a darkened room and he saw something he had never seen before He saw that from the first day he had stepped down from the Garvian ship that had brought him to Hospital Earth to begin his medical training he had been relying upon crutches to help him Black Doctor Arnquist had been a crutch upon whom he could lean Tiger for all his clumsy good heartedness and for all the help and protection he had offered had been a crutch Fuzzy who had been by his side since the day he was born was still another kind of crutch to fall back on a way out a port of haven in the storm They were crutches every one and he had leaned on them heavily But now there was no crutch to lean on He had a quick mind with good training He had two nimble hands that knew their job and two legs that were capable of supporting his weight frail as they were He knew now that he had to stand on them squarely for the first time in his life And suddenly he realized that this was as it should be It seemed so clear so obvious and unmistakable that he wondered how he could have failed to recognize it for so long If he could not depend on himself then Black Doctor Hugo Tanner would have been right all along If he could not do this job that was before him on his own strength standing on his own two legs without crutches to lean on how could he claim to be a competent physician What right did he have to the goal he sought if he had to earn it on the strength of the help of others It was he who wanted to be a Star Surgeon not Fuzzy not Tiger nor anyone else He felt his heart thudding in his chest and he saw the operation before him as if he were standing in an amphitheater peering down over some other surgeon s shoulder Suddenly everything else was gone from his mind but the immediate task at hand His fingers began to move more swiftly with a confidence he had never felt before The decisions to be made arose and he made them without hesitation and knew as he made them that they were right And for the first time the procedure began to move He murmured instructions to Jack from time to time and placed Tiger s clumsy hands in the places he wanted them for retraction Not there back a little he said That s right Now hold this clamp and release it slowly while I tie then reclamp it Slowly now that s the way Jack check that pressure again It seemed as though someone else were doing the surgery directing his hands step by step in the critical work that had to be done Dal placed the connections to the heart lung machine perfectly and moved with new swiftness and confidence as the great blood vessels were clamped off and the damaged heart removed A quick check of vital signs chemistries oxygenation a sharp instruction to Jack a caution to Tiger and the new prosthetic heart was in place He worked now with painstaking care manipulating the micro sutures that would secure the new vessels to the old so firmly that they were almost indistinguishable from a healed wound and he knew that it was going right now that whether the patient ultimately survived or not he had made the right decision and had carried it through with all the skill at his command And then the heart lung machine fell silent again and the carefully applied nodal stimulator flicked on and off and slowly at first hesitantly then firmly and vigorously the new heart began its endless pumping chore The Black Doctor s blood pressure moved up to a healthy level and stabilized the gray flesh of his face slowly became suffused with healthy pink It was over and Dal was walking out of the surgery his hands trembling so violently that he could hardly get his gown off He wanted to laugh and cry at the same time and he could see the silent pride in the others faces as they joined him in the dressing room to change clothes He knew then that no matter what happened he had vindicated himself Half an hour later back in the sickbay the Black Doctor was awake breathing slowly and easily without need of supplemental oxygen Only the fine sweat standing out on his forehead gave indication of the ordeal he had been through Swiftly and clinically Dal checked the vital signs as the old man watched him He was about to turn the pressure cuff over to Jack and leave when the Black Doctor said Wait Dal turned to him Yes sir You did it the Black Doctor said softly Yes sir It s finished The transplant is done Yes Dal said It went well and you can rest now You were a good patient For the first time Dal saw a smile cross the old man s face A foolish patient perhaps he said so softly that no one but Dal could hear but not so foolish now not so foolish that I cannot recognize a good doctor when I see one And with a smile he closed his eyes and went to sleep CHAPTER fourteen STAR SURGEON It was amazing to Dal Timgar just how good it seemed to be back on Hospital Earth again In the time he had been away as a crewman of the Lancet the seasons had changed and the port of Philadelphia lay under the steaming summer sun As Dal stepped off the shuttle ship to join the hurrying crowds in the great space port it seemed almost as though he were coming home He thought for a moment of the night not so long before when he had waited here for the shuttle to Hospital Seattle to attend the meeting of the medical training council He had worn no uniform then not even the collar and cuff of the probationary physician and he remembered his despair that night when he had thought that his career as a physician from Hospital Earth was at an end Now he was returning by shuttle from Hospital Seattle to the port of Philadelphia again completing the cycle that had been started many months before 
1311_134176_000005_000001	train-clean-360	But things were different now 
none	none	The scarlet cape of the Red Service of Surgery hung from his slender shoulders now and the light of the station room caught the polished silver emblem on his collar It was a tiny bit of metal but its significance was enormous It announced to the world Dal Timgar s final and permanent acceptance as a physician but more it symbolized the far reaching distances he had already traveled and would travel again in the service of Hospital Earth It was the silver star of the Star Surgeon The week just past had been both exciting and confusing The hospital ship had arrived five hours after Black Doctor Hugo Tanner had recovered from his anaesthesia moving in on the Lancet in frantic haste and starting the shipment of special surgical supplies anaesthetics and maintenance equipment across in lifeboats almost before contact had been stabilized A large passenger boat hurtled away from the hospital ship s side carrying a pair of Four star surgeons half a dozen Three star Surgeons two Radiologists two Internists a dozen nurses and another Four star Black Doctor across to the Lancet and when they arrived at the patrol ship s entrance lock they discovered that their haste had been in vain It was like Grand Rounds in the general wards of Hospital Philadelphia with the Four star Surgeons in the lead as they tramped aboard the patrol ship They found Black Doctor Tanner sitting quietly at his bedside reading a journal of pathology and taking notes He glared up at them when they burst in the door without even knocking But are you feeling well sir the chief surgeon asked him for the third time Of course I m feeling well Do you think I d be sitting here if I weren t the Black Doctor growled doctor Timgar is my surgeon and the physician in charge of this case Talk to him He can give you all the details of the matter You mean you permitted a probationary physician to perform this kind of surgery The Four star Surgeon cried incredulously
1311_134176_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 I did not the Black Doctor snapped 
none	none	He had to drag me kicking and screaming into the operating room But fortunately for me this particular probationary physician had the courage of his convictions as well as wit enough to realize that I would not survive if he waited for you to gather your army together But I think you will find the surgery was handled with excellent skill Again I must refer you to doctor Timgar for the details I was not paying attention to the technique of the surgery I assure you But sir the chief surgeon broke in how could there have been surgery of any sort here The dispatch that came to us listed the Lancet as a plague ship Plague ship the Black Doctor exploded Oh yes Egad I hum imagine that the dispatcher must have gotten his signals mixed somehow Well I suppose you want to examine me Let s have it over with The doctors examined him within an inch of his life They exhausted every means of physical laboratory and radiological examination short of re opening his chest and looking in and at last the chief surgeon was forced reluctantly to admit that there was nothing left for him to do but provide post operative follow up care for the irascible old man And by the time the examination was over and the Black Doctor was moved aboard the hospital ship word had come through official channels to the Lancet announcing that the quarantine order had been a dispatcher s unfortunate error and directing the ship to return at once to Hospital Earth with the new contract that had been signed on thirty one Brucker VII The crewmen of the Lancet had special orders to report immediately to the medical training council at Hospital Seattle upon arrival in order to give their formal General Practice Patrol reports and to receive their appointments respectively as Star Physician Star Diagnostician and Star Surgeon The orders were signed with the personal mark of Hugo Tanner Physician of the Black Service of Pathology Now the ceremony and celebration in Hospital Seattle were over and Dal had another appointment to keep He lifted Fuzzy from his elbow and tucked him safely into an inner jacket pocket to protect him from the crowd in the station and moved swiftly through to the subway tubes He had expected to see Black Doctor Arnquist at the investment ceremonies but there had been neither sign nor word from him Dal tried to reach him after the ceremonies were over all he could learn was that the Black Doctor was unavailable And then a message had come through to Dal under the official Hospital Earth headquarters priority requesting him to present himself at once at the grand council building at Hospital Philadelphia for an interview of the utmost importance He followed the directions on the dispatch now and reached the grand council building well ahead of the appointed time He followed corridors and rode elevators until he reached the twenty second story office suite where he had been directed to report The whole building seemed alive with bustle as though something of enormous importance was going on high ranking physicians of all the services were hurrying about gathering in little groups at the elevators and talking among themselves in hushed voices Even more strange Dal saw delegation after delegation of alien creatures moving through the building some in the special atmosphere maintaining devices necessary for their survival on Earth some characteristically alone and unaccompanied others in the company of great retinues of underlings Dal paused in the main concourse of the building as he saw two such delegations arrive by special car from the port of Philadelphia Odd he said quietly reaching in to stroke Fuzzy s head Quite a gathering of the clans eh What do you think Last time I saw a gathering like this was back at home during one of the centennial conclaves of the Galactic Confederation On the twenty second floor a secretary ushered him into an inner office There he found Black Doctor Thorvold Arnquist in busy conference with a Blue Doctor a Green Doctor and a surgeon 
1311_134176_000021_000002	train-clean-360	The Black Doctor looked up and beamed 
none	none	That will be all right now gentlemen he said I ll be in touch with you directly He waited until the others had departed Then he crossed the room and practically hugged Dal in delight It s good to see you boy he said and above all it s good to see that silver star at last You and your little pink friend have done a good job a far better job than I thought you would do I must admit Dal perched Fuzzy on his shoulder But what is this about an interview Why did you want to see me and what are all these people doing here 
1311_134176_000024_000000	train-clean-360	doctor Arnquist laughed 
none	none	Don t worry he said You won t have to stay for the council meeting It will be a long boring session I fear Doubtless every single one of these delegates at some time in the next few days will be standing up to give us a three hour oration and it is my ill fortune as a Four star Black Doctor to have to sit and listen and smile through it all But in the end it will be worth it and I thought that you should at least know that your name will be mentioned many times during these sessions

1311_134176_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 You didn t know that you were a guinea pig did you the Black Doctor said 
none	none	I I m afraid I didn t An unwitting tool so to speak the Black Doctor chuckled You know of course that the Galactic Confederation has been delaying and stalling any action on Hospital Earth s application for full status as one of the Confederation powers and for a seat on the council We had fulfilled two criteria for admission without difficulty we had resolved our problems at home so that we were free from war on our own planet and we had a talent that is much needed and badly in demand in the galaxy a job to do that would fit into the Confederation s organization But the Confederation has always had a third criterion for its membership a criterion that Hospital Earth could not so easily prove or demonstrate The Black Doctor smiled After all there could be no place in a true Confederation of worlds for any one race of people that considered itself superior to all the rest No race can be admitted to the Confederation until its members have demonstrated that they are capable of tolerance willing to accept the members of other races on an equal footing And it has always been the nature of Earthmen to be intolerant to assume that one who looks strange and behaves differently must somehow be inferior The Black Doctor crossed the room and opened a folder on the desk You can read the details some other time if you like You were selected by the Galactic Confederation from a thousand possible applicants to serve as a test case to see if a place could be made for you on Hospital Earth No one here was told of your position not even you although certain of us suspected the truth The Confederation wanted to see if a well qualified likeable and intelligent creature from another world would be accepted and elevated to equal rank as a physician with Earthmen Dal stared at him And I was the one You were the one It was a struggle all right but Hospital Earth has finally satisfied the Confederation At the end of this conclave we will be admitted to full membership and given a permanent seat and vote in the galactic council Our probationary period will be over But enough of that What about you 
1311_134176_000032_000006	train-clean-360	What are your plans 
1311_134176_000032_000007	train-clean-360	What do you propose to do now that you have that star on your collar

none	none	Tiger Martin had been appointed to the survey crew returning to thirty one Brucker VII at his own request while Jack was accepting a temporary teaching post in the great diagnostic clinic at Hospital Philadelphia There were a dozen things that Dal had considered but for the moment he wanted only to travel from medical center to medical center on Hospital Earth observing and studying in order to decide how he would best like to use his abilities and his position as a Physician from Hospital Earth It will be in surgery of course he said Just where in surgery or what kind I don t know just yet But there will be time enough to decide that
1311_134176_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Then go along doctor Arnquist said with my congratulations and blessing 
none	none	You have taught us a great deal and perhaps you have learned some things at the same time Dal hesitated for a moment Then he nodded I ve learned some things he said but there s still one thing that I want to do before I go He lifted his little pink friend gently down from his shoulder and rested him in the crook of his arm Fuzzy looked up at him blinking his shoe button eyes happily You asked me once to leave Fuzzy with you and I refused I couldn t see then how I could possibly do without him even the thought was frightening 
1311_134176_000036_000004	train-clean-360	But now I think I ve changed my mind 
1311_134176_000037_000000	train-clean-360	He reached out and placed Fuzzy gently in the Black Doctor s hand 
1311_134176_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 I want you to keep him he said 
1311_134176_000037_000002	train-clean-360	 I don t think I ll need him any more I ll miss him but I think it would be better if I don t have him now Be good to him and let me visit him once in a while 
1311_134176_000038_000000	train-clean-360	The Black Doctor looked at Dal and then lifted Fuzzy up to his own shoulder 
1311_134176_000038_000001	train-clean-360	For a moment the little creature shivered as if afraid 
1311_134176_000038_000002	train-clean-360	Then he blinked twice at Dal trustingly and snuggled in comfortably against the Black Doctor s neck 
none	none	Without a word Dal turned and walked out of the office As he stepped down the corridor he waited fearfully for the wave of desolation and loneliness he had felt before when Fuzzy was away from him But there was no hint of those desolate feelings in his mind now And after all he thought why should there be He was not a Garvian any longer 
1311_134176_000040_000003	train-clean-360	He was a Star Surgeon from Hospital Earth 
none	none	He smiled as he stepped from the elevator into the main lobby and crossed through the crowd to the street doors 
1311_134176_000041_000001	train-clean-360	He pulled his scarlet cape tightly around his throat
