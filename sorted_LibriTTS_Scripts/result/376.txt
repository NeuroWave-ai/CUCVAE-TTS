none	none	Written by a Citizen who continued all the while in London Never made public before It was about the beginning of September sixteen sixty four that I among the rest of my neighbours heard in ordinary discourse that the plague was returned again in Holland for it had been very violent there and particularly at Amsterdam and Rotterdam in the year sixteen sixty three whither they say it was brought some said from Italy others from the Levant among some goods which were brought home by their Turkey fleet others said it was brought from Candia others from Cyprus

none	none	We had no such thing as printed newspapers in those days to spread rumours and reports of things and to improve them by the invention of men as I have lived to see practised since 
26_495_000007_000001	train-clean-100	But such things as these were gathered from the letters of merchants and others who corresponded abroad and from them was handed about by word of mouth only so that things did not spread instantly over the whole nation as they do now 
26_495_000007_000002	train-clean-100	But it seems that the Government had a true account of it and several councils were held about ways to prevent its coming over but all was kept very private 
26_495_000007_000003	train-clean-100	Hence it was that this rumour died off again and people began to forget it as a thing we were very little concerned in and that we hoped was not true till the latter end of November or the beginning of December sixteen sixty four when two men said to be Frenchmen died of the plague in Long Acre or rather at the upper end of Drury Lane 
none	none	The family they were in endeavoured to conceal it as much as possible but as it had gotten some vent in the discourse of the neighbourhood the Secretaries of State got knowledge of it and concerning themselves to inquire about it in order to be certain of the truth two physicians and a surgeon were ordered to go to the house and make inspection 
26_495_000007_000005	train-clean-100	This they did and finding evident tokens of the sickness upon both the bodies that were dead they gave their opinions publicly that they died of the plague 
26_495_000007_000006	train-clean-100	Whereupon it was given in to the parish clerk and he also returned them to the Hall and it was printed in the weekly bill of mortality in the usual manner thus

none	none	The people showed a great concern at this and began to be alarmed all over the town and the more because in the last week in December sixteen sixty four another man died in the same house and of the same distemper And then we were easy again for about six weeks when none having died with any marks of infection it was said the distemper was gone but after that I think it was about the twelfth of February another died in another house but in the same parish and in the same manner This turned the people s eyes pretty much towards that end of the town and the weekly bills showing an increase of burials in saint Giles s parish more than usual it began to be suspected that the plague was among the people at that end of the town and that many had died of it though they had taken care to keep it as much from the knowledge of the public as possible This possessed the heads of the people very much and few cared to go through Drury Lane or the other streets suspected unless they had extraordinary business that obliged them to it This increase of the bills stood thus the usual number of burials in a week in the parishes of saint Giles in the Fields and saint Andrew s Holborn were from twelve to seventeen or nineteen each few more or less but from the time that the plague first began in saint Giles s parish it was observed that the ordinary burials increased in number considerably

none	none	From December twenty seven to January three I might spend a great deal of time in my exclamations against the follies and indeed the wickedness of those things in a time of such danger in a matter of such consequences as this of a national infection But my memorandums of these things relate rather to take notice only of the fact and mention only that it was so How the poor people found the insufficiency of those things and how many of them were afterwards carried away in the dead carts and thrown into the common graves of every parish with these hellish charms and trumpery hanging about their necks remains to be spoken of as we go along All this was the effect of the hurry the people were in after the first notion of the plaque being at hand was among them and which may be said to be from about Michaelmas sixteen sixty four but more particularly after the two men died in saint Giles s in the beginning of December and again after another alarm in February For when the plague evidently spread itself they soon began to see the folly of trusting to those unperforming creatures who had gulled them of their money and then their fears worked another way namely to amazement and stupidity not knowing what course to take or what to do either to help or relieve themselves But they ran about from one neighbour s house to another and even in the streets from one door to another with repeated cries of Lord have mercy upon us What shall we do Indeed the poor people were to be pitied in one particular thing in which they had little or no relief and which I desire to mention with a serious awe and reflection which perhaps every one that reads this may not relish namely that whereas death now began not as we may say to hover over every one s head only but to look into their houses and chambers and stare in their faces Though there might be some stupidity and dulness of the mind and there was so a great deal yet there was a great deal of just alarm sounded into the very inmost soul if I may so say of others Many consciences were awakened many hard hearts melted into tears many a penitent confession was made of crimes long concealed It would wound the soul of any Christian to have heard the dying groans of many a despairing creature and none durst come near to comfort them Many a robbery many a murder was then confessed aloud and nobody surviving to record the accounts of it People might be heard even into the streets as we passed along calling upon God for mercy through Jesus Christ and saying I have been a thief I have been an adulterer I have been a murderer and the like and none durst stop to make the least inquiry into such things or to administer comfort to the poor creatures that in the anguish both of soul and body thus cried out Some of the ministers did visit the sick at first and for a little while but it was not to be done It would have been present death to have gone into some houses The very buriers of the dead who were the hardenedest creatures in town were sometimes beaten back and so terrified that they durst not go into houses where the whole families were swept away together and where the circumstances were more particularly horrible as some were but this was indeed at the first heat of the distemper Time inured them to it all and they ventured everywhere afterwards without hesitation as I shall have occasion to mention at large hereafter I am supposing now the plague to be begun as I have said and that the magistrates began to take the condition of the people into their serious consideration What they did as to the regulation of the inhabitants and of infected families I shall speak to by itself but as to the affair of health it is proper to mention it here that having seen the foolish humour of the people in running after quacks and mountebanks wizards and fortune tellers which they did as above even to madness the Lord Mayor a very sober and religious gentleman appointed physicians and surgeons for relief of the poor I mean the diseased poor and in particular ordered the College of Physicians to publish directions for cheap remedies for the poor in all the circumstances of the distemper This indeed was one of the most charitable and judicious things that could be done at that time for this drove the people from haunting the doors of every disperser of bills and from taking down blindly and without consideration poison for physic and death instead of life This direction of the physicians was done by a consultation of the whole College and as it was particularly calculated for the use of the poor and for cheap medicines it was made public so that everybody might see it and copies were given gratis to all that desired it But as it is public and to be seen on all occasions I need not give the reader of this the trouble of it I shall not be supposed to lessen the authority or capacity of the physicians when I say that the violence of the distemper when it came to its extremity was like the fire the next year The fire which consumed what the plague could not touch defied all the application of remedies the fire engines were broken the buckets thrown away and the power of man was baffled and brought to an end So the Plague defied all medicines the very physicians were seized with it with their preservatives in their mouths and men went about prescribing to others and telling them what to do till the tokens were upon them and they dropped down dead destroyed by that very enemy they directed others to oppose This was the case of several physicians even some of them the most eminent and of several of the most skilful surgeons Abundance of quacks too died who had the folly to trust to their own medicines which they must needs be conscious to themselves were good for nothing and who rather ought like other sorts of thieves to have run away sensible of their guilt from the justice that they could not but expect should punish them as they knew they had deserved Not that it is any derogation from the labour or application of the physicians to say they fell in the common calamity nor is it so intended by me it rather is to their praise that they ventured their lives so far as even to lose them in the service of mankind They endeavoured to do good and to save the lives of others But we were not to expect that the physicians could stop God s judgements or prevent a distemper eminently armed from heaven from executing the errand it was sent about Doubtless the physicians assisted many by their skill and by their prudence and applications to the saving of their lives and restoring their health But it is not lessening their character or their skill to say they could not cure those that had the tokens upon them or those who were mortally infected before the physicians were sent for as was frequently the case It remains to mention now what public measures were taken by the magistrates for the general safety and to prevent the spreading of the distemper when it first broke out I shall have frequent occasion to speak of the prudence of the magistrates their charity their vigilance for the poor and for preserving good order furnishing provisions and the like when the plague was increased as it afterwards was But I am now upon the order and regulations they published for the government of infected families I mentioned above shutting of houses up and it is needful to say something particularly to that for this part of the history of the plague is very melancholy but the most grievous story must be told About June the Lord Mayor of London and the Court of Aldermen as I have said began more particularly to concern themselves for the regulation of the city The justices of Peace for Middlesex by direction of the Secretary of State had begun to shut up houses in the parishes of saint Giles in the Fields saint Martin saint Clement Danes c and it was with good success for in several streets where the plague broke out upon strict guarding the houses that were infected and taking care to bury those that died immediately after they were known to be dead the plague ceased in those streets It was also observed that the plague decreased sooner in those parishes after they had been visited to the full than it did in the parishes of Bishopsgate Shoreditch Aldgate Whitechappel Stepney and others the early care taken in that manner being a great means to the putting a check to it This shutting up of houses was a method first taken as I understand in the plague which happened in sixteen oh three at the coming of King James the First to the crown and the power of shutting people up in their own houses was granted by Act of Parliament entitled An Act for the charitable Relief and Ordering of Persons infected with the Plague on which Act of Parliament the Lord Mayor and aldermen of the city of London founded the order they made at this time and which took place the first of July sixteen sixty five when the numbers infected within the city were but few the last bill for the ninety two parishes being but four and some houses having been shut up in the city and some people being removed to the pest house beyond Bunhill Fields in the way to Islington I say by these means when there died near one thousand a week in the whole the number in the city was but twenty eight and the city was preserved more healthy in proportion than any other place all the time of the infection These orders of my Lord Mayor s were published as I have said the latter end of June and took place from the first of July and were as follows viz ORDERS CONCEIVED AND PUBLISHED BY THE LORD MAYOR AND ALDERMEN OF THE CITY OF LONDON CONCERNING THE INFECTION OF THE PLAGUE sixteen sixty five WHEREAS in the reign of our late Sovereign King James of happy memory an Act was made for the charitable relief and ordering of persons infected with the plague whereby authority was given to justices of the peace mayors bailiffs and other head officers to appoint within their several limits examiners searchers watchmen keepers and buriers for the persons and places infected and to minister unto them oaths for the performance of their offices And the same statute did also authorise the giving of other directions as unto them for the present necessity should seem good in their directions It is now upon special consideration thought very expedient for preventing and avoiding of infection of sickness if it shall so please Almighty God that these officers following be appointed and these orders hereafter duly observed Examiners to be appointed in every Parish First it is thought requisite and so ordered that in every parish there be one two or more persons of good sort and credit chosen and appointed by the alderman his deputy and common council of every ward by the name of examiners to continue in that office the space of two months at least And if any fit person so appointed shall refuse to undertake the same the said parties so refusing to be committed to prison until they shall conform themselves accordingly The Examiner s Office That these examiners be sworn by the aldermen to inquire and learn from time to time what houses in every parish be visited and what persons be sick and of what diseases as near as they can inform themselves and upon doubt in that case to command restraint of access until it appear what the disease shall prove And if they find any person sick of the infection to give order to the constable that the house be shut up and if the constable shall be found remiss or negligent to give present notice thereof to the alderman of the ward Watchmen That to every infected house there be appointed two watchmen one for every day and the other for the night and that these watchmen have a special care that no person go in or out of such infected houses whereof they have the charge upon pain of severe punishment And the said watchmen to do such further offices as the sick house shall need and require and if the watchman be sent upon any business to lock up the house and take the key with him and the watchman by day to attend until ten of the clock at night and the watchman by night until six in the morning Searchers That there be a special care to appoint women searchers in every parish such as are of honest reputation and of the best sort as can be got in this kind and these to be sworn to make due search and true report to the utmost of their knowledge whether the persons whose bodies they are appointed to search do die of the infection or of what other diseases as near as they can And that the physicians who shall be appointed for cure and prevention of the infection do call before them the said searchers who are or shall be appointed for the several parishes under their respective cares to the end they may consider whether they are fitly qualified for that employment and charge them from time to time as they shall see cause if they appear defective in their duties That no searcher during this time of visitation be permitted to use any public work or employment or keep any shop or stall or be employed as a laundress or in any other common employment whatsoever Chirurgeons For better assistance of the searchers forasmuch as there hath been heretofore great abuse in misreporting the disease to the further spreading of the infection it is therefore ordered that there be chosen and appointed able and discreet chirurgeons besides those that do already belong to the pest house amongst whom the city and Liberties to be quartered as the places lie most apt and convenient and every of these to have one quarter for his limit and the said chirurgeons in every of their limits to join with the searchers for the view of the body to the end there may be a true report made of the disease And further that the said chirurgeons shall visit and search such like persons as shall either send for them or be named and directed unto them by the examiners of every parish and inform themselves of the disease of the said parties And forasmuch as the said chirurgeons are to be sequestered from all other cures and kept only to this disease of the infection it is ordered that every of the said chirurgeons shall have twelve pence a body searched by them to be paid out of the goods of the party searched if he be able or otherwise by the parish Nurse keepers If any nurse keeper shall remove herself out of any infected house before twenty eight days after the decease of any person dying of the infection the house to which the said nurse keeper doth so remove herself shall be shut up until the said twenty eight days be expired ORDERS CONCERNING INFECTED HOUSES AND PERSONS SICK OF THE PLAGUE Notice to be given of the Sickness The master of every house as soon as any one in his house complaineth either of blotch or purple or swelling in any part of his body or falleth otherwise dangerously sick without apparent cause of some other disease shall give knowledge thereof to the examiner of health within two hours after the said sign shall appear Sequestration of the Sick As soon as any man shall be found by this examiner chirurgeon or searcher to be sick of the plague he shall the same night be sequestered in the same house and in case he be so sequestered then though he afterwards die not the house wherein he sickened should be shut up for a month after the use of the due preservatives taken by the rest Airing the Stuff For sequestration of the goods and stuff of the infection their bedding and apparel and hangings of chambers must be well aired with fire and such perfumes as are requisite within the infected house before they be taken again to use This to be done by the appointment of an examiner Shutting up of the House If any person shall have visited any man known to be infected of the plague or entered willingly into any known infected house being not allowed the house wherein he inhabiteth shall be shut up for certain days by the examiner s direction None to be removed out of infected Houses but C Item that none be removed out of the house where he falleth sick of the infection into any other house in the city except it be to the pest house or a tent or unto some such house which the owner of the said visited house holdeth in his own hands and occupieth by his own servants and so as security be given to the parish whither such remove is made that the attendance and charge about the said visited persons shall be observed and charged in all the particularities before expressed without any cost of that parish to which any such remove shall happen to be made and this remove to be done by night And it shall be lawful to any person that hath two houses to remove either his sound or his infected people to his spare house at his choice so as if he send away first his sound he not after send thither his sick nor again unto the sick the sound and that the same which he sendeth be for one week at the least shut up and secluded from company for fear of some infection at the first not appearing Burial of the Dead That the burial of the dead by this visitation be at most convenient hours always either before sun rising or after sun setting with the privity of the churchwardens or constable and not otherwise and that no neighbours nor friends be suffered to accompany the corpse to church or to enter the house visited upon pain of having his house shut up or be imprisoned And that no corpse dying of infection shall be buried or remain in any church in time of common prayer sermon or lecture And that no children be suffered at time of burial of any corpse in any church churchyard or burying place to come near the corpse coffin or grave And that all the graves shall be at least six feet deep And further all public assemblies at other burials are to be foreborne during the continuance of this visitation No infected Stuff to be uttered That no clothes stuff bedding or garments be suffered to be carried or conveyed out of any infected houses and that the criers and carriers abroad of bedding or old apparel to be sold or pawned be utterly prohibited and restrained and no brokers

be shut up as infected and so shall continue shut up twenty days at the least No Person to be conveyed out of any infected House If any person visited do fortune by negligent looking unto or by any other means to come or be conveyed from a place infected to any other place the parish from whence such party hath come or been conveyed upon notice thereof given shall at their charge cause the said

watched That the constables see every house shut up and to be attended with watchmen which may keep them in and minister necessaries unto them at their own charges if they be able or at the common charge if they are unable the shutting up to be for the space of four weeks after all be whole That precise order to be taken that the searchers chirurgeons keepers and buriers are not to pass the streets without holding a red rod or wand of three feet in length in their hands open and evident to be seen and are not to go into any other house than into their own or into that whereunto they are directed or sent for but to forbear and abstain from company especially when they have been lately used in any such business or attendance Inmates That where several inmates are in one and the same house and any person in that house happens to be infected no other person or family of such house shall be suffered to remove him or themselves without a certificate from the examiners of health of that parish or in default thereof the house whither he or they so remove shall be shut up as in case of visitation Hackney Coaches That care be taken of hackney coachmen that they may not as some of them have been observed to do after carrying of infected persons to the pest house and other places be admitted to common use till their coaches be well aired and have stood unemployed by the space of five or six days after such service ORDERS FOR CLEANSING AND KEEPING OF THE STREETS SWEPT The Streets to be kept Clean First it is thought necessary and so ordered that every householder do cause the street to be daily prepared before his door and so to keep it clean swept all the week long That Rakers take it from out the Houses That the sweeping and filth of houses be daily carried away by the rakers and that the raker shall give notice of his coming by the blowing of a horn as hitherto hath been done Laystalls to be made far off from the City That the laystalls be removed as far as may be out of the city and common passages and that no nightman or other be suffered to empty a vault into any garden near about the city Care to be had of unwholesome Fish or Flesh and of musty Corn That

stray in the streets or lanes but that such swine be impounded by the beadle or any other officer and the owner punished according to Act of Common Council and that the dogs be killed by the dog killers appointed for that purpose ORDERS CONCERNING LOOSE PERSONS AND IDLE ASSEMBLIES Beggars Forasmuch as nothing is more complained of than the multitude of rogues and wandering beggars that swarm in every place about the city being a great cause of the spreading of the infection and will not be avoided notwithstanding any orders that have been given to the contrary It is therefore now ordered that such constables and others whom this matter may any way concern take special care that no wandering beggars be suffered in the streets of this city in any fashion or manner whatsoever upon the penalty provided by the law to be duly and severely executed upon them Plays That all plays bear baitings games singing of ballads buckler play or such like causes of assemblies of people be utterly prohibited and the parties offending severely punished by every alderman in his ward Feasting prohibited That all public feasting and particularly by the companies of this city and dinners at taverns ale houses and other places of common entertainment be forborne till further order and allowance and that the money thereby spared be preserved and employed for the benefit and relief of the poor visited with the infection Tippling houses That disorderly tippling in taverns ale houses coffee houses and cellars be severely looked unto as the common sin of this time and greatest occasion of dispersing the plague And that no company or person be suffered to remain or come into any tavern ale house or coffee house to drink after nine of the clock in the evening according to the ancient law and custom of this city upon the penalties ordained in that behalf And for the better execution of these orders and such other rules and directions as upon further consideration shall be found needful It is ordered and enjoined that the aldermen deputies and common councilmen shall meet together weekly once twice thrice or oftener as cause shall require at some one general place accustomed in their respective wards being clear from infection of the plague to consult how the said orders may be duly put in execution not intending that any dwelling in or near places infected shall come to the said meeting while their coming may be doubtful And the said aldermen and deputies and common councilmen in their several wards may put in execution any other good orders that by them at their said meetings shall be conceived and devised for preservation of his Majesty s subjects from the infection SIR JOHN LAWRENCE Lord Mayor SIR GEORGE WATERMAN SIR CHARLES DOE Sheriffs I need not say that these orders extended only to such places as were within the Lord Mayor s jurisdiction so it is requisite to observe that the justices of Peace within those parishes and places as were called the Hamlets and out parts took the same method As I remember the orders for shutting up of houses did not take Place so soon on our side because as I said before the plague did not reach to these eastern parts of the town at least nor begin to be very violent till the beginning of August For example the whole bill from the eleventh to the eighteenth of July was seventeen sixty one yet there died but seventy one of the plague in all those parishes we call the Tower Hamlets and they were as follows The next week And to the first was thus of Aug thus Aldgate fourteen thirty four sixty five Stepney thirty three fifty eight seventy six Whitechappel twenty one forty eight seventy nine saint Katherine Tower two four four Trinity Minories one one four seventy one one hundred forty five two hundred twenty eight It was indeed coming on amain for the burials that same week were in the next adjoining parishes thus The next week prodigiously To the first of increased as Aug thus saint Leonard s Shoreditch sixty four eighty four one hundred ten saint Botolph s Bishopsgate sixty five one hundred five one hundred sixteen saint Giles s Cripplegate two hundred thirteen four hundred twenty one five hundred fifty four three hundred forty two six hundred ten seven hundred eighty This shutting up of houses was at first counted a very cruel and unchristian method and the poor people so confined made bitter lamentations Complaints of the severity of it were also daily brought to my Lord Mayor of houses causelessly and some maliciously shut up I cannot say but upon inquiry many that complained so loudly were found in a condition to be continued and others again inspection being made upon the sick person and the sickness not appearing infectious or if uncertain yet on his being content to be carried to the pest house were released It is true that the locking up the doors of people s houses and setting a watchman there night and day to prevent their stirring out or any coming to them when perhaps the sound people in the family might have escaped if they had been removed from the sick looked very hard and cruel and many people perished in these miserable confinements which tis reasonable to believe would not have been distempered if they had had liberty though the plague was in the house at which the people were very clamorous and uneasy at first and several violences were committed and injuries offered to the men who were set to watch the houses so shut up also several people broke out by force in many places as I shall observe by and by But it was a public good that justified the private mischief and there was no obtaining the least mitigation by any application to magistrates or government at that time at least not that I heard of This put the people upon all manner of stratagem in order if possible to get out and it would fill a little volume to set down the arts used by the people of such houses to shut the eyes of the watchmen who were employed to deceive them and to escape or break out from them in which frequent scuffles and some mischief happened of which by itself As I went along Houndsditch one morning about eight o clock there was a great noise It is true indeed there was not much crowd because people were not very free to gather together or to stay long together when they were there nor did I stay long there But the outcry was loud enough to prompt my curiosity and I called to one that looked out of a window and asked what was the matter A watchman it seems had been employed to keep his post at the door of a house which was infected or said to be infected and was shut up He had been there all night for two nights together as he told his story and the day watchman had been there one day and was now come to relieve him All this while no noise had been heard in the house no light had been seen they called for nothing sent him of no errands which used to be the chief business of the watchmen neither had they given him any disturbance as he said from the Monday afternoon when he heard great crying and screaming in the house which as he supposed was occasioned by some of the family dying just at that time It seems the night before the dead cart as it was called had been stopped there and a servant maid had been brought down to the door dead and the buriers or bearers as they were called put her into the cart wrapt only in a green rug and carried her away The watchman had knocked at the door it seems when he heard that noise and crying as above and nobody answered a great while but at last one looked out and said with an angry quick tone and yet a kind of crying voice or a voice of one that was crying What d ye want that ye make such a knocking He answered I am the watchman How do you do What is the matter The person answered What is that to you Stop the dead cart This it seems was about one o clock Soon after as the fellow said he stopped the dead cart and then knocked again but nobody answered He continued knocking and the bellman called out several times Bring out your dead but nobody answered till the man that drove the cart being called to other houses would stay no longer and drove away The watchman knew not what to make of all this so he let them alone till the morning man or day watchman as they called him came to relieve him Giving him an account of the particulars they knocked at the door a great while but nobody answered and they observed that the window or casement at which the person had looked out who had answered before continued open being up two pair of stairs Upon this the two men to satisfy their curiosity got a long ladder and one of them went up to the window and looked into the room where he saw a woman lying dead upon the floor in a dismal manner having no clothes on her but her shift But though he called aloud and putting in his long staff knocked hard on the floor yet nobody stirred or answered neither could he hear any noise in the house He came down again upon this and acquainted his fellow who went up also and finding it just so they resolved to acquaint either the Lord Mayor or some other magistrate of it but did not offer to go in at the window The magistrate it seems upon the information of the two men ordered the house to be broke open a constable and other persons being appointed to be present that nothing might be plundered and accordingly it was so done when nobody was found in the house but that young woman who having been infected and past recovery the rest had left her to die by herself and were every one gone having found some way to delude the watchman and to get open the door or get out at some back door or over the tops of the houses so that he knew nothing of it and as to those cries and shrieks which he heard it was supposed they were the passionate cries of the family at the bitter parting which to be sure it was to them all this being the sister to the mistress of the family The man of the house his wife several children and servants being all gone and fled whether sick or sound that I could never learn nor indeed did I make much inquiry after it Many such escapes were made out of infected houses as particularly when the watchman was sent of some errand for it was his business to go of any errand that the family sent him of that is to say for necessaries such as food and physic to fetch physicians if they would come or surgeons or nurses or to order the dead cart and the like but with this condition too that when he went he was to lock up the outer door of the house and take the key away with him To evade this and cheat the watchmen people got two or three keys made to their locks or they found ways to unscrew the locks such as were screwed on and so take off the lock being in the inside of the house and while they sent away the watchman to the market to the bakehouse or for one trifle or another open the door and go out as often as they pleased But this being found out the officers afterwards had orders to padlock up the doors on the outside and place bolts on them as they thought fit At another house as I was informed in the street next within Aldgate a whole family was shut up and locked in because the maid servant was taken sick The master of the house had complained by his friends to the next alderman and to the Lord Mayor and had consented to have the maid carried to the pest house but was refused so the door was marked with a red cross a padlock on the outside as above and a watchman set to keep the door according to public order After the master of the house found there was no remedy but that he his wife and his children were to be locked up with this poor distempered servant he called to the watchman and told him he must go then and fetch a nurse for them to attend this poor girl for that it would be certain death to them all to oblige them to nurse her and told him plainly that if he would not do this the maid must perish either of the distemper or be starved for want of food for he was resolved none of his family should go near her and she lay in the garret four storey high where she could not cry out or call to anybody for help The watchman consented to that and went and fetched a nurse as he was appointed and brought her to them the same evening During this interval the master of the house took his opportunity to break a large hole through his shop into a bulk or stall where formerly a cobbler had sat before or under his shop window but the tenant as may be supposed at such a dismal time as that was dead or removed and so he had the key in his own keeping Having made his way into this stall which he could not have done if the man had been at the door the noise he was obliged to make being such as would have alarmed the watchman I say having made his way into this stall he sat still till the watchman returned with the nurse and all the next day also But the night following having contrived to send the watchman of another trifling errand which as I take it was to an apothecary s for a plaister for the maid which he was to stay for the making up or some other such errand that might secure his staying some time in that time he conveyed himself and all his family out of the house and left the nurse and the watchman to bury the poor wench that is throw her into the cart and take care of the house I could give a great many such stories as these diverting enough which in the long course of that dismal year I met with that is heard of and which are very certain to be true or very near the truth that is to say true in the general for no man could at such a time learn all the particulars There was likewise violence used with the watchmen as was reported in abundance of places and I believe that from the beginning of the visitation to the end there was not less than eighteen or twenty of them killed or so wounded as to be taken up for dead which was supposed to be done by the people in the infected houses which were shut up and where they attempted to come out and were opposed Nor indeed could less be expected for here were so many prisons in the town as there were houses shut up and as the people shut up or imprisoned so were guilty of no crime only shut up because miserable it was really the more intolerable to them It had also this difference that every prison as we may call it had but one jailer and as he had the whole house to guard and that many houses were so situated as that they had several ways out some more some less and some into several streets it was impossible for one man so to guard all the passages as to prevent the escape of people made desperate by the fright of their circumstances by the resentment of their usage or by the raging of the distemper itself so that they would talk to the watchman on one side of the house while the family made their escape at another For example in Coleman Street there are abundance of alleys as appears still A house was shut up in that they call White s Alley and this house had a back window not a door into a court which had a passage into Bell Alley A watchman was set by the constable at the door of this house and there he stood or his comrade night and day while the family went all away in the evening out at that window into the court and left the poor fellows warding and watching for near a fortnight Not far from the same place they blew up a watchman with gunpowder and burned the poor fellow dreadfully and while he made hideous cries and nobody would venture to come near to help him the whole family that were able to stir got out at the windows one storey high two that were left sick calling out for help Care was taken to give them nurses to look after them but the persons fled were never found till after the plague was abated they returned but as nothing could be proved so nothing could be done to them It is to be considered too that as these were prisons without bars and bolts which our common prisons are furnished with so the people let themselves down out of their windows even in the face of the watchman bringing swords or pistols in their hands and threatening the poor wretch to shoot him if he stirred or called for help In other cases some had gardens and walls or pales between them and their neighbours or yards and back houses and these by friendship and entreaties would get leave to get over those walls or pales and so go out at their neighbours doors or by giving money to their servants get them to let them through in the night so that in short the shutting up of houses was in no wise to be depended upon Neither did it answer the end at all serving more to make the people desperate and drive them to such extremities as that they would break out at all adventures And that which was still worse those that did thus break out spread the infection farther by their wandering about with the distemper upon them in their desperate circumstances than they would otherwise have done for whoever considers all the particulars in such cases must acknowledge and we cannot doubt but the severity of those confinements made many people desperate and made them run out of their houses at all hazards and with the plague visibly upon them not knowing either whither to go or what to do or indeed what they did and many that did so were driven to dreadful exigencies and extremities and perished in the streets or fields for mere want or dropped down by the raging violence of the fever upon them Others wandered into the country and went forward any way as their desperation guided them not knowing whither they went or would go till faint and tired and not getting any relief the houses and villages on the road refusing to admit them to lodge whether infected or no they have perished by the roadside or gotten into barns and died there none daring to come to them or relieve them though perhaps not infected for nobody would believe them On the other hand when the plague at first seized a family that is to say when any body of the family had gone out and unwarily or otherwise catched the distemper and brought it home it was certainly known by the family before it was known to the officers who as you will see by the order were appointed to examine into the circumstances of all sick persons when they heard of their being sick In this interval between their being taken sick and the examiners coming the master of the house had leisure and liberty to remove himself or all his family if he knew whither to go and many did so But the great disaster was that many did thus after they were really infected themselves and so carried the disease into the houses of those who were so hospitable as to receive them which it must be confessed was very cruel and ungrateful And this was in part the reason of the general notion or scandal rather which went about of the temper of people infected namely that they did not take the least care or make any scruple of infecting others though I cannot say but there might be some truth in it too but not so general as was reported What natural reason could be given for so wicked a thing at a time when they might conclude themselves just going to appear at the bar of Divine justice I know not I am very well satisfied that it cannot be reconciled to religion and principle any more than it can be to generosity and Humanity but I may speak of that again I am speaking now of people made desperate by the apprehensions of their being shut up and their breaking out by stratagem or force either before or after they were shut up whose misery was not lessened when they were out but sadly increased On the other hand many that thus got away had retreats to go to and other houses where they locked themselves up and kept hid till the plague was over and many families foreseeing the approach of the distemper laid up stores of provisions sufficient for their whole families and shut themselves up and that so entirely that they were neither seen or heard of till the infection was quite ceased and then came abroad sound and well I might recollect several such as these and give you the particulars of their management for doubtless it was the most effectual secure step that could be taken for such whose circumstances would not admit them to remove or who had not retreats abroad proper for the case for in being thus shut up they were as if they had been a hundred miles off Nor do I remember that any one of those families miscarried Among these several Dutch merchants were particularly remarkable who kept their houses like little garrisons besieged suffering none to go in or out or come near them particularly one in a court in Throgmorton Street whose house looked into Draper s Garden But I come back to the case of families infected and shut up by the magistrates The misery of those families is not to be expressed and it was generally in such houses that we heard the most dismal shrieks and outcries of the poor people terrified and even frighted to death by the sight of the condition of their dearest relations and by the terror of being imprisoned as they were I remember and while I am writing this story I think I hear the very sound of it a certain lady had an only daughter a young maiden about nineteen years old and who was possessed of a very considerable fortune They were only lodgers in the house where they were The young woman her mother and the maid had been abroad on some occasion I do not remember what for the house was not shut up but about two hours after they came home the young lady complained she was not well in a quarter of an hour more she vomited and had a violent pain in her head Pray God says her mother in a terrible fright my child has not the distemper The pain in her head increasing her mother ordered the bed to be warmed and resolved to put her to bed and prepared to give her things to sweat which was the ordinary remedy to be taken when the first apprehensions of the distemper began While the bed was airing the mother undressed the young woman and just as she was laid down in the bed she looking upon her body with a candle immediately discovered the fatal tokens on the inside of her thighs Her mother not being able to contain herself threw down her candle and shrieked out in such a frightful manner that it was enough to place horror upon the stoutest heart in the world nor was it one scream or one cry but the fright having seized her spirits she fainted first then recovered then ran all over the house up the stairs and down the stairs like one distracted and indeed really was distracted and continued screeching and crying out for several hours void of all sense or at least government of her senses and as I was told never came thoroughly to herself again As to the young maiden she was a dead corpse from that moment for the gangrene which occasions the spots had spread over her whole body and she died in less than two hours But still the mother continued crying out not knowing anything more of her child several hours after she was dead It is so long ago that I am not certain but I think the mother never recovered but died in two or three weeks after This was an extraordinary case and I am therefore the more particular in it because I came so much to the knowledge of it but there were innumerable such like cases and it was seldom that the weekly bill came in but there were two or three put in frighted that is that may well be called frighted to death But besides those who were so frighted as to die upon the spot there were great numbers frighted to other extremes some frighted out of their senses some out of their memory and some out of their understanding But I return to the shutting up of houses As several people I say got out of their houses by stratagem after they were shut UP so others got out by bribing the watchmen and giving them money to let them go privately out in the night I must confess I thought it at that time the most innocent corruption or bribery that any man could be guilty of and therefore could not but pity the poor men and think it was hard when three of those watchmen were publicly whipped through the streets for suffering people to go out of houses shut up But notwithstanding that severity money prevailed with the poor men and many families found means to make sallies out and escape that way after they had been shut up but these were generally such as had some places to retire to and though there was no easy passing the roads any whither after the first of August yet there were many ways of retreat and particularly as I hinted some got tents and set them up in the fields carrying beds or straw to lie on and provisions to eat and so lived in them as hermits in a cell for nobody would venture to come near them and several stories were told of such some comical some tragical some who lived like wandering pilgrims in the deserts and escaped by making themselves exiles in such a manner as is scarce to be credited and who yet enjoyed more liberty than was to be expected in such cases I have by me a story of two brothers and their kinsman who being single men but that had stayed in the city too long to get away and indeed not knowing where to go to have any retreat nor having wherewith to travel far took a course for their own preservation which though in itself at first desperate yet was so natural that it may be wondered that no more did so at that time They were but of mean condition and yet not so very poor as that they could not furnish themselves with some little conveniences such as might serve to keep life and soul together and finding the distemper increasing in a terrible manner they resolved to shift as well as they could and to be gone One of them had been a soldier in the late wars and before that in the Low Countries and having been bred to no particular employment but his arms and besides being wounded and not able to work very hard had for some time been employed at a baker s of sea biscuit in Wapping The brother of this man was a seaman too but somehow or other had been hurt of one leg that he could not go to sea but had worked for his living at a sailmaker s in Wapping or thereabouts and being a good husband had laid up some money and was the richest of the three The third man was a joiner or carpenter by trade a handy fellow and he had no wealth but his box or basket of tools with the help of which he could at any time get his living such a time as this excepted wherever he went and he lived near Shadwell They all lived in Stepney parish which as I have said being the last that was infected or at least violently they stayed there till they evidently saw the plague was abating at the west part of the town and coming towards the east where they lived The story of those three men if the reader will be content to have me give it in their own persons without taking upon me to either vouch the particulars or answer for any mistakes I shall give as distinctly as I can believing the history will be a very good pattern for any poor man to follow in case the like public desolation should happen here and if there may be no such occasion which God of His infinite mercy grant us still the story may have its uses so many ways as that it will I hope never be said that the relating has been unprofitable I say all this previous to the history having yet for the present much more to say before I quit my own part I went all the first part of the time freely about the streets though not so freely as to run myself into apparent danger except when they dug the great pit in the churchyard of our parish of Aldgate A terrible pit it was and I could not resist my curiosity to go and see it As near as I may judge it was about forty feet in length and about fifteen or sixteen feet broad and at the time I first looked at it about nine feet deep but it was said they dug it near twenty feet deep afterwards in one part of it till they could go no deeper for the water for they had it seems dug several large pits before this For though the plague was long a coming to our parish yet when it did come there was no parish in or about London where it raged with such violence as in the two parishes of Aldgate and Whitechappel I say they had dug several pits in another ground when the distemper began to spread in our parish and especially when the dead carts began to go about which was not in our parish till the beginning of August Into these pits they had put perhaps fifty or sixty bodies each then they made larger holes wherein they buried all that the cart brought in a week which by the middle to the end of August came to from two hundred to four hundred a week and they could not well dig them larger because of the order of the magistrates confining them to leave no bodies within six feet of the surface and the water coming on at about seventeen or eighteen feet they could not well I say put more in one pit But now at the beginning of September the plague raging in a dreadful manner and the number of burials in our parish increasing to more than was ever buried in any parish about London of no larger extent they ordered this dreadful gulf to be dug for such it was rather than a pit They had supposed this pit would have supplied them for a month or more when they dug it and some blamed the churchwardens for suffering such a frightful thing telling them they were making preparations to bury the whole parish and the like but time made it appear the churchwardens knew the condition of the parish better than they did for the pit being finished the fourth of September I think they began to bury in it the sixth and by the twentieth which was just two weeks they had thrown into it eleven fourteen bodies when they were obliged to fill it up the bodies being then come to lie within six feet of the surface I doubt not but there may be some ancient persons alive in the parish who can justify the fact of this and are able to show even in what place of the churchyard the pit lay better than I can The mark of it also was many years to be seen in the churchyard on the surface lying in length parallel with the passage which goes by the west wall of the churchyard out of Houndsditch and turns east again into Whitechappel coming out near the Three Nuns Inn It was about the tenth of September that my curiosity led or rather drove me to go and see this pit again when there had been near four hundred people buried in it and I was not content to see it in the day time as I had done before for then there would have been nothing to have been seen but the loose earth for all the bodies that were thrown in were immediately covered with earth by those they called the buriers which at other times were called bearers but I resolved to go in the night and see some of them thrown in There was a strict order to prevent people coming to those pits and that was only to prevent infection But after some time that order was more necessary for people that were infected and near their end and delirious also would run to those pits wrapt in blankets or rugs and throw themselves in and as they said bury themselves I cannot say that the officers suffered any willingly to lie there but I have heard that in a great pit in Finsbury in the parish of Cripplegate it lying open then to the fields for it was not then walled about many came and threw themselves in and expired there before they threw any earth upon them and that when they came to bury others and found them there they were quite dead though not cold This may serve a little to describe the dreadful condition of that day though it is impossible to say anything that is able to give a true idea of it to those who did not see it other than this that it was indeed very very very dreadful and such as no tongue can express I got admittance into the churchyard by being acquainted with the sexton who attended who though he did not refuse me at all yet earnestly persuaded me not to go telling me very seriously for he was a good religious and sensible man that it was indeed their business and duty to venture and to run all hazards and that in it they might hope to be preserved but that I had no apparent call to it but my own curiosity which he said he believed I would not pretend was sufficient to justify my running that hazard I told him I had been pressed in my mind to go and that perhaps it might be an instructing sight that might not be without its uses Nay says the good man if you will venture upon that score name of God go in for depend upon it twill be a sermon to you it may be the best that ever you heard in your life Tis a speaking sight says he and has a voice with it and a loud one to call us all to repentance and with that he opened the door and said Go if you will His discourse had shocked my resolution a little and I stood wavering for a good while but just at that interval I saw two links come over from the end of the Minories and heard the bellman and then appeared a dead cart as they called it coming over the streets so I could no longer resist my desire of seeing it and went in There was nobody as I could perceive at first in the churchyard or going into it but the buriers and the fellow that drove the cart or rather led the horse and cart but when they came up to the pit they saw a man go to and again muffled up in a brown Cloak and making motions with his hands under his cloak as if he was in great agony and the buriers immediately gathered about him supposing he was one of those poor delirious or desperate creatures that used to pretend as I have said to bury themselves He said nothing as he walked about but two or three times groaned very deeply and loud and sighed as he would break his heart When the buriers came up to him they soon found he was neither a person infected and desperate as I have observed above or a person distempered in mind but one oppressed with a dreadful weight of grief indeed having his wife and several of his children all in the cart that was just come in with him and he followed in an agony and excess of sorrow He mourned heartily as it was easy to see but with a kind of masculine grief that could not give itself vent by tears and calmly defying the buriers to let him alone said he would only see the bodies thrown in and go away so they left importuning him But no sooner was the cart turned round and the bodies shot into the pit promiscuously which was a surprise to him for he at least expected they would have been decently laid in though indeed he was afterwards convinced that was impracticable I say no sooner did he see the sight but he cried out aloud unable to contain himself I could not hear what he said but he went backward two or three steps and fell down in a swoon The buriers ran to him and took him up and in a little while he came to himself and they led him away to the Pie Tavern over against the end of Houndsditch where it seems the man was known and where they took care of him He looked into the pit again as he went away but the buriers had covered the bodies so immediately with throwing in earth that though there was light enough for there were lanterns and candles in them placed all night round the sides of the pit upon heaps of earth seven or eight or perhaps more yet nothing could be seen This was a mournful scene indeed and affected me almost as much as the rest but the other was awful and full of terror The cart had in it sixteen or seventeen bodies some were wrapt up in linen sheets some in rags some little other than naked or so loose that what covering they had fell from them in the shooting out of the cart and they fell quite naked among the rest but the matter was not much to them or the indecency much to any one else seeing they were all dead and were to be huddled together into the common grave of mankind as we may call it for here was no difference made but poor and rich went together there was no other way of burials neither was it possible there should for coffins were not to be had for the prodigious numbers that fell in such a calamity as this It was reported by way of scandal upon the buriers that if any corpse was delivered to them decently wound up as we called it then in a winding sheet tied over the head and feet which some did and which was generally of good linen I say it was reported that the buriers were so wicked as to strip them in the cart and carry them quite naked to the ground But as I cannot easily credit anything so vile among Christians and at a time so filled with terrors as that was I can only relate it and leave it undetermined Innumerable stories also went about of the cruel behaviours and practices of nurses who tended the sick and of their hastening on the fate of those they tended in their sickness But I shall say more of this in its place I was indeed shocked with this sight it almost overwhelmed me and I went away with my heart most afflicted and full of the afflicting thoughts such as I cannot describe just at my going out of the church and turning up the street towards my own house I saw another cart with links and a bellman going before coming out of Harrow Alley in the Butcher Row on the other side of the way and being as I perceived very full of dead bodies it went directly over the street also toward the church I stood a while but I had no stomach to go back again to see the same dismal scene over again so I went directly home where I could not but consider with thankfulness the risk I had run believing I had gotten no injury as indeed I had not Here the poor unhappy gentleman s grief came into my head again and indeed I could not but shed tears in the reflection upon it perhaps more than he did himself but his case lay so heavy upon my mind that I could not prevail with myself but that I must go out again into the street and go to the Pie Tavern resolving to inquire what became of him It was by this time one o clock in the morning and yet the poor gentleman was there The truth was the people of the house knowing him had entertained him and kept him there all the night notwithstanding the danger of being infected by him though it appeared the man was perfectly sound himself It is with regret that I take notice of this tavern The people were civil mannerly and an obliging sort of folks enough and had till this time kept their house open and their trade going on though not so very publicly as formerly but there was a dreadful set of fellows that used their house and who in the middle of all this horror met there every night behaved with all the revelling and roaring extravagances as is usual for such people to do at other times and indeed to such an offensive degree that the very master and mistress of the house grew first ashamed and then terrified at them They sat generally in a room next the street and as they always kept late hours so when the dead cart came across the street end to go into Houndsditch which was in view of the tavern windows they would frequently open the windows as soon as they heard the bell and look out at them and as they might often hear sad lamentations of people in the streets or at their windows as the carts went along they would make their impudent mocks and jeers at them especially if they heard the poor people call upon God to have mercy upon them as many would do at those times in their ordinary passing along the streets These gentlemen being something disturbed with the clutter of bringing the poor gentleman into the house as above were first angry and very high with the master of the house for suffering such a fellow as they called him to be brought out of the grave into their house but being answered that the man was a neighbour and that he was sound but overwhelmed with the calamity of his family and the like they turned their anger into ridiculing the man and his sorrow for his wife and children taunted him with want of courage to leap into the great pit and go to heaven as they jeeringly expressed it along with them adding some very profane and even blasphemous expressions They were at this vile work when I came back to the house and as far as I could see though the man sat still mute and disconsolate and their affronts could not divert his sorrow yet he was both grieved and offended at their discourse Upon this I gently reproved them being well enough acquainted with their characters and not unknown in person to two of them They immediately fell upon me with ill language and oaths asked me what I did out of my grave at such a time when so many honester men were carried into the churchyard and why I was not at home saying my prayers against the dead cart came for me and the like I was indeed astonished at the impudence of the men though not at all discomposed at their treatment of me However I kept my temper I told them that though I defied them or any man in the world to tax me with any dishonesty yet I acknowledged that in this terrible judgement of God many better than I were swept away and carried to their grave But to answer their question directly the case was that I was mercifully preserved by that great God whose name they had blasphemed and taken in vain by cursing and swearing in a dreadful manner and that I believed I was preserved in particular among other ends of His goodness that I might reprove them for their audacious boldness in behaving in such a manner and in such an awful time as this was especially for their jeering and mocking at an honest gentleman and a neighbour for some of them knew him who they saw was overwhelmed with sorrow for the breaches which it had pleased God to make upon his family I cannot call exactly to mind the hellish abominable raillery which was the return they made to that talk of mine being provoked it seems that I was not at all afraid to be free with them nor if I could remember would I fill my account with any of the words the horrid oaths curses and vile expressions such as at that time of the day even the worst and ordinariest people in the street would not use for except such hardened creatures as these the most wicked wretches that could be found had at that time some terror upon their minds of the hand of that Power which could thus in a moment destroy them But that which was the worst in all their devilish language was that they were not afraid to blaspheme God and talk atheistically making a jest of my calling the plague the hand of God mocking and even laughing at the word judgement as if the providence of God had no concern in the inflicting such a desolating stroke and that the people calling upon God as they saw the carts carrying away the dead bodies was all enthusiastic absurd and impertinent I made them some reply such as I thought proper but which I found was so far from putting a check to their horrid way of speaking that it made them rail the more so that I confess it filled me with horror and a kind of rage and I came away as I told them lest the hand of that judgement which had visited the whole city should glorify His vengeance upon them and all that were near them They received all reproof with the utmost contempt and made the greatest mockery that was possible for them to do at me giving me all the opprobrious insolent scoffs that they could think of for preaching to them as they called it which indeed grieved me rather than angered me and I went away blessing God however in my mind that I had not spared them though they had insulted me so much They continued this wretched course three or four days after this continually mocking and jeering at all that showed themselves religious or serious or that were any way touched with the sense of the terrible judgement of God upon us and I was informed they flouted in the same manner at the good people who notwithstanding the contagion met at the church fasted and prayed to God to remove His hand from them I say they continued this dreadful course three or four days I think it was no more when one of them particularly he who asked the poor gentleman what he did out of his grave was struck from Heaven with the plague and died in a most deplorable manner and in a word they were every one of them carried into the great pit which I have mentioned above before it was quite filled up which was not above a fortnight or thereabout These men were guilty of many extravagances such as one would think human nature should have trembled at the thoughts of at such a time of general terror as was then upon us and particularly scoffing and mocking at everything which they happened to see that was religious among the people especially at their thronging zealously to the place of public worship to implore mercy from Heaven in such a time of distress and this tavern where they held their dub being within view of the church door they had the more particular occasion for their atheistical profane mirth But this began to abate a little with them before the accident which I have related happened for the infection increased so violently at this part of the town now that people began to be afraid to come to the church at least such numbers did not resort thither as was usual Many of the clergymen likewise were dead and others gone into the country for it really required a steady courage and a strong faith for a man not only to venture being in town at such a time as this but likewise to venture to come to church and perform the office of a minister to a congregation of whom he had reason to believe many of them were actually infected with the plague and to do this every day or twice a day as in some places was done It is true the people showed an extraordinary zeal in these religious exercises and as the church doors were always open people would go in single at all times whether the minister was officiating or no and locking themselves into separate pews would be praying to God with great fervency and devotion Others assembled at meeting houses every one as their different opinions in such things guided but all were promiscuously the subject of these men s drollery especially at the beginning of the visitation It seems they had been checked for their open insulting religion in this manner by several good people of every persuasion and that and the violent raging of the infection I suppose was the occasion that they had abated much of their rudeness for some time before and were only roused by the spirit of ribaldry and atheism at the clamour which was made when the gentleman was first brought in there and perhaps were agitated by the same devil when I took upon me to reprove them though I did it at first with all the calmness temper and good manners that I could which for a while they insulted me the more for thinking it had been in fear of their resentment though afterwards they found the contrary I went home indeed grieved and afflicted in my mind at the abominable wickedness of those men not doubting however that they would be made dreadful examples of God s justice for I looked upon this dismal time to be a particular season of Divine vengeance and that God would on this occasion single out the proper objects of His displeasure in a more especial and remarkable manner than at another time and that though I did believe that many good people would and did fall in the common calamity and that it was no certain rule to judge of the eternal state of any one by their being distinguished in such a time of general destruction neither one way or other yet I say it could not but seem reasonable to believe that God would not think fit to spare by His mercy such open declared enemies that should insult His name and Being defy His vengeance and mock at His worship and worshippers at such a time no not though His mercy had thought fit to bear with and spare them at other times that this was a day of visitation a day of God s anger and those words came into my thought Jer v nine Shall I not visit for these things saith the Lord and shall not My soul be avenged of such a nation as this These things I say lay upon my mind and I went home very much grieved and oppressed with the horror of these men s wickedness and to think that anything could be so vile so hardened and notoriously wicked as to insult God and His servants and His worship in such a manner and at such a time as this was when He had as it were His sword drawn in His hand on purpose to take vengeance not on them only but on the whole nation I had indeed been in some passion at first with them though it was really raised not by any affront they had offered me personally but by the horror their blaspheming tongues filled me with However I was doubtful in my thoughts whether the resentment I retained was not all upon my own private account for they had given me a great deal of ill language too I mean personally but after some pause and having a weight of grief upon my mind I retired myself as soon as I came home for I slept not that night and giving God most humble thanks for my preservation in the eminent danger I had been in I set my mind seriously and with the utmost earnestness to pray for those desperate wretches that God would pardon them open their eyes and effectually humble them By this I not only did my duty namely to pray for those who despitefully used me but I fully tried my own heart to my fun satisfaction that it was not filled with any spirit of resentment as they had offended me in particular and I humbly recommend the method to all those that would know or be certain how to distinguish between their zeal for the honour of God and the effects of their private passions and resentment But I must go back here to the particular incidents which occur to my thoughts of the time of the visitation and particularly to the time of their shutting up houses in the first part of their sickness for before the sickness was come to its height people had more room to make their observations than they had afterward but when it was in the extremity there was no such thing as communication with one another as before During the shutting up of houses as I have said some violence was offered to the watchmen As to soldiers there were none to be found The few guards which the king then had which were nothing like the number entertained since were dispersed either at Oxford with the Court or in quarters in the remoter parts of the country small detachments excepted who did duty at the Tower and at Whitehall and these but very few Neither am I positive that there was any other guard at the Tower than the warders as they called them who stand at the gate with gowns and caps the same as the yeomen of the guard except the ordinary gunners who were twenty four and the officers appointed to look after the magazine who were called armourers As to trained bands there was no possibility of raising any neither if the Lieutenancy either of London or Middlesex had ordered the drums to beat for the militia would any of the companies I believe have drawn together whatever risk they had run This made the watchmen be the less regarded and perhaps occasioned the greater violence to be used against them I mention it on this score to observe that the setting watchmen thus to keep the people in was first of all not effectual but that the people broke out whether by force or by stratagem even almost as often as they pleased and second that those that did thus break out were generally people infected who in their desperation running about from one place to another valued not whom they injured and which perhaps as I have said might give birth to report that it was natural to the infected people to desire to infect others which report was really false And I know it so well and in so many several cases that I could give several relations of good pious and religious people who when they have had the distemper have been so far from being forward to infect others that they have forbid their own family to come near them in hopes of their being preserved and have even died without seeing their nearest relations lest they should be instrumental to give them the distemper and infect or endanger them If then there were cases wherein the infected people were careless of the injury they did to others this was certainly one of them if not the chief namely when people who had the distemper had broken out from houses which were so shut up and having been driven to extremities for provision or for entertainment had endeavoured to conceal their condition and have been thereby instrumental involuntarily to infect others who have been ignorant and unwary This is one of the reasons why I believed then and do believe still that the shutting up houses thus by force and restraining or rather imprisoning people in their own houses as I said above was of little or no service in the whole Nay I am of opinion it was rather hurtful having forced those desperate people to wander abroad with the plague upon them who would otherwise have died quietly in their beds I remember one citizen who having thus broken out of his house in Aldersgate Street or thereabout went along the road to Islington he attempted to have gone in at the Angel Inn and after that the White Horse two inns known still by the same signs but was refused after which he came to the Pied Bull an inn also still continuing the same sign He asked them for lodging for one night only pretending to be going into Lincolnshire and assuring them of his being very sound and free from the infection which also at that time had not reached much that way They told him they had no lodging that they could spare but one bed up in the garret and that they could spare that bed for one night some drovers being expected the next day with cattle so if he would accept of that lodging he might have it which he did So a servant was sent up with a candle with him to show him the room He was very well dressed and looked like a person not used to lie in a garret and when he came to the room he fetched a deep sigh and said to the servant I have seldom lain in such a lodging as this However the servant assuring him again that they had no better Well says he I must make shift this is a dreadful time but it is but for one night So he sat down upon the bedside and bade the maid I think it was fetch him up a pint of warm ale Accordingly the servant went for the ale but some hurry in the house which perhaps employed her other ways put it out of her head and she went up no more to him The next morning seeing no appearance of the gentleman somebody in the house asked the servant that had showed him upstairs what was become of him She started Alas I says she I never thought more of him He bade me carry him some warm ale but I forgot Upon which not the maid but some other person was sent up to see after him who coming into the room found him stark dead and almost cold stretched out across the bed His clothes were pulled off his jaw fallen his eyes open in a most frightful posture the rug of the bed being grasped hard in one of his hands so that it was plain he died soon after the maid left him and tis probable had she gone up with the ale she had found him dead in a few minutes after he sat down upon the bed The alarm was great in the house as anyone may suppose they having been free from the distemper till that disaster which bringing the infection to the house spread it immediately to other houses round about it I do not remember how many died in the house itself but I think the maid servant who went up first with him fell presently ill by the fright and several others for whereas there died but two in Islington of the plague the week before there died seventeen the week after whereof fourteen were of the plague This was in the week from the eleventh of July to the eighteenth There was one shift that some families had and that not a few when their houses happened to be infected and that was this the families who in the first breaking out of the distemper fled away into the country and had retreats among their friends generally found some or other of their neighbours or relations to commit the charge of those houses to for the safety of the goods and the like Some houses were indeed entirely locked up the doors padlocked the windows and doors having deal boards nailed over them and only the inspection of them committed to the ordinary watchmen and parish officers but these were but few It was thought that there were not less than ten thousand houses forsaken of the inhabitants in the city and suburbs including what was in the out parishes and in Surrey or the side of the water they called Southwark This was besides the numbers of lodgers and of particular persons who were fled out of other families so that in all it was computed that about two hundred thousand people were fled and gone But of this I shall speak again But I mention it here on this account namely that it was a rule with those who had thus two houses in their keeping or care that if anybody was taken sick in a family before the master of the family let the examiners or any other officer know of it he immediately would send all the rest of his family whether children or servants as it fell out to be to such other house which he had so in charge and then giving notice of the sick person to the examiner have a nurse or nurses appointed and have another person to be shut up in the house with them which many for money would do so to take charge of the house in case the person should die This was in many cases the saving a whole family who if they had been shut up with the sick person would inevitably have perished But on the other hand this was another of the inconveniences of shutting up houses for the apprehensions and terror of being shut up made many run away with the rest of the family who though it was not publicly known and they were not quite sick had yet the distemper upon them and who by having an uninterrupted liberty to go about but being obliged still to conceal their circumstances or perhaps not knowing it themselves gave the distemper to others and spread the infection in a dreadful manner as I shall explain further hereafter And here I may be able to make an observation or two of my own which may be of use hereafter to those into whose hands these may come if they should ever see the like dreadful visitation one The infection generally came into the houses of the citizens by the means of their servants whom they were obliged to send up and down the streets for necessaries that is to say for food or physic to bakehouses brew houses shops c and who going necessarily through the streets into shops markets and the like it was impossible but that they should one way or other meet with distempered people who conveyed the fatal breath into them and they brought it home to the families to which they belonged two It was a great mistake that such a great city as this had but one pest house for had there been instead of one pest house viz beyond Bunhill Fields where at most they could receive perhaps two hundred or three hundred people I say had there instead of that one been several pest houses every one able to contain a thousand people without lying two in a bed or two beds in a room and had every master of a family as soon as any servant especially had been taken sick in his house been obliged to send them to the next pest house if they were willing as many were and had the examiners done the like among the poor people when any had been stricken with the infection I say had this been done where the people were willing not otherwise and the houses not been shut I am persuaded and was all the while of that opinion that not so many by several thousands had died for it was observed and I could give several instances within the compass of my own knowledge where a servant had been taken sick and the family had either time to send him out or retire from the house and leave the sick person as I have said above they had all been preserved whereas when upon one or more sickening in a family the house has been shut up the whole family have perished and the bearers been obliged to go in to fetch out the dead bodies not being able to bring them to the door and at last none left to do it three This put it out of question to me that the calamity was spread by infection that is to say by some certain steams or fumes which the physicians call effluvia by the breath or by the sweat or by the stench of the sores of the sick persons or some other way perhaps beyond even the reach of the physicians themselves which effluvia affected the sound who came within certain distances of the sick immediately penetrating the vital parts of the said sound persons putting their blood into an immediate ferment and agitating their spirits to that degree which it was found they were agitated and so those newly infected persons communicated it in the same manner to others And this I shall give some instances of that cannot but convince those who seriously consider it and I cannot but with some wonder find some people now the contagion is over talk of its being an immediate stroke from Heaven without the agency of means having commission to strike this and that particular person and none other which I look upon with contempt as the effect of manifest ignorance and enthusiasm likewise the opinion of others who talk of infection being carried on by the air only by carrying with it vast numbers of insects and invisible creatures who enter into the body with the breath or even at the pores with the air and there generate or emit most acute poisons or poisonous ovae or eggs which mingle themselves with the blood and so infect the body a discourse full of learned simplicity and manifested to be so by universal experience but I shall say more to this case in its order I must here take further notice that nothing was more fatal to the inhabitants of this city than the supine negligence of the people themselves who during the long notice or warning they had of the visitation made no provision for it by laying in store of provisions or of other necessaries by which they might have lived retired and within their own houses as I have observed others did and who were in a great measure preserved by that caution nor were they after they were a little hardened to it so shy of conversing with one another when actually infected as they were at first no though they knew it I acknowledge I was one of those thoughtless ones that had made so little provision that my servants were obliged to go out of doors to buy every trifle by penny and halfpenny just as before it began even till my experience showing me the folly I began to be wiser so late that I had scarce time to store myself sufficient for our common subsistence for a month I had in family only an ancient woman that managed the house a maid servant two apprentices and myself and the plague beginning to increase about us I had many sad thoughts about what course I should take and how I should act The many dismal objects which happened everywhere as I went about the streets had filled my mind with a great deal of horror for fear of the distemper which was indeed very horrible in itself and in some more than in others The swellings which were generally in the neck or groin when they grew hard and would not break grew so painful that it was equal to the most exquisite torture and some not able to bear the torment threw themselves out at windows or shot themselves or otherwise made themselves away and I saw several dismal objects of that kind Others unable to contain themselves vented their pain by incessant roarings and such loud and lamentable cries were to be heard as we walked along the streets that would pierce the very heart to think of especially when it was to be considered that the same dreadful scourge might be expected every moment to seize upon ourselves I cannot say but that now I began to faint in my resolutions my heart failed me very much and sorely I repented of my rashness When I had been out and met with such terrible things as these I have talked of I say I repented my rashness in venturing to abide in town I wished often that I had not taken upon me to stay but had gone away with my brother and his family Terrified by those frightful objects I would retire home sometimes and resolve to go out no more and perhaps I would keep those resolutions for three or four days which time I spent in the most serious thankfulness for my preservation and the preservation of my family and the constant confession of my sins giving myself up to God every day and applying to Him with fasting humiliation and meditation Such intervals as I had I employed in reading books and in writing down my memorandums of what occurred to me every day and out of which afterwards I took most of this work as it relates to my observations without doors What I wrote of my private meditations I reserve for private use and desire it may not be made public on any account whatever I also wrote other meditations upon divine subjects such as occurred to me at that time and were profitable to myself but not fit for any other view and therefore I say no more of that I had a very good friend a physician whose name was Heath whom I frequently visited during this dismal time and to whose advice I was very much obliged for many things which he directed me to take by way of preventing the infection when I went out as he found I frequently did and to hold in my mouth when I was in the streets He also came very often to see me and as he was a good Christian as well as a good physician his agreeable conversation was a very great support to me in the worst of this terrible time It was now the beginning of August and the plague grew very violent and terrible in the place where I lived and doctor Heath coming to visit me and finding that I ventured so often out in the streets earnestly persuaded me to lock myself up and my family and not to suffer any of us to go out of doors to keep all our windows fast shutters and curtains close and never to open them but first to make a very strong smoke in the room where the window or door was to be opened with rozen and pitch brimstone or gunpowder and the like and we did this for some time but as I had not laid in a store of provision for such a retreat it was impossible that we could keep within doors entirely However I attempted though it was so very late to do something towards it and first as I had convenience both for brewing and baking I went and bought two sacks of meal and for several weeks having an oven we baked all our own bread also I bought malt and brewed as much beer as all the casks I had would hold and which seemed enough to serve my house for five or six weeks also I laid in a quantity of salt butter and Cheshire cheese but I had no flesh meat and the plague raged so violently among the butchers and slaughter houses on the other side of our street where they are known to dwell in great numbers that it was not advisable so much as to go over the street among them And here I must observe again that this necessity of going out of our houses to buy provisions was in a great measure the ruin of the whole city for the people catched the distemper on these occasions one of another and even the provisions themselves were often tainted at least I have great reason to believe so and therefore I cannot say with satisfaction what I know is repeated with great assurance that the market people and such as brought provisions to town were never infected I am certain the butchers of Whitechappel where the greatest part of the flesh meat was killed were dreadfully visited and that at least to such a degree that few of their shops were kept open and those that remained of them killed their meat at Mile End and that way and brought it to market upon horses However the poor people could not lay up provisions and there was a necessity that they must go to market to buy and others to send servants or their children and as this was a necessity which renewed itself daily it brought abundance of unsound people to the markets and a great many that went thither sound brought death home with them It is true people used all possible precaution When any one bought a joint of meat in the market they would not take it off the butcher s hand but took it off the hooks themselves On the other hand the butcher would not touch the money but have it put into a pot full of vinegar which he kept for that purpose The buyer carried always small money to make up any odd sum that they might take no change They carried bottles of scents and perfumes in their hands and all the means that could be used were used but then the poor could not do even these things and they went at all hazards Innumerable dismal stories we heard every day on this very account Sometimes a man or woman dropped down dead in the very markets for many people that had the plague upon them knew nothing of it till the inward gangrene had affected their vitals and they died in a few moments This caused that many died frequently in that manner in the streets suddenly without any warning others perhaps had time to go to the next bulk or stall or to any door porch and just sit down and die as I have said before These objects were so frequent in the streets that when the plague came to be very raging on one side there was scarce any passing by the streets but that several dead bodies would be lying here and there upon the ground On the other hand it is observable that though at first the people would stop as they went along and call to the neighbours to come out on such an occasion yet afterward no notice was taken of them but that if at any time we found a corpse lying go across the way and not come near it or if in a narrow lane or passage go back again and seek some other way to go on the business we were upon and in those cases the corpse was always left till the officers had notice to come and take them away or till night when the bearers attending the dead cart would take them up and carry them away Nor did those undaunted creatures who performed these offices fail to search their pockets and sometimes strip off their clothes if they were well dressed as sometimes they were and carry off what they could get But to return to the markets The butchers took that care that if any person died in the market they had the officers always at band to take them up upon hand barrows and carry them to the next churchyard and this was so frequent that such were not entered in the weekly bill Found dead in the streets or fields as is the case now but they went into the general articles of the great distemper But now the fury of the distemper increased to such a degree that even the markets were but very thinly furnished with provisions or frequented with buyers compared to what they were before and the Lord Mayor caused the country people who brought provisions to be stopped in the streets leading into the town and to sit down there with their goods where they sold what they brought and went immediately away and this encouraged the country people greatly to do so for they sold their provisions at the very entrances into the town and even in the fields as particularly in the fields beyond Whitechappel in Spittlefields also in saint George s Fields in Southwark in Bunhill Fields and in a great field called Wood s Close near Islington Thither the Lord Mayor aldermen and magistrates sent their officers and servants to buy for their families themselves keeping within doors as much as possible and the like did many other people and after this method was taken the country people came with great cheerfulness and brought provisions of all sorts and very seldom got any harm which I suppose added also to that report of their being miraculously preserved As for my little family having thus as I have said laid in a store of bread butter cheese and beer I took my friend and physician s advice and locked myself up and my family and resolved to suffer the hardship of living a few months without flesh meat rather than to purchase it at the hazard of our lives But though I confined my family I could not prevail upon my unsatisfied curiosity to stay within entirely myself and though I generally came frighted and terrified home yet I could not restrain only that indeed I did not do it so frequently as at first I had some little obligations indeed upon me to go to my brother s house which was in Coleman Street parish and which he had left to my care and I went at first every day but afterwards only once or twice a week In these walks I had many dismal scenes before my eyes as particularly of persons falling dead in the streets terrible shrieks and screechings of women who in their agonies would throw open their chamber windows and cry out in a dismal surprising manner It is impossible to describe the variety of postures in which the passions of the poor people would express themselves Passing through Tokenhouse Yard in Lothbury of a sudden a casement violently opened just over my head and a woman gave three frightful screeches and then cried Oh death death death in a most inimitable tone and which struck me with horror and a chillness in my very blood There was nobody to be seen in the whole street neither did any other window open for people had no curiosity now in any case nor could anybody help one another so I went on to pass into Bell Alley Just in Bell Alley on the right hand of the passage there was a more terrible cry than that though it was not so directed out at the window but the whole family was in a terrible fright and I could hear women and children run screaming about the rooms like distracted when a garret window opened and somebody from a window on the other side the alley called and asked What is the matter upon which from the first window it was answered Oh Lord my old master has hanged himself The other asked again Is he quite dead and the first answered Ay ay quite dead quite dead and cold This person was a merchant and a deputy alderman and very rich I care not to mention the name though I knew his name too but that would be an hardship to the family which is now flourishing again But this is but one it is scarce credible what dreadful cases happened in particular families every day People in the rage of the distemper or in the torment of their swellings which was indeed intolerable running out of their own government raving and distracted and oftentimes laying violent hands upon themselves throwing themselves out at their windows shooting themselves c mothers murdering their own children in their lunacy some dying of mere grief as a passion some of mere fright and surprise without any infection at all others frighted into idiotism and foolish distractions some into despair and lunacy others into melancholy madness The pain of the swelling was in particular very violent and to some intolerable the physicians and surgeons may be said to have tortured many poor creatures even to death The swellings in some grew hard and they applied violent drawing plaisters or poultices to break them and if these did not do they cut and scarified them in a terrible manner In some those swellings were made hard partly by the force of the distemper and partly by their being too violently drawn and were so hard that no instrument could cut them and then they burnt them with caustics so that many died raving mad with the torment and some in the very operation In these distresses some for want of help to hold them down in their beds or to look to them laid hands upon themselves as above Some broke out into the streets perhaps naked and would run directly down to the river if they were not stopped by the watchman or other officers and plunge themselves into the water wherever they found it It often pierced my very soul to hear the groans and cries of those who were thus tormented but of the two this was counted the most promising particular in the whole infection for if these swellings could be brought to a head and to break and run or as the surgeons call it to digest the patient generally recovered whereas those who like the gentlewoman s daughter were struck with death at the beginning and had the tokens come out upon them often went about indifferent easy till a little before they died and some till the moment they dropped down as in apoplexies and epilepsies is often the case Such would be taken suddenly very sick and would run to a bench or bulk or any convenient place that offered itself or to their own houses if possible as I mentioned before and there sit down grow faint and die This kind of dying was much the same as it was with those who die of common mortifications who die swooning and as it were go away in a dream Such as died thus had very little notice of their being infected at all till the gangrene was spread through their whole body nor could physicians themselves know certainly how it was with them till they opened their breasts or other parts of their body and saw the tokens We had at this time a great many frightful stories told us of nurses and watchmen who looked after the dying people that is to say hired nurses who attended infected people using them barbarously starving them smothering them or by other wicked means hastening their end that is to say murdering of them and watchmen being set to guard houses that were shut up when there has been but one person left and perhaps that one lying sick that they have broke in and murdered that body and immediately thrown them out into the dead cart And so they have gone scarce cold to the grave I cannot say but that some such murders were committed and I think two were sent to prison for it but died before they could be tried and I have heard that three others at several times were excused for murders of that kind but I must say I believe nothing of its being so common a crime as some have since been pleased to say nor did it seem to be so rational where the people were brought so low as not to be able to help themselves for such seldom recovered and there was no temptation to commit a murder at least none equal to the fact where they were sure persons would die in so short a time and could not live That there were a great many robberies and wicked practices committed even in this dreadful time I do not deny The power of avarice was so strong in some that they would run any hazard to steal and to plunder and particularly in houses where all the families or inhabitants have been dead and carried out they would break in at all hazards and without regard to the danger of infection take even the clothes off the dead bodies and the bed clothes from others where they lay dead This I suppose must be the case of a family in Houndsditch where a man and his daughter the rest of the family being as I suppose carried away before by the dead cart were found stark naked one in one chamber and one in another lying dead on the floor and the clothes of the beds from whence tis supposed they were rolled off by thieves stolen and carried quite away It is indeed to be observed that the women were in all this calamity the most rash fearless and desperate creatures and as there were vast numbers that went about as nurses to tend those that were sick they committed a great many petty thieveries in the houses where they were employed and some of them were publicly whipped for it when perhaps they ought rather to have been hanged for examples for numbers of houses were robbed on these occasions till at length the parish officers were sent to recommend nurses to the sick and always took an account whom it was they sent so as that they might call them to account if the house had been abused where they were placed But these robberies extended chiefly to wearing clothes linen and what rings or money they could come at when the person died who was under their care but not to a general plunder of the houses and I could give you an account of one of these nurses who several years after being on her deathbed confessed with the utmost horror the robberies she had committed at the time of her being a nurse and by which she had enriched herself to a great degree But as for murders I do not find that there was ever any proof of the facts in the manner as it has been reported except as above They did tell me indeed of a nurse in one place that laid a wet cloth upon the face of a dying patient whom she tended and so put an end to his life who was just expiring before and another that smothered a young woman she was looking to when she was in a fainting fit and would have come to herself some that killed them by giving them one thing some another and some starved them by giving them nothing at all But these stories had two marks of suspicion that always attended them which caused me always to slight them and to look on them as mere stories that people continually frighted one another with First that wherever it was that we heard it they always placed the scene at the farther end of the town opposite or most remote from where you were to hear it If you heard it in Whitechappel it had happened at saint Giles s or at Westminster or Holborn or that end of the town If you heard of it at that end of the town then it was done in Whitechappel or the Minories or about Cripplegate parish If you heard of it in the city why then it happened in Southwark and if you heard of it in Southwark then it was done in the city and the like In the next place of what part soever you heard the story the particulars were always the same especially that of laying a wet double cloth on a dying man s face and that of smothering a young gentlewoman so that it was apparent at least to my judgement that there was more of tale than of truth in those things However I cannot say but it had some effect upon the people and particularly that as I said before they grew more cautious whom they took into their houses and whom they trusted their lives with and had them always recommended if they could and where they could not find such for they were not very plenty they applied to the parish officers But here again the misery of that time lay upon the poor who being infected had neither food or physic neither physician or apothecary to assist them or nurse to attend them Many of those died calling for help and even for sustenance out at their windows in a most miserable and deplorable manner but it must be added that whenever the cases of such persons or families were represented to my Lord Mayor they always were relieved It is true in some houses where the people were not very poor yet where they had sent perhaps their wives and children away and if they had any servants they had been dismissed I say it is true that to save the expenses many such as these shut themselves in and not having help died alone A neighbour and acquaintance of mine having some money owing to him from a shopkeeper in Whitecross Street or thereabouts sent his apprentice a youth about eighteen years of age to endeavour to get the money He came to the door and finding it shut knocked pretty hard and as he thought heard somebody answer within but was not sure so he waited and after some stay knocked again and then a third time when he heard somebody coming downstairs At length the man of the house came to the door he had on his breeches or drawers and a yellow flannel waistcoat no stockings a pair of slipped shoes a white cap on his head and as the young man said death in his face When he opened the door says he What do you disturb me thus for The boy though a little surprised replied I come from such a one and my master sent me for the money which he says you know of Very well child returns the living ghost call as you go by at Cripplegate Church and bid them ring the bell and with these words shut the door again and went up again and died the same day nay perhaps the same hour This the young man told me himself and I have reason to believe it This was while the plague was not come to a height I think it was in June towards the latter end of the month it must be before the dead carts came about and while they used the ceremony of ringing the bell for the dead which was over for certain in that parish at least before the month of July for by the twenty fifth of July there died five hundred fifty and upwards in a week and then they could no more bury in form rich or poor I have mentioned above that notwithstanding this dreadful calamity yet the numbers of thieves were abroad upon all occasions where they had found any prey and that these were generally women It was one morning about eleven O clock I had walked out to my brother s house in Coleman Street parish as I often did to see that all was safe My brother s house had a little court before it and a brick wall and a gate in it and within that several warehouses where his goods of several sorts lay It happened that in one of these warehouses were several packs of women s high crowned hats which came out of the country and were as I suppose for exportation whither I know not I was surprised that when I came near my brother s door which was in a place they called Swan Alley I met three or four women with high crowned hats on their heads and as I remembered afterwards one if not more had some hats likewise in their hands but as I did not see them come out at my brother s door and not knowing that my brother had any such goods in his warehouse I did not offer to say anything to them but went across the way to shun meeting them as was usual to do at that time for fear of the plague But when I came nearer to the gate I met another woman with more hats come out of the gate What business mistress said I have you had there There are more people there said she I have had no more business there than they I was hasty to get to the gate then and said no more to her by which means she got away But just as I came to the gate I saw two more coming across the yard to come out with hats also on their heads and under their arms at which I threw the gate to behind me which having a spring lock fastened itself and turning to the women Forsooth said I what are you doing here and seized upon the hats and took them from them One of them who I confess did not look like a thief Indeed says she we are wrong but we were told they were goods that had no owner Be pleased to take them again and look yonder there are more such customers as we She cried and looked pitifully so I took the hats from her and opened the gate and bade them be gone for I pitied the women indeed but when I looked towards the warehouse as she directed there were six or seven more all women fitting themselves with hats as unconcerned and quiet as if they had been at a hatter s shop buying for their money I was surprised not at the sight of so many thieves only but at the circumstances I was in being now to thrust myself in among so many people who for some weeks had been so shy of myself that if I met anybody in the street I would cross the way from them They were equally surprised though on another account They all told me they were neighbours that they had heard anyone might take them that they were nobody s goods and the like I talked big to them at first went back to the gate and took out the key so that they were all my prisoners threatened to lock them all into the warehouse and go and fetch my Lord Mayor s officers for them They begged heartily protested they found the gate open and the warehouse door open and that it had no doubt been broken open by some who expected to find goods of greater value which indeed was reasonable to believe because the lock was broke and a padlock that hung to the door on the outside also loose and an abundance of the hats carried away At length I considered that this was not a time to be cruel and rigorous and besides that it would necessarily oblige me to go much about to have several people come to me and I go to several whose circumstances of health I knew nothing of and that even at this time the plague was so high as that there died four thousand a week so that in showing my resentment or even in seeking justice for my brother s goods I might lose my own life so I contented myself with taking the names and places where some of them lived who were really inhabitants in the neighbourhood and threatening that my brother should call them to an account for it when he returned to his habitation Then I talked a little upon another foot with them and asked them how they could do such things as these in a time of such general calamity and as it were in the face of God s most dreadful judgements when the plague was at their very doors and it may be in their very houses and they did not know but that the dead cart might stop at their doors in a few hours to carry them to their graves I could not perceive that my discourse made much impression upon them all that while till it happened that there came two men of the neighbourhood hearing of the disturbance and knowing my brother for they had been both dependents upon his family and they came to my assistance These being as I said neighbours presently knew three of the women and told me who they were and where they lived and it seems they had given me a true account of themselves before This brings these two men to a further remembrance The name of one was John Hayward who was at that time undersexton of the parish of saint Stephen Coleman Street By undersexton was understood at that time gravedigger and bearer of the dead This man carried or assisted to carry all the dead to their graves which were buried in that large parish and who were carried in form and after that form of burying was stopped went with the dead cart and the bell to fetch the dead bodies from the houses where they lay and fetched many of them out of the chambers and houses for the parish was and is still remarkable particularly above all the parishes in London for a great number of alleys and thoroughfares very long into which no carts could come and where they were obliged to go and fetch the bodies a very long way which alleys now remain to witness it such as White s Alley Cross Key Court Swan Alley Bell Alley White Horse Alley and many more Here they went with a kind of hand barrow and laid the dead bodies on it and carried them out to the carts which work he performed and never had the distemper at all but lived about twenty years after it and was sexton of the parish to the time of his death His wife at the same time was a nurse to infected people and tended many that died in the parish being for her honesty recommended by the parish officers yet she never was infected neither He never used any preservative against the infection other than holding garlic and rue in his mouth and smoking tobacco This I also had from his own mouth And his wife s remedy was washing her head in vinegar and sprinkling her head clothes so with vinegar as to keep them always moist and if the smell of any of those she waited on was more than ordinary offensive she snuffed vinegar up her nose and sprinkled vinegar upon her head clothes and held a handkerchief wetted with vinegar to her mouth It must be confessed that though the plague was chiefly among the poor yet were the poor the most venturous and fearless of it and went about their employment with a sort of brutal courage I must call it so for it was founded neither on religion nor prudence scarce did they use any caution but ran into any business which they could get employment in though it was the most hazardous Such was that of tending the sick watching houses shut up carrying infected persons to the pest house and which was still worse carrying the dead away to their graves It was under this John Hayward s care and within his bounds that the story of the piper with which people have made themselves so merry happened and he assured me that it was true It is said that it was a blind piper but as John told me the fellow was not blind but an ignorant weak poor man and usually walked his rounds about ten o clock at night and went piping along from door to door and the people usually took him in at public houses where they knew him and would give him drink and victuals and sometimes farthings and he in return would pipe and sing and talk simply which diverted the people and thus he lived It was but a very bad time for this diversion while things were as I have told yet the poor fellow went about as usual but was almost starved and when anybody asked how he did he would answer the dead cart had not taken him yet but that they had promised to call for him next week It happened one night that this poor fellow whether somebody had given him too much drink or no John Hayward said he had not drink in his house but that they had given him a little more victuals than ordinary at a public house in Coleman Street and the poor fellow having not usually had a bellyful for perhaps not a good while was laid all along upon the top of a bulk or stall and fast asleep at a door in the street near London Wall towards Cripplegate and that upon the same bulk or stall the people of some house in the alley of which the house was a corner hearing a bell which they always rang before the cart came had laid a body really dead of the plague just by him thinking too that this poor fellow had been a dead body as the other was and laid there by some of the neighbours Accordingly when John Hayward with his bell and the cart came along finding two dead bodies lie upon the stall they took them up with the instrument they used and threw them into the cart and all this while the piper slept soundly From hence they passed along and took in other dead bodies till as honest John Hayward told me they almost buried him alive in the cart yet all this while he slept soundly At length the cart came to the place where the bodies were to be thrown into the ground which as I do remember was at Mount Mill and as the cart usually stopped some time before they were ready to shoot out the melancholy load they had in it as soon as the cart stopped the fellow awaked and struggled a little to get his head out from among the dead bodies when raising himself up in the cart he called out Hey where am I This frighted the fellow that attended about the work but after some pause John Hayward recovering himself said Lord bless us There s somebody in the cart not quite dead So another called to him and said Who are you The fellow answered I am the poor piper Where am I Where are you says Hayward Why you are in the dead cart and we are going to bury you But I an t dead though am I says the piper which made them laugh a little though as John said they were heartily frighted at first so they helped the poor fellow down and he went about his business I know the story goes he set up his pipes in the cart and frighted the bearers and others so that they ran away but John Hayward did not tell the story so nor say anything of his piping at all but that he was a poor piper and that he was carried away as above I am fully satisfied of the truth of It is to be noted here that the dead carts in the city were not confined to particular parishes but one cart went through several parishes according as the number of dead presented nor were they tied to carry the dead to their respective parishes but many of the dead taken up in the city were carried to the burying ground in the out parts for want of room I have already mentioned the surprise that this judgement was at first among the people I must be allowed to give some of my observations on the more serious and religious part Surely never city at least of this bulk and magnitude was taken in a condition so perfectly unprepared for such a dreadful visitation whether I am to speak of the civil preparations or religious They were indeed as if they had had no warning no expectation no apprehensions and consequently the least provision imaginable was made for it in a public way For example the Lord Mayor and sheriffs had made no provision as magistrates for the regulations which were to be observed They had gone into no measures for relief of the poor The citizens had no public magazines or storehouses for corn or meal for the subsistence of the poor which if they had provided themselves as in such cases is done abroad many miserable families who were now reduced to the utmost distress would have been relieved and that in a better manner than now could be done The stock of the city s money I can say but little to The Chamber of London was said to be exceedingly rich and it may be concluded that they were so by the vast of money issued from thence in the rebuilding the public edifices after the fire of London and in building new works such as for the first part the Guildhall Blackwell Hall part of Leadenhall half the Exchange the Session House the Compter the prisons of Ludgate Newgate c several of the wharfs and stairs and landing places on the river all which were either burned down or damaged by the great fire of London the next year after the plague and of the second sort the Monument Fleet Ditch with its bridges and the Hospital of Bethlem or Bedlam c But possibly the managers of the city s credit at that time made more conscience of breaking in upon the orphan s money to show charity to the distressed citizens than the managers in the following years did to beautify the city and re edify the buildings though in the first case the losers would have thought their fortunes better bestowed and the public faith of the city have been less subjected to scandal and reproach It must be acknowledged that the absent citizens who though they were fled for safety into the country were yet greatly interested in the welfare of those whom they left behind forgot not to contribute liberally to the relief of the poor and large sums were also collected among trading towns in the remotest parts of England and as I have heard also the nobility and the gentry in all parts of England took the deplorable condition of the city into their consideration and sent up large sums of money in charity to the Lord Mayor and magistrates for the relief of the poor The king also as I was told ordered a thousand pounds a week to be distributed in four parts one quarter to the city and liberty of Westminster one quarter or part among the inhabitants of the Southwark side of the water one quarter to the liberty and parts within of the city exclusive of the city within the walls and one fourth part to the suburbs in the county of Middlesex and the east and north parts of the city But this latter I only speak of as a report Certain it is the greatest part of the poor or families who formerly lived by their labour or by retail trade lived now on charity and had there not been prodigious sums of money given by charitable well minded Christians for the support of such the city could never have subsisted There were no question accounts kept of their charity and of the just distribution of it by the magistrates But as such multitudes of those very officers died through whose hands it was distributed and also that as I have been told most of the accounts of those things were lost in the great fire which happened in the very next year and which burnt even the chamberlain s office and many of their papers so I could never come at the particular account which I used great endeavours to have seen It may however be a direction in case of the approach of a like visitation which God keep the city from I say it may be of use to observe that by the care of the Lord Mayor and aldermen at that time in distributing weekly great sums of money for relief of the poor a multitude of people who would otherwise have perished were relieved and their lives preserved And here let me enter into a brief state of the case of the poor at that time and what way apprehended from them from whence may be judged hereafter what may be expected if the like distress should come upon the city At the beginning of the plague when there was now no more hope but that the whole city would be visited when as I have said all that had friends or estates in the country retired with their families and when indeed one would have thought the very city itself was running out of the gates and that there would be nobody left behind you may be sure from that hour all trade except such as related to immediate subsistence was as it were at a full stop This is so lively a case and contains in it so much of the real condition of the people that I think I cannot be too particular in it and therefore I descend to the several arrangements or classes of people who fell into immediate distress upon this occasion For example one All master workmen in manufactures especially such as belonged to ornament and the less necessary parts of the people s dress clothes and furniture for houses such as riband weavers and other weavers gold and silver lace makers and gold and silver wire drawers sempstresses milliners shoemakers hatmakers and glovemakers also upholsterers joiners cabinet makers looking glass makers and innumerable trades which depend upon such as these I say the master workmen in such stopped their work dismissed their journeymen and workmen and all their dependents two As merchandising was at a full stop for very few ships ventured to come up the river and none at all went out so all the extraordinary officers of the customs likewise the watermen carmen porters and all the poor whose labour depended upon the merchants were at once dismissed and put out of business three All the tradesmen usually employed in building or repairing of houses were at a full stop for the people were far from wanting to build houses when so many thousand houses were at once stripped of their inhabitants so that this one article turned all the ordinary workmen of that kind out of business such as bricklayers masons carpenters joiners plasterers painters glaziers smiths plumbers and all the labourers depending on such four As navigation was at a stop our ships neither coming in or going out as before so the seamen were all out of employment and many of them in the last and lowest degree of distress and with the seamen were all the several tradesmen and workmen belonging to and depending upon the building and fitting out of ships such as ship carpenters caulkers ropemakers dry coopers sailmakers anchorsmiths and other smiths blockmakers carvers gunsmiths ship chandlers ship carvers and the like The masters of those perhaps might live upon their substance but the traders were universally at a stop and consequently all their workmen discharged Add to these that the river was in a manner without boats and all or most part of the watermen lightermen boat builders and lighter builders in like manner idle and laid by five All families retrenched their living as much as possible as well those that fled as those that stayed so that an innumerable multitude of footmen serving men shopkeepers journeymen merchants bookkeepers and such sort of people and especially poor maid servants were turned off and left friendless and helpless without employment and without habitation and this was really a dismal article I might be more particular as to this part but it may suffice to mention in general all trades being stopped employment ceased the labour and by that the bread of the poor were cut off and at first indeed the cries of the poor were most lamentable to hear though by the distribution of charity their misery that way was greatly abated Many indeed fled into the counties but thousands of them having stayed in London till nothing but desperation sent them away death overtook them on the road and they served for no better than the messengers of death indeed others carrying the infection along with them spread it very unhappily into the remotest parts of the kingdom Many of these were the miserable objects of despair which I have mentioned before and were removed by the destruction which followed These might be said to perish not by the infection itself but by the consequence of it indeed namely by hunger and distress and the want of all things being without lodging without money without friends without means to get their bread or without anyone to give it them for many of them were without what we call legal settlements and so could not claim of the parishes and all the support they had was by application to the magistrates for relief which relief was to give the magistrates their due carefully and cheerfully administered as they found it necessary and those that stayed behind never felt the want and distress of that kind which they felt who went away in the manner above noted Let any one who is acquainted with what multitudes of people get their daily bread in this city by their labour whether artificers or mere workmen I say let any man consider what must be the miserable condition of this town if on a sudden they should be all turned out of employment that labour should cease and wages for work be no more This was the case with us at that time and had not the sums of money contributed in charity by well disposed people of every kind as well abroad as at home been prodigiously great it had not been in the power of the Lord Mayor and sheriffs to have kept the public peace Nor were they without apprehensions as it was that desperation should push the people upon tumults and cause them to rifle the houses of rich men and plunder the markets of provisions in which case the country people who brought provisions very freely and boldly to town would have been terrified from coming any more and the town would have sunk under an unavoidable famine But the prudence of my Lord Mayor and the Court of Aldermen within the city and of the justices of peace in the out parts was such and they were supported with money from all parts so well that the poor people were kept quiet and their wants everywhere relieved as far as was possible to be done Two things besides this contributed to prevent the mob doing any mischief One was that really the rich themselves had not laid up stores of provisions in their houses as indeed they ought to have done and which if they had been wise enough to have done and locked themselves entirely up as some few did they had perhaps escaped the disease better But as it appeared they had not so the mob had no notion of finding stores of provisions there if they had broken in as it is plain they were sometimes very near doing and which if they had they had finished the ruin of the whole city for there were no regular troops to have withstood them nor could the trained bands have been brought together to defend the city no men being to be found to bear arms But the vigilance of the Lord Mayor and such magistrates as could be had for some even of the aldermen were dead and some absent prevented this and they did it by the most kind and gentle methods they could think of as particularly by relieving the most desperate with money and putting others into business and particularly that employment of watching houses that were infected and shut up And as the number of these were very great for it was said there was at one time ten thousand houses shut up and every house had two watchmen to guard it viz one by night and the other by day this gave opportunity to employ a very great number of poor men at a time The women and servants that were turned off from their places were likewise employed as nurses to tend the sick in all places and this took off a very great number of them And which though a melancholy article in itself yet was a deliverance in its kind namely the plague which raged in a dreadful manner from the middle of August to the middle of October carried off in that time thirty or forty thousand of these very people which had they been left would certainly have been an insufferable burden by their poverty that is to say the whole city could not have supported the expense of them or have provided food for them and they would in time have been even driven to the necessity of plundering either the city itself or the country adjacent to have subsisted themselves which would first or last have put the whole nation as well as the city into the utmost terror and confusion It was observable then that this calamity of the people made them very humble for now for about nine weeks together there died near a thousand a day one day with another even by the account of the weekly bills which yet I have reason to be assured never gave a full account by many thousands the confusion being such and the carts working in the dark when they carried the dead that in some places no account at all was kept but they worked on the clerks and sextons not attending for weeks together and not knowing what number they carried This account is verified by the following bills of mortality Of all of the Diseases Plague From August eight to August fifteen five thousand three hundred nineteen three thousand eight hundred eighty fifteen twenty two five thousand five hundred sixty eight four thousand two hundred thirty seven twenty two twenty nine seven thousand four hundred ninety six six thousand one hundred two twenty nine to September five eight thousand two hundred fifty two six thousand nine hundred eighty eight September five twelve seven thousand six hundred ninety six thousand five hundred forty four twelve nineteen eight thousand two hundred ninety seven seven thousand one hundred sixty five nineteen twenty six six thousand four hundred sixty five thousand five hundred thirty three twenty six to October three five thousand seven hundred twenty four thousand nine hundred seventy nine October three ten five thousand sixty eight four thousand three hundred twenty seven fifty nine thousand eight hundred seventy forty nine thousand seven hundred five So that the gross of the people were carried off in these two months for as the whole number which was brought in to die of the plague was but sixty eight thousand five hundred ninety here is fifty thousand of them within a trifle in two months I say fifty thousand because as there wants two hundred ninety five in the number above so there wants two days of two months in the account of time Now when I say that the parish officers did not give in a full account or were not to be depended upon for their account let any one but consider how men could be exact in such a time of dreadful distress and when many of them were taken sick themselves and perhaps died in the very time when their accounts were to be given in I mean the parish clerks besides inferior officers for though these poor men ventured at all hazards yet they were far from being exempt from the common calamity especially if it be true that the parish of Stepney had within the year one hundred sixteen sextons gravediggers and their assistants that is to say bearers bellmen and drivers of carts for carrying off the dead bodies Indeed the work was not of a nature to allow them leisure to take an exact tale of the dead bodies which were all huddled together in the dark into a pit which pit or trench no man could come nigh but at the utmost peril I observed often that in the parishes of Aldgate and Cripplegate Whitechappel and Stepney there were five six seven and eight hundred in a week in the bills whereas if we may believe the opinion of those that lived in the city all the time as well as I there died sometimes two thousand a week in those parishes and I saw it under the hand of one that made as strict an examination into that part as he could that there really died an hundred thousand people of the plague in that one year whereas in the bills the articles of the plague it was but sixty eight thousand five hundred ninety If I may be allowed to give my opinion by what I saw with my eyes and heard from other people that were eye witnesses I do verily believe the same viz that there died at least one hundred thousand of the plague only besides other distempers and besides those which died in the fields and highways and secret Places out of the compass of the communication as it was called and who were not put down in the bills though they really belonged to the body of the inhabitants It was known to us all that abundance of poor despairing creatures who had the distemper upon them and were grown stupid or melancholy by their misery as many were wandered away into the fields and Woods and into secret uncouth places almost anywhere to creep into a bush or hedge and die The inhabitants of the villages adjacent would in pity carry them food and set it at a distance that they might fetch it if they were able and sometimes they were not able and the next time they went they should find the poor wretches lie dead and the food untouched The number of these miserable objects were many and I know so many that perished thus and so exactly where that I believe I could go to the very place and dig their bones up still for the country people would go and dig a hole at a distance from them and then with long poles and hooks at the end of them drag the bodies into these pits and then throw the earth in from as far as they could cast it to cover them taking notice how the wind blew and so coming on that side which the seamen call to windward that the scent of the bodies might blow from them and thus great numbers went out of the world who were never known or any account of them taken as well within the bills of mortality as without This indeed I had in the main only from the relation of others for I seldom walked into the fields except towards Bethnal Green and Hackney or as hereafter But when I did walk I always saw a great many poor wanderers at a distance but I could know little of their cases for whether it were in the street or in the fields if we had seen anybody coming it was a general method to walk away yet I believe the account is exactly true As this puts me upon mentioning my walking the streets and fields I cannot omit taking notice what a desolate place the city was at that time The great street I lived in which is known to be one of the broadest of all the streets of London I mean of the suburbs as well as the liberties all the side where the butchers lived especially without the bars was more like a green field than a paved street and the people generally went in the middle with the horses and carts It is true that the farthest end towards Whitechappel Church was not all paved but even the part that was paved was full of grass also but this need not seem strange since the great streets within the city such as Leadenhall Street Bishopsgate Street Cornhill and even the Exchange itself had grass growing in them in several places neither cart or coach were seen in the streets from morning to evening except some country carts to bring roots and beans or peas hay and straw to the market and those but very few compared to what was usual As for coaches they were scarce used but to carry sick people to the pest house and to other hospitals and some few to carry physicians to such places as they thought fit to venture to visit for really coaches were dangerous things and people did not care to venture into them because they did not know who might have been carried in them last and sick infected people were as I have said ordinarily carried in them to the pest houses and sometimes people expired in them as they went along It is true when the infection came to such a height as I have now mentioned there were very few physicians which cared to stir abroad to sick houses and very many of the most eminent of the faculty were dead as well as the surgeons also for now it was indeed a dismal time and for about a month together not taking any notice of the bills of mortality I believe there did not die less than fifteen hundred or seventeen hundred a day one day with another One of the worst days we had in the whole time as I thought was in the beginning of September when indeed good people began to think that God was resolved to make a full end of the people in this miserable city This was at that time when the plague was fully come into the eastern parishes The parish of Aldgate if I may give my opinion buried above a thousand a week for two weeks though the bills did not say so many but it surrounded me at so dismal a rate that there was not a house in twenty uninfected in the Minories in Houndsditch and in those parts of Aldgate parish about the Butcher Row and the alleys over against me I say in those places death reigned in every corner Whitechappel parish was in the same condition and though much less than the parish I lived in yet buried near six hundred a week by the bills and in my opinion near twice as many Whole families and indeed whole streets of families were swept away together insomuch that it was frequent for neighbours to call to the bellman to go to such and such houses and fetch out the people for that they were all dead And indeed the work of removing the dead bodies by carts was now grown so very odious and dangerous that it was complained of that the bearers did not take care to clear such houses where all the inhabitants were dead but that sometimes the bodies lay several days unburied till the neighbouring families were offended with the stench and consequently infected and this neglect of the officers was such that the churchwardens and constables were summoned to look after it and even the justices of the Hamlets were obliged to venture their lives among them to quicken and encourage them for innumerable of the bearers died of the distemper infected by the bodies they were obliged to come so near And had it not been that the number of poor people who wanted employment and wanted bread as I have said before was so great that necessity drove them to undertake anything and venture anything they would never have found people to be employed And then the bodies of the dead would have lain above ground and have perished and rotted in a dreadful manner But the magistrates cannot be enough commended in this that they kept such good order for the burying of the dead that as fast as any of these they employed to carry off and bury the dead fell sick or died as was many times the case they immediately supplied the places with others which by reason of the great number of poor that was left out of business as above was not hard to do This occasioned that notwithstanding the infinite number of people which died and were sick almost all together yet they were always cleared away and carried off every night so that it was never to be said of London that the living were not able to bury the dead As the desolation was greater during those terrible times so the amazement of the people increased and a thousand unaccountable things they would do in the violence of their fright as others did the same in the agonies of their distemper and this part was very affecting Some went roaring and crying and wringing their hands along the street some would go praying and lifting up their hands to heaven calling upon God for mercy I cannot say indeed whether this was not in their distraction but be it so it was still an indication of a more serious mind when they had the use of their senses and was much better even as it was than the frightful yellings and cryings that every day and especially in the evenings were heard in some streets I suppose the world has heard of the famous Solomon Eagle an enthusiast He though not infected at all but in his head went about denouncing of judgement upon the city in a frightful manner sometimes quite naked and with a pan of burning charcoal on his head What he said or pretended indeed I could not learn I will not say whether that clergyman was distracted or not or whether he did it in pure zeal for the poor people who went every evening through the streets of Whitechappel and with his hands lifted up repeated that part of the Liturgy of the Church continually Spare us good Lord spare Thy people whom Thou has redeemed with Thy most precious blood I say I cannot speak positively of these things because these were only the dismal objects which represented themselves to me as I looked through my chamber windows for I seldom opened the casements while I confined myself within doors during that most violent raging of the pestilence when indeed as I have said many began to think and even to say that there would none escape and indeed I began to think so too and therefore kept within doors for about a fortnight and never stirred out But I could not hold it Besides there were some people who notwithstanding the danger did not omit publicly to attend the worship of God even in the most dangerous times and though it is true that a great many clergymen did shut up their churches and fled as other people did for the safety of their lives yet all did not do so Some ventured to officiate and to keep up the assemblies of the people by constant prayers and sometimes sermons or brief exhortations to repentance and reformation and this as long as any would come to hear them And Dissenters did the like also and even in the very churches where the parish ministers were either dead or fled nor was there any room for making difference at such a time as this was It was indeed a lamentable thing to hear the miserable lamentations of poor dying creatures calling out for ministers to comfort them and pray with them to counsel them and to direct them calling out to God for pardon and mercy and confessing aloud their past sins It would make the stoutest heart bleed to hear how many warnings were then given by dying penitents to others not to put off and delay their repentance to the day of distress that such a time of calamity as this was no time for repentance was no time to call upon God I wish I could repeat the very sound of those groans and of those exclamations that I heard from some poor dying creatures when in the height of their agonies and distress and that I could make him that reads this hear as I imagine I now hear them for the sound seems still to ring in my ears If I could but tell this part in such moving accents as should alarm the very soul of the reader I should rejoice that I recorded those things however short and imperfect It pleased God that I was still spared and very hearty and sound in health but very impatient of being pent up within doors without air as I had been for fourteen days or thereabouts and I could not restrain myself but I would go to carry a letter for my brother to the post house Then it was indeed that I observed a profound silence in the streets When I came to the post house as I went to put in my letter I saw a man stand in one corner of the yard and talking to another at a window and a third had opened a door belonging to the office In the middle of the yard lay a small leather purse with two keys hanging at it with money in it but nobody would meddle with it I asked how long it had lain there the man at the window said it had lain almost an hour but that they had not meddled with it because they did not know but the person who dropped it might come back to look for it I had no such need of money nor was the sum so big that I had any inclination to meddle with it or to get the money at the hazard it might be attended with so I seemed to go away when the man who had opened the door said he would take it up but so that if the right owner came for it he should be sure to have it So he went in and fetched a pail of water and set it down hard by the purse then went again and fetch some gunpowder and cast a good deal of powder upon the purse and then made a train from that which he had thrown loose upon the purse The train reached about two yards After this he goes in a third time and fetches out a pair of tongs red hot and which he had prepared I suppose on purpose and first setting fire to the train of powder that singed the purse and also smoked the air sufficiently But he was not content with that but he then takes up the purse with the tongs holding it so long till the tongs burnt through the purse and then he shook the money out into the pail of water so he carried it in The money as I remember was about thirteen shilling and some smooth groats and brass farthings There might perhaps have been several poor people as I have observed above that would have been hardy enough to have ventured for the sake of the money but you may easily see by what I have observed that the few people who were spared were very careful of themselves at that time when the distress was so exceeding great Much about the same time I walked out into the fields towards Bow for I had a great mind to see how things were managed in the river and among the ships and as I had some concern in shipping I had a notion that it had been one of the best ways of securing one s self from the infection to have retired into a ship and musing how to satisfy my curiosity in that point I turned away over the fields from Bow to Bromley and down to Blackwall to the stairs which are there for landing or taking water Here I saw a poor man walking on the bank or sea wall as they call it by himself I walked a while also about seeing the houses all shut up At last I fell into some talk at a distance with this poor man first I asked him how people did thereabouts Alas sir says he almost desolate all dead or sick Here are very few families in this part or in that village pointing at Poplar where half of them are not dead already and the rest sick Then he pointing to one house There they are all dead said he and the house stands open nobody dares go into it A poor thief says he ventured in to steal something but he paid dear for his theft for he was carried to the churchyard too last night Then he pointed to several other houses There says he they are all dead the man and his wife and five children There says he they are shut up you see a watchman at the door and so of other houses Why says I what do you here all alone Why says he I am a poor desolate man it has pleased God I am not yet visited though my family is and one of my children dead How do you mean then said I that you are not visited Why says he that s my house pointing to a very little low boarded house and there my poor wife and two children live said he if they may be said to live for my wife and one of the children are visited but I do not come at them And with that word I saw the tears run very plentifully down his face and so they did down mine too I assure you But said I why do you not come at them How can you abandon your own flesh and blood Oh sir says he the Lord forbid I do not abandon them I work for them as much as I am able and blessed be the Lord I keep them from want and with that I observed he lifted up his eyes to heaven with a countenance that presently told me I had happened on a man that was no hypocrite but a serious religious good man and his ejaculation was an expression of thankfulness that in such a condition as he was in he should be able to say his family did not want Well says I honest man that is a great mercy as things go now with the poor But how do you live then and how are you kept from the dreadful calamity that is now upon us all Why sir says he I am a waterman and there s my boat says he and the boat serves me for a house I work in it in the day and I sleep in it in the night and what I get I lay down upon that stone says he showing me a broad stone on the other side of the street a good way from his house and then says he I halloo and call to them till I make them hear and they come and fetch it Well friend says I but how can you get any money as a waterman Does any body go by water these times Yes sir says he in the way I am employed there does Do you see there says he five ships lie at anchor pointing down the river a good way below the town and do you see says he eight or ten ships lie at the chain there and at anchor yonder pointing above the town All those ships have families on board of their merchants and owners and such like who have locked themselves up and live on board close shut in for fear of the infection and I tend on them to fetch things for them carry letters and do what is absolutely necessary that they may not be obliged to come on shore and every night I fasten my boat on board one of the ship s boats and there I sleep by myself and blessed be God I am preserved hitherto Well said I friend but will they let you come on board after you have been on shore here when this is such a terrible place and so infected as it is Why as to that said he I very seldom go up the ship side but deliver what I bring to their boat or lie by the side and they hoist it on board If I did I think they are in no danger from me for I never go into any house on shore or touch anybody no not of my own family but I fetch provisions for them Nay says I but that may be worse for you must have those provisions of somebody or other and since all this part of the town is so infected it is dangerous so much as to speak with anybody for the village said I is as it were the beginning of London though it be at some distance from it That is true added he but you do not understand me right I do not buy provisions for them here I row up to Greenwich and buy fresh meat there and sometimes I row down the river to Woolwich and buy there then I go to single farm houses on the Kentish side where I am known and buy fowls and eggs and butter and bring to the ships as they direct me sometimes one sometimes the other I seldom come on shore here and I came now only to call on my wife and hear how my family do and give them a little money which I received last night Poor man said I and how much hast thou gotten for them I have gotten four shillings said he which is a great sum as things go now with poor men but they have given me a bag of bread too and a salt fish and some flesh so all helps out Well said I and have you given it them yet No said he but I have called and my wife has answered that she cannot come out yet but in half an hour she hopes to come and I am waiting for her Poor woman says he she is brought sadly down She has a swelling and it is broke and I hope she will recover but I fear the child will die but it is the Lord Here he stopped and wept very much Well honest friend said I thou hast a sure Comforter if thou hast brought thyself to be resigned to the will of God He is dealing with us all in judgement Oh sir says he it is infinite mercy if any of us are spared and who am I to repine Sayest thou so said I and how much less is my faith than thine And here my heart smote me suggesting how much better this poor man s foundation was on which he stayed in the danger than mine that he had nowhere to fly that he had a family to bind him to attendance which I had not and mine was mere presumption his a true dependence and a courage resting on God and yet that he used all possible caution for his safety I turned a little way from the man while these thoughts engaged me for indeed I could no more refrain from tears than he At length after some further talk the poor woman opened the door and called Robert Robert He answered and bid her stay a few moments and he would come so he ran down the common stairs to his boat and fetched up a sack in which was the provisions he had brought from the ships and when he returned he hallooed again Then he went to the great stone which he showed me and emptied the sack and laid all out everything by themselves and then retired and his wife came with a little boy to fetch them away and called and said such a captain had sent such a thing and such a captain such a thing and at the end adds God has sent it all give thanks to Him When the poor woman had taken up all she was so weak she could not carry it at once in though the weight was not much neither so she left the biscuit which was in a little bag and left a little boy to watch it till she came again Well but says I to him did you leave her the four shillings too which you said was your week s pay Yes yes says he you shall hear her own it So he calls again Rachel Rachel which it seems was her name did you take up the money Yes said she How much was it said he Four shillings and a groat said she Well well says he the Lord keep you all and so he turned to go away As I could not refrain contributing tears to this man s story so neither could I refrain my charity for his assistance So I called him Hark thee friend said I come hither for I believe thou art in health that I may venture thee so I pulled out my hand which was in my pocket before Here says I go and call thy Rachel once more and give her a little more comfort from me God will never forsake a family that trust in Him as thou dost So I gave him four other shillings and bid him go lay them on the stone and call his wife I have not words to express the poor man s thankfulness neither could he express it himself but by tears running down his face He called his wife and told her God had moved the heart of a stranger upon hearing their condition to give them all that money and a great deal more such as that he said to her The woman too made signs of the like thankfulness as well to Heaven as to me and joyfully picked it up and I parted with no money all that year that I thought better bestowed I then asked the poor man if the distemper had not reached to Greenwich He said it had not till about a fortnight before but that then he feared it had but that it was only at that end of the town which lay south towards Deptford Bridge that he went only to a butcher s shop and a grocer s where he generally bought such things as they sent him for but was very careful I asked him then how it came to pass that those people who had so shut themselves up in the ships had not laid in sufficient stores of all things necessary He said some of them had but on the other hand some did not come on board till they were frighted into it and till it was too dangerous for them to go to the proper people to lay in quantities of things and that he waited on two ships which he showed me that had laid in little or nothing but biscuit bread and ship beer and that he had bought everything else almost for them I asked him if there was any more ships that had separated themselves as those had done He told me yes all the way up from the point right against Greenwich to within the shore of Limehouse and Redriff all the ships that could have room rid two and two in the middle of the stream and that some of them had several families on board I asked him if the distemper had not reached them He said he believed it had not except two or three ships whose people had not been so watchful to keep the seamen from going on shore as others had been and he said it was a very fine sight to see how the ships lay up the Pool When he said he was going over to Greenwich as soon as the tide began to come in I asked if he would let me go with him and bring me back for that I had a great mind to see how the ships were ranged as he had told me He told me if I would assure him on the word of a Christian and of an honest man that I had not the distemper he would I assured him that I had not that it had pleased God to preserve me that I lived in Whitechappel but was too impatient of being so long within doors and that I had ventured out so far for the refreshment of a little air but that none in my house had so much as been touched with it Well sir says he as your charity has been moved to pity me and my poor family sure you cannot have so little pity left as to put yourself into my boat if you were not sound in health which would be nothing less than killing me and ruining my whole family The poor man troubled me so much when he spoke of his family with such a sensible concern and in such an affectionate manner that I could not satisfy myself at first to go at all I told him I would lay aside my curiosity rather than make him uneasy though I was sure and very thankful for it that I had no more distemper upon me than the freshest man in the world Well he would not have me put it off neither but to let me see how confident he was that I was just to him now importuned me to go so when the tide came up to his boat I went in and he carried me to Greenwich While he bought the things which he had in his charge to buy I walked up to the top of the hill under which the town stands and on the east side of the town to get a prospect of the river But it was a surprising sight to see the number of ships which lay in rows two and two and some places two or three such lines in the breadth of the river and this not only up quite to the town between the houses which we call Ratcliff and Redriff which they name the Pool but even down the whole river as far as the head of Long Reach which is as far as the hills give us leave to see it I cannot guess at the number of ships but I think there must be several hundreds of sail and I could not but applaud the contrivance for ten thousand people and more who attended ship affairs were certainly sheltered here from the violence of the contagion and lived very safe and very easy I returned to my own dwelling very well satisfied with my day s journey and particularly with the poor man also I rejoiced to see that such little sanctuaries were provided for so many families in a time of such desolation I observed also that as the violence of the plague had increased so the ships which had families on board removed and went farther off till as I was told some went quite away to sea and put into such harbours and safe roads on the north coast as they could best come at But it was also true that all the people who thus left the land and lived on board the ships were not entirely safe from the infection for many died and were thrown overboard into the river some in coffins and some as I heard without coffins whose bodies were seen sometimes to drive up and down with the tide in the river But I believe I may venture to say that in those ships which were thus infected it either happened where the people had recourse to them too late and did not fly to the ship till they had stayed too long on shore and had the distemper upon them though perhaps they might not perceive it and so the distemper did not come to them on board the ships but they really carried it with them or it was in these ships where the poor waterman said they had not had time to furnish themselves with provisions but were obliged to send often on shore to buy what they had occasion for or suffered boats to come to them from the shore And so the distemper was brought insensibly among them And here I cannot but take notice that the strange temper of the people of London at that time contributed extremely to their own destruction The plague began as I have observed at the other end of the town namely in Long Acre Drury Lane c and came on towards the city very gradually and slowly It was felt at first in December then again in February then again in April and always but a very little at a time then it stopped till May and even the last week in May there was but seventeen and all at that end of the town and all this while even so long as till there died above three thousand a week yet had the people in Redriff and in Wapping and Ratcliff on both sides of the river and almost all Southwark side a mighty fancy that they should not be visited or at least that it would not be so violent among them Some people fancied the smell of the pitch and tar and such other things as oil and rosin and brimstone which is so much used by all trades relating to shipping would preserve them Others argued it because it was in its extreamest violence in Westminster and the parish of saint Giles and saint Andrew c and began to abate again before it came among them which was true indeed in part For example From the eighth to the fifteenth August saint Giles in the Fields two hundred forty two Cripplegate eight hundred eighty six Stepney one hundred ninety seven saint Margaret Bermondsey twenty four Rotherhith three Total this week four thousand thirty From the fifteenth to the twenty second August saint Giles in the Fields one hundred seventy five Cripplegate eight hundred forty seven Stepney two hundred seventy three saint Margaret Bermondsey thirty six Rotherhith two Total this week five thousand three hundred nineteen N B That it was observed the numbers mentioned in Stepney parish at that time were generally all on that side where Stepney parish joined to Shoreditch which we now call Spittlefields where the parish of Stepney comes up to the very wall of Shoreditch Churchyard and the plague at this time was abated at saint Giles in the Fields and raged most violently in Cripplegate Bishopsgate and Shoreditch parishes but there was not ten people a week that died of it in all that part of Stepney parish which takes in Limehouse Ratdiff Highway and which are now the parishes of Shadwell and Wapping even to saint Katherine s by the Tower till after the whole month of August was expired But they paid for it afterwards as I shall observe by and by This I say made the people of Redriff and Wapping Ratcliff and Limehouse so secure and flatter themselves so much with the plague s going off without reaching them that they took no care either to fly into the country or shut themselves up Nay so far were they from stirring that they rather received their friends and relations from the city into their houses and several from other places really took sanctuary in that part of the town as a Place of safety and as a place which they thought God would pass over and not visit as the rest was visited And this was the reason that when it came upon them they were more surprised more unprovided and more at a loss what to do than they were in other places for when it came among them really and with violence as it did indeed in September and October there was then no stirring out into the country nobody would suffer a stranger to come near them no nor near the towns where they dwelt and as I have been told several that wandered into the country on Surrey side were found starved to death in the woods and commons that country being more open and more woody than any other part so near London especially about Norwood and the parishes of Camberwell Dullege and Lusum where it seems nobody durst relieve the poor distressed people for fear of the infection This notion having as I said prevailed with the people in that part of the town was in part the occasion as I said before that they had recourse to ships for their retreat and where they did this early and with prudence furnishing themselves so with provisions that they had no need to go on shore for supplies or suffer boats to come on board to bring them I say where they did so they had certainly the safest retreat of any people whatsoever but the distress was such that people ran on board in their fright without bread to eat and some into ships that had no men on board to remove them farther off or to take the boat and go down the river to buy provisions where it might be done safely and these often suffered and were infected on board as much as on shore As the richer sort got into ships so the lower rank got into hoys smacks lighters and fishing boats and many especially watermen lay in their boats but those made sad work of it especially the latter for going about for provision and perhaps to get their subsistence the infection got in among them and made a fearful havoc many of the watermen died alone in their wherries as they rid at their roads as well as above bridge as below and were not found sometimes till they were not in condition for anybody to touch or come near them Indeed the distress of the people at this seafaring end of the town was very deplorable and deserved the greatest commiseration But alas this was a time when every one s private safety lay so near them that they had no room to pity the distresses of others for every one had death as it were at his door and many even in their families and knew not what to do or whither to fly This I say took away all compassion self preservation indeed appeared here to be the first law For the children ran away from their parents as they languished in the utmost distress And in some places though not so frequent as the other parents did the like to their children nay some dreadful examples there were and particularly two in one week of distressed mothers raving and distracted killing their own children one whereof was not far off from where I dwelt the poor lunatic creature not living herself long enough to be sensible of the sin of what she had done much less to be punished for it It is not indeed to be wondered at for the danger of immediate death to ourselves took away all bowels of love all concern for one another I speak in general for there were many instances of immovable affection pity and duty in many and some that came to my knowledge that is to say by hearsay for I shall not take upon me to vouch the truth of the particulars To introduce one let me first mention that one of the most deplorable cases in all the present calamity was that of women with child who when they came to the hour of their sorrows and their pains come upon them could neither have help of one kind or another neither midwife or neighbouring women to come near them Most of the midwives were dead especially of such as served the poor and many if not all the midwives of note were fled into the country so that it was next to impossible for a poor woman that could not pay an immoderate price to get any midwife to come to her and if they did those they could get were generally unskilful and ignorant creatures and the consequence of this was that a most unusual and incredible number of women were reduced to the utmost distress Some were delivered and spoiled by the rashness and ignorance of those who pretended to lay them Children without number were I might say murdered by the same but a more justifiable ignorance pretending they would save the mother whatever became of the child and many times both mother and child were lost in the same manner and especially where the mother had the distemper there nobody would come near them and both sometimes perished Sometimes the mother has died of the plague and the infant it may be half born or born but not parted from the mother Some died in the very pains of their travail and not delivered at all and so many were the cases of this kind that it is hard to judge of them Something of it will appear in the unusual numbers which are put into the weekly bills though I am far from allowing them to be able to give anything of a full account under the articles of Child bed Abortive and Still born Christmas and Infants Take the weeks in which the plague was most violent and compare them with the weeks before the distemper began even in the same year For example Child bed Abortive Still born From January three to January ten seven one thirteen ten seventeen eight six eleven seventeen twenty four nine five fifteen twenty four thirty one three two nine thirty one to February seven three three eight February seven fourteen six two eleven fourteen twenty one five two thirteen twenty one twenty eight two two ten twenty eight to March seven five one ten forty eight twenty four one hundred From August one to August eight twenty five five eleven eight fifteen twenty three six eight fifteen twenty two twenty eight four four twenty two twenty nine forty six ten twenty nine to September five thirty eight two eleven September five twelve thirty nine twenty three twelve nineteen forty two five seventeen nineteen twenty six forty two six ten twenty six to October three fourteen four nine two hundred ninety one sixty one eighty To the disparity of these numbers it is to be considered and allowed for that according to our usual opinion who were then upon the spot there were not one third of the people in the town during the months of August and September as were in the months of January and February In a word the usual number that used to die of these three articles and as I hear did die of them the year before was thus sixteen sixty four sixteen sixty five Child bed one hundred eighty nine Child bed six hundred twenty five Abortive and still born four hundred fifty eight Abortive and still born six hundred seventeen six hundred forty seven twelve forty two This inequality I say is exceedingly augmented when the numbers of people are considered I pretend not to make any exact calculation of the numbers of people which were at this time in the city but I shall make a probable conjecture at that part by and by What I have said now is to explain the misery of those poor creatures above so that it might well be said as in the Scripture Woe be to those who are with child and to those which give suck in that day For indeed it was a woe to them in particular I was not conversant in many particular families where these things happened but the outcries of the miserable were heard afar off As to those who were with child we have seen some calculation made two hundred ninety one women dead in child bed in nine weeks out of one third part of the number of whom there usually died in that time but eighty four of the same disaster Let the reader calculate the proportion There is no room to doubt but the misery of those that gave suck was in proportion as great Our bills of mortality could give but little light in this yet some it did There were several more than usual starved at nurse but this was nothing The misery was where they were first starved for want of a nurse the mother dying and all the family and the infants found dead by them merely for want and if I may speak my opinion I do believe that many hundreds of poor helpless infants perished in this manner Secondly not starved but poisoned by the nurse Nay even where the mother has been nurse and having received the infection has poisoned that is infected the infant with her milk even before they knew they were infected themselves nay and the infant has died in such a case before the mother I cannot but remember to leave this admonition upon record if ever such another dreadful visitation should happen in this city that all women that are with child or that give suck should be gone if they have any possible means out of the place because their misery if infected will so much exceed all other people s I could tell here dismal stories of living infants being found sucking the breasts of their mothers or nurses after they have been dead of the plague Of a mother in the parish where I lived who having a child that was not well sent for an apothecary to view the child and when he came as the relation goes was giving the child suck at her breast and to all appearance was herself very well but when the apothecary came close to her he saw the tokens upon that breast with which she was suckling the child He was surprised enough to be sure but not willing to fright the poor woman too much he desired she would give the child into his hand so he takes the child and going to a cradle in the room lays it in and opening its cloths found the tokens upon the child too and both died before he could get home to send a preventive medicine to the father of the child to whom he had told their condition Whether the child infected the nurse mother or the mother the child was not certain but the last most likely Likewise of a child brought home to the parents from a nurse that had died of the plague yet the tender mother would not refuse to take in her child and laid it in her bosom by which she was infected and died with the child in her arms dead also It would make the hardest heart move at the instances that were frequently found of tender mothers tending and watching with their dear children and even dying before them and sometimes taking the distemper from them and dying when the child for whom the affectionate heart had been sacrificed has got over it and escaped The like of a tradesman in East Smithfield whose wife was big with child of her first child and fell in labour having the plague upon her He could neither get midwife to assist her or nurse to tend her and two servants which he kept fled both from her He ran from house to house like one distracted but could get no help the utmost he could get was that a watchman who attended at an infected house shut up promised to send a nurse in the morning The poor man with his heart broke went back assisted his wife what he could acted the part of the midwife brought the child dead into the world and his wife in about an hour died in his arms where he held her dead body fast till the morning when the watchman came and brought the nurse as he had promised and coming up the stairs for he had left the door open or only latched they found the man sitting with his dead wife in his arms and so overwhelmed with grief that he died in a few hours after without any sign of the infection upon him but merely sunk under the weight of his grief I have heard also of some who on the death of their relations have grown stupid with the insupportable sorrow and of one in particular who was so absolutely overcome with the pressure upon his spirits that by degrees his head sank into his body so between his shoulders that the crown of his head was very little seen above the bone of his shoulders and by degrees losing both voice and sense his face looking forward lay against his collarbone and could not be kept up any otherwise unless held up by the hands of other people and the poor man never came to himself again but languished near a year in that condition and died Nor was he ever once seen to lift up his eyes or to look upon any particular object I cannot undertake to give any other than a summary of such passages as these because it was not possible to come at the particulars where sometimes the whole families where such things happened were carried off by the distemper But there were innumerable cases of this kind which presented to the eye and the ear even in passing along the streets as I have hinted above Nor is it easy to give any story of this or that family which there was not divers parallel stories to be met with of the same kind But as I am now talking of the time when the plague raged at the easternmost part of the town how for a long time the people of those parts had flattered themselves that they should escape and how they were surprised when it came upon them as it did for indeed it came upon them like an armed man when it did come I say this brings me back to the three poor men who wandered from Wapping not knowing whither to go or what to do and whom I mentioned before one a biscuit baker one a sailmaker and the other a joiner all of Wapping or there abouts The sleepiness and security of that part as I have observed was such that they not only did not shift for themselves as others did but they boasted of being safe and of safety being with them and many people fled out of the city and out of the infected suburbs to Wapping Ratcliff Limehouse Poplar and such Places as to Places of security and it is not at all unlikely that their doing this helped to bring the plague that way faster than it might otherwise have come For though I am much for people flying away and emptying such a town as this upon the first appearance of a like visitation and that all people who have any possible retreat should make use of it in time and be gone yet I must say when all that will fly are gone those that are left and must stand it should stand stock still where they are and not shift from one end of the town or one part of the town to the other for that is the bane and mischief of the whole and they carry the plague from house to house in their very clothes Wherefore were we ordered to kill all the dogs and cats but because as they were domestic animals and are apt to run from house to house and from street to street so they are capable of carrying the effluvia or infectious streams of bodies infected even in their furs and hair And therefore it was that in the beginning of the infection an order was published by the Lord Mayor and by the magistrates according to the advice of the physicians that all the dogs and cats should be immediately killed and an officer was appointed for the execution It is incredible if their account is to be depended upon what a prodigious number of those creatures were destroyed I think they talked of forty thousand dogs and five times as many cats few houses being without a cat some having several sometimes five or six in a house All possible endeavours were used also to destroy the mice and rats especially the latter by laying ratsbane and other poisons for them and a prodigious multitude of them were also destroyed I often reflected upon the unprovided condition that the whole body of the people were in at the first coming of this calamity upon them and how it was for want of timely entering into measures and managements as well public as private that all the confusions that followed were brought upon us and that such a prodigious number of people sank in that disaster which if proper steps had been taken might Providence concurring have been avoided and which if posterity think fit they may take a caution and warning from But I shall come to this part again I come back to my three men Their story has a moral in every part of it and their whole conduct and that of some whom they joined with is a pattern for all poor men to follow or women either if ever such a time comes again and if there was no other end in recording it I think this a very just one whether my account be exactly according to fact or no Two of them are said to be brothers the one an old soldier but now a biscuit maker the other a lame sailor but now a sailmaker the third a joiner Says John the biscuit maker one day to Thomas his brother the sailmaker Brother Tom what will become of us The plague grows hot in the city and increases this way What shall we do Truly says Thomas I am at a great loss what to do for I find if it comes down into Wapping I shall be turned out of my lodging And thus they began to talk of it beforehand John Turned out of your lodging Tom I If you are I don t know who will take you in for people are so afraid of one another now there s no getting a lodging anywhere Thomas Why the people where I lodge are good civil people and have kindness enough for me too but they say I go abroad every day to my work and it will be dangerous and they talk of locking themselves up and letting nobody come near them John Why they are in the right to be sure if they resolve to venture staying in town Thomas Nay I might even resolve to stay within doors too for except a suit of sails that my master has in hand and which I am just finishing I am like to get no more work a great while There s no trade stirs now Workmen and servants are turned off everywhere so that I might be glad to be locked up too but I do not see they will be willing to consent to that any more than to the other John Why what will you do then brother And what shall I do for I am almost as bad as you The people where I lodge are all gone into the country but a maid and she is to go next week and to shut the house quite up so that I shall be turned adrift to the wide world before you and I am resolved to go away too if I knew but where to go Thomas We were both distracted we did not go away at first then we might have travelled anywhere There s no stirring now we shall be starved if we pretend to go out of town They won t let us have victuals no not for our money nor let us come into the towns much less into their houses John And that which is almost as bad I have but little money to help myself with neither Thomas As to that we might make shift I have a little though not much but I tell you there s no stirring on the road I know a couple of poor honest men in our street have attempted to travel and at Barnet or Whetstone or thereabouts the people offered to fire at them if they pretended to go forward so they are come back again quite discouraged John I would have ventured their fire if I had been there If I had been denied food for my money they should have seen me take it before their faces and if I had tendered money for it they could not have taken any course with me by law Thomas You talk your old soldier s language as if you were in the Low Countries now but this is a serious thing The people have good reason to keep anybody off that they are not satisfied are sound at such a time as this and we must not plunder them John No brother you mistake the case and mistake me too I would plunder nobody but for any town upon the road to deny me leave to pass through the town in the open highway and deny me provisions for my money is to say the town has a right to starve me to death which cannot be true Thomas But they do not deny you liberty to go back again from whence you came and therefore they do not starve you John But the next town behind me will by the same rule deny me leave to go back and so they do starve me between them Besides there is no law to prohibit my travelling wherever I will on the road Thomas But there will be so much difficulty in disputing with them at every town on the road that it is not for poor men to do it or undertake it at such a time as this is especially John Why brother our condition at this rate is worse than anybody else s for we can neither go away nor stay here I am of the same mind with the lepers of Samaria If we stay here we are sure to die I mean especially as you and I are stated without a dwelling house of our own and without lodging in anybody else s There is no lying in the street at such a time as this we had as good go into the dead cart at once Therefore I say if we stay here we are sure to die and if we go away we can but die I am resolved to be gone Thomas You will go away Whither will you go and what can you do I would as willingly go away as you if I knew whither But we have no acquaintance no friends Here we were born and here we must die John Look you Tom the whole kingdom is my native country as well as this town You may as well say I must not go out of my house if it is on fire as that I must not go out of the town I was born in when it is infected with the plague I was born in England and have a right to live in it if I can Thomas But you know every vagrant person may by the laws of England be taken up and passed back to their last legal settlement John But how shall they make me vagrant I desire only to travel on upon my lawful occasions Thomas What lawful occasions can we pretend to travel or rather wander upon They will not be put off with words John Is not flying to save our lives a lawful occasion And do they not all know that the fact is true We cannot be said to dissemble Thomas But suppose they let us pass whither shall we go John Anywhere to save our lives it is time enough to consider that when we are got out of this town If I am once out of this dreadful place I care not where I go Thomas We shall be driven to great extremities I know not what to think of it John Well Tom consider of it a little This was about the beginning of July and though the plague was come forward in the west and north parts of the town yet all Wapping as I have observed before and Redriff and Ratdiff and Limehouse and Poplar in short Deptford and Greenwich all both sides of the river from the Hermitage and from over against it quite down to Blackwall was entirely free there had not one person died of the plague in all Stepney parish and not one on the south side of Whitechappel Road no not in any parish and yet the weekly bill was that very week risen up to ten oh six It was a fortnight after this before the two brothers met again and then the case was a little altered and the plague was exceedingly advanced and the number greatly increased the bill was up at twenty seven eighty five and prodigiously increasing though still both sides of the river as below kept pretty well But some began to die in Redriff and about five or six in Ratdiff Highway when the sailmaker came to his brother John express and in some fright for he was absolutely warned out of his lodging and had only a week to provide himself His brother John was in as bad a case for he was quite out and had only begged leave of his master the biscuit maker to lodge in an outhouse belonging to his workhouse where he only lay upon straw with some biscuit sacks or bread sacks as they called them laid upon it and some of the same sacks to cover him Here they resolved seeing all employment being at an end and no work or wages to be had they would make the best of their way to get out of the reach of the dreadful infection and being as good husbands as they could would endeavour to live upon what they had as long as it would last and then work for more if they could get work anywhere of any kind let it be what it would While they were considering to put this resolution in practice in the best manner they could the third man who was acquainted very well with the sailmaker came to know of the design and got leave to be one of the number and thus they prepared to set out It happened that they had not an equal share of money but as the sailmaker who had the best stock was besides his being lame the most unfit to expect to get anything by working in the country so he was content that what money they had should all go into one public stock on condition that whatever any one of them could gain more than another it should without any grudging be all added to the public stock They resolved to load themselves with as little baggage as possible because they resolved at first to travel on foot and to go a great way that they might if possible be effectually safe and a great many consultations they had with themselves before they could agree about what way they should travel which they were so far from adjusting that even to the morning they set out they were not resolved on it At last the seaman put in a hint that determined it First says he the weather is very hot and therefore I am for travelling north that we may not have the sun upon our faces and beating on our breasts which will heat and suffocate us and I have been told says he that it is not good to overheat our blood at a time when for aught we know the infection may be in the very air In the next place says he I am for going the way that may be contrary to the wind as it may blow when we set out that we may not have the wind blow the air of the city on our backs as we go These two cautions were approved of if it could be brought so to hit that the wind might not be in the south when they set out to go north John the baker who had been a soldier then put in his opinion First says he we none of us expect to get any lodging on the road and it will be a little too hard to lie just in the open air Though it be warm weather yet it may be wet and damp and we have a double reason to take care of our healths at such a time as this and therefore says he you brother Tom that are a sailmaker might easily make us a little tent and I will undertake to set it up every night and take it down and a fig for all the inns in England if we have a good tent over our heads we shall do well enough The joiner opposed this and told them let them leave that to him he would undertake to build them a house every night with his hatchet and mallet though he had no other tools which should be fully to their satisfaction and as good as a tent The soldier and the joiner disputed that point some time but at last the soldier carried it for a tent The only objection against it was that it must be carried with them and that would increase their baggage too much the weather being hot but the sailmaker had a piece of good hap fell in which made that easy for his master whom he worked for having a rope walk as well as sailmaking trade had a little poor horse that he made no use of then and being willing to assist the three honest men he gave them the horse for the carrying their baggage also for a small matter of three days work that his man did for him before he went he let him have an old top gallant sail that was worn out but was sufficient and more than enough to make a very good tent The soldier showed how to shape it and they soon by his direction made their tent and fitted it with poles or staves for the purpose and thus they were furnished for their journey viz three men one tent one horse one gun for the soldier would not go without arms for now he said he was no more a biscuit baker but a trooper The joiner had a small bag of tools such as might be useful if he should get any work abroad as well for their subsistence as his own What money they had they brought all into one public stock and thus they began their journey It seems that in the morning when they set out the wind blew as the sailor said by his pocket compass at N W by W So they directed or rather resolved to direct their course N W But then a difficulty came in their way that as they set out from the hither end of Wapping near the Hermitage and that the plague was now very violent especially on the north side of the city as in Shoreditch and Cripplegate parish they did not think it safe for them to go near those parts so they went away east through Ratcliff Highway as far as Ratcliff Cross and leaving Stepney Church still on their left hand being afraid to come up from Ratcliff Cross to Mile End because they must come just by the churchyard and because the wind that seemed to blow more from the west blew directly from the side of the city where the plague was hottest So I say leaving Stepney they fetched a long compass and going to Poplar and Bromley came into the great road just at Bow Here the watch placed upon Bow Bridge would have questioned them but they crossing the road into a narrow way that turns out of the hither end of the town of Bow to Old Ford avoided any inquiry there and travelled to Old Ford The constables everywhere were upon their guard not so much It seems to stop people passing by as to stop them from taking up their abode in their towns and withal because of a report that was newly raised at that time and that indeed was not very improbable viz that the poor people in London being distressed and starved for want of work and by that means for want of bread were up in arms and had raised a tumult and that they would come out to all the towns round to plunder for bread This I say was only a rumour and it was very well it was no more But it was not so far off from being a reality as it has been thought for in a few weeks more the poor people became so desperate by the calamity they suffered that they were with great difficulty kept from going out into the fields and towns and tearing all in pieces wherever they came and as I have observed before nothing hindered them but that the plague raged so violently and fell in upon them so furiously that they rather went to the grave by thousands than into the fields in mobs by thousands for in the parts about the parishes of saint Sepulcher Clarkenwell Cripplegate Bishopsgate and Shoreditch which were the places where the mob began to threaten the distemper came on so furiously that there died in those few parishes even then before the plague was come to its height no less than five thousand three hundred sixty one people in the first three weeks in August when at the same time the parts about Wapping Radcliffe and Rotherhith were as before described hardly touched or but very lightly so that in a word though as I said before the good management of the Lord Mayor and justices did much to prevent the rage and desperation of the people from breaking out in rabbles and tumults and in short from the poor plundering the rich I say though they did much the dead carts did more for as I have said that in five parishes only there died above five thousand in twenty days so there might be probably three times that number sick all that time for some recovered and great numbers fell sick every day and died afterwards Besides I must still be allowed to say that if the bills of mortality said five thousand I always believed it was near twice as many in reality there being no room to believe that the account they gave was right or that indeed they were among such confusions as I saw them in in any condition to keep an exact account But to return to my travellers Here they were only examined and as they seemed rather coming from the country than from the city they found the people the easier with them that they talked to them let them come into a public house where the constable and his warders were and gave them drink and some victuals which greatly refreshed and encouraged them and here it came into their heads to say when they should be inquired of afterwards not that they came from London but that they came out of Essex To forward this little fraud they obtained so much favour of the constable at Old Ford as to give them a certificate of their passing from Essex through that village and that they had not been at London which though false in the common acceptance of London in the county yet was literally true Wapping or Ratcliff being no part either of the city or liberty This certificate directed to the next constable that was at Homerton one of the hamlets of the parish of Hackney was so serviceable to them that it procured them not a free passage there only but a full certificate of health from a justice of the peace who upon the constable s application granted it without much difficulty and thus they passed through the long divided town of Hackney for it lay then in several separated hamlets and travelled on till they came into the great north road on the top of Stamford Hill By this time they began to be weary and so in the back road from Hackney a little before it opened into the said great road they resolved to set up their tent and encamp for the first night which they did accordingly with this addition that finding a barn or a building like a barn and first searching as well as they could to be sure there was nobody in it they set up their tent with the head of it against the barn This they did also because the wind blew that night very high and they were but young at such a way of lodging as well as at the managing their tent Here they went to sleep but the joiner a grave and sober man and not pleased with their lying at this loose rate the first night could not sleep and resolved after trying to sleep to no purpose that he would get out and taking the gun in his hand stand sentinel and guard his companions So with the gun in his hand he walked to and again before the barn for that stood in the field near the road but within the hedge He had not been long upon the scout but he heard a noise of people coming on as if it had been a great number and they came on as he thought directly towards the barn He did not presently awake his companions but in a few minutes more their noise growing louder and louder the biscuit baker called to him and asked him what was the matter and quickly started out too The other being the lame sailmaker and most weary lay still in the tent As they expected so the people whom they had heard came on directly to the barn when one of our travellers challenged like soldiers upon the guard with Who comes there The people did not answer immediately but one of them speaking to another that was behind him Alas I alas I we are all disappointed says he Here are some people before us the barn is taken up They all stopped upon that as under some surprise and it seems there was about thirteen of them in all and some women among them They consulted together what they should do and by their discourse our travellers soon found they were poor distressed people too like themselves seeking shelter and safety and besides our travellers had no need to be afraid of their coming up to disturb them for as soon as they heard the words Who comes there these could hear the women say as if frighted Do not go near them How do you know but they may have the plague And when one of the men said Let us but speak to them the women said No don t by any means We have escaped thus far by the goodness of God do not let us run into danger now we beseech you Our travellers found by this that they were a good sober sort of people and flying for their lives as they were and as they were encouraged by it so John said to the joiner his comrade Let us encourage them too as much as we can so he called to them Hark ye good people says the joiner we find by your talk that you are flying from the same dreadful enemy as we are Do not be afraid of us we are only three poor men of us If you are free from the distemper you shall not be hurt by us We are not in the barn but in a little tent here in the outside and we will remove for you we can set up our tent again immediately anywhere else and upon this a parley began between the joiner whose name was Richard and one of their men who said his name was Ford Ford And do you assure us that you are all sound men Richard Nay we are concerned to tell you of it that you may not be uneasy or think yourselves in danger but you see we do not desire you should put yourselves into any danger and therefore I tell you that we have not made use of the barn so we will remove from it that you may be safe and we also Ford That is very kind and charitable but if we have reason to be satisfied that you are sound and free from the visitation why should we make you remove now you are settled in your lodging and it may be are laid down to rest We will go into the barn if you please to rest ourselves a while and we need not disturb you Richard Well but you are more than we are I hope you will assure us that you are all of you sound too for the danger is as great from you to us as from us to you Ford Blessed be God that some do escape though it is but few what may be our portion still we know not but hitherto we are preserved Richard What part of the town do you come from Was the plague come to the places where you lived Ford Ay ay in a most frightful and terrible manner or else we had not fled away as we do but we believe there will be very few left alive behind us Richard What part do you come from Ford We are most of us of Cripplegate parish only two or three of Clerkenwell parish but on the hither side Richard How then was it that you came away no sooner Ford We have been away some time and kept together as well as we could at the hither end of Islington where we got leave to lie in an old uninhabited house and had some bedding and conveniences of our own that we brought with us but the plague is come up into Islington too and a house next door to our poor dwelling was infected and shut up and we are come away in a fright Richard And what way are you going Ford As our lot shall cast us we know not whither but God will guide those that look up to Him They parleyed no further at that time but came all up to the barn and with some difficulty got into it There was nothing but hay in the barn but it was almost full of that and they accommodated themselves as well as they could and went to rest but our travellers observed that before they went to sleep an ancient man who it seems was father of one of the women went to prayer with all the company recommending themselves to the blessing and direction of Providence before they went to sleep It was soon day at that time of the year and as Richard the joiner had kept guard the first part of the night so John the soldier relieved him and he had the post in the morning and they began to be acquainted with one another It seems when they left Islington they intended to have gone north away to Highgate but were stopped at Holloway and there they would not let them pass so they crossed over the fields and hills to the eastward and came out at the Boarded River and so avoiding the towns they left Hornsey on the left hand and Newington on the right hand and came into the great road about Stamford Hill on that side as the three travellers had done on the other side And now they had thoughts of going over the river in the marshes and make forwards to Epping Forest where they hoped they should get leave to rest It seems they were not poor at least not so poor as to be in want at least they had enough to subsist them moderately for two or three months when as they said they were in hopes the cold weather would check the infection or at least the violence of it would have spent itself and would abate if it were only for want of people left alive to be infected This was much the fate of our three travellers only that they seemed to be the better furnished for travelling and had it in their view to go farther off for as to the first they did not propose to go farther than one day s journey that so they might have intelligence every two or three days how things were at London But here our travellers found themselves under an unexpected inconvenience namely that of their horse for by means of the horse to carry their baggage they were obliged to keep in the road whereas the people of this other band went over the fields or roads path or no path way or no way as they pleased neither had they any occasion to pass through any town or come near any town other than to buy such things as they wanted for their necessary subsistence and in that indeed they were put to much difficulty of which in its place But our three travellers were obliged to keep the road or else they must commit spoil and do the country a great deal of damage in breaking down fences and gates to go over enclosed fields which they were loth to do if they could help it Our three travellers however had a great mind to join themselves to this company and take their lot with them and after some discourse they laid aside their first design which looked northward and resolved to follow the other into Essex so in the morning they took up their tent and loaded their horse and away they travelled all together They had some difficulty in passing the ferry at the river side the ferryman being afraid of them but after some parley at a distance the ferryman was content to bring his boat to a place distant from the usual ferry and leave it there for them to take it so putting themselves over he directed them to leave the boat and he having another boat said he would fetch it again which it seems however he did not do for above eight days Here giving the ferryman money beforehand they had a supply of victuals and drink which he brought and left in the boat for them but not without as I said having received the money beforehand But now our travellers were at a great loss and difficulty how to get the horse over the boat being small and not fit for it and at last could not do it without unloading the baggage and making him swim over From the river they travelled towards the forest but when they came to Walthamstow the people of that town denied to admit them as was the case everywhere The constables and their watchmen kept them off at a distance and parleyed with them They gave the same account of themselves as before but these gave no credit to what they said giving it for a reason that two or three companies had already come that way and made the like pretences but that they had given several people the distemper in the towns where they had passed and had been afterwards so hardly used by the country though with justice too as they had deserved that about Brentwood or that way several of them perished in the fields whether of the plague or of mere want and distress they could not tell This was a good reason indeed why the people of Walthamstow should be very cautious and why they should resolve not to entertain anybody that they were not well satisfied of But as Richard the joiner and one of the other men who parleyed with them told them it was no reason why they should block up the roads and refuse to let people pass through the town and who asked nothing of them but to go through the street that if their people were afraid of them they might go into their houses and shut their doors they would neither show them civility nor incivility but go on about their business The constables and attendants not to be persuaded by reason continued obstinate and would hearken to nothing so the two men that talked with them went back to their fellows to consult what was to be done It was very discouraging in the whole and they knew not what to do for a good while but at last John the soldier and biscuit maker considering a while Come says he leave the rest of the parley to me He had not appeared yet so he sets the joiner Richard to work to cut some poles out of the trees and shape them as like guns as he could and in a little time he had five or six fair muskets which at a distance would not be known and about the part where the lock of a gun is he caused them to wrap cloth and rags such as they had as soldiers do in wet weather to preserve the locks of their pieces from rust the rest was discoloured with clay or mud such as they could get and all this while the rest of them sat under the trees by his direction in two or three bodies where they made fires at a good distance from one another While this was doing he advanced himself and two or three with him and set up their tent in the lane within sight of the barrier which the town s men had made and set a sentinel just by it with the real gun the only one they had and who walked to and fro with the gun on his shoulder so as that the people of the town might see them Also he tied the horse to a gate in the hedge just by and got some dry sticks together and kindled a fire on the other side of the tent so that the people of the town could see the fire and the smoke but could not see what they were doing at it After the country people had looked upon them very earnestly a great while and by all that they could see could not but suppose that they were a great many in company they began to be uneasy not for their going away but for staying where they were and above all perceiving they had horses and arms for they had seen one horse and one gun at the tent and they had seen others of them walk about the field on the inside of the hedge by the side of the lane with their muskets as they took them to be shouldered I say upon such a sight as this you may be assured they were alarmed and terribly frighted and it seems they went to a justice of the peace to know what they should do What the justice advised them to I know not but towards the evening they called from the barrier as above to the sentinel at the tent What do you want says John Why what do you intend to do says the constable To do says John what would you have us to do Constable Why don t you be gone What do you stay there for John Why do you stop us on the king s highway and pretend to refuse us leave to go on our way Constable We are not bound to tell you our reason though we did let you know it was because of the plague John We told you we were all sound and free from the plague which we were not bound to have satisfied you of and yet you pretend to stop us on the highway Constable We have a right to stop it up and our own safety obliges us to it Besides this is not the king s highway tis a way upon sufferance You see here is a gate and if we do let people pass here we make them pay toll John We have a right to seek our own safety as well as you and you may see we are flying for our lives and tis very unchristian and unjust to stop us Constable You may go back from whence you came we do not hinder you from that John No it is a stronger enemy than you that keeps us from doing that or else we should not have come hither Constable Well you may go any other way then John No no I suppose you see we are able to send you going and all the people of your parish and come through your town when we will but since you have stopped us here we are content You see we have encamped here and here we will live We hope you will furnish us with victuals It seems John was in the tent but hearing them call he steps out and taking the gun upon his shoulder talked to them as if he had been the sentinel placed there upon the guard by some officer that was his superior Footnote in the original Constable We furnish you What mean you by that John Why you would not have us starve would you If you stop us here you must keep us Constable You will be ill kept at our maintenance John If you stint us we shall make ourselves the better allowance Constable Why you will not pretend to quarter upon us by force will you John We have offered no violence to you yet Why do you seem to oblige us to it I am an old soldier and cannot starve and if you think that we shall be obliged to go back for want of provisions you are mistaken Constable Since you threaten us we shall take care to be strong enough for you I have orders to raise the county upon you John It is you that threaten not we And since you are for mischief you cannot blame us if we do not give you time for it we shall begin our march in a few minutes Constable What is it you demand of us John At first we desired nothing of you but leave to go through the town we should have offered no injury to any of you neither would you have had any injury or loss by us We are not thieves but poor people in distress and flying from the dreadful plague in London which devours thousands every week We wonder how you could be so unmerciful Constable Self preservation obliges us John What To shut up your compassion in a case of such distress as this Constable Well if you will pass over the fields on your left hand and behind that part of the town I will endeavour to have gates opened for you John Our horsemen cannot pass with our baggage that way it does not lead into the road that we want to go and why should you force us out of the road Besides you have kept us here all day without any provisions but such as we brought with us I think you ought to send us some provisions for our relief This frighted the constable and the people that were with him that they immediately changed their note They had but one horse among them Footnotes in the original Constable If you will go another way we will send you some provisions John That is the way to have all the towns in the county stop up the ways against us Constable If they all furnish you with food what will you be the worse I see you have tents you want no lodging John Well what quantity of provisions will you send us Constable How many are you John Nay we do not ask enough for all our company we are in three companies If you will send us bread for twenty men and about six or seven women for three days and show us the way over the field you speak of we desire not to put your people into any fear for us we will go out of our way to oblige you though we are as free from infection as you are Constable And will you assure us that your other people shall offer us no new disturbance John No no you may depend on it Constable You must oblige yourself too that none of your people shall come a step nearer than where the provisions we send you shall be set down John I answer for it we will not Accordingly they sent to the place twenty loaves of bread and three or four large pieces of good beef and opened some gates through which they passed but none of them had courage so much as to look out to see them go and as it was evening if they had looked they could not have seen them as to know how few they were This was John the soldier s management But this gave such an alarm to the county that had they really been two or three hundred the whole county would have been raised upon them and they would have been sent to prison or perhaps knocked on the head Here he called to one of his men and bade him order Captain Richard and his people to march the lower way on the side of the marches and meet them in the forest which was all a sham for they had no Captain Richard or any such company Footnote in the original They were soon made sensible of this for two days afterwards they found several parties of horsemen and footmen also about in pursuit of three companies of men armed as they said with muskets who were broke out from London and had the plague upon them and that were not only spreading the distemper among the people but plundering the country As they saw now the consequence of their case they soon saw the danger they were in so they resolved by the advice also of the old soldier to divide themselves again John and his two comrades with the horse went away as if towards Waltham the other in two companies but all a little asunder and went towards Epping The first night they encamped all in the forest and not far off of one another but not setting up the tent lest that should discover them On the other hand Richard went to work with his axe and his hatchet and cutting down branches of trees he built three tents or hovels in which they all encamped with as much convenience as they could expect The provisions they had at Walthamstow served them very plentifully this night and as for the next they left it to Providence They had fared so well with the old soldier s conduct that they now willingly made him their leader and the first of his conduct appeared to be very good He told them that they were now at a proper distance enough from London that as they need not be immediately beholden to the country for relief so they ought to be as careful the country did not infect them as that they did not infect the country that what little money they had they must be as frugal of as they could that as he would not have them think of offering the country any violence so they must endeavour to make the sense of their condition go as far with the country as it could They all referred themselves to his direction so they left their three houses standing and the next day went away towards Epping The captain also for so they now called him and his two fellow travellers laid aside their design of going to Waltham and all went together When they came near Epping they halted choosing out a proper place in the open forest not very near the highway but not far out of it on the north side under a little cluster of low pollard trees Here they pitched their little camp which consisted of three large tents or huts made of poles which their carpenter and such as were his assistants cut down and fixed in the ground in a circle binding all the small ends together at the top and thickening the sides with boughs of trees and bushes so that they were completely close and warm They had besides this a little tent where the women lay by themselves and a hut to put the horse in It happened that the next day or next but one was market day at Epping when Captain John and one of the other men went to market and bought some provisions that is to say bread and some mutton and beef and two of the women went separately as if they had not belonged to the rest and bought more John took the horse to bring it home and the sack which the carpenter carried his tools in to put it in The carpenter went to work and made them benches and stools to sit on such as the wood he could get would afford and a kind of table to dine on They were taken no notice of for two or three days but after that abundance of people ran out of the town to look at them and all the country was alarmed about them The people at first seemed afraid to come near them and on the other hand they desired the people to keep off for there was a rumour that the plague was at Waltham and that it had been in Epping two or three days so John called out to them not to come to them for says he we are all whole and sound people here and we would not have you bring the plague among us nor pretend we brought it among you After this the parish officers came up to them and parleyed with them at a distance and desired to know who they were and by what authority they pretended to fix their stand at that place John answered very frankly they were poor distressed people from London who foreseeing the misery they should be reduced to if plague spread into the city had fled out in time for their lives and having no acquaintance or relations to fly to had first taken up at Islington but the plague being come into that town were fled farther and as they supposed that the people of Epping might have refused them coming into their town they had pitched their tents thus in the open field and in the forest being willing to bear all the hardships of such a disconsolate lodging rather than have any one think or be afraid that they should receive injury by them At first the Epping people talked roughly to them and told them they must remove that this was no place for them and that they pretended to be sound and well but that they might be infected with the plague for aught they knew and might infect the whole country and they could not suffer them there John argued very calmly with them a great while and told them that London was the place by which they that is the townsmen of Epping and all the country round them subsisted to whom they sold the produce of their lands and out of whom they made their rent of their farms and to be so cruel to the inhabitants of London or to any of those by whom they gained so much was very hard and they would be loth to have it remembered hereafter and have it told how barbarous how inhospitable and how unkind they were to the people of London when they fled from the face of the most terrible enemy in the world that it would be enough to make the name of an Epping man hateful through all the city and to have the rabble stone them in the very streets whenever they came so much as to market that they were not yet secure from being visited themselves and that as he heard Waltham was already that they would think it very hard that when any of them fled for fear before they were touched they should be denied the liberty of lying so much as in the open fields The Epping men told them again that they indeed said they were sound and free from the infection but that they had no assurance of it and that it was reported that there had been a great rabble of people at Walthamstow who made such pretences of being sound as they did but that they threatened to plunder the town and force their way whether the parish officers would or no that there were near two hundred of them and had arms and tents like Low Country soldiers that they extorted provisions from the town by threatening them with living upon them at free quarter showing their arms and talking in the language of soldiers and that several of them being gone away toward Rumford and Brentwood the country had been infected by them and the plague spread into both those large towns so that the people durst not go to market there as usual that it was very likely they were some of that party and if so they deserved to be sent to the county jail and be secured till they had made satisfaction for the damage they had done and for the terror and fright they had put the country into John answered that what other people had done was nothing to them that they assured them they were all of one company that they had never been more in number than they saw them at that time which by the way was very true that they came out in two separate companies but joined by the way their cases being the same that they were ready to give what account of themselves anybody could desire of them and to give in their names and places of abode that so they might be called to an account for any disorder that they might be guilty of that the townsmen might see they were content to live hardly and only desired a little room to breathe in on the forest where it was wholesome for where it was not they could not stay and would decamp if they found it otherwise there But said the townsmen we have a great charge of poor upon our hands already and we must take care not to increase it we suppose you can give us no security against your being chargeable to our parish and to the inhabitants any more than you can of being dangerous to us as to the infection Why look you says John as to being chargeable to you we hope we shall not If you will relieve us with provisions for our present necessity we will be very thankful as we all lived without charity when we were at home so we will oblige ourselves fully to repay you if God pleases to bring us back to our own families and houses in safety and to restore health to the people of London As to our dying here we assure you if any of us die we that survive will bury them and put you to no expense except it should be that we should all die and then indeed the last man not being able to bury himself would put you to that single expense which I am persuaded says John he would leave enough behind him to pay you for the expense of On the other hand says John if you shut up all bowels of compassion and not relieve us at all we shall not extort anything by violence or steal from any one but when what little we have is spent if we perish for want God s will be done John wrought so upon the townsmen by talking thus rationally and smoothly to them that they went away and though they did not give any consent to their staying there yet they did not molest them and the poor people continued there three or four days longer without any disturbance In this time they had got some remote acquaintance with a victualling house at the outskirts of the town to whom they called at a distance to bring some little things that they wanted and which they caused to be set down at a distance and always paid for very honestly During this time the younger people of the town came frequently pretty near them and would stand and look at them and sometimes talk with them at some space between and particularly it was observed that the first Sabbath day the poor people kept retired worshipped God together and were heard to sing psalms These things and a quiet inoffensive behaviour began to get them the good opinion of the country and people began to pity them and speak very well of them the consequence of which was that upon the occasion of a very wet rainy night a certain gentleman who lived in the neighbourhood sent them a little cart with twelve trusses or bundles of straw as well for them to lodge upon as to cover and thatch their huts and to keep them dry The minister of a parish not far off not knowing of the other sent them also about two bushels of wheat and half a bushel of white peas They were very thankful to be sure for this relief and particularly the straw was a very great comfort to them for though the ingenious carpenter had made frames for them to lie in like troughs and filled them with leaves of trees and such things as they could get and had cut all their tent cloth out to make them coverlids yet they lay damp and hard and unwholesome till this straw came which was to them like feather beds and as John said more welcome than feather beds would have been at another time This gentleman and the minister having thus begun and given an example of charity to these wanderers others quickly followed and they received every day some benevolence or other from the people but chiefly from the gentlemen who dwelt in the country round them Some sent them chairs stools tables and such household things as they gave notice they wanted some sent them blankets rugs and coverlids some earthenware and some kitchen ware for ordering their food Encouraged by this good usage their carpenter in a few days built them a large shed or house with rafters and a roof in form and an upper floor in which they lodged warm for the weather began to be damp and cold in the beginning of September But this house being well thatched and the sides and roof made very thick kept out the cold well enough He made also an earthen wall at one end with a chimney in it and another of the company with a vast deal of trouble and pains made a funnel to the chimney to carry out the smoke Here they lived comfortably though coarsely till the beginning of September when they had the bad news to hear whether true or not that the plague which was very hot at Waltham Abbey on one side and at Rumford and Brentwood on the other side was also coming to Epping to Woodford and to most of the towns upon the Forest and which as they said was brought down among them chiefly by the higlers and such people as went to and from London with provisions If this was true it was an evident contradiction to that report which was afterwards spread all over England but which as I have said I cannot confirm of my own knowledge namely that the market people carrying provisions to the city never got the infection or carried it back into the country both which I have been assured has been false It might be that they were preserved even beyond expectation though not to a miracle that abundance went and came and were not touched and that was much for the encouragement of the poor people of London who had been completely miserable if the people that brought provisions to the markets had not been many times wonderfully preserved or at least more preserved than could be reasonably expected But now these new inmates began to be disturbed more effectually for the towns about them were really infected and they began to be afraid to trust one another so much as to go abroad for such things as they wanted and this pinched them very hard for now they had little or nothing but what the charitable gentlemen of the country supplied them with But for their encouragement it happened that other gentlemen in the country who had not sent them anything before began to hear of them and supply them and one sent them a large pig that is to say a porker another two sheep and another sent them a calf In short they had meat enough and sometimes had cheese and milk and all such things They were chiefly put to it for bread for when the gentlemen sent them corn they had nowhere to bake it or to grind it This made them eat the first two bushel of wheat that was sent them in parched corn as the Israelites of old did without grinding or making bread of it At last they found means to carry their corn to a windmill near Woodford where they had it ground and afterwards the biscuit maker made a hearth so hollow and dry that he could bake biscuit cakes tolerably well and thus they came into a condition to live without any assistance or supplies from the towns and it was well they did for the country was soon after fully infected and about one hundred twenty were said to have died of the distemper in the villages near them which was a terrible thing to them On this they called a new council and now the towns had no need to be afraid they should settle near them but on the contrary several families of the poorer sort of the inhabitants quitted their houses and built huts in the forest after the same manner as they had done But it was observed that several of these poor people that had so removed had the sickness even in their huts or booths the reason of which was plain namely not because they removed into the air but one because they did not remove time enough that is to say not till by openly conversing with the other people their neighbours they had the distemper upon them or as may be said among them and so carried it about them whither they went Or two because they were not careful enough after they were safely removed out of the towns not to come in again and mingle with the diseased people But be it which of these it will when our travellers began to perceive that the plague was not only in the towns but even in the tents and huts on the forest near them they began then not only to be afraid but to think of decamping and removing for had they stayed they would have been in manifest danger of their lives It is not to be wondered that they were greatly afflicted at being obliged to quit the place where they had been so kindly received and where they had been treated with so much humanity and charity but necessity and the hazard of life which they came out so far to preserve prevailed with them and they saw no remedy John however thought of a remedy for their present misfortune namely that he would first acquaint that gentleman who was their principal benefactor with the distress they were in and to crave his assistance and advice The good charitable gentleman encouraged them to quit the Place for fear they should be cut off from any retreat at all by the violence of the distemper but whither they should go that he found very hard to direct them to At last John asked of him whether he being a justice of the peace would give them certificates of health to other justices whom they might come before that so whatever might be their lot they might not be repulsed now they had been also so long from London This his worship immediately granted and gave them proper letters of health and from thence they were at liberty to travel whither they pleased Accordingly they had a full certificate of health intimating that they had resided in a village in the county of Essex so long that being examined and scrutinised sufficiently and having been retired from all conversation for above forty days without any appearance of sickness they were therefore certainly concluded to be sound men and might be safely entertained anywhere having at last removed rather for fear of the plague which was come into such a town rather than for having any signal of infection upon them or upon any belonging to them With this certificate they removed though with great reluctance and John inclining not to go far from home they moved towards the marshes on the side of Waltham But here they found a man who it seems kept a weir or stop upon the river made to raise the water for the barges which go up and down the river and he terrified them with dismal stories of the sickness having been spread into all the towns on the river and near the river on the side of Middlesex and Hertfordshire that is to say into Waltham Waltham Cross Enfield and Ware and all the towns on the road that they were afraid to go that way though it seems the man imposed upon them for that the thing was not really true However it terrified them and they resolved to move across the forest towards Rumford and Brentwood but they heard that there were numbers of people fled out of London that way who lay up and down in the forest called Henalt Forest reaching near Rumford and who having no subsistence or habitation not only lived oddly and suffered great extremities in the woods and fields for want of relief but were said to be made so desperate by those extremities as that they offered many violences to the county robbed and plundered and killed cattle and the like that others building huts and hovels by the roadside begged and that with an importunity next door to demanding relief so that the county was very uneasy and had been obliged to take some of them up This in the first place intimated to them that they would be sure to find the charity and kindness of the county which they had found here where they were before hardened and shut up against them and that on the other hand they would be questioned wherever they came and would be in danger of violence from others in like cases as themselves Upon all these considerations John their captain in all their names went back to their good friend and benefactor who had relieved them before and laying their case truly before him humbly asked his advice and he as kindly advised them to take up their old quarters again or if not to remove but a little farther out of the road and directed them to a proper place for them and as they really wanted some house rather than huts to shelter them at that time of the year it growing on towards Michaelmas they found an old decayed house which had been formerly some cottage or little habitation but was so out of repair as scarce habitable and by the consent of a farmer to whose farm it belonged they got leave to make what use of it they could The ingenious joiner and all the rest by his directions went to work with it and in a very few days made it capable to shelter them all in case of bad weather and in which there was an old chimney and old oven though both lying in ruins yet they made them both fit for use and raising additions sheds and leantos on every side they soon made the house capable to hold them all They chiefly wanted boards to make window shutters floors doors and several other things but as the gentlemen above favoured them and the country was by that means made easy with them and above all that they were known to be all sound and in good health everybody helped them with what they could spare Here they encamped for good and all and resolved to remove no more They saw plainly how terribly alarmed that county was everywhere at anybody that came from London and that they should have no admittance anywhere but with the utmost difficulty at least no friendly reception and assistance as they had received here Now although they received great assistance and encouragement from the country gentlemen and from the people round about them yet they were put to great straits for the weather grew cold and wet in October and November and they had not been used to so much hardship so that they got colds in their limbs and distempers but never had the infection and thus about December they came home to the city again I give this story thus at large principally to give an account what became of the great numbers of people which immediately appeared in the city as soon as the sickness abated for as I have said great numbers of those that were able and had retreats in the country fled to those retreats So when it was increased to such a frightful extremity as I have related the middling people who had not friends fled to all parts of the country where they could get shelter as well those that had money to relieve themselves as those that had not Those that had money always fled farthest because they were able to subsist themselves but those who were empty suffered as I have said great hardships and were often driven by necessity to relieve their wants at the expense of the country By that means the country was made very uneasy at them and sometimes took them up though even then they scarce knew what to do with them and were always very backward to punish them but often too they forced them from place to place till they were obliged to come back again to London I have since my knowing this story of John and his brother inquired and found that there were a great many of the poor disconsolate people as above fled into the country every way and some of them got little sheds and barns and outhouses to live in where they could obtain so much kindness of the country and especially where they had any the least satisfactory account to give of themselves and particularly that they did not come out of London too late But others and that in great numbers built themselves little huts and retreats in the fields and woods and lived like hermits in holes and caves or any place they could find and where we may be sure they suffered great extremities such that many of them were obliged to come back again whatever the danger was and so those little huts were often found empty and the country people supposed the inhabitants lay dead in them of the plague and would not go near them for fear no not in a great while nor is it unlikely but that some of the unhappy wanderers might die so all alone even sometimes for want of help as particularly in one tent or hut was found a man dead and on the gate of a field just by was cut with his knife in uneven letters the following words by which it may be supposed the other man escaped or that one dying first the other buried him as well as he could O mIsErY We BoTH ShaLL DyE WoE WoE I have given an account already of what I found to have been the case down the river among the seafaring men how the ships lay in the offing as it s called in rows or lines astern of one another quite down from the Pool as far as I could see I have been told that they lay in the same manner quite down the river as low as Gravesend and some far beyond even everywhere or in every place where they could ride with safety as to wind and weather nor did I ever hear that the plague reached to any of the people on board those ships except such as lay up in the Pool or as high as Deptford Reach although the people went frequently on shore to the country towns and villages and farmers houses to buy fresh provisions fowls pigs calves and the like for their supply Likewise I found that the watermen on the river above the bridge found means to convey themselves away up the river as far as they could go and that they had many of them their whole families in their boats covered with tilts and bales as they call them and furnished with straw within for their lodging and that they lay thus all along by the shore in the marshes some of them setting up little tents with their sails and so lying under them on shore in the day and going into their boats at night and in this manner as I have heard the river sides were lined with boats and people as long as they had anything to subsist on or could get anything of the country and indeed the country people as well Gentlemen as others on these and all other occasions were very forward to relieve them but they were by no means willing to receive them into their towns and houses and for that we cannot blame them There was one unhappy citizen within my knowledge who had been visited in a dreadful manner so that his wife and all his children were dead and himself and two servants only left with an elderly woman a near relation who had nursed those that were dead as well as she could This disconsolate man goes to a village near the town though not within the bills of mortality and finding an empty house there inquires out the owner and took the house After a few days he got a cart and loaded it with goods and carries them down to the house the people of the village opposed his driving the cart along but with some arguings and some force the men that drove the cart along got through the street up to the door of the house There the constable resisted them again and would not let them be brought in The man caused the goods to be unloaden and laid at the door and sent the cart away upon which they carried the man before a justice of peace that is to say they commanded him to go which he did The justice ordered him to cause the cart to fetch away the goods again which he refused to do upon which the justice ordered the constable to pursue the carters and fetch them back and make them reload the goods and carry them away or to set them in the stocks till they came for further orders and if they could not find them nor the man would not consent to take them away they should cause them to be drawn with hooks from the house door and burned in the street The poor distressed man upon this fetched the goods again but with grievous cries and lamentations at the hardship of his case But there was no remedy self preservation obliged the people to those severities which they would not otherwise have been concerned in Whether this poor man lived or died I cannot tell but it was reported that he had the plague upon him at that time and perhaps the people might report that to justify their usage of him but it was not unlikely that either he or his goods or both were dangerous when his whole family had been dead of the distempers so little a while before I know that the inhabitants of the towns adjacent to London were much blamed for cruelty to the poor people that ran from the contagion in their distress and many very severe things were done as may be seen from what has been said but I cannot but say also that where there was room for charity and assistance to the people without apparent danger to themselves they were willing enough to help and relieve them But as every town were indeed judges in their own case so the poor people who ran abroad in their extremities were often ill used and driven back again into the town and this caused infinite exclamations and outcries against the country towns and made the clamour very popular And yet more or less with all the caution there was not a town of any note within ten or I believe twenty miles of the city but what was more or less infected and had some died among them I have heard the accounts of several such as they were reckoned up as follows In Enfield thirty two In Uxbridge one hundred seventeen Hornsey fifty eight Hertford ninety Newington seventeen Ware one hundred sixty Tottenham forty two Hodsdon thirty Edmonton nineteen Waltham Abbey twenty three Barnet and Hadly nineteen Epping twenty six saint Albans one hundred twenty one Deptford six hundred twenty three Watford forty five Greenwich two hundred thirty one Eltham and Lusum eighty five Kingston one hundred twenty two Croydon sixty one Stanes eighty two Brentwood seventy Chertsey eighteen Rumford one hundred nine Windsor one hundred three Barking Abbot two hundred Brentford four hundred thirty two Cum aliis Another thing might render the country more strict with respect to the citizens and especially with respect to the poor and this was what I hinted at before namely that there was a seeming propensity or a wicked inclination in those that were infected to infect others There have been great debates among our physicians as to the reason of this Some will have it to be in the nature of the disease and that it impresses every one that is seized upon by it with a kind of a rage and a hatred against their own kind as if there was a malignity not only in the distemper to communicate itself but in the very nature of man prompting him with evil will or an evil eye that as they say in the case of a mad dog who though the gentlest creature before of any of his kind yet then will fly upon and bite any one that comes next him and those as soon as any who had been most observed by him before Others placed it to the account of the corruption of human nature who cannot bear to see itself more miserable than others of its own species and has a kind of involuntary wish that all men were as unhappy or in as bad a condition as itself Others say it was only a kind of desperation not knowing or regarding what they did and consequently unconcerned at the danger or safety not only of anybody near them but even of themselves also And indeed when men are once come to a condition to abandon themselves and be unconcerned for the safety or at the danger of themselves it cannot be so much wondered that they should be careless of the safety of other people But I choose to give this grave debate a quite different turn and answer it or resolve it all by saying that I do not grant the fact On the contrary I say that the thing is not really so but that it was a general complaint raised by the people inhabiting the outlying villages against the citizens to justify or at least excuse those hardships and severities so much talked of and in which complaints both sides may be said to have injured one another that is to say the citizens pressing to be received and harboured in time of distress and with the plague upon them complain of the cruelty and injustice of the country people in being refused entrance and forced back again with their goods and families and the inhabitants finding themselves so imposed upon and the citizens breaking in as it were upon them whether they would or no complain that when they were infected they were not only regardless of others but even willing to infect them neither of which were really true that is to say in the colours they were described in It is true there is something to be said for the frequent alarms which were given to the country of the resolution of the people of London to come out by force not only for relief but to plunder and rob that they ran about the streets with the distemper upon them without any control and that no care was taken to shut up houses and confine the sick people from infecting others whereas to do the Londoners justice they never practised such things except in such particular cases as I have mentioned above and such like On the other hand everything was managed with so much care and such excellent order was observed in the whole city and suburbs by the care of the Lord Mayor and aldermen and by the justices of the peace church wardens c in the outparts that London may be a pattern to all the cities in the world for the good government and the excellent order that was everywhere kept even in the time of the most violent infection and when the people were in the utmost consternation and distress But of this I shall speak by itself One thing it is to be observed was owing principally to the prudence of the magistrates and ought to be mentioned to their honour viz the moderation which they used in the great and difficult work of shutting up of houses It is true as I have mentioned that the shutting up of houses was a great subject of discontent and I may say indeed the only subject of discontent among the people at that time for the confining the sound in the same house with the sick was counted very terrible and the complaints of people so confined were very grievous They were heard into the very streets and they were sometimes such that called for resentment though oftener for compassion They had no way to converse with any of their friends but out at their windows where they would make such piteous lamentations as often moved the hearts of those they talked with and of others who passing by heard their story and as those complaints oftentimes reproached the severity and sometimes the insolence of the watchmen placed at their doors those watchmen would answer saucily enough and perhaps be apt to affront the people who were in the street talking to the said families for which or for their ill treatment of the families I think seven or eight of them in several places were killed I know not whether I should say murdered or not because I cannot enter into the particular cases It is true the watchmen were on their duty and acting in the post where they were placed by a lawful authority and killing any public legal officer in the execution of his office is always in the language of the law called murder But as they were not authorised by the magistrates instructions or by the power they acted under to be injurious or abusive either to the people who were under their observation or to any that concerned themselves for them so when they did so they might be said to act themselves not their office to act as private persons not as persons employed and consequently if they brought mischief upon themselves by such an undue behaviour that mischief was upon their own heads and indeed they had so much the hearty curses of the people whether they deserved it or not that whatever befell them nobody pitied them and everybody was apt to say they deserved it whatever it was Nor do I remember that anybody was ever punished at least to any considerable degree for whatever was done to the watchmen that guarded their houses What variety of stratagems were used to escape and get out of houses thus shut up by which the watchmen were deceived or overpowered and that the people got away I have taken notice of already and shall say no more to that But I say the magistrates did moderate and ease families upon many occasions in this case and particularly in that of taking away or suffering to be removed the sick persons out of such houses when they were willing to be removed either to a pest house or other Places and sometimes giving the well persons in the family so shut up leave to remove upon information given that they were well and that they would confine themselves in such houses where they went so long as should be required of them The concern also of the magistrates for the supplying such poor families as were infected I say supplying them with necessaries as well physic as food was very great and in which they did not content themselves with giving the necessary orders to the officers appointed but the aldermen in person and on horseback frequently rode to such houses and caused the people to be asked at their windows whether they were duly attended or not also whether they wanted anything that was necessary and if the officers had constantly carried their messages and fetched them such things as they wanted or not And if they answered in the affirmative all was well but if they complained that they were ill supplied and that the officer did not do his duty or did not treat them civilly they the officers were generally removed and others placed in their stead It is true such complaint might be unjust and if the officer had such arguments to use as would convince the magistrate that he was right and that the people had injured him he was continued and they reproved But this part could not well bear a particular inquiry for the parties could very ill be well heard and answered in the street from the windows as was the case then The magistrates therefore generally chose to favour the people and remove the man as what seemed to be the least wrong and of the least ill consequence seeing if the watchman was injured yet they could easily make him amends by giving him another post of the like nature but if the family was injured there was no satisfaction could be made to them the damage perhaps being irreparable as it concerned their lives A great variety of these cases frequently happened between the watchmen and the poor people shut up besides those I formerly mentioned about escaping Sometimes the watchmen were absent sometimes drunk sometimes asleep when the people wanted them and such never failed to be punished severely as indeed they deserved But after all that was or could be done in these cases the shutting up of houses so as to confine those that were well with those that were sick had very great inconveniences in it and some that were very tragical and which merited to have been considered if there had been room for it But it was authorised by a law it had the public good in view as the end chiefly aimed at and all the private injuries that were done by the putting it in execution must be put to the account of the public benefit It is doubtful to this day whether in the whole it contributed anything to the stop of the infection and indeed I cannot say it did for nothing could run with greater fury and rage than the infection did when it was in its chief violence though the houses infected were shut up as exactly and as effectually as it was possible Certain it is that if all the infected persons were effectually shut in no sound person could have been infected by them because they could not have come near them But the case was this and I shall only touch it here namely that the infection was propagated insensibly and by such persons as were not visibly infected who neither knew whom they infected or who they were infected by A house in Whitechappel was shut up for the sake of one infected maid who had only spots not the tokens come out upon her and recovered yet these people obtained no liberty to stir neither for air or exercise forty days Want of breath fear anger vexation and all the other gifts attending such an injurious treatment cast the mistress of the family into a fever and visitors came into the house and said it was the plague though the physicians declared it was not However the family were obliged to begin their quarantine anew on the report of the visitors or examiner though their former quarantine wanted but a few days of being finished This oppressed them so with anger and grief and as before straitened them also so much as to room and for want of breathing and free air that most of the family fell sick one of one distemper one of another chiefly scorbutic ailments only one a violent colic till after several prolongings of their confinement some or other of those that came in with the visitors to inspect the persons that were ill in hopes of releasing them brought the distemper with them and infected the whole house and all or most of them died not of the plague as really upon them before but of the plague that those people brought them who should have been careful to have protected them from it And this was a thing which frequently happened and was indeed one of the worst consequences of shutting houses up I had about this time a little hardship put upon me which I was at first greatly afflicted at and very much disturbed about though as it proved it did not expose me to any disaster and this was being appointed by the alderman of Portsoken Ward one of the examiners of the houses in the precinct where I lived We had a large parish and had no less than eighteen examiners as the order called us the people called us visitors I endeavoured with all my might to be excused from such an employment and used many arguments with the alderman s deputy to be excused particularly I alleged that I was against shutting up houses at all and that it would be very hard to oblige me to be an instrument in that which was against my judgement and which I did verily believe would not answer the end it was intended for but all the abatement I could get was only that whereas the officer was appointed by my Lord Mayor to continue two months I should be obliged to hold it but three weeks on condition nevertheless that I could then get some other sufficient housekeeper to serve the rest of the time for me which was in short but a very small favour it being very difficult to get any man to accept of such an employment that was fit to be entrusted with it It is true that shutting up of houses had one effect which I am sensible was of moment namely it confined the distempered people who would otherwise have been both very troublesome and very dangerous in their running about streets with the distemper upon them which when they were delirious they would have done in a most frightful manner and as indeed they began to do at first very much till they were thus restrained nay so very open they were that the poor would go about and beg at people s doors and say they had the plague upon them and beg rags for their sores or both or anything that delirious nature happened to think of A poor unhappy gentlewoman a substantial citizen s wife was if the story be true murdered by one of these creatures in Aldersgate Street or that way He was going along the street raving mad to be sure and singing the people only said he was drunk but he himself said he had the plague upon him which it seems was true and meeting this gentlewoman he would kiss her She was terribly frighted as he was only a rude fellow and she ran from him but the street being very thin of people there was nobody near enough to help her When she saw he would overtake her she turned and gave him a thrust so forcibly he being but weak and pushed him down backward But very unhappily she being so near he caught hold of her and pulled her down also and getting up first mastered her and kissed her and which was worst of all when he had done told her he had the plague and why should not she have it as well as he She was frighted enough before being also young with child but when she heard him say he had the plague she screamed out and fell down into a swoon or in a fit which though she recovered a little yet killed her in a very few days and I never heard whether she had the plague or no Another infected person came and knocked at the door of a citizen s house where they knew him very well the servant let him in and being told the master of the house was above he ran up and came into the room to them as the whole family was at supper They began to rise up a little surprised not knowing what the matter was but he bid them sit still he only came to take his leave of them They asked him Why mister where are you going Going says he I have got the sickness and shall die tomorrow night Tis easy to believe though not to describe the consternation they were all in The women and the man s daughters which were but little girls were frighted almost to death and got up one running out at one door and one at another some downstairs and some upstairs and getting together as well as they could locked themselves into their chambers and screamed out at the window for help as if they had been frighted out of their wits The master more composed than they though both frighted and provoked was going to lay hands on him and throw him downstairs being in a passion but then considering a little the condition of the man and the danger of touching him horror seized his mind and he stood still like one astonished The poor distempered man all this while being as well diseased in his brain as in his body stood still like one amazed At length he turns round Ay says he with all the seeming calmness imaginable is it so with you all Are you all disturbed at me Why then I ll e en go home and die there And so he goes immediately downstairs The servant that had let him in goes down after him with a candle but was afraid to go past him and open the door so he stood on the stairs to see what he would do The man went and opened the door and went out and flung the door after him It was some while before the family recovered the fright but as no ill consequence attended they have had occasion since to speak of it You may be sure with great satisfaction Though the man was gone it was some time nay as I heard some days before they recovered themselves of the hurry they were in nor did they go up and down the house with any assurance till they had burnt a great variety of fumes and perfumes in all the rooms and made a great many smokes of pitch of gunpowder and of sulphur all separately shifted and washed their clothes and the like As to the poor man whether he lived or died I don t remember It is most certain that if by the shutting up of houses the sick had not been confined multitudes who in the height of their fever were delirious and distracted would have been continually running up and down the streets and even as it was a very great number did so and offered all sorts of violence to those they met even just as a mad dog runs on and bites at every one he meets nor can I doubt but that should one of those infected diseased creatures have bitten any man or woman while the frenzy of the distemper was upon them they I mean the person so wounded would as certainly have been incurably infected as one that was sick before and had the tokens upon him I heard of one infected creature who running out of his bed in his shirt in the anguish and agony of his swellings of which he had three upon him got his shoes on and went to put on his coat but the nurse resisting and snatching the coat from him he threw her down ran over her ran downstairs and into the street directly to the Thames in his shirt the nurse running after him and calling to the watch to stop him but the watchman frighted at the man and afraid to touch him let him go on upon which he ran down to the Stillyard stairs threw away his shirt and plunged into the Thames and being a good swimmer swam quite over the river and the tide being coming in as they call it that is running westward he reached the land not till he came about the Falcon stairs where landing and finding no people there it being in the night he ran about the streets there naked as he was for a good while when it being by that time high water he takes the river again and swam back to the Stillyard landed ran up the streets again to his own house knocking at the door went up the stairs and into his bed again and that this terrible experiment cured him of the plague that is to say that the violent motion of his arms and legs stretched the parts where the swellings he had upon him were that is to say under his arms and his groin and caused them to ripen and break and that the cold of the water abated the fever in his blood I have only to add that I do not relate this any more than some of the other as a fact within my own knowledge so as that I can vouch the truth of them and especially that of the man being cured by the extravagant adventure which I confess I do not think very possible but it may serve to confirm the many desperate things which the distressed people falling into deliriums and what we call light headedness were frequently run upon at that time and how infinitely more such there would have been if such people had not been confined by the shutting up of houses and this I take to be the best if not the only good thing which was performed by that severe method On the other hand the complaints and the murmurings were very bitter against the thing itself It would pierce the hearts of all that came by to hear the piteous cries of those infected people who being thus out of their understandings by the violence of their pain or the heat of their blood were either shut in or perhaps tied in their beds and chairs to prevent their doing themselves hurt and who would make a dreadful outcry at their being confined and at their being not permitted to die at large as they called it and as they would have done before This running of distempered people about the streets was very dismal and the magistrates did their utmost to prevent it but as it was generally in the night and always sudden when such attempts were made the officers could not be at hand to prevent it and even when any got out in the day the officers appointed did not care to meddle with them because as they were all grievously infected to be sure when they were come to that height so they were more than ordinarily infectious and it was one of the most dangerous things that could be to touch them On the other hand they generally ran on not knowing what they did till they dropped down stark dead or till they had exhausted their spirits so as that they would fall and then die in perhaps half an hour or an hour and which was most piteous to hear they were sure to come to themselves entirely in that half hour or hour and then to make most grievous and piercing cries and lamentations in the deep afflicting sense of the condition they were in This was much of it before the order for shutting up of houses was strictly put in execution for at first the watchmen were not so vigorous and severe as they were afterward in the keeping the people in that is to say before they were I mean some of them severely punished for their neglect failing in their duty and letting people who were under their care slip away or conniving at their going abroad whether sick or well But after they saw the officers appointed to examine into their conduct were resolved to have them do their duty or be punished for the omission they were more exact and the people were strictly restrained which was a thing they took so ill and bore so impatiently that their discontents can hardly be described But there was an absolute necessity for it that must be confessed unless some other measures had been timely entered upon and it was too late for that Had not this particular of the sick being restrained as above been our case at that time London would have been the most dreadful place that ever was in the world there would for aught I know have as many people died in the streets as died in their houses for when the distemper was at its height it generally made them raving and delirious and when they were so they would never be persuaded to keep in their beds but by force and many who were not tied threw themselves out of windows when they found they could not get leave to go out of their doors It was for want of people conversing one with another in this time of calamity that it was impossible any particular person could come at the knowledge of all the extraordinary cases that occurred in different families and particularly I believe it was never known to this day how many people in their deliriums drowned themselves in the Thames and in the river which runs from the marshes by Hackney which we generally called Ware River or Hackney River As to those which were set down in the weekly bill they were indeed few nor could it be known of any of those whether they drowned themselves by accident or not But I believe I might reckon up more who within the compass of my knowledge or observation really drowned themselves in that year than are put down in the bill of all put together for many of the bodies were never found who yet were known to be lost and the like in other methods of self destruction There was also one man in or about Whitecross Street burned himself to death in his bed some said it was done by himself others that it was by the treachery of the nurse that attended him but that he had the plague upon him was agreed by all It was a merciful disposition of Providence also and which I have many times thought of at that time that no fires or no considerable ones at least happened in the city during that year which if it had been otherwise would have been very dreadful and either the people must have let them alone unquenched or have come together in great crowds and throngs unconcerned at the danger of the infection not concerned at the houses they went into at the goods they handled or at the persons or the people they came among But so it was that excepting that in Cripplegate parish and two or three little eruptions of fires which were presently extinguished there was no disaster of that kind happened in the whole year They told us a story of a house in a place called Swan Alley passing from Goswell Street near the end of Old Street into saint John Street that a family was infected there in so terrible a manner that every one of the house died The last person lay dead on the floor and as it is supposed had lain herself all along to die just before the fire the fire it seems had fallen from its place being of wood and had taken hold of the boards and the joists they lay on and burnt as far as just to the body but had not taken hold of the dead body though she had little more than her shift on and had gone out of itself not burning the rest of the house though it was a slight timber house How true this might be I do not determine but the city being to suffer severely the next year by fire this year it felt very little of that calamity Indeed considering the deliriums which the agony threw people into and how I have mentioned in their madness when they were alone they did many desperate things it was very strange there were no more disasters of that kind It has been frequently asked me and I cannot say that I ever knew how to give a direct answer to it how it came to pass that so many infected people appeared abroad in the streets at the same time that the houses which were infected were so vigilantly searched and all of them shut up and guarded as they were I confess I know not what answer to give to this unless it be this that in so great and populous a city as this is it was impossible to discover every house that was infected as soon as it was so or to shut up all the houses that were infected so that people had the liberty of going about the streets even where they Pleased unless they were known to belong to such and such infected houses It is true that as several physicians told my Lord Mayor the fury of the contagion was such at some particular times and people sickened so fast and died so soon that it was impossible and indeed to no purpose to go about to inquire who was sick and who was well or to shut them up with such exactness as the thing required almost every house in a whole street being infected and in many places every person in some of the houses and that which was still worse by the time that the houses were known to be infected most of the persons infected would be stone dead and the rest run away for fear of being shut up so that it was to very small purpose to call them infected houses and shut them up the infection having ravaged and taken its leave of the house before it was really known that the family was any way touched This might be sufficient to convince any reasonable person that as it was not in the power of the magistrates or of any human methods of policy to prevent the spreading the infection so that this way of shutting up of houses was perfectly insufficient for that end Indeed it seemed to have no manner of public good in it equal or proportionable to the grievous burden that it was to the particular families that were so shut up and as far as I was employed by the public in directing that severity I frequently found occasion to see that it was incapable of answering the end For example as I was desired as a visitor or examiner to inquire into the particulars of several families which were infected we scarce came to any house where the plague had visibly appeared in the family but that some of the family were fled and gone The magistrates would resent this and charge the examiners with being remiss in their examination or inspection But by that means houses were long infected before it was known Now as I was in this dangerous office but half the appointed time which was two months it was long enough to inform myself that we were no way capable of coming at the knowledge of the true state of any family but by inquiring at the door or of the neighbours As for going into every house to search that was a part no authority would offer to impose on the inhabitants or any citizen would undertake for it would have been exposing us to certain infection and death and to the ruin of our own families as well as of ourselves nor would any citizen of probity and that could be depended upon have stayed in the town if they had been made liable to such a severity Seeing then that we could come at the certainty of things by no method but that of inquiry of the neighbours or of the family and on that we could not justly depend it was not possible but that the uncertainty of this matter would remain as above It is true masters of families were bound by the order to give notice to the examiner of the place wherein he lived within two hours after he should discover it of any person being sick in his house that is to say having signs of the infection but they found so many ways to evade this and excuse their negligence that they seldom gave that notice till they had taken measures to have every one escape out of the house who had a mind to escape whether they were sick or sound and while this was so it is easy to see that the shutting up of houses was no way to be depended upon as a sufficient method for putting a stop to the infection because as I have said elsewhere many of those that so went out of those infected houses had the plague really upon them though they might really think themselves sound And some of these were the people that walked the streets till they fell down dead not that they were suddenly struck with the distemper as with a bullet that killed with the stroke but that they really had the infection in their blood long before only that as it preyed secretly on the vitals it appeared not till it seized the heart with a mortal power and the patient died in a moment as with a sudden fainting or an apoplectic fit I know that some even of our physicians thought for a time that those people that so died in the streets were seized but that moment they fell as if they had been touched by a stroke from heaven as men are killed by a flash of lightning but they found reason to alter their opinion afterward for upon examining the bodies of such after they were dead they always either had tokens upon them or other evident proofs of the distemper having been longer upon them than they had otherwise expected This often was the reason that as I have said we that were examiners were not able to come at the knowledge of the infection being entered into a house till it was too late to shut it up and sometimes not till the people that were left were all dead In Petticoat Lane two houses together were infected and several people sick but the distemper was so well concealed the examiner who was my neighbour got no knowledge of it till notice was sent him that the people were all dead and that the carts should call there to fetch them away The two heads of the families concerted their measures and so ordered their matters as that when the examiner was in the neighbourhood they appeared generally at a time and answered that is lied for one another or got some of the neighbourhood to say they were all in health and perhaps knew no better till death making it impossible to keep it any longer as a secret the dead carts were called in the night to both the houses and so it became public But when the examiner ordered the constable to shut up the houses there was nobody left in them but three people two in one house and one in the other just dying and a nurse in each house who acknowledged that they had buried five before that the houses had been infected nine or ten days and that for all the rest of the two families which were many they were gone some sick some well or whether sick or well could not be known In like manner at another house in the same lane a man having his family infected but very unwilling to be shut up when he could conceal it no longer shut up himself that is to say he set the great red cross upon his door with the words Lord have mercy upon us and so deluded the examiner who supposed it had been done by the constable by order of the other examiner for there were two examiners to every district or precinct By this means he had free egress and regress into his house again and out of it as he pleased notwithstanding it was infected till at length his stratagem was found out and then he with the sound part of his servants and family made off and escaped so they were not shut up at all These things made it very hard if not impossible as I have said to prevent the spreading of an infection by the shutting up of houses unless the people would think the shutting of their houses no grievance and be so willing to have it done as that they would give notice duly and faithfully to the magistrates of their being infected as soon as it was known by themselves but as that cannot be expected from them and the examiners cannot be supposed as above to go into their houses to visit and search all the good of shutting up houses will be defeated and few houses will be shut up in time except those of the poor who cannot conceal it and of some people who will be discovered by the terror and consternation which the things put them into I got myself discharged of the dangerous office I was in as soon as I could get another admitted whom I had obtained for a little money to accept of it and so instead of serving the two months which was directed I was not above three weeks in it and a great while too considering it was in the month of August at which time the distemper began to rage with great violence at our end of the town In the execution of this office I could not refrain speaking my opinion among my neighbours as to this shutting up the people in their houses in which we saw most evidently the severities that were used though grievous in themselves had also this particular objection against them namely that they did not answer the end as I have said but that the distempered people went day by day about the streets and it was our united opinion that a method to have removed the sound from the sick in case of a particular house being visited would have been much more reasonable on many accounts leaving nobody with the sick persons but such as should on such occasion request to stay and declare themselves content to be shut up with them Our scheme for removing those that were sound from those that were sick was only in such houses as were infected and confining the sick was no confinement those that could not stir would not complain while they were in their senses and while they had the power of judging Indeed when they came to be delirious and light headed then they would cry out of the cruelty of being confined but for the removal of those that were well we thought it highly reasonable and just for their own sakes they should be removed from the sick and that for other people s safety they should keep retired for a while to see that they were sound and might not infect others and we thought twenty or thirty days enough for this Now certainly if houses had been provided on purpose for those that were sound to perform this demi quarantine in they would have much less reason to think themselves injured in such a restraint than in being confined with infected people in the houses where they lived It is here however to be observed that after the funerals became so many that people could not toll the bell mourn or weep or wear black for one another as they did before no nor so much as make coffins for those that died so after a while the fury of the infection appeared to be so increased that in short they shut up no houses at all It seemed enough that all the remedies of that kind had been used till they were found fruitless and that the plague spread itself with an irresistible fury so that as the fire the succeeding year spread itself and burned with such violence that the citizens in despair gave over their endeavours to extinguish it so in the plague it came at last to such violence that the people sat still looking at one another and seemed quite abandoned to despair whole streets seemed to be desolated and not to be shut up only but to be emptied of their inhabitants doors were left open windows stood shattering with the wind in empty houses for want of people to shut them In a word people began to give up themselves to their fears and to think that all regulations and methods were in vain and that there was nothing to be hoped for but an universal desolation and it was even in the height of this general despair that it Pleased God to stay His hand and to slacken the fury of the contagion in such a manner as was even surprising like its beginning and demonstrated it to be His own particular hand and that above if not without the agency of means as I shall take notice of in its proper place But I must still speak of the plague as in its height raging even to desolation and the people under the most dreadful consternation even as I have said to despair It is hardly credible to what excess the passions of men carried them in this extremity of the distemper and this part I think was as moving as the rest What could affect a man in his full power of reflection and what could make deeper impressions on the soul than to see a man almost naked and got out of his house or perhaps out of his bed into the street come out of Harrow Alley a populous conjunction or collection of alleys courts and passages in the Butcher Row in Whitechappel I say what could be more affecting than to see this poor man come out into the open street run dancing and singing and making a thousand antic gestures with five or six women and children running after him crying and calling upon him for the Lord s sake to come back and entreating the help of others to bring him back but all in vain nobody daring to lay a hand upon him or to come near him This was a most grievous and afflicting thing to me who saw it all from my own windows for all this while the poor afflicted man was as I observed it even then in the utmost agony of pain having as they said two swellings upon him which could not be brought to break or to suppurate but by laying strong caustics on them the surgeons had it seems hopes to break them which caustics were then upon him burning his flesh as with a hot iron I cannot say what became of this poor man but I think he continued roving about in that manner till he fell down and died No wonder the aspect of the city itself was frightful The usual concourse of people in the streets and which used to be supplied from our end of the town was abated The Exchange was not kept shut indeed but it was no more frequented The fires were lost they had been almost extinguished for some days by a very smart and hasty rain But that was not all some of the physicians insisted that they were not only no benefit but injurious to the health of people This they made a loud clamour about and complained to the Lord Mayor about it On the other hand others of the same faculty and eminent too opposed them and gave their reasons why the fires were and must be useful to assuage the violence of the distemper I cannot give a full account of their arguments on both sides only this I remember that they cavilled very much with one another Some were for fires but that they must be made of wood and not coal and of particular sorts of wood too such as fir in particular or cedar because of the strong effluvia of turpentine others were for coal and not wood because of the sulphur and bitumen and others were for neither one or other Upon the whole the Lord Mayor ordered no more fires and especially on this account namely that the plague was so fierce that they saw evidently it defied all means and rather seemed to increase than decrease upon any application to check and abate it and yet this amazement of the magistrates proceeded rather from want of being able to apply any means successfully than from any unwillingness either to expose themselves or undertake the care and weight of business for to do them justice they neither spared their pains nor their persons But nothing answered the infection raged and the people were now frighted and terrified to the last degree so that as I may say they gave themselves up and as I mentioned above abandoned themselves to their despair But let me observe here that when I say the people abandoned themselves to despair I do not mean to what men call a religious despair or a despair of their eternal state but I mean a despair of their being able to escape the infection or to outlive the plague which they saw was so raging and so irresistible in its force that indeed few people that were touched with it in its height about August and September escaped and which is very particular contrary to its ordinary operation in June and July and the beginning of August when as I have observed many were infected and continued so many days and then went off after having had the poison in their blood a long time but now on the contrary most of the people who were taken during the two last weeks in August and in the three first weeks in September generally died in two or three days at furthest and many the very same day they were taken whether the dog days or as our astrologers pretended to express themselves the influence of the dog star had that malignant effect or all those who had the seeds of infection before in them brought it up to a maturity at that time altogether I know not but this was the time when it was reported that above three thousand people died in one night and they that would have us believe they more critically observed it pretend to say that they all died within the space of two hours viz between the hours of one and three in the morning As to the suddenness of people s dying at this time more than before there were innumerable instances of it and I could name several in my neighbourhood One family without the Bars and not far from me were all seemingly well on the Monday being ten in family That evening one maid and one apprentice were taken ill and died the next morning when the other apprentice and two children were touched whereof one died the same evening and the other two on Wednesday In a word by Saturday at noon the master mistress four children and four servants were all gone and the house left entirely empty except an ancient woman who came in to take charge of the goods for the master of the family s brother who lived not far off and who had not been sick Many houses were then left desolate all the people being carried away dead and especially in an alley farther on the same side beyond the Bars going in at the sign of Moses and Aaron there were several houses together which they said had not one person left alive in them and some that died last in several of those houses were left a little too long before they were fetched out to be buried the reason of which was not as some have written very untruly that the living were not sufficient to bury the dead but that the mortality was so great in the yard or alley that there was nobody left to give notice to the buriers or sextons that there were any dead bodies there to be buried It was said how true I know not that some of those bodies were so much corrupted and so rotten that it was with difficulty they were carried and as the carts could not come any nearer than to the Alley Gate in the High Street it was so much the more difficult to bring them along but I am not certain how many bodies were then left I am sure that ordinarily it was not so As I have mentioned how the people were brought into a condition to despair of life and abandon themselves so this very thing had a strange effect among us for three or four weeks that is it made them bold and venturous they were no more shy of one another or restrained within doors but went anywhere and everywhere and began to converse One would say to another I do not ask you how you are or say how I am it is certain we shall all go so tis no matter who is all sick or who is sound and so they ran desperately into any place or any company As it brought the people into public company so it was surprising how it brought them to crowd into the churches They inquired no more into whom they sat near to or far from what offensive smells they met with or what condition the people seemed to be in but looking upon themselves all as so many dead corpses they came to the churches without the least caution and crowded together as if their lives were of no consequence compared to the work which they came about there Indeed the zeal which they showed in coming and the earnestness and affection they showed in their attention to what they heard made it manifest what a value people would all put upon the worship of God if they thought every day they attended at the church that it would be their last Nor was it without other strange effects for it took away all manner of prejudice at or scruple about the person whom they found in the pulpit when they came to the churches It cannot be doubted but that many of the ministers of the parish churches were cut off among others in so common and dreadful a calamity and others had not courage enough to stand it but removed into the country as they found means for escape As then some parish churches were quite vacant and forsaken the people made no scruple of desiring such Dissenters as had been a few years before deprived of their livings by virtue of the Act of Parliament called the Act of Uniformity to preach in the churches nor did the church ministers in that case make any difficulty of accepting their assistance so that many of those whom they called silenced ministers had their mouths opened on this occasion and preached publicly to the people Here we may observe and I hope it will not be amiss to take notice of it that a near view of death would soon reconcile men of good principles one to another and that it is chiefly owing to our easy situation in life and our putting these things far from us that our breaches are fomented ill blood continued prejudices breach of charity and of Christian union so much kept and so far carried on among us as it is Another plague year would reconcile all these differences a close conversing with death or with diseases that threaten death would scum off the gall from our tempers remove the animosities among us and bring us to see with differing eyes than those which we looked on things with before As the people who had been used to join with the Church were reconciled at this time with the admitting the Dissenters to preach to them so the Dissenters who with an uncommon prejudice had broken off from the communion of the Church of England were now content to come to their parish churches and to conform to the worship which they did not approve of before but as the terror of the infection abated those things all returned again to their less desirable channel and to the course they were in before I mention this but historically I have no mind to enter into arguments to move either or both sides to a more charitable compliance one with another I do not see that it is probable such a discourse would be either suitable or successful the breaches seem rather to widen and tend to a widening further than to closing and who am I that I should think myself able to influence either one side or other But this I may repeat again that tis evident death will reconcile us all on the other side the grave we shall be all brethren again In heaven whither I hope we may come from all parties and persuasions we shall find neither prejudice or scruple there we shall be of one principle and of one opinion Why we cannot be content to go hand in hand to the Place where we shall join heart and hand without the least hesitation and with the most complete harmony and affection I say why we cannot do so here I can say nothing to neither shall I say anything more of it but that it remains to be lamented I could dwell a great while upon the calamities of this dreadful time and go on to describe the objects that appeared among us every day the dreadful extravagancies which the distraction of sick people drove them into how the streets began now to be fuller of frightful objects and families to be made even a terror to themselves But after I have told you as I have above that one man being tied in his bed and finding no other way to deliver himself set the bed on fire with his candle which unhappily stood within his reach and burnt himself in his bed and how another by the insufferable torment he bore danced and sung naked in the streets not knowing one ecstasy from another I say after I have mentioned these things what can be added more What can be said to represent the misery of these times more lively to the reader or to give him a more perfect idea of a complicated distress I must acknowledge that this time was terrible that I was sometimes at the end of all my resolutions and that I had not the courage that I had at the beginning As the extremity brought other people abroad it drove me home and except having made my voyage down to Blackwall and Greenwich as I have related which was an excursion I kept afterwards very much within doors as I had for about a fortnight before I have said already that I repented several times that I had ventured to stay in town and had not gone away with my brother and his family but it was too late for that now and after I had retreated and stayed within doors a good while before my impatience led me abroad then they called me as I have said to an ugly and dangerous office which brought me out again but as that was expired while the height of the distemper lasted I retired again and continued close ten or twelve days more during which many dismal spectacles represented themselves in my view out of my own windows and in our own street as that particularly from Harrow Alley of the poor outrageous creature which danced and sung in his agony and many others there were Scarce a day or night passed over but some dismal thing or other happened at the end of that Harrow Alley which was a place full of poor people most of them belonging to the butchers or to employments depending upon the butchery Sometimes heaps and throngs of people would burst out of the alley most of them women making a dreadful clamour mixed or compounded of screeches cryings and calling one another that we could not conceive what to make of it Almost all the dead part of the night the dead cart stood at the end of that alley for if it went in it could not well turn again and could go in but a little way There I say it stood to receive dead bodies and as the churchyard was but a little way off if it went away full it would soon be back again It is impossible to describe the most horrible cries and noise the poor people would make at their bringing the dead bodies of their children and friends out of the cart and by the number one would have thought there had been none left behind or that there were people enough for a small city living in those places Several times they cried Murder sometimes Fire but it was easy to perceive it was all distraction and the complaints of distressed and distempered people I believe it was everywhere thus as that time for the plague raged for six or seven weeks beyond all that I have expressed and came even to such a height that in the extremity they began to break into that excellent order of which I have spoken so much in behalf of the magistrates namely that no dead bodies were seen in the street or burials in the daytime for there was a necessity in this extremity to bear with its being otherwise for a little while One thing I cannot omit here and indeed I thought it was extraordinary at least it seemed a remarkable hand of Divine justice viz that all the predictors astrologers fortune tellers and what they called cunning men conjurers and the like calculators of nativities and dreamers of dream and such people were gone and vanished not one of them was to be found I am verily persuaded that a great number of them fell in the heat of the calamity having ventured to stay upon the prospect of getting great estates and indeed their gain was but too great for a time through the madness and folly of the people But now they were silent many of them went to their long home not able to foretell their own fate or to calculate their own nativities Some have been critical enough to say that every one of them died I dare not affirm that but this I must own that I never heard of one of them that ever appeared after the calamity was over But to return to my particular observations during this dreadful part of the visitation I am now come as I have said to the month of September which was the most dreadful of its kind I believe that ever London saw for by all the accounts which I have seen of the preceding visitations which have been in London nothing has been like it the number in the weekly bill amounting to almost forty thousand from the twenty second of August to the twenty sixth of September being but five weeks The particulars of the bills are as follows viz From August the twenty second to the twenty ninth seven thousand four hundred ninety six twenty ninth fifth September eight thousand two hundred fifty two September the fifth twelfth seven thousand six hundred ninety twelfth nineteenth eight thousand two hundred ninety seven nineteenth twenty sixth six thousand four hundred sixty thirty eight thousand one hundred ninety five This was a prodigious number of itself but if I should add the reasons which I have to believe that this account was deficient and how deficient it was you would with me make no scruple to believe that there died above ten thousand a week for all those weeks one week with another and a proportion for several weeks both before and after The confusion among the people especially within the city at that time was inexpressible The terror was so great at last that the courage of the people appointed to carry away the dead began to fail them nay several of them died although they had the distemper before and were recovered and some of them dropped down when they have been carrying the bodies even at the pit side and just ready to throw them in and this confusion was greater in the city because they had flattered themselves with hopes of escaping and thought the bitterness of death was past One cart they told us going up Shoreditch was forsaken of the drivers or being left to one man to drive he died in the street and the horses going on overthrew the cart and left the bodies some thrown out here some there in a dismal manner Another cart was it seems found in the great pit in Finsbury Fields the driver being dead or having been gone and abandoned it and the horses running too near it the cart fell in and drew the horses in also It was suggested that the driver was thrown in with it and that the cart fell upon him by reason his whip was seen to be in the pit among the bodies but that I suppose could not be certain In our parish of Aldgate the dead carts were several times as I have heard found standing at the churchyard gate full of dead bodies but neither bellman or driver or any one else with it neither in these or many other cases did they know what bodies they had in their cart for sometimes they were let down with ropes out of balconies and out of windows and sometimes the bearers brought them to the cart sometimes other people nor as the men themselves said did they trouble themselves to keep any account of the numbers The vigilance of the magistrates was now put to the utmost trial and it must be confessed can never be enough acknowledged on this occasion also whatever expense or trouble they were at two things were never neglected in the city or suburbs either one Provisions were always to be had in full plenty and the price not much raised neither hardly worth speaking two No dead bodies lay unburied or uncovered and if one walked from one end of the city to another no funeral or sign of it was to be seen in the daytime except a little as I have said above in the three first weeks in September This last article perhaps will hardly be believed when some accounts which others have published since that shall be seen wherein they say that the dead lay unburied which I am assured was utterly false at least if it had been anywhere so it must have been in houses where the living were gone from the dead having found means as I have observed to escape and where no notice was given to the officers All which amounts to nothing at all in the case in hand for this I am positive in having myself been employed a little in the direction of that part in the parish in which I lived and where as great a desolation was made in proportion to the number of inhabitants as was anywhere I say I am sure that there were no dead bodies remained unburied that is to say none that the proper officers knew of none for want of people to carry them off and buriers to put them into the ground and cover them and this is sufficient to the argument for what might lie in houses and holes as in Moses and Aaron Alley is nothing for it is most certain they were buried as soon as they were found As to the first article namely of provisions the scarcity or dearness though I have mentioned it before and shall speak of it again yet I must observe here one The price of bread in particular was not much raised for in the beginning of the year viz in the first week in March the penny wheaten loaf was ten ounces and a half and in the height of the contagion it was to be had at nine ounces and a half and never dearer no not all that season And about the beginning of November it was sold ten ounces and a half again the like of which I believe was never heard of in any city under so dreadful a visitation before two Neither was there which I wondered much at any want of bakers or ovens kept open to supply the people with the bread but this was indeed alleged by some families viz that their maidservants going to the bakehouses with their dough to be baked which was then the custom sometimes came home with the sickness that is to say the plague upon them In all this dreadful visitation there were as I have said before but two pest houses made use of viz one in the fields beyond Old Street and one in Westminster neither was there any compulsion used in carrying people thither Indeed there was no need of compulsion in the case for there were thousands of poor distressed people who having no help or conveniences or supplies but of charity would have been very glad to have been carried thither and been taken care of which indeed was the only thing that I think was wanting in the whole public management of the city seeing nobody was here allowed to be brought to the pest house but where money was given or security for money either at their introducing or upon their being cured and sent out for very many were sent out again whole and very good physicians were appointed to those places so that many people did very well there of which I shall make mention again The principal sort of people sent thither were as I have said servants who got the distemper by going on errands to fetch necessaries to the families where they lived and who in that case if they came home sick were removed to preserve the rest of the house and they were so well looked after there in all the time of the visitation that there was but one hundred fifty six buried in all at the London pest house and one hundred fifty nine at that of Westminster By having more pest houses I am far from meaning a forcing all people into such places Had the shutting up of houses been omitted and the sick hurried out of their dwellings to pest houses as some proposed it seems at that time as well as since it would certainly have been much worse than it was The very removing the sick would have been a spreading of the infection and rather because that removing could not effectually clear the house where the sick person was of the distemper and the rest of the family being then left at liberty would certainly spread it among others The methods also in private families which would have been universally used to have concealed the distemper and to have concealed the persons being sick would have been such that the distemper would sometimes have seized a whole family before any visitors or examiners could have known of it On the other hand the prodigious numbers which would have been sick at a time would have exceeded all the capacity of public pest houses to receive them or of public officers to discover and remove them This was well considered in those days and I have heard them talk of it often The magistrates had enough to do to bring people to submit to having their houses shut up and many ways they deceived the watchmen and got out as I have observed But that difficulty made it apparent that they would have found it impracticable to have gone the other way to work for they could never have forced the sick people out of their beds and out of their dwellings It must not have been my Lord Mayor s officers but an army of officers that must have attempted it and the people on the other hand would have been enraged and desperate and would have killed those that should have offered to have meddled with them or with their children and relations whatever had befallen them for it so that they would have made the people who as it was were in the most terrible distraction imaginable I say they would have made them stark mad whereas the magistrates found it proper on several accounts to treat them with lenity and compassion and not with violence and terror such as dragging the sick out of their houses or obliging them to remove themselves would have been This leads me again to mention the time when the plague first began that is to say when it became certain that it would spread over the whole town when as I have said the better sort of people first took the alarm and began to hurry themselves out of town It was true as I observed in its place that the throng was so great and the coaches horses waggons and carts were so many driving and dragging the people away that it looked as if all the city was running away and had any regulations been published that had been terrifying at that time especially such as would pretend to dispose of the people otherwise than they would dispose of themselves it would have put both the city and suburbs into the utmost confusion But the magistrates wisely caused the people to be encouraged made very good bye laws for the regulating the citizens keeping good order in the streets and making everything as eligible as possible to all sorts of people In the first place the Lord Mayor and the sheriffs the Court of Aldermen and a certain number of the Common Council men or their deputies came to a resolution and published it viz that they would not quit the city themselves but that they would be always at hand for the preserving good order in every place and for the doing justice on all occasions as also for the distributing the public charity to the poor and in a word for the doing the duty and discharging the trust reposed in them by the citizens to the utmost of their power In pursuance of these orders the Lord Mayor sheriffs c held councils every day more or less for making such dispositions as they found needful for preserving the civil peace and though they used the people with all possible gentleness and clemency yet all manner of presumptuous rogues such as thieves housebreakers plunderers of the dead or of the sick were duly punished and several declarations were continually published by the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen against such Also all constables and churchwardens were enjoined to stay in the city upon severe penalties or to depute such able and sufficient housekeepers as the deputy aldermen or Common Council men of the precinct should approve and for whom they should give security and also security in case of mortality that they would forthwith constitute other constables in their stead These things re established the minds of the people very much especially in the first of their fright when they talked of making so universal a flight that the city would have been in danger of being entirely deserted of its inhabitants except the poor and the country of being plundered and laid waste by the multitude Nor were the magistrates deficient in performing their part as boldly as they promised it for my Lord Mayor and the sheriffs were continually in the streets and at places of the greatest danger and though they did not care for having too great a resort of people crowding about them yet in emergent cases they never denied the people access to them and heard with patience all their grievances and complaints My Lord Mayor had a low gallery built on purpose in his hall where he stood a little removed from the crowd when any complaint came to be heard that he might appear with as much safety as possible Likewise the proper officers called my Lord Mayor s officers constantly attended in their turns as they were in waiting and if any of them were sick or infected as some of them were others were instantly employed to fill up and officiate in their places till it was known whether the other should live or die In like manner the sheriffs and aldermen did in their several stations and wards where they were placed by office and the sheriff s officers or sergeants were appointed to receive orders from the respective aldermen in their turn so that justice was executed in all cases without interruption In the next place it was one of their particular cares to see the orders for the freedom of the markets observed and in this part either the Lord Mayor or one or both of the sheriffs were every market day on horseback to see their orders executed and to see that the country people had all possible encouragement and freedom in their coming to the markets and going back again and that no nuisances or frightful objects should be seen in the streets to terrify them or make them unwilling to come Also the bakers were taken under particular order and the Master of the Bakers Company was with his court of assistants directed to see the order of my Lord Mayor for their regulation put in execution and the due assize of bread which was weekly appointed by my Lord Mayor observed and all the bakers were obliged to keep their oven going constantly on pain of losing the privileges of a freeman of the city of London By this means bread was always to be had in plenty and as cheap as usual as I said above and provisions were never wanting in the markets even to such a degree that I often wondered at it and reproached myself with being so timorous and cautious in stirring abroad when the country people came freely and boldly to market as if there had been no manner of infection in the city or danger of catching it It was indeed one admirable piece of conduct in the said magistrates that the streets were kept constantly clear and free from all manner of frightful objects dead bodies or any such things as were indecent or unpleasant unless where anybody fell down suddenly or died in the streets as I have said above and these were generally covered with some cloth or blanket or removed into the next churchyard till night All the needful works that carried terror with them that were both dismal and dangerous were done in the night if any diseased bodies were removed or dead bodies buried or infected clothes burnt it was done in the night and all the bodies which were thrown into the great pits in the several churchyards or burying grounds as has been observed were so removed in the night and everything was covered and closed before day So that in the daytime there was not the least signal of the calamity to be seen or heard of except what was to be observed from the emptiness of the streets and sometimes from the passionate outcries and lamentations of the people out at their windows and from the numbers of houses and shops shut up Nor was the silence and emptiness of the streets so much in the city as in the out parts except just at one particular time when as I have mentioned the plague came east and spread over all the city It was indeed a merciful disposition of God that as the plague began at one end of the town first as has been observed at large so it proceeded progressively to other parts and did not come on this way or eastward till it had spent its fury in the West part of the town and so as it came on one way it abated another For example it began at saint Giles s and the Westminster end of the town and it was in its height in all that part by about the middle of July viz in saint Giles in the Fields saint Andrew s Holborn saint Clement Danes saint Martin in the Fields and in Westminster The latter end of July it decreased in those parishes and coming east it increased prodigiously in Cripplegate saint Sepulcher s saint James s Clarkenwell and saint Bride s and Aldersgate While it was in all these parishes the city and all the parishes of the Southwark side of the water and all Stepney Whitechappel Aldgate Wapping and Ratcliff were very little touched so that people went about their business unconcerned carried on their trades kept open their shops and conversed freely with one another in all the city the east and north east suburbs and in Southwark almost as if the plague had not been among us Even when the north and north west suburbs were fully infected viz Cripplegate Clarkenwell Bishopsgate and Shoreditch yet still all the rest were tolerably well For example from twenty fifth July to first August the bill stood thus of all diseases saint Giles Cripplegate five hundred fifty four saint Sepulchers two hundred fifty Clarkenwell one hundred three Bishopsgate one hundred sixteen Shoreditch one hundred ten Stepney parish one hundred twenty seven Aldgate ninety two Whitechappel one hundred four All the ninety seven parishes within the walls two hundred twenty eight All the parishes in Southwark two hundred five Total eighteen eighty nine So that in short there died more that week in the two parishes of Cripplegate and saint Sepulcher by forty eight than in all the city all the east suburbs and all the Southwark parishes put together This caused the reputation of the city s health to continue all over England and especially in the counties and markets adjacent from whence our supply of provisions chiefly came even much longer than that health itself continued for when the people came into the streets from the country by Shoreditch and Bishopsgate or by Old Street and Smithfield they would see the out streets empty and the houses and shops shut and the few people that were stirring there walk in the middle of the streets But when they came within the city there things looked better and the markets and shops were open and the people walking about the streets as usual though not quite so many and this continued till the latter end of August and the beginning of September But then the case altered quite the distemper abated in the west and north west parishes and the weight of the infection lay on the city and the eastern suburbs and the Southwark side and this in a frightful manner Then indeed the city began to look dismal shops to be shut and the streets desolate In the High Street indeed necessity made people stir abroad on many occasions and there would be in the middle of the day a pretty many people but in the mornings and evenings scarce any to be seen even there no not in Cornhill and Cheapside These observations of mine were abundantly confirmed by the weekly bills of mortality for those weeks an abstract of which as they respect the parishes which I have mentioned and as they make the calculations I speak of very evident take as follows The weekly bill which makes out this decrease of the burials in the west and north side of the city stands thus From the twelfth of September to the nineteenth saint Giles Cripplegate four hundred fifty six saint Giles in the Fields one hundred forty Clarkenwell seventy seven saint Sepulcher two hundred fourteen saint Leonard Shoreditch one hundred eighty three Stepney parish seven hundred sixteen Aldgate six hundred twenty three Whitechappel five hundred thirty two In the ninety seven parishes within the walls fourteen ninety three In the eight parishes on Southwark side sixteen thirty six Total six thousand sixty Here is a strange change of things indeed and a sad change it was and had it held for two months more than it did very few people would have been left alive But then such I say was the merciful disposition of God that when it was thus the west and north part which had been so dreadfully visited at first grew as you see much better and as the people disappeared here they began to look abroad again there and the next week or two altered it still more that is more to the encouragement of the other part of the town For example From the nineteenth of September to the twenty sixth saint Giles Cripplegate two hundred seventy seven saint Giles in the Fields one hundred nineteen Clarkenwell seventy six saint Sepulchers one hundred ninety three saint Leonard Shoreditch one hundred forty six Stepney parish six hundred sixteen Aldgate four hundred ninety six Whitechappel three hundred forty six In the ninety seven parishes within the walls twelve sixty eight In the eight parishes on Southwark side thirteen ninety Total four thousand nine hundred twenty seven From the twenty sixth of September to the third of October saint Giles Cripplegate one hundred ninety six saint Giles in the Fields ninety five Clarkenwell forty eight saint Sepulchers one hundred thirty seven saint Leonard Shoreditch one hundred twenty eight Stepney parish six hundred seventy four Aldgate three hundred seventy two Whitechappel three hundred twenty eight In the ninety seven parishes within the walls eleven forty nine In the eight parishes on Southwark side twelve oh one Total four thousand three hundred eighty two And now the misery of the city and of the said east and south parts was complete indeed for as you see the weight of the distemper lay upon those parts that is to say the city the eight parishes over the river with the parishes of Aldgate Whitechappel and Stepney and this was the time that the bills came up to such a monstrous height as that I mentioned before and that eight or nine and as I believe ten or twelve thousand a week died for it is my settled opinion that they never could come at any just account of the numbers for the reasons which I have given already Nay one of the most eminent physicians who has since published in Latin an account of those times and of his observations says that in one week there died twelve thousand people and that particularly there died four thousand in one night though I do not remember that there ever was any such particular night so remarkably fatal as that such a number died in it However all this confirms what I have said above of the uncertainty of the bills of mortality c of which I shall say more hereafter And here let me take leave to enter again though it may seem a repetition of circumstances into a description of the miserable condition of the city itself and of those parts where I lived at this particular time The city and those other parts notwithstanding the great numbers of people that were gone into the country was vastly full of people and perhaps the fuller because people had for a long time a strong belief that the plague would not come into the city nor into Southwark no nor into Wapping or Ratcliff at all nay such was the assurance of the people on that head that many removed from the suburbs on the west and north sides into those eastern and south sides as for safety and as I verily believe carried the plague amongst them there perhaps sooner than they would otherwise have had it Here also I ought to leave a further remark for the use of posterity concerning the manner of people s infecting one another namely that it was not the sick people only from whom the plague was immediately received by others that were sound but the well To explain myself by the sick people I mean those who were known to be sick had taken their beds had been under cure or had swellings and tumours upon them and the like these everybody could beware of they were either in their beds or in such condition as could not be concealed By the well I mean such as had received the contagion and had it really upon them and in their blood yet did not show the consequences of it in their countenances nay even were not sensible of it themselves as many were not for several days These breathed death in every place and upon everybody who came near them nay their very clothes retained the infection their hands would infect the things they touched especially if they were warm and sweaty and they were generally apt to sweat too Now it was impossible to know these people nor did they sometimes as I have said know themselves to be infected These were the people that so often dropped down and fainted in the streets for oftentimes they would go about the streets to the last till on a sudden they would sweat grow faint sit down at a door and die It is true finding themselves thus they would struggle hard to get home to their own doors or at other times would be just able to go into their houses and die instantly other times they would go about till they had the very tokens come out upon them and yet not know it and would die in an hour or two after they came home but be well as long as they were abroad These were the dangerous people these were the people of whom the well people ought to have been afraid but then on the other side it was impossible to know them And this is the reason why it is impossible in a visitation to prevent the spreading of the plague by the utmost human vigilance viz that it is impossible to know the infected people from the sound or that the infected people should perfectly know themselves I knew a man who conversed freely in London all the season of the plague in sixteen sixty five and kept about him an antidote or cordial on purpose to take when he thought himself in any danger and he had such a rule to know or have warning of the danger by as indeed I never met with before or since How far it may be depended on I know not He had a wound in his leg and whenever he came among any people that were not sound and the infection began to affect him he said he could know it by that signal viz that his wound in his leg would smart and look pale and white so as soon as ever he felt it smart it was time for him to withdraw or to take care of himself taking his drink which he always carried about him for that purpose Now it seems he found his wound would smart many times when he was in company with such who thought themselves to be sound and who appeared so to one another but he would presently rise up and say publicly Friends here is somebody in the room that has the plague and so would immediately break up the company This was indeed a faithful monitor to all people that the plague is not to be avoided by those that converse promiscuously in a town infected and people have it when they know it not and that they likewise give it to others when they know not that they have it themselves and in this case shutting up the well or removing the sick will not do it unless they can go back and shut up all those that the sick had conversed with even before they knew themselves to be sick and none knows how far to carry that back or where to stop for none knows when or where or how they may have received the infection or from whom This I take to be the reason which makes so many people talk of the air being corrupted and infected and that they need not be cautious of whom they converse with for that the contagion was in the air I have seen them in strange agitations and surprises on this account I have never come near any infected body says the disturbed person I have conversed with none but sound healthy people and yet I have gotten the distemper I am sure I am struck from Heaven says another and he falls to the serious part Again the first goes on exclaiming I have come near no infection or any infected person I am sure it is the air We draw in death when we breathe and therefore tis the hand of God there is no withstanding it And this at last made many people being hardened to the danger grow less concerned at it and less cautious towards the latter end of the time and when it was come to its height than they were at first Then with a kind of a Turkish predestinarianism they would say if it pleased God to strike them it was all one whether they went abroad or stayed at home they could not escape it and therefore they went boldly about even into infected houses and infected company visited sick people and in short lay in the beds with their wives or relations when they were infected And what was the consequence but the same that is the consequence in Turkey and in those countries where they do those things namely that they were infected too and died by hundreds and thousands I would be far from lessening the awe of the judgements of God and the reverence to His providence which ought always to be on our minds on such occasions as these Doubtless the visitation itself is a stroke from Heaven upon a city or country or nation where it falls a messenger of His vengeance and a loud call to that nation or country or city to humiliation and repentance according to that of the prophet Jeremiah xviii seven eight At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and to destroy it if that nation against whom I have pronounced turn from their evil I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them Now to prompt due impressions of the awe of God on the minds of men on such occasions and not to lessen them it is that I have left those minutes upon record I say therefore I reflect upon no man for putting the reason of those things upon the immediate hand of God and the appointment and direction of His providence nay on the contrary there were many wonderful deliverances of persons from infection and deliverances of persons when infected which intimate singular and remarkable providence in the particular instances to which they refer and I esteem my own deliverance to be one next to miraculous and do record it with thankfulness But when I am speaking of the plague as a distemper arising from natural causes we must consider it as it was really propagated by natural means nor is it at all the less a judgement for its being under the conduct of human causes and effects for as the Divine Power has formed the whole scheme of nature and maintains nature in its course so the same Power thinks fit to let His own actings with men whether of mercy or judgement to go on in the ordinary course of natural causes and He is pleased to act by those natural causes as the ordinary means excepting and reserving to Himself nevertheless a power to act in a supernatural way when He sees occasion Now tis evident that in the case of an infection there is no apparent extraordinary occasion for supernatural operation but the ordinary course of things appears sufficiently armed and made capable of all the effects that Heaven usually directs by a contagion Among these causes and effects this of the secret conveyance of infection imperceptible and unavoidable is more than sufficient to execute the fierceness of Divine vengeance without putting it upon supernaturals and miracle The acute penetrating nature of the disease itself was such and the infection was received so imperceptibly that the most exact caution could not secure us while in the place But I must be allowed to believe and I have so many examples fresh in my memory to convince me of it that I think none can resist their evidence I say I must be allowed to believe that no one in this whole nation ever received the sickness or infection but who received it in the ordinary way of infection from somebody or the clothes or touch or stench of somebody that was infected before The manner of its coming first to London proves this also viz by goods brought over from Holland and brought thither from the Levant the first breaking of it out in a house in Long Acre where those goods were carried and first opened its spreading from that house to other houses by the visible unwary conversing with those who were sick and the infecting the parish officers who were employed about the persons dead and the like These are known authorities for this great foundation point that it went on and proceeded from person to person and from house to house and no otherwise In the first house that was infected there died four persons A neighbour hearing the mistress of the first house was sick went to visit her and went home and gave the distemper to her family and died and all her household A minister called to pray with the first sick person in the second house was said to sicken immediately and die with several more in his house Then the physicians began to consider for they did not at first dream of a general contagion But the physicians being sent to inspect the bodies they assured the people that it was neither more or less than the plague with all its terrifying particulars and that it threatened an universal infection so many people having already conversed with the sick or distempered and having as might be supposed received infection from them that it would be impossible to put a stop to it Here the opinion of the physicians agreed with my observation afterwards namely that the danger was spreading insensibly for the sick could infect none but those that came within reach of the sick person but that one man who may have really received the infection and knows it not but goes abroad and about as a sound person may give the plague to a thousand people and they to greater numbers in proportion and neither the person giving the infection or the persons receiving it know anything of it and perhaps not feel the effects of it for several days after For example many persons in the time of this visitation never perceived that they were infected till they found to their unspeakable surprise the tokens come out upon them after which they seldom lived six hours for those spots they called the tokens were really gangrene spots or mortified flesh in small knobs as broad as a little silver penny and hard as a piece of callus or horn so that when the disease was come up to that length there was nothing could follow but certain death and yet as I said they knew nothing of their being infected nor found themselves so much as out of order till those mortal marks were upon them But everybody must allow that they were infected in a high degree before and must have been so some time and consequently their breath their sweat their very clothes were contagious for many days before This occasioned a vast variety of cases which physicians would have much more opportunity to remember than I but some came within the compass of my observation or hearing of which I shall name a few A certain citizen who had lived safe and untouched till the month of September when the weight of the distemper lay more in the city than it had done before was mighty cheerful and something too bold as I think it was in his talk of how secure he was how cautious he had been and how he had never come near any sick body Says another citizen a neighbour of his to him one day Do not be too confident mister it is hard to say who is sick and who is well for we see men alive and well to outward appearance one hour and dead the next That is true says the first man for he was not a man presumptuously secure but had escaped a long while and men as I said above especially in the city began to be over easy upon that score That is true says he I do not think myself secure but I hope I have not been in company with any person that there has been any danger in No says his neighbour Was not you at the Bull Head Tavern in Gracechurch Street with mister the night before last Yes says the first I was but there was nobody there that we had any reason to think dangerous Upon which his neighbour said no more being unwilling to surprise him but this made him more inquisitive and as his neighbour appeared backward he was the more impatient and in a kind of warmth says he aloud Why he is not dead is he Upon which his neighbour still was silent but cast up his eyes and said something to himself at which the first citizen turned pale and said no more but this Then I am a dead man too and went home immediately and sent for a neighbouring apothecary to give him something preventive for he had not yet found himself ill but the apothecary opening his breast fetched a sigh and said no more but this Look up to God and the man died in a few hours Now let any man judge from a case like this if it is possible for the regulations of magistrates either by shutting up the sick or removing them to stop an infection which spreads itself from man to man even while they are perfectly well and insensible of its approach and may be so for many days It may be proper to ask here how long it may be supposed men might have the seeds of the contagion in them before it discovered itself in this fatal manner and how long they might go about seemingly whole and yet be contagious to all those that came near them I believe the most experienced physicians cannot answer this question directly any more than I can and something an ordinary observer may take notice of which may pass their observations The opinion of physicians abroad seems to be that it may lie dormant in the spirits or in the blood vessels a very considerable time Why else do they exact a quarantine of those who came into their harbours and ports from suspected places Forty days is one would think too long for nature to struggle with such an enemy as this and not conquer it or yield to it But I could not think by my own observation that they can be infected so as to be contagious to others above fifteen or sixteen days at furthest and on that score it was that when a house was shut up in the city and any one had died of the plague but nobody appeared to be ill in the family for sixteen or eighteen days after they were not so strict but that they would connive at their going privately abroad nor would people be much afraid of them afterward but rather think they were fortified the better having not been vulnerable when the enemy was in their own house but we sometimes found it had lain much longer concealed Upon the foot of all these observations I must say that though Providence seemed to direct my conduct to be otherwise yet it is my opinion and I must leave it as a prescription viz that the best physic against the plague is to run away from it I know people encourage themselves by saying God is able to keep us in the midst of danger and able to overtake us when we think ourselves out of danger and this kept thousands in the town whose carcases went into the great pits by cartloads and who if they had fled from the danger had I believe been safe from the disaster at least tis probable they had been safe And were this very fundamental only duly considered by the people on any future occasion of this or the like nature I am persuaded it would put them upon quite different measures for managing the people from those that they took in sixteen sixty five or than any that have been taken abroad that I have heard of In a word they would consider of separating the people into smaller bodies and removing them in time farther from one another and not let such a contagion as this which is indeed chiefly dangerous to collected bodies of people find a million of people in a body together as was very near the case before and would certainly be the case if it should ever appear again The plague like a great fire if a few houses only are contiguous where it happens can only burn a few houses or if it begins in a single or as we call it a lone house can only burn that lone house where it begins But if it begins in a close built town or city and gets a head there its fury increases it rages over the whole place and consumes all it can reach I could propose many schemes on the foot of which the government of this city if ever they should be under the apprehensions of such another enemy God forbid they should might ease themselves of the greatest part of the dangerous people that belong to them I mean such as the begging starving labouring poor and among them chiefly those who in case of a siege are called the useless mouths who being then prudently and to their own advantage disposed of and the wealthy inhabitants disposing of themselves and of their servants and children the city and its adjacent parts would be so effectually evacuated that there would not be above a tenth part of its people left together for the disease to take hold upon But suppose them to be a fifth part and that two hundred and fifty thousand people were left and if it did seize upon them they would by their living so much at large be much better prepared to defend themselves against the infection and be less liable to the effects of it than if the same number of people lived close together in one smaller city such as Dublin or Amsterdam or the like It is true hundreds yea thousands of families fled away at this last plague but then of them many fled too late and not only died in their flight but carried the distemper with them into the countries where they went and infected those whom they went among for safety which confounded the thing and made that be a propagation of the distemper which was the best means to prevent it and this too is an evidence of it and brings me back to what I only hinted at before but must speak more fully to here namely that men went about apparently well many days after they had the taint of the disease in their vitals and after their spirits were so seized as that they could never escape it and that all the while they did so they were dangerous to others I say this proves that so it was for such people infected the very towns they went through as well as the families they went among and it was by that means that almost all the great towns in England had the distemper among them more or less and always they would tell you such a Londoner or such a Londoner brought it down It must not be omitted that when I speak of those people who were really thus dangerous I suppose them to be utterly ignorant of their own conditions for if they really knew their circumstances to be such as indeed they were they must have been a kind of wilful murtherers if they would have gone abroad among healthy people and it would have verified indeed the suggestion which I mentioned above and which I thought seemed untrue viz that the infected people were utterly careless as to giving the infection to others and rather forward to do it than not and I believe it was partly from this very thing that they raised that suggestion which I hope was not really true in fact I confess no particular case is sufficient to prove a general but I could name several people within the knowledge of some of their neighbours and families yet living who showed the contrary to an extreme One man a master of a family in my neighbourhood having had the distemper he thought he had it given him by a poor workman whom he employed and whom he went to his house to see or went for some work that he wanted to have finished and he had some apprehensions even while he was at the poor workman s door but did not discover it fully but the next day it discovered itself and he was taken very in upon which he immediately caused himself to be carried into an outbuilding which he had in his yard and where there was a chamber over a workhouse the man being a brazier Here he lay and here he died and would be tended by none of his neighbours but by a nurse from abroad and would not suffer his wife nor children nor servants to come up into the room lest they should be infected but sent them his blessing and prayers for them by the nurse who spoke it to them at a distance and all this for fear of giving them the distemper and without which he knew as they were kept up they could not have it And here I must observe also that the plague as I suppose all distempers do operated in a different manner on differing constitutions some were immediately overwhelmed with it and it came to violent fevers vomitings insufferable headaches pains in the back and so up to ravings and ragings with those pains others with swellings and tumours in the neck or groin or armpits which till they could be broke put them into insufferable agonies and torment while others as I have observed were silently infected the fever preying upon their spirits insensibly and they seeing little of it till they fell into swooning and faintings and death without pain I am not physician enough to enter into the particular reasons and manner of these differing effects of one and the same distemper and of its differing operation in several bodies nor is it my business here to record the observations which I really made because the doctors themselves have done that part much more effectually than I can do and because my opinion may in some things differ from theirs I am only relating what I know or have heard or believe of the particular cases and what fell within the compass of my view and the different nature of the infection as it appeared in the particular cases which I have related but this may be added too that though the former sort of those cases namely those openly visited were the worst for themselves as to pain I mean those that had such fevers vomitings headaches pains and swellings because they died in such a dreadful manner yet the latter had the worst state of the disease for in the former they frequently recovered especially if the swellings broke but the latter was inevitable death no cure no help could be possible nothing could follow but death And it was worse also to others because as above it secretly and unperceived by others or by themselves communicated death to those they conversed with the penetrating poison insinuating itself into their blood in a manner which it is impossible to describe or indeed conceive This infecting and being infected without so much as its being known to either person is evident from two sorts of cases which frequently happened at that time and there is hardly anybody living who was in London during the infection but must have known several of the cases of both sorts one Fathers and mothers have gone about as if they had been well and have believed themselves to be so till they have insensibly infected and been the destruction of their whole families which they would have been far from doing if they had the least apprehensions of their being unsound and dangerous themselves A family whose story I have heard was thus infected by the father and the distemper began to appear upon some of them even before he found it upon himself But searching more narrowly it appeared he had been affected some time and as soon as he found that his family had been poisoned by himself he went distracted and would have laid violent hands upon himself but was kept from that by those who looked to him and in a few days died two The other particular is that many people having been well to the best of their own judgement or by the best observation which they could make of themselves for several days and only finding a decay of appetite or a light sickness upon their stomachs nay some whose appetite has been strong and even craving and only a light pain in their heads have sent for physicians to know what ailed them and have been found to their great surprise at the brink of death the tokens upon them or the plague grown up to an incurable height It was very sad to reflect how such a person as this last mentioned above had been a walking destroyer perhaps for a week or a fortnight before that how he had ruined those that he would have hazarded his life to save and had been breathing death upon them even perhaps in his tender kissing and embracings of his own children Yet thus certainly it was and often has been and I could give many particular cases where it has been so If then the blow is thus insensibly striking if the arrow flies thus unseen and cannot be discovered to what purpose are all the schemes for shutting up or removing the sick people Those schemes cannot take place but upon those that appear to be sick or to be infected whereas there are among them at the same time thousands of people who seem to be well but are all that while carrying death with them into all companies which they come into This frequently puzzled our physicians and especially the apothecaries and surgeons who knew not how to discover the sick from the sound they all allowed that it was really so that many people had the plague in their very blood and preying upon their spirits and were in themselves but walking putrefied carcases whose breath was infectious and their sweat poison and yet were as well to look on as other people and even knew it not themselves I say they all allowed that it was really true in fact but they knew not how to propose a discovery My friend doctor Heath was of opinion that it might be known by the smell of their breath but then as he said who durst smell to that breath for his information since to know it he must draw the stench of the plague up into his own brain in order to distinguish the smell I have heard it was the opinion of others that it might be distinguished by the party s breathing upon a piece of glass where the breath condensing there might living creatures be seen by a microscope of strange monstrous and frightful shapes such as dragons snakes serpents and devils horrible to behold But this I very much question the truth of and we had no microscopes at that time as I remember to make the experiment with It was the opinion also of another learned man that the breath of such a person would poison and instantly kill a bird not only a small bird but even a cock or hen and that if it did not immediately kill the latter it would cause them to be roupy as they call it particularly that if they had laid any eggs at any time they would be all rotten But those are opinions which I never found supported by any experiments or heard of others that had seen it so I leave them as I find them only with this remark namely that I think the probabilities are very strong for them Some have proposed that such persons should breathe hard upon warm water and that they would leave an unusual scum upon it or upon several other things especially such as are of a glutinous substance and are apt to receive a scum and support it But from the whole I found that the nature of this contagion was such that it was impossible to discover it at all or to prevent its spreading from one to another by any human skill Here was indeed one difficulty which I could never thoroughly get over to this time and which there is but one way of answering that I know of and it is this viz the first person that died of the plague was on December twenty or thereabouts sixteen sixty four and in or about long Acre whence the first person had the infection was generally said to be from a parcel of silks imported from Holland and first opened in that house But after this we heard no more of any person dying of the plague or of the distemper being in that place till the ninth of February which was about seven weeks after and then one more was buried out of the same house Then it was hushed and we were perfectly easy as to the public for a great while for there were no more entered in the weekly bill to be dead of the plague till the twenty second of April when there was two more buried not out of the same house but out of the same street and as near as I can remember it was out of the next house to the first This was nine weeks asunder and after this we had no more till a fortnight and then it broke out in several streets and spread every way Now the question seems to lie thus Where lay the seeds of the infection all this while How came it to stop so long and not stop any longer Either the distemper did not come immediately by contagion from body to body or if it did then a body may be capable to continue infected without the disease discovering itself many days nay weeks together even not a quarantine of days only but soixantine not only forty days but sixty days or longer It is true there was as I observed at first and is well known to many yet living a very cold winter and a long frost which continued three months and this the doctors say might check the infection but then the learned must allow me to say that if according to their notion the disease was as I may say only frozen up it would like a frozen river have returned to its usual force and current when it thawed whereas the principal recess of this infection which was from February to April was after the frost was broken and the weather mild and warm But there is another way of solving all this difficulty which I think my own remembrance of the thing will supply and that is the fact is not granted namely that there died none in those long intervals viz from the twentieth of December to the ninth of February and from thence to the twenty second of April The weekly bills are the only evidence on the other side and those bills were not of credit enough at least with me to support an hypothesis or determine a question of such importance as this for it was our received opinion at that time and I believe upon very good grounds that the fraud lay in the parish officers searchers and persons appointed to give account of the dead and what diseases they died of and as people were very loth at first to have the neighbours believe their houses were infected so they gave money to procure or otherwise procured the dead persons to be returned as dying of other distempers and this I know was practised afterwards in many places I believe I might say in all places where the distemper came as will be seen by the vast increase of the numbers placed in the weekly bills under other articles of diseases during the time of the infection For example in the months of July and August when the plague was coming on to its highest pitch it was very ordinary to have from a thousand to twelve hundred nay to almost fifteen hundred a week of other distempers Not that the numbers of those distempers were really increased to such a degree but the great number of families and houses where really the infection was obtained the favour to have their dead be returned of other distempers to prevent the shutting up their houses For example Dead of other diseases beside the plague From the eighteenth July to the twenty fifth nine hundred forty two twenty fifth July first August ten oh four first August eighth twelve thirteen eighth fifteenth fourteen thirty nine fifteenth twenty second thirteen thirty one twenty second twenty ninth thirteen ninety four twenty ninth fifth September twelve sixty four fifth September to the twelfth ten fifty six twelfth nineteenth eleven thirty two nineteenth twenty sixth nine hundred twenty seven Now it was not doubted but the greatest part of these or a great part of them were dead of the plague but the officers were prevailed with to return them as above and the numbers of some particular articles of distempers discovered is as follows Aug Aug Aug Aug Aug Sept Sept Sept one eight fifteen twenty two twenty nine five twelve nineteen to eight to fifteen to twenty two to twenty nine to Sept five to twelve to nineteen to twenty six Fever three hundred fourteen three hundred fifty three three hundred forty eight three hundred eighty three three hundred sixty four three hundred thirty two three hundred nine two hundred sixty eight Spotted one hundred seventy four one hundred ninety one hundred sixty six one hundred sixty five one hundred fifty seven ninety seven one hundred one sixty five Fever Surfeit eighty five eighty seven seventy four ninety nine sixty eight forty five forty nine thirty six Teeth ninety one hundred thirteen one hundred eleven one hundred thirty three one hundred thirty eight one hundred twenty eight one hundred twenty one one hundred twelve six hundred sixty three seven hundred forty three six hundred ninety nine seven hundred eighty seven hundred twenty seven six hundred two five hundred eighty four hundred eighty one There were several other articles which bore a proportion to these and which it is easy to perceive were increased on the same account as aged consumptions vomitings imposthumes gripes and the like many of which were not doubted to be infected people but as it was of the utmost consequence to families not to be known to be infected if it was possible to avoid it so they took all the measures they could to have it not believed and if any died in their houses to get them returned to the examiners and by the searchers as having died of other distempers This I say will account for the long interval which as I have said was between the dying of the first persons that were returned in the bill to be dead of the plague and the time when the distemper spread openly and could not be concealed Besides the weekly bills themselves at that time evidently discover the truth for while there was no mention of the plague and no increase after it had been mentioned yet it was apparent that there was an increase of those distempers which bordered nearest upon it for example there were eight twelve seventeen of the spotted fever in a week when there were none or but very few of the plague whereas before one three or four were the ordinary weekly numbers of that distemper Likewise as I observed before the burials increased weekly in that particular parish and the parishes adjacent more than in any other parish although there were none set down of the plague all which tells us that the infection was handed on and the succession of the distemper really preserved though it seemed to us at that time to be ceased and to come again in a manner surprising It might be also that the infection might remain in other parts of the same parcel of goods which at first it came in and which might not be perhaps opened or at least not fully or in the clothes of the first infected person for I cannot think that anybody could be seized with the contagion in a fatal and mortal degree for nine weeks together and support his state of health so well as even not to discover it to themselves yet if it were so the argument is the stronger in favour of what I am saying namely that the infection is retained in bodies apparently well and conveyed from them to those they converse with while it is known to neither the one nor the other Great were the confusions at that time upon this very account and when people began to be convinced that the infection was received in this surprising manner from persons apparently well they began to be exceeding shy and jealous of every one that came near them Once on a public day whether a Sabbath day or not I do not remember in Aldgate Church in a pew full of people on a sudden one fancied she smelt an ill smell Immediately she fancies the plague was in the pew whispers her notion or suspicion to the next then rises and goes out of the pew It immediately took with the next and so to them all and every one of them and of the two or three adjoining pews got up and went out of the church nobody knowing what it was offended them or from whom This immediately filled everybody s mouths with one preparation or other such as the old woman directed and some perhaps as physicians directed in order to prevent infection by the breath of others insomuch that if we came to go into a church when it was anything full of people there would be such a mixture of smells at the entrance that it was much more strong though perhaps not so wholesome than if you were going into an apothecary s or druggist s shop In a word the whole church was like a smelling bottle in one corner it was all perfumes in another aromatics balsamics and variety of drugs and herbs in another salts and spirits as every one was furnished for their own preservation Yet I observed that after people were possessed as I have said with the belief or rather assurance of the infection being thus carried on by persons apparently in health the churches and meeting houses were much thinner of people than at other times before that they used to be For this is to be said of the people of London that during the whole time of the pestilence the churches or meetings were never wholly shut up nor did the people decline coming out to the public worship of God except only in some parishes when the violence of the distemper was more particularly in that parish at that time and even then no longer than it continued to be so Indeed nothing was more strange than to see with what courage the people went to the public service of God even at that time when they were afraid to stir out of their own houses upon any other occasion this I mean before the time of desperation which I have mentioned already This was a proof of the exceeding populousness of the city at the time of the infection notwithstanding the great numbers that were gone into the country at the first alarm and that fled out into the forests and woods when they were further terrified with the extraordinary increase of it For when we came to see the crowds and throngs of people which appeared on the Sabbath days at the churches and especially in those parts of the town where the plague was abated or where it was not yet come to its height it was amazing But of this I shall speak again presently I return in the meantime to the article of infecting one another at first before people came to right notions of the infection and of infecting one another People were only shy of those that were really sick a man with a cap upon his head or with clothes round his neck which was the case of those that had swellings there Such was indeed frightful but when we saw a gentleman dressed with his band on and his gloves in his hand his hat upon his head and his hair combed of such we had not the least apprehensions and people conversed a great while freely especially with their neighbours and such as they knew But when the physicians assured us that the danger was as well from the sound that is the seemingly sound as the sick and that those people who thought themselves entirely free were oftentimes the most fatal and that it came to be generally understood that people were sensible of it and of the reason of it then I say they began to be jealous of everybody and a vast number of people locked themselves up so as not to come abroad into any company at all nor suffer any that had been abroad in promiscuous company to come into their houses or near them at least not so near them as to be within the reach of their breath or of any smell from them and when they were obliged to converse at a distance with strangers they would always have preservatives in their mouths and about their clothes to repel and keep off the infection It must be acknowledged that when people began to use these cautions they were less exposed to danger and the infection did not break into such houses so furiously as it did into others before and thousands of families were preserved speaking with due reserve to the direction of Divine Providence by that means But it was impossible to beat anything into the heads of the poor They went on with the usual impetuosity of their tempers full of outcries and lamentations when taken but madly careless of themselves foolhardy and obstinate while they were well Where they could get employment they pushed into any kind of business the most dangerous and the most liable to infection and if they were spoken to their answer would be I must trust to God for that if I am taken then I am provided for and there is an end of me and the like Or thus Why what must I do I can t starve I had as good have the plague as perish for want I have no work what could I do I must do this or beg Suppose it was burying the dead or attending the sick or watching infected houses which were all terrible hazards but their tale was generally the same It is true necessity was a very justifiable warrantable plea and nothing could be better but their way of talk was much the same where the necessities were not the same This adventurous conduct of the poor was that which brought the plague among them in a most furious manner and this joined to the distress of their circumstances when taken was the reason why they died so by heaps for I cannot say I could observe one jot of better husbandry among them I mean the labouring poor while they were all well and getting money than there was before but as lavish as extravagant and as thoughtless for tomorrow as ever so that when they came to be taken sick they were immediately in the utmost distress as well for want as for sickness as well for lack of food as lack of health This misery of the poor I had many occasions to be an eyewitness of and sometimes also of the charitable assistance that some pious people daily gave to such sending them relief and supplies both of food physic and other help as they found they wanted and indeed it is a debt of justice due to the temper of the people of that day to take notice here that not only great sums very great sums of money were charitably sent to the Lord Mayor and aldermen for the assistance and support of the poor distempered people but abundance of private people daily distributed large sums of money for their relief and sent people about to inquire into the condition of particular distressed and visited families and relieved them nay some pious ladies were so transported with zeal in so good a work and so confident in the protection of Providence in discharge of the great duty of charity that they went about in person distributing alms to the poor and even visiting poor families though sick and infected in their very houses appointing nurses to attend those that wanted attending and ordering apothecaries and surgeons the first to supply them with drugs or plasters and such things as they wanted and the last to lance and dress the swellings and tumours where such were wanting giving their blessing to the poor in substantial relief to them as well as hearty prayers for them I will not undertake to say as some do that none of those charitable people were suffered to fall under the calamity itself but this I may say that I never knew any one of them that miscarried which I mention for the encouragement of others in case of the like distress and doubtless if they that give to the poor lend to the Lord and He will repay them those that hazard their lives to give to the poor and to comfort and assist the poor in such a misery as this may hope to be protected in the work Nor was this charity so extraordinary eminent only in a few but for I cannot lightly quit this point the charity of the rich as well in the city and suburbs as from the country was so great that in a word a prodigious number of people who must otherwise inevitably have perished for want as well as sickness were supported and subsisted by it and though I could never nor I believe any one else come to a full knowledge of what was so contributed yet I do believe that as I heard one say that was a critical observer of that part there was not only many thousand pounds contributed but many hundred thousand pounds to the relief of the poor of this distressed afflicted city nay one man affirmed to me that he could reckon up above one hundred thousand pounds a week which was distributed by the churchwardens at the several parish vestries by the Lord Mayor and aldermen in the several wards and precincts and by the particular direction of the court and of the justices respectively in the parts where they resided over and above the private charity distributed by pious bands in the manner I speak of and this continued for many weeks together I confess this is a very great sum but if it be true that there was distributed in the parish of Cripplegate only seventeen thousand eight hundred in one week to the relief of the poor as I heard reported and which I really believe was true the other may not be improbable It was doubtless to be reckoned among the many signal good providences which attended this great city and of which there were many other worth recording I say this was a very remarkable one that it pleased God thus to move the hearts of the people in all parts of the kingdom so cheerfully to contribute to the relief and support of the poor at London the good consequences of which were felt many ways and particularly in preserving the lives and recovering the health of so many thousands and keeping so many thousands of families from perishing and starving And now I am talking of the merciful disposition of Providence in this time of calamity I cannot but mention again though I have spoken several times of it already on other accounts I mean that of the progression of the distemper how it began at one end of the town and proceeded gradually and slowly from one part to another and like a dark cloud that passes over our heads which as it thickens and overcasts the air at one end dears up at the other end so while the plague went on raging from west to east as it went forwards east it abated in the west by which means those parts of the town which were not seized or who were left and where it had spent its fury were as it were spared to help and assist the other whereas had the distemper spread itself over the whole city and suburbs at once raging in all places alike as it has done since in some places abroad the whole body of the people must have been overwhelmed and there would have died twenty thousand a day as they say there did at Naples nor would the people have been able to have helped or assisted one another For it must be observed that where the plague was in its full force there indeed the people were very miserable and the consternation was inexpressible But a little before it reached even to that place or presently after it was gone they were quite another sort of people and I cannot but acknowledge that there was too much of that common temper of mankind to be found among us all at that time namely to forget the deliverance when the danger is past But I shall come to speak of that part again It must not be forgot here to take some notice of the state of trade during the time of this common calamity and this with respect to foreign trade as also to our home trade As to foreign trade there needs little to be said The trading nations of Europe were all afraid of us no port of France or Holland or Spain or Italy would admit our ships or correspond with us indeed we stood on ill terms with the Dutch and were in a furious war with them but though in a bad condition to fight abroad who had such dreadful enemies to struggle with at home Our merchants were accordingly at a full stop their ships could go nowhere that is to say to no place abroad their manufactures and merchandise that is to say of our growth would not be touched abroad They were as much afraid of our goods as they were of our people and indeed they had reason for our woollen manufactures are as retentive of infection as human bodies and if packed up by persons infected would receive the infection and be as dangerous to touch as a man would be that was infected and therefore when any English vessel arrived in foreign countries if they did take the goods on shore they always caused the bales to be opened and aired in places appointed for that purpose But from London they would not suffer them to come into port much less to unlade their goods upon any terms whatever and this strictness was especially used with them in Spain and Italy In Turkey and the islands of the Arches indeed as they are called as well those belonging to the Turks as to the Venetians they were not so very rigid In the first there was no obstruction at all and four ships which were then in the river loading for Italy that is for Leghorn and Naples being denied product as they call it went on to Turkey and were freely admitted to unlade their cargo without any difficulty only that when they arrived there some of their cargo was not fit for sale in that country and other parts of it being consigned to merchants at Leghorn the captains of the ships had no right nor any orders to dispose of the goods so that great inconveniences followed to the merchants But this was nothing but what the necessity of affairs required and the merchants at Leghorn and Naples having notice given them sent again from thence to take care of the effects which were particularly consigned to those ports and to bring back in other ships such as were improper for the markets at Smyrna and Scanderoon The inconveniences in Spain and Portugal were still greater for they would by no means suffer our ships especially those from London to come into any of their ports much less to unlade There was a report that one of our ships having by stealth delivered her cargo among which was some bales of English cloth cotton kerseys and such like goods the Spaniards caused all the goods to be burned and punished the men with death who were concerned in carrying them on shore This I believe was in part true though I do not affirm it but it is not at all unlikely seeing the danger was really very great the infection being so violent in London I heard likewise that the plague was carried into those countries by some of our ships and particularly to the port of Faro in the kingdom of Algarve belonging to the King of Portugal and that several persons died of it there but it was not confirmed On the other hand though the Spaniards and Portuguese were so shy of us it is most certain that the plague as has been said keeping at first much at that end of the town next Westminster the merchandising part of the town such as the city and the water side was perfectly sound till at least the beginning of July and the ships in the river till the beginning of August for to the first of July there had died but seven within the whole city and but sixty within the liberties but one in all the parishes of Stepney Aldgate and Whitechappel and but two in the eight parishes of Southwark But it was the same thing abroad for the bad news was gone over the whole world that the city of London was infected with the plague and there was no inquiring there how the infection proceeded or at which part of the town it was begun or was reached to Besides after it began to spread it increased so fast and the bills grew so high all on a sudden that it was to no purpose to lessen the report of it or endeavour to make the people abroad think it better than it was the account which the weekly bills gave in was sufficient and that there died two thousand to three or four thousand a week was sufficient to alarm the whole trading part of the world and the following time being so dreadful also in the very city itself put the whole world I say upon their guard against it You may be sure also that the report of these things lost nothing in the carriage The plague was itself very terrible and the distress of the people very great as you may observe of what I have said But the rumour was infinitely greater and it must not be wondered that our friends abroad as my brother s correspondents in particular were told there namely in Portugal and Italy where he chiefly traded said that in London there died twenty thousand in a week that the dead bodies lay unburied by heaps that the living were not sufficient to bury the dead or the sound to look after the sick that all the kingdom was infected likewise so that it was an universal malady such as was never heard of in those parts of the world and they could hardly believe us when we gave them an account how things really were and how there was not above one tenth part of the people dead that there was five hundred thousand left that lived all the time in the town that now the people began to walk the streets again and those who were fled to return there was no miss of the usual throng of people in the streets except as every family might miss their relations and neighbours and the like I say they could not believe these things and if inquiry were now to be made in Naples or in other cities on the coast of Italy they would tell you that there was a dreadful infection in London so many years ago in which as above there died twenty thousand in a week c just as we have had it reported in London that there was a plague in the city of Naples in the year sixteen fifty six in which there died twenty thousand people in a day of which I have had very good satisfaction that it was utterly false But these extravagant reports were very prejudicial to our trade as well as unjust and injurious in themselves for it was a long time after the plague was quite over before our trade could recover itself in those parts of the world and the Flemings and Dutch but especially the last made very great advantages of it having all the market to themselves and even buying our manufactures in several parts of England where the plague was not and carrying them to Holland and Flanders and from thence transporting them to Spain and to Italy as if they had been of their own making But they were detected sometimes and punished that is to say their goods confiscated and ships also for if it was true that our manufactures as well as our people were infected and that it was dangerous to touch or to open and receive the smell of them then those people ran the hazard by that clandestine trade not only of carrying the contagion into their own country but also of infecting the nations to whom they traded with those goods which considering how many lives might be lost in consequence of such an action must be a trade that no men of conscience could suffer themselves to be concerned in I do not take upon me to say that any harm was done I mean of that kind by those people But I doubt I need not make any such proviso in the case of our own country for either by our people of London or by the commerce which made their conversing with all sorts of people in every country and of every considerable town necessary I say by this means the plague was first or last spread all over the kingdom as well in London as in all the cities and great towns especially in the trading manufacturing towns and seaports so that first or last all the considerable places in England were visited more or less and the kingdom of Ireland in some places but not so universally How it fared with the people in Scotland I had no opportunity to inquire It is to be observed that while the plague continued so violent in London the outports as they are called enjoyed a very great trade especially to the adjacent countries and to our own plantations For example the towns of Colchester Yarmouth and Hun on that side of England exported to Holland and Hamburg the manufactures of the adjacent countries for several months after the trade with London was as it were entirely shut up likewise the cities of Bristol and Exeter with the port of Plymouth had the like advantage to Spain to the Canaries to Guinea and to the West Indies and particularly to Ireland but as the plague spread itself every way after it had been in London to such a degree as it was in August and September so all or most of those cities and towns were infected first or last and then trade was as it were under a general embargo or at a full stop as I shall observe further when I speak of our home trade One thing however must be observed that as to ships coming in from abroad as many you may be sure did some who were out in all parts of the world a considerable while before and some who when they went out knew nothing of an infection or at least of one so terrible these came up the river boldly and delivered their cargoes as they were obliged to do except just in the two months of August and September when the weight of the infection lying as I may say all below Bridge nobody durst appear in business for a while But as this continued but for a few weeks the homeward bound ships especially such whose cargoes were not liable to spoil came to an anchor for a time short of the Pool or fresh water part of the river even as low as the river Medway where several of them ran in and others lay at the Nore and in the Hope below Gravesend So that by the latter end of October there was a very great fleet of homeward bound ships to come up such as the like had not been known for many years That part of the river where the ships lie up when they come home is called the Pool and takes in all the river on both sides of the water from the Tower to Cuckold s Point and Limehouse Footnote in the original Two particular trades were carried on by water carriage all the while of the infection and that with little or no interruption very much to the advantage and comfort of the poor distressed people of the city and those were the coasting trade for corn and the Newcastle trade for coals The first of these was particularly carried on by small vessels from the port of Hull and other places on the Humber by which great quantities of corn were brought in from Yorkshire and Lincolnshire The other part of this corn trade was from Lynn in Norfolk from Wells and Burnham and from Yarmouth all in the same county and the third branch was from the river Medway and from Milton Feversham Margate and Sandwich and all the other little places and ports round the coast of Kent and Essex There was also a very good trade from the coast of Suffolk with corn butter and cheese these vessels kept a constant course of trade and without interruption came up to that market known still by the name of Bear Key where they supplied the city plentifully with corn when land carriage began to fail and when the people began to be sick of coming from many places in the country This also was much of it owing to the prudence and conduct of the Lord Mayor who took such care to keep the masters and seamen from danger when they came up causing their corn to be bought off at any time they wanted a market which however was very seldom and causing the corn factors immediately to unlade and deliver the vessels loaden with corn that they had very little occasion to come out of their ships or vessels the money being always carried on board to them and put into a pail of vinegar before it was carried The second trade was that of coals from Newcastle upon Tyne without which the city would have been greatly distressed for not in the streets only but in private houses and families great quantities of coals were then burnt even all the summer long and when the weather was hottest which was done by the advice of the physicians Some indeed opposed it and insisted that to keep the houses and rooms hot was a means to propagate the temper which was a fermentation and heat already in the blood that it was known to spread and increase in hot weather and abate in cold and therefore they alleged that all contagious distempers are the worse for heat because the contagion was nourished and gained strength in hot weather and was as it were propagated in heat Others said they granted that heat in the climate might propagate infection as sultry hot weather fills the air with vermin and nourishes innumerable numbers and kinds of venomous creatures which breed in our food in the plants and even in our bodies by the very stench of which infection may be propagated also that heat in the air or heat of weather as we ordinarily call it makes bodies relax and faint exhausts the spirits opens the pores and makes us more apt to receive infection or any evil influence be it from noxious pestilential vapours or any other thing in the air but that the heat of fire and especially of coal fires kept in our houses or near us had a quite different operation the heat being not of the same kind but quick and fierce tending not to nourish but to consume and dissipate all those noxious fumes which the other kind of heat rather exhaled and stagnated than separated and burnt up Besides it was alleged that the sulphurous and nitrous particles that are often found to be in the coal with that bituminous substance which burns are all assisting to clear and purge the air and render it wholesome and safe to breathe in after the noxious particles as above are dispersed and burnt up The latter opinion prevailed at that time and as I must confess I think with good reason and the experience of the citizens confirmed it many houses which had constant fires kept in the rooms having never been infected at all and I must join my experience to it for I found the keeping good fires kept our rooms sweet and wholesome and I do verily believe made our whole family so more than would otherwise have been But I return to the coals as a trade It was with no little difficulty that this trade was kept open and particularly because as we were in an open war with I the Dutch at that time the Dutch capers at first took a great many of our collier ships which made the rest cautious and made them to stay to come in fleets together But after some time the capers were either afraid to take them or their masters the States were afraid they should and forbade them lest the plague should be among them which made them fare the better For the security of those northern traders the coal ships were ordered by my Lord Mayor not to come up into the Pool above a certain number at a time and ordered lighters and other vessels such as the woodmongers that is the wharf keepers or coal sellers furnished to go down and take out the coals as low as Deptford and Greenwich and some farther down Others delivered great quantities of coals in particular places where the ships could come to the shore as at Greenwich Blackwall and other places in vast heaps as if to be kept for sale but were then fetched away after the ships which brought them were gone so that the seamen had no communication with the river men nor so much as came near one another Yet all this caution could not effectually prevent the distemper getting among the colliery that is to say among the ships by which a great many seamen died of it and that which was still worse was that they carried it down to Ipswich and Yarmouth to Newcastle upon Tyne and other places on the coast where especially at Newcastle and at Sunderland it carried off a great number of people The making so many fires as above did indeed consume an unusual quantity of coals and that upon one or two stops of the ships coming up whether by contrary weather or by the interruption of enemies I do not remember but the price of coals was exceeding dear even as high as four a chalder but it soon abated when the ships came in and as afterwards they had a freer passage the price was very reasonable all the rest of that year The public fires which were made on these occasions as I have calculated it must necessarily have cost the city about two hundred chalders of coals a week if they had continued which was indeed a very great quantity but as it was thought necessary nothing was spared However as some of the physicians cried them down they were not kept alight above four or five days The fires were ordered thus One at the Custom House one at Billingsgate one at Queenhith and one at the Three Cranes one in Blackfriars and one at the gate of Bridewell one at the corner of Leadenhal Street and Gracechurch one at the north and one at the south gate of the Royal Exchange one at Guild Hall and one at Blackwell Hall gate one at the Lord Mayor s door in saint Helen s one at the west entrance into saint Paul s and one at the entrance into Bow Church I do not remember whether there was any at the city gates but one at the Bridge foot there was just by saint Magnus Church I know some have quarrelled since that at the experiment and said that there died the more people because of those fires but I am persuaded those that say so offer no evidence to prove it neither can I believe it on any account whatever It remains to give some account of the state of trade at home in England during this dreadful time and particularly as it relates to the manufactures and the trade in the city At the first breaking out of the infection there was as it is easy to suppose a very great fright among the people and consequently a general stop of trade except in provisions and necessaries of life and even in those things as there was a vast number of people fled and a very great number always sick besides the number which died so there could not be above two thirds if above one half of the consumption of provisions in the city as used to be It pleased God to send a very plentiful year of corn and fruit but not of hay or grass by which means bread was cheap by reason of the plenty of corn Flesh was cheap by reason of the scarcity of grass but butter and cheese were dear for the same reason and hay in the market just beyond Whitechappel Bars was sold at four pound per load But that affected not the poor There was a most excessive plenty of all sorts of fruit such as apples pears plums cherries grapes and they were the cheaper because of the want of people but this made the poor eat them to excess and this brought them into fluxes griping of the guts surfeits and the like which often precipitated them into the plague But to come to matters of trade First foreign exportation being stopped or at least very much interrupted and rendered difficult a general stop of all those manufactures followed of course which were usually brought for exportation and though sometimes merchants abroad were importunate for goods yet little was sent the passages being so generally stopped that the English ships would not be admitted as is said already into their port This put a stop to the manufactures that were for exportation in most parts of England except in some out ports and even that was soon stopped for they all had the plague in their turn But though this was felt all over England yet what was still worse all intercourse of trade for home consumption of manufactures especially those which usually circulated through the Londoner s hands was stopped at once the trade of the city being stopped All kinds of handicrafts in the city c tradesmen and mechanics were as I have said before out of employ and this occasioned the putting off and dismissing an innumerable number of journeymen and workmen of all sorts seeing nothing was done relating to such trades but what might be said to be absolutely necessary This caused the multitude of single people in London to be unprovided for as also families whose living depended upon the labour of the heads of those families I say this reduced them to extreme misery and I must confess it is for the honour of the city of London and will be for many ages as long as this is to be spoken of that they were able to supply with charitable provision the wants of so many thousands of those as afterwards fell sick and were distressed so that it may be safely averred that nobody perished for want at least that the magistrates had any notice given them of This stagnation of our manufacturing trade in the country would have put the people there to much greater difficulties but that the master workmen clothiers and others to the uttermost of their stocks and strength kept on making their goods to keep the poor at work believing that soon as the sickness should abate they would have a quick demand in proportion to the decay of their trade at that time But as none but those masters that were rich could do thus and that many were poor and not able the manufacturing trade in England suffered greatly and the poor were pinched all over England by the calamity of the city of London only It is true that the next year made them full amends by another terrible calamity upon the city so that the city by one calamity impoverished and weakened the country and by another calamity even terrible too of its kind enriched the country and made them again amends for an infinite quantity of household Stuff wearing apparel and other things besides whole warehouses filled with merchandise and manufactures such as come from all parts of England were consumed in the fire of London the next year after this terrible visitation It is incredible what a trade this made all over the whole kingdom to make good the want and to supply that loss so that in short all the manufacturing hands in the nation were set on work and were little enough for several years to supply the market and answer the demands All foreign markets also were empty of our goods by the stop which had been occasioned by the plague and before an open trade was allowed again and the prodigious demand at home falling in joined to make a quick vent for all sort of goods so that there never was known such a trade all over England for the time as was in the first seven years after the plague and after the fire of London It remains now that I should say something of the merciful part of this terrible judgement The last week in September the plague being come to its crisis its fury began to assuage I remember my friend doctor Heath coming to see me the week before told me he was sure that the violence of it would assuage in a few days but when I saw the weekly bill of that week which was the highest of the whole year being eight thousand two hundred ninety seven of all diseases I upbraided him with it and asked him what he had made his judgement from His answer however was not so much to seek as I thought it would have been Look you says he by the number which are at this time sick and infected there should have been twenty thousand dead the last week instead of eight thousand if the inveterate mortal contagion had been as it was two weeks ago for then it ordinarily killed in two or three days now not under eight or ten and then not above one in five recovered whereas I have observed that now not above two in five miscarry And observe it from me the next bill will decrease and you will see many more people recover than used to do for though a vast multitude are now everywhere infected and as many every day fall sick yet there will not so many die as there did for the malignity of the distemper is abated adding that he began now to hope nay more than hope that the infection had passed its crisis and was going off and accordingly so it was for the next week being as I said the last in September the bill decreased almost two thousand It is true the plague was still at a frightful height and the next bill was no less than six thousand four hundred sixty and the next to that five thousand seven hundred twenty but still my friend s observation was just and it did appear the people did recover faster and more in number than they used to do and indeed if it had not been so what had been the condition of the city of London For according to my friend there were not fewer than sixty thousand people at that time infected whereof as above twenty thousand four hundred seventy seven died and near forty thousand recovered whereas had it been as it was before fifty thousand of that number would very probably have died if not more and fifty thousand more would have sickened for in a word the whole mass of people began to sicken and it looked as if none would escape But this remark of my friend s appeared more evident in a few weeks more for the decrease went on and another week in October it decreased eighteen forty three so that the number dead of the plague was but twenty six sixty five and the next week it decreased fourteen thirteen more and yet it was seen plainly that there was abundance of people sick nay abundance more than ordinary and abundance fell sick every day but as above the malignity of the disease abated Such is the precipitant disposition of our people whether it is so or not all over the world that s none of my particular business to inquire but I saw it apparently here that as upon the first fright of the infection they shunned one another and fled from one another s houses and from the city with an unaccountable and as I thought unnecessary fright so now upon this notion spreading viz that the distemper was not so catching as formerly and that if it was catched it was not so mortal and seeing abundance of people who really fell sick recover again daily they took to such a precipitant courage and grew so entirely regardless of themselves and of the infection that they made no more of the plague than of an ordinary fever nor indeed so much They not only went boldly into company with those who had tumours and carbuncles upon them that were running and consequently contagious but ate and drank with them nay into their houses to visit them and even as I was told into their very chambers where they lay sick This I could not see rational My friend doctor Heath allowed and it was plain to experience that the distemper was as catching as ever and as many fell sick but only he alleged that so many of those that fell sick did not die but I think that while many did die and that at best the distemper itself was very terrible the sores and swellings very tormenting and the danger of death not left out of the circumstances of sickness though not so frequent as before all those things together with the exceeding tediousness of the cure the loathsomeness of the disease and many other articles were enough to deter any man living from a dangerous mixture with the sick people and make them as anxious almost to avoid the infections as before Nay there was another thing which made the mere catching of the distemper frightful and that was the terrible burning of the caustics which the surgeons laid on the swellings to bring them to break and to run without which the danger of death was very great even to the last Also the insufferable torment of the swellings which though it might not make people raving and distracted as they were before and as I have given several instances of already yet they put the patient to inexpressible torment and those that fell into it though they did escape with life yet they made bitter complaints of those that had told them there was no danger and sadly repented their rashness and folly in venturing to run into the reach of it Nor did this unwary conduct of the people end here for a great many that thus cast off their cautions suffered more deeply still and though many escaped yet many died and at least it had this public mischief attending it that it made the decrease of burials slower than it would otherwise have been For as this notion ran like lightning through the city and people s heads were possessed with it even as soon as the first great decrease in the bills appeared we found that the two next bills did not decrease in proportion the reason I take to be the people s running so rashly into danger giving up all their former cautions and care and all the shyness which they used to practise depending that the sickness would not reach them or that if it did they should not die The physicians opposed this thoughtless humour of the people with all their might and gave out printed directions spreading them all over the city and suburbs advising the people to continue reserved and to use still the utmost caution in their ordinary conduct notwithstanding the decrease of the distemper terrifying them with the danger of bringing a relapse upon the whole city and telling them how such a relapse might be more fatal and dangerous than the whole visitation that had been already with many arguments and reasons to explain and prove that part to them and which are too long to repeat here But it was all to no purpose the audacious creatures were so possessed with the first joy and so surprised with the satisfaction of seeing a vast decrease in the weekly bills that they were impenetrable by any new terrors and would not be persuaded but that the bitterness of death was past and it was to no more purpose to talk to them than to an east wind but they opened shops went about streets did business and conversed with anybody that came in their way to converse with whether with business or without neither inquiring of their health or so much as being apprehensive of any danger from them though they knew them not to be sound This imprudent rash conduct cost a great many their lives who had with great care and caution shut themselves up and kept retired as it were from all mankind and had by that means under God s providence been preserved through all the heat of that infection This rash and foolish conduct I say of the people went so far that the ministers took notice to them of it at last and laid before them both the folly and danger of it and this checked it a little so that they grew more cautious But it had another effect which they could not check for as the first rumour had spread not over the city only but into the country it had the like effect and the people were so tired with being so long from London and so eager to come back that they flocked to town without fear or forecast and began to show themselves in the streets as if all the danger was over It was indeed surprising to see it for though there died still from one thousand to eighteen hundred a week yet the people flocked to town as if all had been well The consequence of this was that the bills increased again four hundred the very first week in November and if I might believe the physicians there was above three thousand fell sick that week most of them new comers too One John Cock a barber in saint Martin s le Grand was an eminent example of this I mean of the hasty return of the people when the plague was abated This John Cock had left the town with his whole family and locked up his house and was gone in the country as many others did and finding the plague so decreased in November that there died but nine hundred five per week of all diseases he ventured home again He had in his family ten persons that is to say himself and wife five children two apprentices and a maid servant He had not returned to his house above a week and began to open his shop and carry on his trade but the distemper broke out in his family and within about five days they all died except one that is to say himself his wife all his five children and his two apprentices and only the maid remained alive But the mercy of God was greater to the rest than we had reason to expect for the malignity as I have said of the distemper was spent the contagion was exhausted and also the winter weather came on apace and the air was clear and cold with sharp frosts and this increasing still most of those that had fallen sick recovered and the health of the city began to return There were indeed some returns of the distemper even in the month of December and the bills increased near a hundred but it went off again and so in a short while things began to return to their own channel And wonderful it was to see how populous the city was again all on a sudden so that a stranger could not miss the numbers that were lost Neither was there any miss of the inhabitants as to their dwellings few or no empty houses were to be seen or if there were some there was no want of tenants for them I wish I could say that as the city had a new face so the manners of the people had a new appearance I doubt not but there were many that retained a sincere sense of their deliverance and were that heartily thankful to that Sovereign Hand that had protected them in so dangerous a time it would be very uncharitable to judge otherwise in a city so populous and where the people were so devout as they were here in the time of the visitation itself but except what of this was to be found in particular families and faces it must be acknowledged that the general practice of the people was just as it was before and very little difference was to be seen Some indeed said things were worse that the morals of the people declined from this very time that the people hardened by the danger they had been in like seamen after a storm is over were more wicked and more stupid more bold and hardened in their vices and immoralities than they were before but I will not carry it so far neither It would take up a history of no small length to give a particular of all the gradations by which the course of things in this city came to be restored again and to run in their own channel as they did before Some parts of England were now infected as violently as London had been the cities of Norwich Peterborough Lincoln Colchester and other places were now visited and the magistrates of London began to set rules for our conduct as to corresponding with those cities It is true we could not pretend to forbid their people coming to London because it was impossible to know them asunder so after many consultations the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen were obliged to drop it All they could do was to warn and caution the people not to entertain in their houses or converse with any people who they knew came from such infected places But they might as well have talked to the air for the people of London thought themselves so plague free now that they were past all admonitions they seemed to depend upon it that the air was restored and that the air was like a man that had had the smallpox not capable of being infected again This revived that notion that the infection was all in the air that there was no such thing as contagion from the sick people to the sound and so strongly did this whimsy prevail among people that they ran all together promiscuously sick and well Not the Mahometans who prepossessed with the principle of predestination value nothing of contagion let it be in what it will could be more obstinate than the people of London they that were perfectly sound and came out of the wholesome air as we call it into the city made nothing of going into the same houses and chambers nay even into the same beds with those that had the distemper upon them and were not recovered Some indeed paid for their audacious boldness with the price of their lives an infinite number fell sick and the physicians had more work than ever only with this difference that more of their patients recovered that is to say they generally recovered but certainly there were more people infected and fell sick now when there did not die above a thousand or twelve hundred in a week than there was when there died five or six thousand a week so entirely negligent were the people at that time in the great and dangerous case of health and infection and so ill were they able to take or accept of the advice of those who cautioned them for their good The people being thus returned as it were in general it was very strange to find that in their inquiring after their friends some whole families were so entirely swept away that there was no remembrance of them left neither was anybody to be found to possess or show any title to that little they had left for in such cases what was to be found was generally embezzled and purloined some gone one way some another It was said such abandoned effects came to the king as the universal heir upon which we are told and I suppose it was in part true that the king granted all such as deodands to the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen of London to be applied to the use of the poor of whom there were very many For it is to be observed that though the occasions of relief and the objects of distress were very many more in the time of the violence of the plague than now after all was over yet the distress of the poor was more now a great deal than it was then because all the sluices of general charity were now shut People supposed the main occasion to be over and so stopped their hands whereas particular objects were still very moving and the distress of those that were poor was very great indeed Though the health of the city was now very much restored yet foreign trade did not begin to stir neither would foreigners admit our ships into their ports for a great while As for the Dutch the misunderstandings between our court and them had broken out into a war the year before so that our trade that way was wholly interrupted but Spain and Portugal Italy and Barbary as also Hamburg and all the ports in the Baltic these were all shy of us a great while and would not restore trade with us for many months The distemper sweeping away such multitudes as I have observed many if not all the out parishes were obliged to make new burying grounds besides that I have mentioned in Bunhill Fields some of which were continued and remain in use to this day But others were left off and which I confess I mention with some reflection being converted into other uses or built upon afterwards the dead bodies were disturbed abused dug up again some even before the flesh of them was perished from the bones and removed like dung or rubbish to other places Some of those which came within the reach of my observation are as follow one A piece of ground beyond Goswell Street near Mount Mill being some of the remains of the old lines or fortifications of the city where abundance were buried promiscuously from the parishes of Aldersgate Clerkenwell and even out of the city This ground as I take it was since made a physic garden and after that has been built upon two A piece of ground just over the Black Ditch as it was then called at the end of Holloway Lane in Shoreditch parish It has been since made a yard for keeping hogs and for other ordinary uses but is quite out of use as a burying ground three The upper end of Hand Alley in Bishopsgate Street which was then a green field and was taken in particularly for Bishopsgate parish though many of the carts out of the city brought their dead thither also particularly out of the parish of saint All hallows on the Wall This place I cannot mention without much regret It was as I remember about two or three years after the plague was ceased that Sir Robert Clayton came to be possessed of the ground It was reported how true I know not that it fell to the king for want of heirs all those who had any right to it being carried off by the pestilence and that Sir Robert Clayton obtained a grant of it from King Charles II But however he came by it certain it is the ground was let out to build on or built upon by his order The first house built upon it was a large fair house still standing which faces the street or way now called Hand Alley which though called an alley is as wide as a street The houses in the same row with that house northward are built on the very same ground where the poor people were buried and the bodies on opening the ground for the foundations were dug up some of them remaining so plain to be seen that the women s skulls were distinguished by their long hair and of others the flesh was not quite perished so that the people began to exclaim loudly against it and some suggested that it might endanger a return of the contagion after which the bones and bodies as fast as they came at them were carried to another part of the same ground and thrown all together into a deep pit dug on purpose which now is to be known in that it is not built on but is a passage to another house at the upper end of Rose Alley just against the door of a meeting house which has been built there many years since and the ground is palisadoed off from the rest of the passage in a little square there lie the bones and remains of near two thousand bodies carried by the dead carts to their grave in that one year four Besides this there was a piece of ground in Moorfields by the going into the street which is now called Old Bethlem which was enlarged much though not wholly taken in on the same occasion N B The author of this journal lies buried in that very ground being at his own desire his sister having been buried there a few years before five Stepney parish extending itself from the east part of London to the north even to the very edge of Shoreditch Churchyard had a piece of ground taken in to bury their dead close to the said churchyard and which for that very reason was left open and is since I suppose taken into the same churchyard And they had also two other burying places in Spittlefields one where since a chapel or tabernacle has been built for ease to this great parish and another in Petticoat Lane There were no less than five other grounds made use of for the parish of Stepney at that time one where now stands the parish church of saint Paul Shadwell and the other where now stands the parish church of saint John s at Wapping both which had not the names of parishes at that time but were belonging to Stepney parish I could name many more but these coming within my particular knowledge the circumstance I thought made it of use to record them From the whole it may be observed that they were obliged in this time of distress to take in new burying grounds in most of the out parishes for laying the prodigious numbers of people which died in so short a space of time but why care was not taken to keep those places separate from ordinary uses that so the bodies might rest undisturbed that I cannot answer for and must confess I think it was wrong Who were to blame I know not I should have mentioned that the Quakers had at that time also a burying ground set apart to their use and which they still make use of and they had also a particular dead cart to fetch their dead from their houses and the famous Solomon Eagle who as I mentioned before had predicted the plague as a judgement and ran naked through the streets telling the people that it was come upon them to punish them for their sins had his own wife died the very next day of the plague and was carried one of the first in the Quakers dead cart to their new burying ground I might have thronged this account with many more remarkable things which occurred in the time of the infection and particularly what passed between the Lord Mayor and the Court which was then at Oxford and what directions were from time to time received from the Government for their conduct on this critical occasion But really the Court concerned themselves so little and that little they did was of so small import that I do not see it of much moment to mention any part of it here except that of appointing a monthly fast in the city and the sending the royal charity to the relief of the poor both which I have mentioned before Great was the reproach thrown on those physicians who left their patients during the sickness and now they came to town again nobody cared to employ them They were called deserters and frequently bills were set up upon their doors and written Here is a doctor to be let so that several of those physicians were fain for a while to sit still and look about them or at least remove their dwellings and set up in new places and among new acquaintance The like was the case with the clergy whom the people were indeed very abusive to writing verses and scandalous reflections upon them setting upon the church door Here is a pulpit to be let or sometimes to be sold which was worse It was not the least of our misfortunes that with our infection when it ceased there did not cease the spirit of strife and contention slander and reproach which was really the great troubler of the nation s peace before It was said to be the remains of the old animosities which had so lately involved us all in blood and disorder But as the late Act of Indemnity had laid asleep the quarrel itself so the Government had recommended family and personal peace upon all occasions to the whole nation But it could not be obtained and particularly after the ceasing of the plague in London when any one that had seen the condition which the people had been in and how they caressed one another at that time promised to have more charity for the future and to raise no more reproaches I say any one that had seen them then would have thought they would have come together with another spirit at last But I say it could not be obtained The quarrel remained the Church and the Presbyterians were incompatible As soon as the plague was removed the Dissenting ousted ministers who had supplied the pulpits which were deserted by the incumbents retired they could expect no other but that they should immediately fall upon them and harass them with their penal laws accept their preaching while they were sick and persecute them as soon as they were recovered again this even we that were of the Church thought was very hard and could by no means approve of it But it was the Government and we could say nothing to hinder it we could only say it was not our doing and we could not answer for it On the other hand the Dissenters reproaching those ministers of the Church with going away and deserting their charge abandoning the people in their danger and when they had most need of comfort and the like this we could by no means approve for all men have not the same faith and the same courage and the Scripture commands us to judge the most favourably and according to charity A plague is a formidable enemy and is armed with terrors that every man is not sufficiently fortified to resist or prepared to stand the shock against It is very certain that a great many of the clergy who were in circumstances to do it withdrew and fled for the safety of their lives but tis true also that a great many of them stayed and many of them fell in the calamity and in the discharge of their duty It is true some of the Dissenting turned out ministers stayed and their courage is to be commended and highly valued but these were not abundance it cannot be said that they all stayed and that none retired into the country any more than it can be said of the Church clergy that they all went away Neither did all those that went away go without substituting curates and others in their places to do the offices needful and to visit the sick as far as it was practicable so that upon the whole an allowance of charity might have been made on both sides and we should have considered that such a time as this of sixteen sixty five is not to be paralleled in history and that it is not the stoutest courage that will always support men in such cases I had not said this but had rather chosen to record the courage and religious zeal of those of both sides who did hazard themselves for the service of the poor people in their distress without remembering that any failed in their duty on either side But the want of temper among us has made the contrary to this necessary some that stayed not only boasting too much of themselves but reviling those that fled branding them with cowardice deserting their flocks and acting the part of the hireling and the like I recommend it to the charity of all good people to look back and reflect duly upon the terrors of the time and whoever does so well see that it is not an ordinary strength that could support it It was not like appearing in the head of an army or charging a body of horse in the field but it was charging Death itself on his pale horse to stay was indeed to die and it could be esteemed nothing less especially as things appeared at the latter end of August and the beginning of September and as there was reason to expect them at that time for no man expected and I dare say believed that the distemper would take so sudden a turn as it did and fall immediately two thousand in a week when there was such a prodigious number of people sick at that time as it was known there was and then it was that many shifted away that had stayed most of the time before Besides if God gave strength to some more than to others was it to boast of their ability to abide the stroke and upbraid those that had not the same gift and support or ought not they rather to have been humble and thankful if they were rendered more useful than their brethren I think it ought to be recorded to the honour of such men as well clergy as physicians surgeons apothecaries magistrates and officers of every kind as also all useful people who ventured their lives in discharge of their duty as most certainly all such as stayed did to the last degree and several of all these kinds did not only venture but lose their lives on that sad occasion I was once making a list of all such I mean of all those professions and employments who thus died as I call it in the way of their duty but it was impossible for a private man to come at a certainty in the particulars I only remember that there died sixteen clergymen two aldermen five physicians thirteen surgeons within the city and liberties before the beginning of September But this being as I said before the great crisis and extremity of the infection it can be no complete list As to inferior people I think there died six and forty constables and head boroughs in the two parishes of Stepney and Whitechappel but I could not carry my list on for when the violent rage of the distemper in September came upon us it drove us out of all measures Men did then no more die by tale and by number They might put out a weekly bill and call them seven or eight thousand or what they pleased tis certain they died by heaps and were buried by heaps that is to say without account And if I might believe some people who were more abroad and more conversant with those things than I though I was public enough for one that had no more business to do than I had I say if I may believe them there was not many less buried those first three weeks in September than twenty thousand per week However the others aver the truth of it yet I rather choose to keep to the public account seven and eight thousand per week is enough to make good all that I have said of the terror of those times and it is much to the satisfaction of me that write as well as those that read to be able to say that everything is set down with moderation and rather within compass than beyond it Upon all these accounts I say I could wish when we were recovered our conduct had been more distinguished for charity and kindness in remembrance of the past calamity and not so much a valuing ourselves upon our boldness in staying as if all men were cowards that fly from the hand of God or that those who stay do not sometimes owe their courage to their ignorance and despising the hand of their Maker which is a criminal kind of desperation and not a true courage I cannot but leave it upon record that the civil officers such as constables head boroughs Lord Mayor s and sheriffs men as also parish officers whose business it was to take charge of the poor did their duties in general with as much courage as any and perhaps with more because their work was attended with more hazards and lay more among the poor who were more subject to be infected and in the most pitiful plight when they were taken with the infection But then it must be added too that a great number of them died indeed it was scarce possible it should be otherwise I have not said one word here about the physic or preparations that we ordinarily made use of on this terrible occasion I mean we that went frequently abroad and up down street as I did much of this was talked of in the books and bills of our quack doctors of whom I have said enough already It may however be added that the College of Physicians were daily publishing several preparations which they had considered of in the process of their practice and which being to be had in print I avoid repeating them for that reason One thing I could not help observing what befell one of the quacks who published that he had a most excellent preservative against the plague which whoever kept about them should never be infected or liable to infection This man who we may reasonably suppose did not go abroad without some of this excellent preservative in his pocket yet was taken by the distemper and carried off in two or three days I am not of the number of the physic haters or physic despisers on the contrary I have often mentioned the regard I had to the dictates of my particular friend doctor Heath but yet I must acknowledge I made use of little or nothing except as I have observed to keep a preparation of strong scent to have ready in case I met with anything of offensive smells or went too near any burying place or dead body Neither did I do what I know some did keep the spirits always high and hot with cordials and wine and such things and which as I observed one learned physician used himself so much to as that he could not leave them off when the infection was quite gone and so became a sot for all his life after I remember my friend the doctor used to say that there was a certain set of drugs and preparations which were all certainly good and useful in the case of an infection out of which or with which physicians might make an infinite variety of medicines as the ringers of bells make several hundred different rounds of music by the changing and order or sound but in six bells and that all these preparations shall be really very good Therefore said he I do not wonder that so vast a throng of medicines is offered in the present calamity and almost every physician prescribes or prepares a different thing as his judgement or experience guides him but says my friend let all the prescriptions of all the physicians in London be examined and it will be found that they are all compounded of the same things with such variations only as the particular fancy of the doctor leads him to so that says he every man judging a little of his own constitution and manner of his living and circumstances of his being infected may direct his own medicines out of the ordinary drugs and preparations Only that says he some recommend one thing as most sovereign and some another Some says he think that pill ruff which is called itself the anti pestilential pill is the best preparation that can be made others think that Venice treacle is sufficient of itself to resist the contagion and I says he think as both these think viz that the last is good to take beforehand to prevent it and the first if touched to expel it According to this opinion I several times took Venice treacle and a sound sweat upon it and thought myself as well fortified against the infection as any one could be fortified by the power of physic As for quackery and mountebanks of which the town was so full I listened to none of them and have observed often since with some wonder that for two years after the plague I scarcely saw or heard of one of them about town Some fancied they were all swept away in the infection to a man and were for calling it a particular mark of God s vengeance upon them for leading the poor people into the pit of destruction merely for the lucre of a little money they got by them but I cannot go that length neither That abundance of them died is certain many of them came within the reach of my own knowledge but that all of them were swept off I much question I believe rather they fled into the country and tried their practices upon the people there who were in apprehension of the infection before it came among them This however is certain not a man of them appeared for a great while in or about London There were indeed several doctors who published bills recommending their several physical preparations for cleansing the body as they call it after the plague and needful as they said for such people to take who had been visited and had been cured whereas I must own I believe that it was the opinion of the most eminent physicians at that time that the plague was itself a sufficient purge and that those who escaped the infection needed no physic to cleanse their bodies of any other things the running sores the tumours c which were broke and kept open by the directions of the physicians having sufficiently cleansed them and that all other distempers and causes of distempers were effectually carried off that way and as the physicians gave this as their opinions wherever they came the quacks got little business There were indeed several little hurries which happened after the decrease of the plague and which whether they were contrived to fright and disorder the people as some imagined I cannot say but sometimes we were told the plague would return by such a time and the famous Solomon Eagle the naked Quaker I have mentioned prophesied evil tidings every day and several others telling us that London had not been sufficiently scourged and that sorer and severer strokes were yet behind Had they stopped there or had they descended to particulars and told us that the city should the next year be destroyed by fire then indeed when we had seen it come to pass we should not have been to blame to have paid more than a common respect to their prophetic spirits at least we should have wondered at them and have been more serious in our inquiries after the meaning of it and whence they had the foreknowledge But as they generally told us of a relapse into the plague we have had no concern since that about them yet by those frequent clamours we were all kept with some kind of apprehensions constantly upon us and if any died suddenly or if the spotted fevers at any time increased we were presently alarmed much more if the number of the plague increased for to the end of the year there were always between two hundred and three hundred of the plague On any of these occasions I say we were alarmed anew Those who remember the city of London before the fire must remember that there was then no such place as we now call Newgate Market but that in the middle of the street which is now called Blowbladder Street and which had its name from the butchers who used to kill and dress their sheep there and who it seems had a custom to blow up their meat with pipes to make it look thicker and fatter than it was and were punished there for it by the Lord Mayor I say from the end of the street towards Newgate there stood two long rows of shambles for the selling meat It was in those shambles that two persons falling down dead as they were buying meat gave rise to a rumour that the meat was all infected which though it might affright the people and spoiled the market for two or three days yet it appeared plainly afterwards that there was nothing of truth in the suggestion But nobody can account for the possession of fear when it takes hold of the mind However it Pleased God by the continuing of the winter weather so to restore the health of the city that by February following we reckoned the distemper quite ceased and then we were not so easily frighted again There was still a question among the learned and at first perplexed the people a little and that was in what manner to purge the house and goods where the plague had been and how to render them habitable again which had been left empty during the time of the plague Abundance of perfumes and preparations were prescribed by physicians some of one kind and some of another in which the people who listened to them put themselves to a great and indeed in my opinion to an unnecessary expense and the poorer people who only set open their windows night and day burned brimstone pitch and gunpowder and such things in their rooms did as well as the best nay the eager people who as I said above came home in haste and at all hazards found little or no inconvenience in their houses nor in the goods and did little or nothing to them However in general prudent cautious people did enter into some measures for airing and sweetening their houses and burned perfumes incense benjamin rozin and sulphur in their rooms close shut up and then let the air carry it all out with a blast of gunpowder others caused large fires to be made all day and all night for several days and nights by the same token that two or three were pleased to set their houses on fire and so effectually sweetened them by burning them down to the ground as particularly one at Ratcliff one in Holbourn and one at Westminster besides two or three that were set on fire but the fire was happily got out again before it went far enough to burn down the houses and one citizen s servant I think it was in Thames Street carried so much gunpowder into his master s house for clearing it of the infection and managed it so foolishly that he blew up part of the roof of the house But the time was not fully come that the city was to be purged by fire nor was it far off for within nine months more I saw it all lying in ashes when as some of our quacking philosophers pretend the seeds of the plague were entirely destroyed and not before a notion too ridiculous to speak of here since had the seeds of the plague remained in the houses not to be destroyed but by fire how has it been that they have not since broken out seeing all those buildings in the suburbs and liberties all in the great parishes of Stepney Whitechappel Aldgate Bishopsgate Shoreditch Cripplegate and saint Giles where the fire never came and where the plague raged with the greatest violence remain still in the same condition they were in before But to leave these things just as I found them it was certain that those people who were more than ordinarily cautious of their health did take particular directions for what they called seasoning of their houses and abundance of costly things were consumed on that account which I cannot but say not only seasoned those houses as they desired but filled the air with very grateful and wholesome smells which others had the share of the benefit of as well as those who were at the expenses of them And yet after all though the poor came to town very precipitantly as I have said yet I must say the rich made no such haste The men of business indeed came up but many of them did not bring their families to town till the spring came on and that they saw reason to depend upon it that the plague would not return The Court indeed came up soon after Christmas but the nobility and gentry except such as depended upon and had employment under the administration did not come so soon I should have taken notice here that notwithstanding the violence of the plague in London and in other places yet it was very observable that it was never on board the fleet and yet for some time there was a strange press in the river and even in the streets for seamen to man the fleet But it was in the beginning of the year when the plague was scarce begun and not at all come down to that part of the city where they usually press for seamen and though a war with the Dutch was not at all grateful to the people at that time and the seamen went with a kind of reluctancy into the service and many complained of being dragged into it by force yet it proved in the event a happy violence to several of them who had probably perished in the general calamity and who after the summer service was over though they had cause to lament the desolation of their families who when they came back were many of them in their graves yet they had room to be thankful that they were carried out of the reach of it though so much against their wills We indeed had a hot war with the Dutch that year and one very great engagement at sea in which the Dutch were worsted but we lost a great many men and some ships But as I observed the plague was not in the fleet and when they came to lay up the ships in the river the violent part of it began to abate I would be glad if I could close the account of this melancholy year with some particular examples historically I mean of the thankfulness to God our preserver for our being delivered from this dreadful calamity Certainly the circumstance of the deliverance as well as the terrible enemy we were delivered from called upon the whole nation for it The circumstances of the deliverance were indeed very remarkable as I have in part mentioned already and particularly the dreadful condition which we were all in when we were to the surprise of the whole town made joyful with the hope of a stop of the infection Nothing but the immediate finger of God nothing but omnipotent power could have done it The contagion despised all medicine death raged in every corner and had it gone on as it did then a few weeks more would have cleared the town of all and everything that had a soul Men everywhere began to despair every heart failed them for fear people were made desperate through the anguish of their souls and the terrors of death sat in the very faces and countenances of the people In that very moment when we might very well say Vain was the help of man I say in that very moment it pleased God with a most agreeable surprise to cause the fury of it to abate even of itself and the malignity declining as I have said though infinite numbers were sick yet fewer died and the very first weeks bill decreased eighteen forty three a vast number indeed It is impossible to express the change that appeared in the very countenances of the people that Thursday morning when the weekly bill came out It might have been perceived in their countenances that a secret surprise and smile of joy sat on everybody s face They shook one another by the hands in the streets who would hardly go on the same side of the way with one another before Where the streets were not too broad they would open their windows and call from one house to another and ask how they did and if they had heard the good news that the plague was abated Some would return when they said good news and ask What good news and when they answered that the plague was abated and the bills decreased almost two thousand they would cry out God be praised I and would weep aloud for joy telling them they had heard nothing of it and such was the joy of the people that it was as it were life to them from the grave I could almost set down as many extravagant things done in the excess of their joy as of their grief but that would be to lessen the value of it I must confess myself to have been very much dejected just before this happened for the prodigious number that were taken sick the week or two before besides those that died was such and the lamentations were so great everywhere that a man must have seemed to have acted even against his reason if he had so much as expected to escape and as there was hardly a house but mine in all my neighbourhood but was infected so had it gone on it would not have been long that there would have been any more neighbours to be infected Indeed it is hardly credible what dreadful havoc the last three weeks had made for if I might believe the person whose calculations I always found very well grounded there were not less than thirty thousand people dead and near one hundred point zero fallen sick in the three weeks I speak of for the number that sickened was surprising indeed it was astonishing and those whose courage upheld them all the time before sank under it now In the middle of their distress when the condition of the city of London was so truly calamitous just then it pleased God as it were by His immediate hand to disarm this enemy the poison was taken out of the sting It was wonderful even the physicians themselves were surprised at it Wherever they visited they found their patients better either they had sweated kindly or the tumours were broke or the carbuncles went down and the inflammations round them changed colour or the fever was gone or the violent headache was assuaged or some good symptom was in the case so that in a few days everybody was recovering whole families that were infected and down that had ministers praying with them and expected death every hour were revived and healed and none died at all out of them Nor was this by any new medicine found out or new method of cure discovered or by any experience in the operation which the physicians or surgeons attained to but it was evidently from the secret invisible hand of Him that had at first sent this disease as a judgement upon us and let the atheistic part of mankind call my saying what they please it is no enthusiasm it was acknowledged at that time by all mankind The disease was enervated and its malignity spent and let it proceed from whencesoever it will let the philosophers search for reasons in nature to account for it by and labour as much as they will to lessen the debt they owe to their Maker those physicians who had the least share of religion in them were obliged to acknowledge that it was all supernatural that it was extraordinary and that no account could be given of it If I should say that this is a visible summons to us all to thankfulness especially we that were under the terror of its increase perhaps it may be thought by some after the sense of the thing was over an officious canting of religious things preaching a sermon instead of writing a history making myself a teacher instead of giving my observations of things and this restrains me very much from going on here as I might otherwise do But if ten lepers Were healed and but one returned to give thanks I desire to be as that one and to be thankful for myself Nor will I deny but there were abundance of people who to all appearance were very thankful at that time for their mouths were stopped even the mouths of those whose hearts were not extraordinary long affected with it But the impression was so strong at that time that it could not be resisted no not by the worst of the people It was a common thing to meet people in the street that were strangers and that we knew nothing at all of expressing their surprise Going one day through Aldgate and a pretty many people being passing and repassing there comes a man out of the end of the Minories and looking a little up the street and down he throws his hands abroad Lord what an alteration is here I Why last week I came along here and hardly anybody was to be seen Another man I heard him adds to his words Tis all wonderful tis all a dream Blessed be God says a third man and and let us give thanks to Him for tis all His own doing human help and human skill was at an end These were all strangers to one another But such salutations as these were frequent in the street every day and in spite of a loose behaviour the very common people went along the streets giving God thanks for their deliverance It was now as I said before the people had cast off all apprehensions and that too fast indeed we were no more afraid now to pass by a man with a white cap upon his head or with a doth wrapt round his neck or with his leg limping occasioned by the sores in his groin all which were frightful to the last degree but the week before But now the street was full of them and these poor recovering creatures give them their due appeared very sensible of their unexpected deliverance and I should wrong them very much if I should not acknowledge that I believe many of them were really thankful But I must own that for the generality of the people it might too justly be said of them as was said of the children of Israel after their being delivered from the host of Pharaoh when they passed the Red Sea and looked back and saw the Egyptians overwhelmed in the water viz that they sang His praise but they soon forgot His works I can go no farther here I should be counted censorious and perhaps unjust if I should enter into the unpleasing work of reflecting whatever cause there was for it upon the unthankfulness and return of all manner of wickedness among us which I was so much an eye witness of myself I shall conclude the account of this calamitous year therefore with a coarse but sincere stanza of my own which I placed at the end of my ordinary memorandums the same year they were written A dreadful plague in London was In the year sixty five Which swept an hundred thousand souls Away yet I alive H F End of Project Gutenberg s A Journal of the Plague Year by Daniel Defoe END OF
