MERE MOTHER AGNES OF JESUS IN GRATEFUL MEMORY OF INNUMERABLE KINDNESSES EXTENDING OVER MANY YEARS PREFACE As we become acquainted with the histories of those in whom in long succession God has been pleased to show forth examples of holiness of life it seems as if every phase of human existence had in the history of the Church received its consecration as a power to bring men nearer to their Maker But there is no limit to the types of sanctity which the Creator is pleased to unfold before His Creatures To many on reading for the first time the story of Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and of the Holy Face it came almost as a shock to find a very youthful member of an austere Order strictly retired from the world engaged in hidden prayer and mortification appearing before us to reveal to the whole world the wonders of the close intimacy of friendship to which her Divine Spouse had been pleased to call her Certainly the way by which Soeur Therese was led is not the normal life of Carmel nor hers the manner whereby most Carmelites are called to accomplish the wondrous apostolate of intercession to which their lives are given But no less certain is it that in her particular case her work for God and her apostolate were not to be confined between the walls of her religious home or to be limited by her few years on earth In the first place we know that it was by obedience that the record of God s dealings with her soul were set down in writing And again the long tale of graces granted in such strange profusion through her intercession is proof sufficient that it was not without Divine permission and guidance that the history of her special and peculiar vocation has become the property of all Catholics in every land It is for God to keep and for Him to make known the secrets of His Love for men And in the case of Soeur Therese it has been His Will to divulge His secrets in most generous consideration for our needs What are the hidden treasures which Our Divine Master thus reveals to us through His chosen little servant It is the old story of simplicity in God s service of the perfect accomplishment of small recurring duties of trustful confidence in Him who made and has redeemed and sanctified us Humility self effacement obedience hiddenness unfaltering charity with all the self control and constant effort that they imply are written on every page of the history of this little Saint And as we turn its pages the lesson is borne in upon our souls that there is no surer nor safer way of pleasing Our Father Who is in Heaven than by remaining ever as little children in His sight Doubtless for many of her clients whose hearts are kindled as they read this book Soeur Therese will obtain as she has done so often in the past wonderful gifts for health of soul and body But may she win for all of us without exception a deep and fruitful conviction of the unchanging truth that unless we become as little children in the doing of our Heavenly Father s Will we cannot enter into our Eternal Home FRANCIS CARDINAL BOURNE Archbishop of Westminster Feast of the Presentation of Our Blessed Lady nineteen twelve PROLOGUE THE PARENTAGE BIRTH OF MARIE FRANCOISE THERESE MARTIN In the month of September eighteen forty three a young man of twenty climbed the mountain of the Great saint Bernard His eyes shone with a holy enthusiasm as the splendour of the Alps stirred to the depths his responsive nature Presently accustomed as they were to discern God s beauty in the beauty of His handiwork they glistened with tears He paused for a space then continuing his journey soon reached the celebrated monastery that like a beacon on those heights darts afar its beams of faith and magnificent charity The Prior struck by the frank and open countenance of his guest welcomed him with more than wonted hospitality Louis Joseph Stanislaus Martin was the pilgrim s name He was born on August twenty two eighteen twenty three at Bordeaux while his father a brave and devout soldier was captain in the garrison there God has predestined this little one for Himself said the saintly Bishop of Bordeaux on the occasion of his baptism and events have proved the truth of his words From this town by the banks of the Garonne his parents went to Alencon in lower Normandy and there in their new home as in their old one Louis was the cherished Benjamin It was not the loveliness of Swiss lakes and mountains and skies that had drawn the traveller from distant Alencon He came to the monastery and his journey was chiefly on foot to consecrate his days to God On learning his purpose the Prior questioned him upon his knowledge of Latin only to discover that the young aspirant had not completed his course of studies in that language I am indeed sorry my child said the venerable monk since this is an essential condition but you must not be disheartened Go back to your own country apply yourself diligently and when you have ended your studies we shall receive you with open arms Louis was disappointed He set out for home for exile he would have said but ere long he saw clearly that his life was to be dedicated to God in another and equally fruitful way and that the Alpine monastery was to be nothing more to him than a sweet memory A few years after the vain quest of Louis Martin a similar scene was enacted in Alencon itself Accompanied by her mother Zelie Guerin an attractive and pious girl presented herself at the Convent of the Sisters of Charity in the hope of gaining admission For years it had been her desire to share the Sisters work but this was not to be In the interview that followed the Superioress guided by the Holy Ghost decided unhesitatingly that Zelie s vocation was not for the religious life God wanted her in the world and so she returned to her parents and to the companionship of her elder sister and her younger brother Shortly afterwards the gates of the Visitation Convent at Le Mans closed upon her beloved sister and Zelie s thoughts turned to the Sacrament of Holy Matrimony O my God she repeated constantly since I am unworthy to be Thy Spouse like my dear sister I shall enter the married state to fulfill Thy Holy Will and I beseech Thee to make me the mother of many children and to grant that all of them may be dedicated to Thee God gave ear to her prayer and His Finger was visible in the circumstances which led to her becoming the wife of Louis Martin on July twelve eighteen fifty eight in Alencon s lovely Church of Notre Dame Like the chaste Tobias they were joined together in matrimony solely for the love of children in whom God s Name might be blessed for ever and ever Nine white flowers bloomed in this sacred garden Of the nine four were transplanted to Paradise ere their buds had quite unfolded while five were gathered in God s walled gardens upon earth one entering the Visitation Convent at Caen the others the Carmel of Lisieux From the cradle all were dedicated to Mary Immaculate and all received her name Marie Louise Marie Pauline Marie Leonie Marie Helene who died at the age of four and a half Marie Joseph Louis Marie Joseph Jean Baptiste Marie Celine Marie Melanie Therese who died when three months old and lastly Marie Francoise Therese The two boys were the fruit of prayers and tears After the birth of the four elder girls their parents entreated saint Joseph to obtain for them the favour of a son who should become a priest and a missionary Marie Joseph soon was given them and his pretty ways appealed to all hearts but only five months had run their course when Heaven demanded what it had lent Then followed more urgent novenas The grandeur of the Priesthood glorious upon earth ineffable in eternity was so well understood by those Christian parents that their hearts coveted it most dearly At all costs the family must have a Priest of the Lord one who would be an apostle peradventure a martyr But the thoughts of the Lord are not our thoughts His ways are not our ways Another little Joseph was born and with him hope once again grew strong Alas Nine months had scarcely passed when he too fled from this world and joined his angel brother They did not ask again Yet could the veil of the future have been lifted their heavy hearts would of a surety have been comforted A child was to be vouchsafed them who would be a herald of Divine love not to China alone but to all the ends of the earth Nay they themselves were destined to shine as apostles and we read on one of the first pages of the Portuguese edition of the Autobiography these significant words of an eminent Jesuit To the Sacred Memory of Louis Joseph Stanislaus Martin and of Zelie Guerin the blessed parents of Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus for an example to all Christian parents They little dreamed of this future apostolate nevertheless they made ready their souls day by day to be God s own instruments in God s good time With most loving resignation they greeted the many crosses which the Lord laid upon them the Lord whose tender name of Father is truest in the dark hour of trial Every morning saw them at Mass together they knelt at the Holy Table They strictly observed the fasts and abstinences of the Church kept Sunday as a day of complete rest from work in spite of the remonstrance of friends and found in pious reading their most delightful recreation They prayed in common after the touching example of Captain Martin whose devout way of repeating the Our Father brought tears to all eyes Thus the great Christian virtues flourished in their home Wealth did not bring luxury in its train and a strict simplicity was invariably observed How mistaken are the great majority of men Madame Martin used often to say If they are rich they at once desire honours and if these are obtained they are still unhappy for never can that heart be satisfied which seeks anything but God Her whole ambition as a mother was directed to Heaven Four of my children are already well settled in life she once wrote and the others will go likewise to that Heavenly Kingdom enriched with greater merit because the combat will have been more prolonged Charity in all its forms was a natural outlet to the piety of these simple hearts Husband and wife set aside each year a considerable portion of their earnings for the Propagation of the Faith they relieved poor persons in distress and ministered to them with their own hands On one occasion Monsieur Martin like a good Samaritan was seen to raise a drunken man from the ground in a busy thoroughfare take his bag of tools support him on his arm and lead him home Another time when he saw in a railway station a poor and starving epileptic without the means to return to his distant home he was so touched with pity that he took off his hat and placing in it an alms proceeded to beg from the passengers on behalf of the sufferer Money poured in and it was with a heart brimming over with gratitude that the sick man blessed his benefactor Never did he allow the meannesses of human respect to degrade his Christian dignity In whatever company he might be he always saluted the Blessed Sacrament when passing a Church and he never met a priest without paying him a mark of respect A word from his lips sufficed to silence whosoever dared blaspheme in his presence In reward for his virtues God showered even temporal blessings on His faithful servant In eighteen seventy one he was able to give up his business as a jeweller and retire to a house in the Rue saint Blaise The making of point lace however begun by Madame Martin was still carried on In that house the Little Flower of Jesus first saw the sunshine Again and again in the pages of her Autobiography she calls herself by this modest name of the Little Flower emblematic of her humility her purity her simplicity and it may be added of the poetry of her soul The reader will learn in the Epilogue how it was also used by one of her favourite martyr saints the now Blessed Theophane Venard On the manuscript of her Autobiography she set the title The Story of the Springtime of a little white Flower and in truth such it was for long ere the rigours of life s winter came round the Flower was blossoming in Paradise It was however in mid winter January two eighteen seventy three that this ninth child of Louis Martin and Zelie Guerin was born Marie and Pauline were at home for the Christmas holidays from the Visitation Convent at Le Mans and though there was it is true a slight disappointment that the future priest was still denied them it quickly passed and the little one was regarded as a special gift from Heaven Later on her beloved Father delighted in calling her his Little Queen adding at times the high sounding titles Of France and Navarre The Little Queen was indeed well received that winter s morning and in the course of the day a poor waif rang timidly at the door of the happy home and presented a paper bearing the following simple stanza Smile and swiftly grow All beckons thee to joy Sweet love and tenderest care Smile gladly at the dawn Bud of an hour for thou Shalt be a stately rose It was a charming prophecy for the bud unfolded its petals and became a rose a rose of love but not for long for the space of a morn On January four she was carried to the Church of Notre Dame to receive the Sacrament of Baptism her eldest sister Marie was her godmother and she was given the name of Marie Francoise Therese one All was joy at first but soon the tender bud drooped on its delicate stem little hope was held out it must wither and die You must pray to saint Francis de Sales wrote her aunt from the convent at Le Mans and you must promise if the child recovers to call her by her second name Frances This was a sword thrust for the Mother Leaning over the cradle of her Therese she awaited the coming of the end saying Only when the last hope has gone will I promise to call her Frances The gentle saint Francis waived his claim in favour of the great Reformer of the Carmelite Order the child recovered and so retained her sweet name of Therese Sorrow however was mixed with the Mother s joy when it became necessary to send the babe to a foster mother in the country There the little rose bud grew in beauty and after some months had gained strength sufficient to allow of her being brought back to Alencon Her memory of this short but happy time spent with her sainted Mother in the Rue saint Blaise was extraordinarily vivid To day a tablet on the balcony of No forty two informs the passers by that here was born a certain Carmelite by name Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face Fifteen years have gone since the meeting in Heaven of Madame Martin and her Carmelite child and if the pilgrimage to where the Little Flower first saw the light of day be not so large as that to the grave where her remains await their glorious resurrection it may nevertheless be numbered in thousands And to the English speaking pilgrim there is an added pleasure in the fact that her most notable convert the first minister of the United Free Church of Scotland to enter the True Fold performs with his convert wife the courteous duties of host It will not be amiss to say a brief word here on the brother and sister of Madame Martin Her sister in religion Sister Marie Dosithea led a life so holy at Le Mans that she was cited by Dom Gueranger perhaps the most distinguished Benedictine of the nineteenth century as the model of a perfect nun By her own confession she had never been guilty from earliest childhood of the smallest deliberate fault She died on February twenty four eighteen seventy seven It was in the convent made fragrant by such holiness that her niece Pauline Martin elder sister and little mother of Therese and for five years her Prioress at the Carmel received her education And if the Little Flower may have imbibed the liturgical spirit from her teachers the daughters of saint Benedict in Lisieux so that she could say before her death I do not think it is possible for anyone to have desired more than I to assist properly at choir and to recite perfectly the Divine Office may it not be to the influences from Le Mans that may be traced something of the honey sweet spirit of saint Francis de Sales which pervades the pages of the Autobiography With the brother of Zelie Guerin the reader will make acquaintance in the narrative of Therese He was a chemist in Lisieux and it was there his daughter Jeanne Guerin married doctor La Neele and his younger child Marie entered the Carmel Our foreign missionaries had a warm friend in the uncle of Therese for his charities he was made godfather to an African King and to the Catholic Press that home missionary he was ever most devoted Founder at Lisieux of the Nocturnal Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament and a zealous member of the Society of saint Vincent de Paul he was called to his abundant reward on September twenty eight nineteen oh nine Verily the lamp of faith is not extinct in the land of the Norman The Father of Therese after the death of his wife likewise made his home in the delightful town which lies amid the beautiful apple orchards of the valley of the Touques Lisieux is deeply interesting by reason of its fine old churches of saint Jacques and saint Pierre and its wonderful specimens of quaint houses some of which date from the twelfth century In matters of faith it is neither fervent nor hostile and in eighteen seventy seven its inhabitants little thought that through their new citizen Marie Francoise Therese Martin their town would be rendered immortal The cell at Lisieux reminds us of the cell of the Blessed Gabriel at Isola There is the same even tenor of way the same magnificant fidelity in little things the same flames of divine charity consuming but concealed Nazareth with the simplicity of its Child and the calm abysmal love of Mary and Joseph Nazareth adorable but imitable gives the key to her spirit and her Autobiography does but repeat the lessons of the thirty hidden years two And it repeats them with an unrivalled charm This master of asceticism writes a biographer three of saint Ignatius Loyola loved the garden and loved the flowers In the balcony of his study he sat gazing on the stars it was then Lainez heard him say Oh how earth grows base to me when I look on Heaven The like imaginative strain so scorned of our petty day inhered in all the lofty souls of that age Even the Saints of our day speak a less radiant language and sanctity shows shorn of its rays through the black fog of universal utilitarianism the materiality which men have drawn into the very lungs of their souls This is not true of the sainted authoress of the chapters that follow less radiant in the medium of a translation In her own inimitable pages as in those of a Campion or an Ignatius a Teresa of Avila or a John of the Cross the Spirit of Poetry is the handmaiden of Holiness This new lover of flowers and student of the stars this strewer of roses has uplifted a million hearts from the base earth and black fog to the very throne of God and her mission is as yet but begun The pen of Soeur Therese herself must now take up the narrative It will do so in words that do not merely tell of love but set the heart on fire and at the same time lay bare the workings of God in a soul that since the age of three never refused the Good God anything The writing of this Autobiography was an act of obedience and the Prioress who imposed the task sought in all simplicity her own personal edification But the fragrance of its pages was such that she was advised to publish them to the world She did so in eighteen ninety nine under the title of L Histoire d une Ame An English version by M H Dziewicki appeared in nineteen oh one This new translation relates more fully the story of the childhood girlhood and brief convent days of Soeur Therese It tells of her Roses and sets forth again in our world wide tongue her world wide embassy the ever ancient message of God s Merciful Love the ever new way to Him of confidence and self surrender The Editor one The baptismal entry with its numerous signatures is shown to visitors and a tablet in the baptistry of the beautiful Gothic church tells the pilgrim that here the Little Queen was made a child of God Ed two As Little Children the abridged life of Soeur Therese Published at the Orphans Press Rochdale three Francis Thompson THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF SOEUR THERESE OF LISIEUX ENTITLED BY HERSELF THE STORY OF THE SPRINGTIME OF A LITTLE WHITE FLOWER CHAPTER I EARLIEST MEMORIES It is to you dear Mother that I am about to confide the story of my soul When you asked me to write it I feared the task might unsettle me but since then Our Lord has deigned to make me understand that by simple obedience I shall please Him best I begin therefore to sing what must be my eternal song the Mercies of the Lord one Before setting about my task I knelt before the statue of Our Lady which had given my family so many proofs of Our Heavenly Mother s loving care two As I knelt I begged of that dear Mother to guide my hand and thus ensure that only what was pleasing to her should find place here Then opening the Gospels my eyes fell on these words Jesus going up into a mountain called unto Him whom He would Himself three They threw a clear light upon the mystery of my vocation and of my entire life and above all upon the favours which Our Lord has granted to my soul He does not call those who are worthy but those whom He will As saint Paul says God will have mercy on whom He will have mercy four So then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth mercy five I often asked myself why God had preferences why all souls did not receive an equal measure of grace I was filled with wonder when I saw extraordinary favours showered on great sinners like saint Paul saint Augustine saint Mary Magdalen and many others whom He forced so to speak to receive His grace In reading the lives of the Saints I was surprised to see that there were certain privileged souls whom Our Lord favoured from the cradle to the grave allowing no obstacle in their path which might keep them from mounting towards Him permitting no sin to soil the spotless brightness of their baptismal robe And again it puzzled me why so many poor savages should die without having even heard the name of God Our Lord has deigned to explain this mystery to me He showed me the book of nature and I understood that every flower created by Him is beautiful that the brilliance of the rose and the whiteness of the lily do not lessen the perfume of the violet or the sweet simplicity of the daisy I understood that if all the lowly flowers wished to be roses nature would lose its springtide beauty and the fields would no longer be enamelled with lovely hues And so it is in the world of souls Our Lord s living garden He has been pleased to create great Saints who may be compared to the lily and the rose but He has also created lesser ones who must be content to be daisies or simple violets flowering at His Feet and whose mission it is to gladden His Divine Eyes when He deigns to look down on them And the more gladly they do His Will the greater is their perfection I understood this also that God s Love is made manifest as well in a simple soul which does not resist His grace as in one more highly endowed In fact the characteristic of love being self abasement if all souls resembled the holy Doctors who have illuminated the Church it seems that God in coming to them would not stoop low enough But He has created the little child who knows nothing and can but utter feeble cries and the poor savage who has only the natural law to guide him and it is to their hearts that He deigns to stoop These are the field flowers whose simplicity charms Him and by His condescension to them Our Saviour shows His infinite greatness As the sun shines both on the cedar and on the floweret so the Divine Sun illumines every soul great and small and all correspond to His care just as in nature the seasons are so disposed that on the appointed day the humblest daisy shall unfold its petals You will wonder dear Mother to what all this is leading for till now I have said nothing that sounds like the story of my life but did you not tell me to write quite freely whatever came into my mind So it will not be my life properly speaking that you will find in these pages but my thoughts about the graces which it has pleased Our Lord to bestow on me I am now at a time of life when I can look back on the past for my soul has been refined in the crucible of interior and exterior trials Now like a flower after the storm I can raise my head and see that the words of the Psalm are realised in me The Lord is my Shepherd and I shall want nothing He hath set me in a place of pasture He hath brought me up on the water of refreshment He hath converted my soul He hath led me on the paths of justice for His own Name s sake For though I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death I will fear no evils for Thou are with me six Yes to me Our Lord has always been compassionate and merciful long suffering and plenteous in mercy seven And so it gives me great joy dear Mother to come to you and sing His unspeakable mercies It is for you alone that I write the story of the little flower gathered by Jesus This thought will help me to speak freely without troubling either about style or about the many digressions that I shall make for a Mother s heart always understands her child even when it can only lisp and so I am sure of being understood and my meaning appreciated If a little flower could speak it seems to me that it would tell us quite simply all that God has done for it without hiding any of its gifts It would not under the pretext of humility say that it was not pretty or that it had not a sweet scent that the sun had withered its petals or the storm bruised its stem if it knew that such were not the case The Little Flower that now tells her tale rejoiced in having to publish the wholly undeserved favours bestowed upon her by Our Lord She knows that she had nothing in herself worthy of attracting Him His Mercy alone showered blessings on her He allowed her to grow in holy soil enriched with the odour of purity and preceded by eight lilies of shining whiteness In His Love He willed to preserve her from the poisoned breath of the world hardly had her petals unfolded when this good Master transplanted her to the mountain of Carmel Our Lady s chosen garden And now dear Mother having summed up in a few words all that God s goodness has done for me I will relate in detail the story of my childhood I know that though to others it may seem wearisome your motherly heart will find pleasure in it In the story of my soul up to the time of my entry into the Carmel there are three clearly marked periods the first in spite of its shortness is by no means the least rich in memories It extends from the dawn of reason to the death of my dearly loved Mother in other words till I was four years and eight months old God in His goodness did me the favour of awakening my intelligence very early and He has imprinted the recollections of my childhood so deeply in my memory that past events seem to have happened but yesterday Without doubt He wished to make me know and appreciate the Mother He had given me Alas His Divine Hand soon took her from me to crown her in Heaven All my life it has pleased Him to surround me with affection My first recollections are of loving smiles and tender caresses but if He made others love me so much He made me love them too for I was of an affectionate nature You can hardly imagine how much I loved my Father and Mother and being very demonstrative I showed my love in a thousand little ways though the means I employed make me smile now when I think of them Dear Mother you have given me the letters which my Mother wrote at this time to Pauline who was at school at the Visitation Convent at Le Mans I remember perfectly the events they refer to but it will be easier for me simply to quote some passages though these charming letters inspired by a Mother s love are too often full of my praises In proof of what I have said about my way of showing affection for my parents here is an example Baby is the dearest little rogue she comes to kiss me and at the same time wishes me to die Oh how I wish you would die dear Mamma she said and when she was scolded she was quite astonished and answered But I want you to go to Heaven and you say we must die to go there and in her outburst of affection for her Father she wishes him to die too The dear little thing will hardly leave me she follows me everywhere but likes going into the garden best when I am not there she refuses to stay and cries so much that they are obliged to bring her back She will not even go upstairs alone without calling me at each step Mamma Mamma and if I forget to answer Yes darling she waits where she is and will not move I was nearly three years old when my Mother wrote Little Therese asked me the other day if she would go to Heaven Yes if you are good I told her Oh Mamma she answered then if I am not good shall I go to Hell Well you know what I will do I shall fly to you in Heaven and you will hold me tight in your arms and how could God take me away then I saw that she was convinced that God could do nothing to her if she hid herself in my arms Marie loves her little sister very much indeed she is a child who delights us all She is extraordinarily outspoken and it is charming to see her run after me to confess her childish faults Mamma I have pushed Celine I slapped her once but I ll not do it again The moment she has done anything mischievous everyone must know Yesterday without meaning to do so she tore off a small piece of wall paper you would have been sorry for her she wanted to tell her father immediately When he came home four hours later everyone else had forgotten about it but she ran at once to Marie saying Tell Papa that I tore the paper She waited there like a criminal for sentence but she thinks she is more easily forgiven if she accuses herself Papa s name fills me with many happy memories Mamma laughingly said he always did whatever I wanted but he answered Well why not She is the Queen Then he would lift me on to his shoulder and caress me in all sorts of ways Yet I cannot say that he spoilt me I remember one day while I was swinging he called out as he passed Come and kiss me little Queen Contrary to my usual custom I would not stir and answered pertly You must come for it Papa He refused quite rightly and went away Marie was there and scolded me saying How naughty to answer Papa like that Her reproof took effect I got off the swing at once and the whole house resounded with my cries I hurried upstairs not waiting this time to call Mamma at each step my one thought was to find Papa and make my peace with him I need not tell you that this was soon done I could not bear to think I had grieved my beloved parents and I acknowledged my faults instantly as this little anecdote related by my Mother will show One morning before going downstairs I wanted to kiss Therese she seemed to be fast asleep and I did not like to wake her but Marie said Mamma I am sure she is only pretending So I bent down to kiss her forehead and immediately she hid herself under the clothes saying in the tone of a spoilt child I don t want anyone to look at me I was not pleased with her and told her so A minute or two afterwards I heard her crying and was surprised to see her by my side She had got out of her cot by herself and had come downstairs with bare feet stumbling over her long nightdress Her little face was wet with tears Mamma she said throwing herself on my knee I am sorry for being naughty forgive me Pardon was quickly granted I took the little angel in my arms and pressed her to my heart smothering her with kisses I remember also my great affection for my eldest sister Marie who had just left school Without seeming to do so I took in all that I saw and heard and I think that I reflected on things then as I do now I listened attentively while she taught Celine and was very good and obedient so as to obtain the privilege of being allowed in the room during lessons She gave me many trifling presents which pleased me greatly I was proud of my two big sisters but as Pauline seemed so far away from us I thought of her all day long When I was only just learning to talk and Mamma asked What are you thinking about my answer invariably was Pauline Sometimes I heard people saying that Pauline would be a nun and without quite knowing what it meant I thought I will be a nun too This is one of my first recollections and I have never changed my mind so it was the example of this beloved sister which from the age of two drew me to the Divine Spouse of Virgins My dearest Mother what tender memories of Pauline I could confide to you here But it would take me too long Leonie had also a very warm place in my heart she loved me very much and her love was returned In the evening when she came home from school she used to take care of me while the others went out and it seems to me I can still hear the sweet songs she sang to put me to sleep I remember perfectly the day of her First Communion and I remember also her companion the poor child whom my Mother dressed according to the touching custom of the well to do families in Alencon This child did not leave Leonie for an instant on that happy day and in the evening at the grand dinner she sat in the place of honour Alas I was too small to stay up for this feast but I shared in it a little thanks to Papa s goodness for he came himself to bring his little Queen a piece of the iced cake The only one now left to speak of is Celine the companion of my childhood My memories of her are so many that I do not know which to choose We understood each other perfectly but I was much more forward and lively and far less ingenuous Here is a letter which will show you dear Mother how sweet was Celine and how naughty Therese I was then nearly three years old and Celine six and a half Celine is naturally inclined to be good as to the little puss Therese one cannot tell how she will turn out she is so young and heedless She is a very intelligent child but has not nearly so sweet a disposition as her sister and her stubbornness is almost unconquerable When she has said No nothing will make her change one could leave her all day in the cellar without getting her to say Yes She would sooner sleep there I had another fault also of which my Mother did not speak in her letters it was self love Here are two instances One day no doubt wishing to see how far my pride would go she smiled and said to me Therese if you will kiss the ground I will give you a halfpenny In those days a halfpenny was a fortune and in order to gain it I had not far to stoop for I was so tiny there was not much distance between me and the ground but my pride was up in arms and holding myself very erect I said No thank you Mamma I would rather go without it Another time we were going into the country to see some friends Mamma told Marie to put on my prettiest frock but not to let me have bare arms I did not say a word and appeared as indifferent as children of that age should be but I said to myself I should have looked much prettier with bare arms With such a disposition I feel sure that had I been brought up by careless parents I should have become very wicked and perhaps have lost my soul But Jesus watched over His little Spouse and turned even her faults to advantage for being checked early in life they became a means of leading her towards perfection For instance as I had great self love and an innate love of good as well it was enough to tell me once You must not do that and I never wanted to do it again Having only good example before my eyes I naturally wished to follow it and I see with pleasure in my Mother s letters that as I grew older I began to be a greater comfort This is what she writes in eighteen seventy six Even Therese is anxious to make sacrifices Marie has given her little sisters a string of beads on purpose to count their acts of self denial They have really spiritual but very amusing conversations together Celine said the other day How can God be in such a tiny Host Therese answered That is not strange because God is Almighty And what does Almighty mean It means that He can do whatever He likes But it is more amusing still to see Therese put her hand in her pocket time after time to pull a bead along the string whenever she makes a little sacrifice The children are inseparable and are quite sufficient company for one another Nurse has given Therese two bantams and every day after dinner she and Celine sit by the fire and play with them One morning Therese got out of her cot and climbed into Celine s The nurse went to fetch her to be dressed and when at last she found her the little thing said hugging her sister very hard Oh Louise leave me here don t you see that we are like the little white bantams we can t be separated from one another It is quite true that I could not be separated from Celine I would rather leave my dessert unfinished at table than let her go without me and I would get down from my high chair when she did and off we went to play together On Sundays as I was still too small to go to the long services Mamma stayed at home to take care of me I was always very good walking about on tip toe but as soon as I heard the door open there was a tremendous outburst of joy I threw myself on my dear little sister exclaiming Oh Celine give me the blessed bread quick eight One day she had not brought any what was to be done I could not do without it for I called this little feast my Mass A bright idea struck me You have no blessed bread make some Celine immediately opened the cupboard took out the bread cut a tiny bit off and after saying a Hail Mary quite solemnly over it triumphantly presented it to me and I making the sign of the Cross ate it with devotion fancying it tasted exactly like the real blessed bread One day Leonie thinking no doubt that she was too big to play with dolls brought us a basket filled with clothes pretty pieces of stuff and other trifles on which her doll was laid Here dears she said choose whatever you like Celine looked at it and took a woollen ball After thinking about it for a minute I put out my hand saying I choose everything and I carried off both doll and basket without more ado This childish incident was a forecast so to speak of my whole life Later on when the way of perfection was opened out before me I realised that in order to become a Saint one must suffer much always seek the most perfect path and forget oneself I also understood that there are many degrees of holiness that each soul is free to respond to the calls of Our Lord to do much or little for His Love in a word to choose amongst the sacrifices He asks And then also as in the days of my childhood I cried out My God I choose everything I will not be a Saint by halves I am not afraid of suffering for Thee I only fear one thing and that is to do my own will Accept the offering of my will for I choose all that Thou willest But dear Mother I am forgetting myself I must not tell you yet of my girlhood I am still speaking of the baby of three and four years old I remember a dream I had at that age which impressed itself very deeply on my memory I thought I was walking alone in the garden when suddenly I saw near the arbour two hideous little devils dancing with surprising agility on a barrel of lime in spite of the heavy irons attached to their feet At first they cast fiery glances at me then as though suddenly terrified I saw them in the twinkling of an eye throw themselves down to the bottom of the barrel from which they came out somehow only to run and hide themselves in the laundry which opened into the garden Finding them such cowards I wanted to know what they were going to do and overcoming my fears I went to the window The wretched little creatures were there running about on the tables not knowing how to hide themselves from my gaze From time to time they came nearer peering through the windows with an uneasy air then seeing that I was still there they began to run about again looking quite desperate Of course this dream was nothing extraordinary yet I think Our Lord made use of it to show me that a soul in the state of grace has nothing to fear from the devil who is a coward and will even fly from the gaze of a little child Dear Mother how happy I was at that age I was beginning to enjoy life and goodness itself seemed full of charms Probably my character was the same as it is now for even then I had great self command and made a practice of never complaining when my things were taken even if I was unjustly accused I preferred to keep silence There was no merit in this for I did it naturally How quickly those sunny years of my childhood passed away and what tender memories they have imprinted on my mind I remember the Sunday walks when my dear Mother always accompanied us and I can still feel the impression made on my childish heart at the sight of the fields bright with cornflowers poppies and marguerites Even at that age I loved far stretching views sunlit spaces and stately trees in a word all nature charmed me and lifted up my soul to Heaven Often during these walks we met poor people I was always chosen to give them an alms which made me feel very happy Sometimes my dear Father knowing the way was too long for his little Queen took me home This was a cause of grief and to console me Celine would fill her basket with daisies and give them to me on her return Truly everything on earth smiled on me I found flowers strewn at every step and my naturally happy disposition helped to make life bright But a new era was about to dawn I was to be the Spouse of Our Lord at such an early age that it was necessary I should suffer from my childhood As the early spring flowers begin to come up under the snow and open at the first rays of the sun so the Little Flower whose story I am writing had to pass through the winter of trial and to have her tender cup filled with the dew of tears one Ps eighty eight eighty nine one two This statue twice appeared as if endowed with life in order to enlighten and console Mme Martin mother of Therese A like favour was granted to Therese herself as will be seen in the course of the narrative three Mark three thirteen four Cf Exodus thirty three nineteen five Cf Rom nine sixteen six Cf Ps twenty two twenty three one four seven Ps one hundred two one hundred three eight eight The custom still prevails in some parts of France of blessing bread at the Offertory of the Mass and then distributing it to the faithful It is known as pain benit This blessing only takes place at the Parochial Mass Ed CHAPTER II A CATHOLIC HOUSEHOLD All the details of my Mother s illness are still fresh in my mind I remember especially her last weeks on earth when Celine and I felt like poor little exiles Every morning a friend came to fetch us and we spent the day with her Once we had not had time to say our prayers before starting and on the way my little sister whispered Must we tell her that we have not said our prayers Yes I answered So very timidly Celine confided our secret to her and she exclaimed Well well children you shall say them Then she took us to a large room and left us there Celine looked at me in amazement I was equally astonished and exclaimed This is not like Mamma she always said our prayers with us During the day in spite of all efforts to amuse us the thought of our dear Mother was constantly in our minds I remember once when my sister had an apricot given to her she leant towards me and said We will not eat it I will give it to Mamma Alas our beloved Mother was now too ill to eat any earthly fruit she would never more be satisfied but by the glory of Heaven There she would drink of the mysterious wine which Jesus at His Last Supper promised to share with us in the Kingdom of His Father The touching ceremony of Extreme Unction made a deep impression on me I can still see the place where I knelt and hear my poor Father s sobs My dear Mother died on August twenty eight eighteen seventy seven in her forty sixth year The day after her death my Father took me in his arms and said Come and kiss your dear Mother for the last time Without saying a word I put my lips to her icy forehead I do not remember having cried much and I did not talk to anyone of all that filled my heart I looked and listened in silence and I saw many things they would have hidden from me Once I found myself close to the coffin in the passage I stood looking at it for a long time I had never seen one before but I knew what it was I was so small that I had to lift up my head to see its whole length and it seemed to me very big and very sad Fifteen years later I was again standing by another coffin that of our holy Mother Genevieve one and I was carried back to the days of my childhood Memories crowded upon me it was the same little Therese who looked at it but she had grown and the coffin seemed small She had not to lift up her head to it now she only raised her eyes to contemplate Heaven which seemed to her very full of joy for trials had matured and strengthened her soul so that nothing on earth could make her grieve Our Lord did not leave me wholly an orphan on the day of my Mother s funeral He gave me another mother and allowed me to choose her freely We were all five together looking at one another sadly when our nurse overcome with emotion said turning to Celine and to me Poor little dears you no longer have a Mother Then Celine threw herself into Marie s arms crying Well you will be my Mother now I was so accustomed to imitate Celine that I should undoubtedly have followed her example but I feared Pauline would be sad and feel herself left out if she too had not a little daughter So with a loving look I hid my face on her breast saying in my turn And Pauline will be my Mother That day as I have said began the second period of my life It was the most sorrowful of all especially after Pauline my second Mother entered the Carmel and it lasted from the time I was four years old until I was fourteen when I recovered much of my childish gaiety even though I understood more fully the serious side of life I must tell you that after my Mother s death my naturally happy disposition completely changed Instead of being lively and demonstrative as I had been I became timid shy and extremely sensitive a look was enough to make me burst into tears I could not bear to be noticed or to meet strangers and was only at ease in my own family circle There I was always cherished with the most loving care my Father s affectionate heart seemed endowed with a mother s love and my sisters were no less tender and devoted If Our Lord had not lavished so much love and sunshine on His Little Flower she never could have become acclimatised to this earth Still too weak to bear the storm she needed warmth refreshing dew and soft breezes and these gifts were never wanting to her even in the chilling seasons of trials Soon after my Mother s death Papa made up his mind to leave Alencon and live at Lisieux so that we might be near our uncle my Mother s brother He made this sacrifice in order that my young sisters should have the benefit of their aunt s guidance in their new life and that she might act as a mother towards them I did not feel any grief at leaving my native town children love change and anything out of the common and so I was pleased to come to Lisieux I remember the journey quite well and our arrival in the evening at my uncle s house and I can still see my little cousins Jeanne and Marie waiting on the doorstep with my aunt How touching was the affection all these dear ones showed us The next day they took us to our new home Les Buissonets two situated in a quiet part of the town I was charmed with the house my Father had taken The large upper window from which there was an extensive view the flower garden in front and the kitchen garden at the back all these seemed delightfully new to my childish mind and this happy home became the scene of many joys and of family gatherings which I can never forget Elsewhere as I said before I felt an exile I cried and fretted for my Mother but here my little heart expanded and I smiled on life once more When I woke there were my sisters ready to caress me and I said my prayers kneeling between them Then Pauline gave me my reading lesson and I remember that Heaven was the first word I could read alone When lessons were over I went upstairs where Papa was generally to be found and how pleased I was when I had good marks to show Every afternoon I went out for a walk with him and we paid a visit to the Blessed Sacrament in one or other of the Churches It was in this way that I first saw the Chapel of the Carmel Look little Queen Papa said to me behind that big grating there are holy nuns who are always praying to Almighty God Little did I think that nine years later I should be amongst them that in this blessed Carmel I should receive so many graces On returning home I learnt my lessons and then spent the rest of the day playing in the garden near Papa I never cared for dolls but one of my favourite amusements was making coloured mixtures with seeds and the bark of trees If the colours were pretty I would promptly offer them to Papa in a little cup and entice him to taste them then my dearest Father would leave his work and smilingly pretend to drink I was very fond of flowers and amused myself by making little altars in holes which I happened to find in the middle of my garden wall When finished I would run and call Papa and he seemed delighted with them I should never stop if I told you of the thousand and one incidents of this kind that I can remember How shall I make you understand the love that my Father lavished on his little Queen Those were specially happy days for me when I went fishing with my dear King as I used to call him Sometimes I tried my hand with a small rod of my own but generally I preferred to sit on the grass some distance away Then my reflections became really deep and without knowing what meditation meant my soul was absorbed in prayer Far off sounds reached me the murmuring of the wind sometimes a few uncertain notes of music from a military band in the town a long way off all this imparted a touch of melancholy to my thoughts Earth seemed a place of exile and I dreamed of Heaven The afternoon passed quickly away and it was soon time to go home but before packing up I would eat the provisions I had brought in a small basket Somehow the slices of bread and jam prepared by my sisters looked different they had seemed so tempting and now they looked stale and uninviting Even such a trifle as this made the earth seem sadder and I realised that only in Heaven will there be unclouded joy Speaking of clouds I remember how one day when we were out the blue sky became overcast and a storm came on accompanied by vivid lightning I looked round on every side so as to lose nothing of the grand sight A thunderbolt fell in a field close by and far from feeling the least bit afraid I was delighted it seemed that God was so near Papa was not so pleased and put an end to my reverie for already the tall grass and daisies taller than I were sparkling with rain drops and we had to cross several fields to reach the road In spite of his fishing tackle he carried me in his arms while I looked down in the beautiful jewelled drops almost sorry that I could not be drenched by them I do not think I have told you that in our daily walks at Lisieux as in Alencon I often used to give alms to the beggars One day we came upon a poor old man who dragged himself painfully along on crutches I went up to give him a penny He looked sadly at me for a long time and then shaking his head with a sorrowful smile he refused my alms I cannot tell you what I felt I had wished to help and comfort him and instead of that I had perhaps hurt him and caused him pain He must have guessed my thought for I saw him turn round and smile at me when we were some way off Just then Papa bought me a cake I wished very much to run after the old man and give it to him for I thought Well he did not want money but I am sure he would like to have a cake I do not know what held me back and I felt so sad I could hardly keep from crying then I remembered having heard that one obtains all the favours asked for on one s First Communion Day This thought consoled me immediately and though I was only six years old at the time I said to myself I will pray for my poor old man on the day of my First Communion Five years later I faithfully kept my resolution I have always thought that my childish prayer for this suffering member of Christ has been blessed and rewarded As I grew older my love of God grew more and more I often offered my heart to Him using the words my Mother had taught me and I tried very hard to please Him in all my actions taking great care never to offend Him And yet one day I committed a fault which I must tell you here it gives me a good opportunity of humbling myself though I believe I have grieved over it with perfect contrition It was the month of May eighteen seventy eight My sisters decided that I was too small to go to the May devotions every evening so I stayed at home with the nurse and said my prayers with her before the little altar which I had arranged according to my own taste Everything was small candlesticks vases and the rest two wax vestas were quite sufficient to light it up properly Sometimes Victoire the maid gave me some little bits of real candle but not often One evening when we went to our prayers I said to her Will you begin the Memorare I am going to light the candles She tried to begin and then looked at me and burst out laughing Seeing my precious vestas burning quickly away I begged her once more to say the Memorare Again there was silence broken only by bursts of laughter All my natural good temper deserted me I got up feeling dreadfully angry and stamping my foot furiously I cried out Victoire you naughty girl She stopped laughing at once and looked at me in utter astonishment then showed me too late the surprise she had in store hidden under her apron two pieces of candle My tears of anger were soon changed into tears of sorrow I was very much ashamed and grieved and made a firm resolution never to act in such a way again Shortly after this I made my first confession three It is a very sweet memory Pauline had warned me Therese darling it is not to a man but to God Himself that you are going to tell your sins I was so persuaded of this that I asked her quite seriously if I should not tell Father Ducellier that I loved him with my whole heart as it was really God I was going to speak to in his person Well instructed as to what I was to do I entered the confessional and turning round to the priest so as to see him better I made my confession and received absolution in a spirit of lively faith my sister having assured me that at this solemn moment the tears of the Holy Child Jesus would purify my soul I remember well that he exhorted me above all to a tender devotion towards Our Lady and I promised to redouble my love for her who already filled so large a place in my heart Then I passed him my Rosary to be blessed and came out of the Confessional more joyful and lighthearted than I had ever felt before It was evening and as soon as I got to a street lamp I stopped and took the newly blessed Rosary out of my pocket turning it over and over What are you looking at Therese dear asked Pauline I am seeing what a blessed Rosary looks like This childish answer amused my sisters very much I was deeply impressed by the graces I had received and wished to go to confession again for all the big feasts for these confessions filled me with joy The feasts What precious memories these simple words bring to me I loved them and my sisters knew so well how to explain the mysteries hidden in each one Those days of earth became days of Heaven Above all I loved the procession of the Blessed Sacrament what a joy it was to strew flowers in God s path But before scattering them on the ground I threw them high in the air and was never so happy as when I saw my rose leaves touch the sacred Monstrance And if the great feasts came but seldom each week brought one very dear to my heart and that was Sunday What a glorious day The Feast of God The day of rest First of all the whole family went to High Mass and I remember that before the sermon we had to come down from our places which were some way from the pulpit and find seats in the nave This was not always easy but to little Therese and her Father everyone offered a place My uncle was delighted when he saw us come down he called me his Sunbeam and said that to see the venerable old man leading his little daughter by the hand was a sight which always filled him with joy I never troubled myself if people looked at me I was only occupied in listening attentively to the preacher A sermon on the Passion of our Blessed Lord was the first I understood and it touched me deeply I was then five and a half and after that time I was able to understand and appreciate all instructions If saint Teresa was mentioned my Father would bend down and whisper to me Listen attentively little Queen he is speaking of your holy patroness I really did listen attentively but I must own I looked at Papa more than at the preacher for I read many things in his face Sometimes his eyes were filled with tears which he strove in vain to keep back and as he listened to the eternal truths he seemed no longer of this earth his soul was absorbed in the thought of another world Alas Many long and sorrowful years had to pass before Heaven was to be opened to him and Our Lord with His Own Divine Hand was to wipe away the bitter tears of His faithful servant To go back to the description of our Sundays This happy day which passed so quickly had also its touch of melancholy my happiness was full till Compline but after that a feeling of sadness took possession of me I thought of the morrow when one had to begin again the daily life of work and lessons and my heart feeling like an exile on this earth longed for the repose of Heaven the never ending Sabbath of our true Home Every Sunday my aunt invited us in turns to spend the evening with her I was always glad when mine came and it was a pleasure to listen to my uncle s conversation His talk was serious but it interested me and he little knew that I paid such attention but my joy was not unmixed with fear when he took me on his knee and sang Bluebeard in his deep voice About eight o clock Papa would come to fetch me I remember that I used to look up at the stars with inexpressible delight Orion s belt fascinated me especially for I saw in it a likeness to the letter T Look Papa I would cry my name is written in Heaven Then not wishing to see this dull earth any longer I asked him to lead me and with my head thrown back I gazed unweariedly at the starry skies I could tell you much about our winter evenings at home After a game of draughts my sisters read aloud Dom Gueranger s Liturgical Year and then a few pages of some other interesting and instructive book While this was going on I established myself on Papa s knee and when the reading was done he used to sing soothing snatches of melody in his beautiful voice as if to lull me to sleep and I would lay my head on his breast while he rocked me gently to and fro Later on we went upstairs for night prayers and there again my place was beside my beloved Father and I had only to look at him to know how the Saints pray Pauline put me to bed and I invariably asked her Have I been good to day Is God pleased with me Will the Angels watch over me The answer was always Yes otherwise I should have spent the whole night in tears After these questions my sisters kissed me and little Therese was left alone in the dark I look on it as a real grace that from childhood I was taught to overcome my fears Sometimes in the evening Pauline would send me to fetch something from a distant room she would take no refusal and she was quite right for otherwise I should have become very nervous whereas now it is difficult to frighten me I wonder sometimes how my little Mother was able to bring me up with so much tenderness and yet without spoiling me for she did not pass over the least fault It is true she never scolded me without cause and I knew well she would never change her mind when once a thing was decided upon To this dearly loved sister I confided my most intimate thoughts she cleared up all my doubts One day I expressed surprise that God does not give an equal amount of glory to all the elect in Heaven I was afraid that they would not all be quite happy She sent me to fetch Papa s big tumbler and put it beside my tiny thimble then filling both with water she asked me which seemed the fuller I replied that one was as full as the other it was impossible to pour more water into either of them for they could not hold it In this way Pauline made it clear to me that in Heaven the least of the Blessed does not envy the happiness of the greatest and so by bringing the highest mysteries down to the level of my understanding she gave my soul the food it needed Joyfully each year I welcomed the prize day Though I was the only competitor justice was none the less strictly observed and I never received rewards unless they were well merited My heart used to beat with excitement when I heard the decisions and in presence of the whole family received prizes from Papa s hands It was to me like a picture of the Judgment Day Seeing Papa so cheerful no suspicion of the terrible trials which awaited him crossed my mind but one day God showed me in an extraordinary vision a vivid picture of the trouble to come My Father was away on a journey and could not return as early as usual It was about two or three o clock in the afternoon the sun was shining brightly and all the world seemed gay I was alone at the window looking on to the kitchen garden my mind full of cheerful thoughts when I saw before me in front of the wash house a man dressed exactly like Papa of the same height and appearance but more bent and aged I say aged to describe his general appearance for I did not see his face as his head was covered with a thick veil He advanced slowly with measured step along my little garden at that instant a feeling of supernatural fear seized me and I called out loudly in a trembling voice Papa Papa The mysterious person seemed not to hear he continued his walk without even turning and went towards a clump of firs which grew in the middle of the garden I expected to see him reappear at the other side of the big trees but the prophetic vision had vanished It was all over in a moment but it was a moment which impressed itself so deeply on my memory that even now after so many years the remembrance of it is as vivid as the vision itself My sisters were all together in an adjoining room Hearing me call Papa they were frightened themselves but Marie hiding her feelings ran to me and said Why are you calling Papa when he is at Alencon I told her what I had seen and to reassure me they said that Nurse must have covered her head with her apron on purpose to frighten me Victoire however when questioned declared she had not left the kitchen besides the truth was too deeply impressed on my mind I had seen a man and that man was exactly like my Father We all went to look behind the clump of trees and finding nothing my sisters told me to think no more about it Ah that was not in my power Often and often my imagination brought before me this mysterious vision often and often I tried to raise the veil which hid its true meaning and deep down in my heart I had a conviction that some day it would be fully revealed to me And you know all dear Mother You know that it was really my Father whom God showed me bent by age and bearing on his venerable face and his white head the symbol of his terrible trial four As the Adorable Face of Jesus was veiled during His Passion so it was fitting that the face of His humble servant should be veiled during the days of his humiliation in order that it might shine with greater brilliancy in Heaven How I admire God s ways He showed us this precious cross beforehand as a father shows his children the glorious future he is preparing for them a future which will bring them an inheritance of priceless treasures But a thought comes into my mind Why did God give this light to a child who if she had understood it would have died of grief Why Here is one of those incomprehensible mysteries which we shall only understand in Heaven where they will be the subject of our eternal admiration My God how good Thou art How well dost Thou suit the trial to our strength At that time I had not courage even to think that Papa could die without being terrified One day he was standing on a high step ladder and as I was close by he called out Move away little Queen if I fall I shall crush you Instantly I felt an inward shock and going still nearer to the ladder I thought At least if Papa falls I shall not have the pain of seeing him die for I shall die with him I could never say how much I loved him I admired everything he did When he explained his ideas on serious matters as if I were a big girl I answered him naively It is quite certain Papa that if you spoke like that to the great men who govern the country they would take you and make you King Then France would be happier than it was ever been but you would be unhappy because that is the lot of kings besides you would no longer be my King alone so I am glad that they do not know you When I was six or seven years old I saw the sea for the first time The sight made a deep impression on me I could not take my eyes off it Its majesty and the roar of the waves all spoke to my soul of the greatness and power of God I remember when we were on the beach a man and woman looked at me for a long time then asking Papa if I was his child they remarked that I was a very pretty little girl Papa at once made a sign to them not to flatter me I was delighted to hear what they said for I did not think I was pretty My sisters were most careful never to talk before me in such a way as to spoil my simplicity and childish innocence and because I believed so implicitly in them I attached little importance to the admiration of these people and thought no more about it That evening at the hour when the sun seems to sink into the vast ocean leaving behind it a trail of glory I sat with Pauline on a bare rock and gazed for long on this golden furrow which she told me was an image of grace illumining the way of faithful souls here below Then I pictured my soul as a tiny barque with a graceful white sail in the midst of the furrow and I resolved never to let it withdraw from the sight of Jesus so that it might sail peacefully and quickly towards the Heavenly Shore one This holy nun had been professed at the Carmel of Poitiers and was sent from there to make the foundation at Lisieux in eighteen thirty eight Her memory is held in benediction in both these convents in the sight of God she constantly practised the most heroic virtue and on December five eighteen ninety one crowned a life of good works by a holy death She was then eighty six years of age two This house an object of deep interest to the clients of Soeur Therese is much frequented by pilgrims to Lisieux Ed three This first confession was made in the beautiful church of saint Pierre formerly the cathedral of Lisieux Ed four It seems advisable on account of the vague allusions which occur here and elsewhere to state what happened to M Louis Martin At the age of sixty six having already had several partial attacks he was struck with general paralysis and his mind gave way altogether CHAPTER III PAULINE ENTERS THE CARMEL I was eight and a half when Leonie left school and I took her place at the Benedictine Abbey in Lisieux The girls of my class were all older than myself one of them was fourteen and though not clever she knew how to impose on the little ones Seeing me so young nearly always first in class and a favourite with all the nuns she was jealous and used to pay me out in a thousand ways Naturally timid and sensitive I did not know how to defend myself and could only cry in silence Celine and my elder sisters did not know of my grief and not being advanced enough in virtue to rise above these troubles I suffered considerably Every evening I went home and then my spirits rose I would climb on to Papa s knee telling him what marks I had and his caresses made me forget all my troubles With what delight I announced the result of my first essay for I won the maximum number of marks In reward I received a silver coin which I put in my money box for the poor and nearly every Thursday I was able to increase the fund Indeed to be spoilt was a real necessity for me The Little Flower had need to strike its tender roots deeper and deeper into the dearly loved garden of home for nowhere else could it find the nourishment it required Thursday was a holiday but it was not like the holidays I had under Pauline which I generally spent upstairs with Papa Not knowing how to play like other children I felt myself a dull companion I tried my best to do as the others did but without success After Celine who was so to say indispensable to me I sought the company of my little cousin Marie because she left me free to choose the games I liked best We were already closely united in heart and will as if God were showing us in advance how one day in the Carmel we should embrace the same religious life one Very often at my uncle s house we used to play at being two austere hermits with only a poor hut a little patch of corn and a garden in which to grow a few vegetables Our life was to be spent in continual contemplation one praying while the other engaged in active duties All was done with religious gravity and decorum If we went out the make believe continued even in the street the two hermits would say the Rosary using their fingers to count on so as not to display their devotion before those who might scoff One day however the hermit Therese forgot herself before eating a cake given her for lunch she made a large Sign of the Cross and some worldly folk did not repress a smile We were so bent on always doing the same thing that sometimes we carried it too far Endeavouring one evening on our way home from school to imitate the modest demeanour of the hermits I said to Marie Lead me I am going to shut my eyes So am I she answered Being on the pavement we were in no fear of vehicles and for a short while all went well and we enjoyed walking with our eyes shut but presently we both fell over some boxes standing at a shop door and knocked them down The shopkeeper came out in a rage to replace them but the would be blind pair picked themselves up and ran off as fast as they could with eyes wide open Then the hermits had to listen to a well deserved scolding from Jeanne the maid who seemed as vexed as the shopkeeper I have not yet told you how Celine and I altered when we came to Lisieux She had now become the little romp full of mischief while Therese had turned into a very quiet little girl far too much inclined to tears I needed a champion and who can say how courageously my dear little sister played that part We used to enjoy making each other little presents for at that age the simplicity of our hearts was unspoiled Like the spring flowers they unfolded glad to receive the morning dew while the same soft breezes swayed their petals Yes our joys were mutual I felt this especially on the happy day of Celine s First Communion I was only seven years old and had not yet begun school at the Abbey How sweet is the remembrance of her preparation Every evening during its last weeks my sisters talked to her of the great event I listened eager to prepare myself too and my heart swelled with grief when I was told to go away because I was still too young I thought that four years was not too long to spend in making ready to receive Our dear Lord One evening I heard someone say to my happy little sister From the time of your First Communion you must begin an entirely new life At once I made a resolution not to wait till the time of my First Communion but to begin with Celine During her retreat she remained as a boarder at the Abbey and it seemed to me she was away a long time but at last the happy day came What a delightful impression it has left on my mind it was like a foretaste of my own First Communion How many graces I received that day I look on it as one of the most beautiful of my life I have gone back a little in order to recall these happy memories but now I must tell you of the mournful parting which crushed my heart when Our Lord took from me my little Mother whom I loved so dearly I told her once that I would like to go away with her to a far off desert she replied that it was her wish too but that she was waiting till I was big enough to set out This impossible promise I took in earnest and what was my grief when I heard Pauline talking to Marie about soon entering the Carmel I did not know the Carmel but I knew that she was leaving me to enter a convent and that she would not wait for me How can I describe the anguish I suffered In a flash I saw life spread out before me as it really is full of sufferings and frequent partings and I shed bitter tears At that time I did not know the joy of sacrifice I was weak so weak that I look on it as a great grace that I was able to bear such a trial one seemingly so much beyond my strength and yet live I shall never forget how tenderly my little Mother consoled me while explaining the religious life Then one evening when I was thinking over the picture she had drawn I felt that the Carmel was the desert where God wished me also to hide I felt this so strongly that I had not the least doubt about it nor was it a childish dream but the certainty of a Divine Call This impression which I cannot properly describe left me with a feeling of great inward peace Next day I confided my desires to Pauline They seemed to her as a proof of God s Will and she promised to take me soon to the Carmel to see the Mother Prioress and to tell her my secret This solemn visit was fixed for a certain Sunday and great was my embarrassment on hearing that my cousin Marie who was still young enough to be allowed to see the Carmelites was to come with us two I had to contrive a means of being alone with the Reverend Mother and this is what I planned I told Marie that as we were to have the great privilege of seeing her we must be very good and polite and tell her our little secrets and in order to do that we must go out of the room in turns Though she did not quite like it because she had no secrets to confide Marie took me at my word and so I was able to be alone with you dear Mother You listened to my great disclosure and believed in my vocation but you told me that postulants were not received at the age of nine and that I must wait till I was sixteen In spite of my ardent desire to enter with Pauline and make my First Communion on her clothing day I had to be resigned At last the second of October came a day of tears but also of blessings when Our Lord gathered the first of His flowers the chosen flower who later on was to become the Mother of her sisters three Whilst Papa with my uncle and Marie climbed the mountain of Carmel to offer his first sacrifice my aunt took me to Mass with my sisters and cousins We were bathed in tears and people gazed at us in astonishment when we entered the church but that did not stop our crying I even wondered how the sun could go on shining Perhaps dear Mother you think I exaggerate my grief a little I confess that this parting ought not to have upset me so much but my soul was yet far from mature and I had to pass through many trials before reaching the haven of peace before tasting the delicious fruits of perfect love and of complete abandonment to God s Will In the afternoon of that October day eighteen eighty two behind the grating of the Carmel I saw my beloved Pauline now become Sister Agnes of Jesus Oh how much I suffered in that parlour As I am writing the story of my soul it seems to me that I ought to tell you everything Well I acknowledge that I hardly counted the first pains of this parting in comparison with those which followed I who had been accustomed to talk with my little Mother of all that was in my heart could now scarcely snatch two or three minutes with her at the end of the family visits even these short minutes were passed in tears and I went away with my heart torn with grief I did not realise that it was impossible to give us each half an hour and that of course Papa and Marie must have the largest share I could not understand all this and I said from the depths of my heart Pauline is lost to me This suffering so affected me that I soon became seriously ill The illness was undoubtedly the work of the devil who in his fury at this first entry into the Carmel tried to avenge himself on me for the great harm my family was to do him in the future However he little knew that the Queen of Heaven was watching faithfully over her Little Flower that she was smiling upon it from on high ready to still the tempest just when the delicate and fragile stalk was in danger of being broken once and for all At the close of the year eighteen eighty two I began to suffer from constant headaches they were bearable however and did not prevent me from continuing my studies This lasted till the Easter of eighteen eighty three Just then Papa went to Paris with my elder sisters and confided Celine and me to the care of our uncle and aunt One evening I was alone with my uncle and he talked so tenderly of my Mother and of bygone days that I was deeply moved and began to cry My sensitiveness touched him too he was surprised that one of my age should feel as I did So he determined to do all he could to divert my mind during the holidays But God had decided otherwise That very evening my headache became acute and I was seized with a strange shivering which lasted all night My aunt like a real mother never left me for a moment all through my illness she lavished on me the most tender and devoted care You may imagine my poor Father s grief when he returned from Paris to find me in this hopeless state he thought I was going to die but Our Lord might have said to him This sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God four Yes God was glorified by means of this trial by the wonderful resignation of my Father and sisters And to Marie especially what suffering it brought and how grateful I am to this dear sister She seemed to divine my wants by instinct for a mother s heart is more knowing than the science of the most skilful doctors And now Pauline s clothing day was drawing near but fearing to distress me no one dared mention it in my presence since it was taken for granted that I should not be well enough to be there Deep down in my heart however I firmly believed that God would give me the consolation of seeing dear Pauline on that day I was quite sure that this feast would be unclouded I knew that Our Lord would not try His Spouse by depriving her of my presence she had already suffered so much on account of my illness And so it turned out I was there able to embrace my dear little Mother to sit on her knee and hiding myself under her veil to receive her loving caresses I was able to feast my eyes upon her she looked so lovely in her veil and mantle of white Truly it was a day of happiness in the midst of heavy trials but this day or rather this hour passed only too quickly and soon we were in the carriage which was to take us away from the Carmel On reaching home I was made to lie down though I did not feel at all tired but next day I had a serious relapse and became so ill that humanly speaking there was no hope of any recovery I do not know how to describe this extraordinary illness I said things which I had never thought of I acted as though I were forced to act in spite of myself I seemed nearly always to be delirious and yet I feel certain that I was never for a minute deprived of my reason Sometimes I remained in a state of extreme exhaustion for hours together unable to make the least movement and yet in spite of this extraordinary torpor hearing the least whisper I remember it still And what fears the devil inspired I was afraid of everything my bed seemed to be surrounded by frightful precipices nails in the wall took the terrifying appearance of long fingers shrivelled and blackened with fire making me cry out in terror One day while Papa stood looking at me in silence the hat in his hand was suddenly transformed into some horrible shape and I was so frightened that he went away sobbing But if God allowed the devil to approach me in this open way Angels too were sent to console and strengthen me Marie never left me and never showed the least trace of weariness in spite of all the trouble I gave her for I could not rest when she was away During meals when Victoire took care of me I never ceased calling tearfully Marie Marie When she wanted to go out it was only if she were going to Mass or to see Pauline that I kept quiet As for Leonie and my little Celine they could not do enough for me On Sundays they shut themselves up for hours with a poor child who seemed almost to have lost her reason My own dear sisters how much I made you suffer My uncle and aunt were also devoted to me My aunt came to see me every day and brought me many little gifts I could never tell you how my love for these dear ones increased during this illness I understood better than ever what Papa had so often told us Always remember children that your uncle and aunt have devoted themselves to you in a way that is quite exceptional In his old age he experienced this himself and now he must bless and protect those who lavished upon him such affectionate care five When my sufferings grew less my great delight was to weave garlands of daisies and forget me nots for Our Lady s statue We were in the beautiful month of May when all nature is clothed with the flowers of spring the Little Flower alone drooped and seemed as though it had withered for ever Yet she too had a shining sun the miraculous statue of the Queen of Heaven How often did not the Little Flower turn towards this glorious Sun One day Papa came into my room in the deepest distress and I watched him go up to Marie and give her some money bidding her write to Paris and have a novena of Masses said at the shrine of Our Lady of Victories six to obtain the cure of his poor little Queen How touching were his faith and love How much I longed to get up and tell him I was cured Alas my wishes could not work a miracle and it needed one to restore me to health Yes it needed a great miracle and this was wrought by Our Lady of Victories herself One Sunday during the novena Marie went into the garden leaving me with Leonie who was reading by the window After a short time I began to call Marie Marie very softly Leonie accustomed to hear me fret like this took no notice so I called louder until Marie came back to me I saw her come into the room quite well but for the first time I failed to recognise her I looked all round and glanced anxiously into the garden still calling Marie Marie Her anguish was perhaps greater than mine and that was unutterable At last after many fruitless efforts to make me recognise her she whispered a few words to Leonie and went away pale and trembling Leonie presently carried me to the window There I saw the garden and Marie walking up and down but still I did not recognise her she came forward smiling and held out her arms to me calling tenderly Therese dear little Therese This last effort failing she came in again and knelt in tears at the foot of my bed turning towards the statue of Our Lady she entreated her with the fervour of a mother who begs the life of her child and will not be refused Leonie and Celine joined her and that cry of faith forced the gates of Heaven I too finding no help on earth and nearly dead with pain turned to my Heavenly Mother begging her from the bottom of my heart to have pity on me Suddenly the statue seemed to come to life and grow beautiful with a divine beauty that I shall never find words to describe The expression of Our Lady s face was ineffably sweet tender and compassionate but what touched me to the very depths of my soul was her gracious smile Then all my pain vanished two big tears started to my eyes and fell silently They were indeed tears of unmixed heavenly joy Our Blessed Lady has come to me she has smiled at me How happy I am but I shall tell no one or my happiness will leave me Such were my thoughts Looking around I recognised Marie she seemed very much overcome and looked lovingly at me as though she guessed that I had just received a great grace Indeed her prayers had gained me this unspeakable favour a smile from the Blessed Virgin When she saw me with my eyes fixed on the statue she said to herself Therese is cured And it was true The Little Flower had come to life again a bright ray from its glorious Sun had warmed and set it free for ever from its cruel enemy The dark winter is past the rain is over and gone seven and Our Lady s Little Flower gathered such strength that five years later it opened wide its petals on the fertile mountain of Carmel As I said before Marie was convinced that Our Blessed Lady while restoring my bodily health had granted me some hidden grace So when I was alone with her I could not resist her tender and pressing inquiries I was so astonished to find my secret already known without my having said a word that I told her everything Alas as I had foreseen my joy was turned into bitterness For four years the remembrance of this grace was a cause of real pain to me and it was only in the blessed sanctuary of Our Lady of Victories at my Mother s feet that I once again found peace There it was restored to me in all its fulness as I will tell you later This is how my joy was changed into sadness When Marie had heard the childish but perfectly sincere account of the grace I had received she begged my leave to tell them at the Carmel and I did not like to refuse her My first visit there after my illness was full of joy at seeing Pauline clothed in the habit of Our Lady of Carmel It was a happy time for us both we had so much to say we had both suffered so much My heart was so full that I could hardly speak You were there dear Mother and plainly showed your affection for me I saw several other Sisters too and you must remember how they questioned me about my cure Some asked if Our Lady was holding the Infant Jesus in her arms others if the Angels were with her and so on All these questions distressed and grieved me and I could only make one answer Our Lady looked very beautiful I saw her come towards me and smile But noticing that the nuns thought something quite different had happened from what I had told them I began to persuade myself that I had been guilty of an untruth If only I had kept my secret I should have kept my happiness also But Our Lady allowed this trouble to befall me for the good of my soul perhaps without it vanity would have crept into my heart whereas now I was humbled and I looked on myself with feelings of contempt My God Thou alone knowest all that I suffered one Marie Guerin entered the Carmel at Lisieux on August fifteen eighteen ninety five and took the name of Sister Mary of the Eucharist She died on April fourteen nineteen oh five aged thirty four two With the Carmelites the grating is only opened for near relatives and very young children Ed three Pauline has several times been Prioress of the Carmel of Lisieux and in nineteen oh nine again succeeded to that office on the death of the young and saintly Mother Mary of saint Angelus of the Child Jesus Ed four John eleven four five Mme Guerin died holily on February thirteen nineteen hundred aged fifty two During her illness Therese assisted her in an extraordinary way several times making her presence felt Monsieur Guerin having for many years used his pen in defence of the Church and his fortune in the support of good works died a beautiful death on September twenty eight nineteen oh nine in his sixty ninth year Ed six It was in this small church once deserted and to day perhaps the most frequented in Paris that the saintly Abbe Desgenettes was inspired by Our Lady in eighteen thirty six to establish the Confraternity of the Immaculate Heart of Mary for the conversion of sinners Ed seven Cant two eleven CHAPTER IV FIRST COMMUNION AND CONFIRMATION While describing this visit to the Carmel my thoughts are carried back to the first one which I paid after Pauline entered On the morning of that happy day I wondered what name would be given to me later on I knew that there was already a Sister Teresa of Jesus nevertheless my beautiful name of Therese could not be taken from me Suddenly I thought of the Child Jesus whom I loved so dearly and I felt how much I should like to be called Teresa of the Child Jesus I was careful not to tell you of my wish dear Mother yet you said to me in the middle of our conversation When you come to us little one you will be called Teresa of the Child Jesus My joy was great indeed This happy coincidence of thought seemed a special favour from the Holy Child So far I have not said anything about my love for pictures and books and yet I owe some of the happiest and strongest impressions which have encouraged me in the practice of virtue to the beautiful pictures Pauline used to show me Everything was forgotten while looking at them For instance The Little Flower of the Divine Prisoner suggested so many thoughts that I would remain gazing at it in a kind of ecstasy I offered myself to Our Lord to be His Little Flower I longed to console Him to draw as near as possible to the Tabernacle to be looked on cared for and gathered by Him As I was of no use at games I should have preferred to spend all my time in reading Happily for me I had visible guardian angels to guide me in this matter they chose books suitable to my age which interested me and at the same time provided food for my thoughts and affections I was only allowed a limited time for this favourite recreation and it became an occasion of much self sacrifice for as soon as the time had elapsed I made it my duty to stop instantly even in the middle of a most interesting passage As to the impressions produced on me by these books I must frankly own that in reading certain tales of chivalry I did not always understand the realities of life And so in my admiration of the patriotic deeds of the heroines of France especially of the Venerable Joan of Arc I longed to do what they had done About this time I received what I have looked on as one of the greatest graces of my life for at that age I was not favoured with lights from Heaven as I am now Our Lord made me understand that the only true glory is that which lasts for ever and that to attain it there is no necessity to do brilliant deeds but rather to hide from the eyes of others and even from oneself so that the left hand knows not what the right hand does one Then as I reflected that I was born for great things and sought the means to attain them it was made known to me interiorly that my personal glory would never reveal itself before the eyes of men but that it would consist in becoming a Saint This aspiration may very well appear rash seeing how imperfect I was and am even now after so many years of religious life yet I still feel the same daring confidence that one day I shall become a great Saint I am not trusting in my own merits for I have none but I trust in Him Who is Virtue and Holiness itself It is He alone Who pleased with my feeble efforts will raise me to Himself and by clothing me with His merits make me a Saint At that time I did not realise that to become one it is necessary to suffer a great deal but God soon disclosed this secret to me by means of the trials I have related I must now continue my story where I left off Three months after my cure Papa took me away for a change It was a very pleasant time and I began to see something of the world All around me was joy and gladness I was petted made much of admired in fact for a whole fortnight my path was strewn with flowers The Wise Man is right when he says The bewitching of vanity overturneth the innocent mind two At ten years of age the heart is easily fascinated and I confess that in my case this kind of life had its charms Alas the world knows well how to combine its pleasures with the service of God How little it thinks of death And yet death has come to many people I knew then young rich and happy I recall to mind the delightful places where they lived and ask myself where they are now and what profit they derive to day from the beautiful houses and grounds where I saw them enjoying all the good things of this life and I reflect that All is vanity besides loving God and serving Him alone three Perhaps Our Lord wished me to know something of the world before He paid His first visit to my soul so that I might choose more deliberately the way in which I was to follow Him I shall always remember my First Communion Day as one of unclouded happiness It seems to me that I could not have been better prepared Do you remember dear Mother the charming little book you gave me three months before the great day I found in it a helpful method which prepared me gradually and thoroughly It is true I had been thinking about my First Communion for a long time but as your precious manuscript told me I must stir up in my heart fresh transports of love and fill it anew with flowers So each day I made a number of little sacrifices and acts of love which were to be changed into so many flowers now violets another time roses then cornflowers daisies or forget me nots in a word all nature s blossoms were to form in me a cradle for the Holy Child I had Marie too who took Pauline s place Every evening I spent a long time with her listening eagerly to all she said How delightfully she talked to me I felt myself set on fire by her noble generous spirit As the warriors of old trained their children in the profession of arms so she trained me for the battle of life and roused my ardour by pointing to the victor s glorious palm She spoke too of the imperishable riches which are so easy to amass each day and of the folly of trampling them under foot when one has but to stoop and gather them When she talked so eloquently I was sorry that I was the only one to listen to her teaching for in my simplicity it seemed to me that the greatest sinners would be converted if they but heard her and that forsaking the perishable riches of this world they would seek none but the riches of Heaven I should have liked at this time to practise mental prayer but Marie finding me sufficiently devout only let me say my vocal prayers A mistress at the Abbey asked me once what I did on holidays when I stayed at home I answered timidly I often hide myself in a corner of my room where I can shut myself in with the bed curtains and then I think But what do you think about said the good nun laughing I think about the Good God about the shortness of life and about eternity in a word I think My mistress did not forget this and later on she used to remind me of the time when I thought asking me if I still thought Now I know that I was really praying while my Divine Master gently instructed me The three months preparation for First Communion passed quickly by it was soon time for me to begin my retreat and during it I stayed at the Abbey Oh what a blessed retreat it was I do not think that one can experience such joy except in a religious house there with only a few children it is easy for each one to receive special attention I write this in a spirit of filial gratitude our mistresses at the Abbey showed us a true motherly affection I do not know why but I saw plainly that they watched over me more carefully than they did over the others Every night the first mistress carrying her little lamp opened my bed curtains softly and kissed me tenderly on the forehead She showed me such affection that touched by her kindness I said one night Mother I love you so much that I am going to tell you a great secret Then I took from under my pillow the precious little book you had given me and showed it to her my eyes sparkling with pleasure She opened it with care and looking through it attentively told me how privileged I was In fact several times during the retreat the truth came home to me that very few motherless children of my age are as lovingly cared for as I was then I listened most attentively to the instructions given us by Father Domin and wrote careful notes on them but I did not put down any of my own thoughts as I knew I should remember them quite well And so it proved How happy I was to attend Divine Office as the nuns did I was easily distinguished from my companions by a large crucifix which Leonie had given me and which like the missionaries I carried in my belt They thought I was trying to imitate my Carmelite sister and indeed my thoughts did often turn lovingly to her I knew she was in retreat too not that Jesus might give Himself to her but that she might give herself entirely to Jesus and this on the same day as I made my First Communion The time of quiet waiting was therefore doubly dear to me At last there dawned the most beautiful day of all the days of my life How perfectly I remember even the smallest details of those sacred hours the joyful awakening the reverent and tender embraces of my mistresses and older companions the room filled with snow white frocks where each child was dressed in turn and above all our entrance into the chapel and the melody of the morning hymn O Altar of God where the Angels are hovering But I would not and I could not tell you all Some things lose their fragrance when exposed to the air and so too one s inmost thoughts cannot be translated into earthly words without instantly losing their deep and heavenly meaning How sweet was the first embrace of Jesus It was indeed an embrace of love I felt that I was loved and I said I love Thee and I give myself to Thee for ever Jesus asked nothing of me and claimed no sacrifice for a long time He and little Therese had known and understood one another That day our meeting was more than simple recognition it was perfect union We were no longer two Therese had disappeared like a drop of water lost in the immensity of the ocean Jesus alone remained He was the Master the King Had not Therese asked Him to take away her liberty which frightened her She felt herself so weak and frail that she wished to be for ever united to the Divine Strength And then my joy became so intense so deep that it could not be restrained tears of happiness welled up and overflowed My companions were astonished and asked each other afterwards Why did she cry Had she anything on her conscience No it is because neither her Mother nor her dearly loved Carmelite sister is here And no one understood that all the joy of Heaven had come down into one heart and that this heart exiled weak and mortal as it was could not contain it without tears How could my Mother s absence grieve me on my First Communion Day As Heaven itself dwelt in my soul in receiving a visit from Our Divine Lord I received one from my dear Mother too Nor was I crying on account of Pauline s absence for we were even more closely united than before No I repeat it joy alone a joy too deep for words overflowed within me During the afternoon I read the act of consecration to Our Lady for myself and my companions I was chosen probably because I had been deprived of my earthly Mother while still so young With all my heart I consecrated myself to the Blessed Virgin Mary and asked her to watch over me She seemed to look lovingly on her Little Flower and to smile at her again and I thought of the visible smile which had once cured me and of all I owed her Had she not herself on the morning of that eighth of May placed in the garden of my soul her Son Jesus the Flower of the field and the Lily of the valleys four On the evening of this happy day Papa and I went to the Carmel and I saw Pauline now become the Spouse of Christ She wore a white veil like mine and a crown of roses My joy was unclouded for I hoped soon to join her and at her side to wait for Heaven I was pleased with the feast prepared for me at home and was delighted with the beautiful watch given to me by Papa My happiness was perfect and nothing troubled the inward peace of my soul Night came and so ended that beautiful day Even the brightest days are followed by darkness one alone will know no setting the day of the First and Eternal Communion in our true Home Somehow the next day seemed sorrowful The pretty clothes and the presents I had received could not satisfy me Henceforth Our Lord alone could fill my heart and all I longed for was the blissful moment when I should receive Him again I made my second Communion on Ascension Day and had the happiness of kneeling at the rails between Papa and Marie My tears flowed with inexpressible sweetness I kept repeating those words of saint Paul I live now not I but Christ liveth in me five After this second visit of Our Lord I longed for nothing else but to receive Him Alas the feasts seemed so far apart On the eve of these happy days Marie helped me to prepare as she had done for my First Communion I remember once she spoke of suffering and said that in all probability instead of making me walk by this road God in His goodness would carry me always like a little child Her words came into my mind next day after my Communion my heart became inflamed with an ardent desire for suffering and I felt convinced that many crosses were in store for me Then my soul was flooded with such consolation as I have never since experienced Suffering became attractive and I found in it charms which held me spellbound though as yet I did not appreciate them to the full I had one other great wish it was to love God only and to find my joy in Him alone During my thanksgiving after Holy Communion I often repeated this passage from the Imitation of Christ O my God who art unspeakable sweetness turn for me into bitterness all the consolations of earth six These words rose to my lips quite naturally I said them like a child who without well understanding repeats what a friend may suggest Later on I will tell you dear Mother how Our Lord has been pleased to fulfill my desire how He and He alone has always been my joy but if I were to speak of it now I should have to pass on to my girlhood and there is still much to tell you of my early days Soon after my First Communion I went into retreat again before being confirmed I prepared myself with the greatest care for the coming of the Holy Ghost I could not understand anyone not doing so before receiving this Sacrament of Love As the ceremony could not take place on the day fixed I had the consolation of remaining somewhat longer in retreat How happy I felt Like the Apostles I looked with joy for the promised Comforter gladdened by the thought that I should soon be a perfect Christan and have the holy Cross the symbol of this wondrous Sacrament traced upon my forehead for eternity I did not feel the mighty wind of the first Pentecost but rather the gentle breeze which the prophet Elias heard on Mount Horeb On that day I received the gift of fortitude in suffering a gift I needed sorely for the martyrdom of my soul was soon to begin When these delightful feasts which can never be forgotten were over I had to resume my life as a day scholar at the Abbey I made good progress with my lessons and remembered easily the sense of what I read but I had the greatest difficulty in learning by heart only at catechism were my efforts crowned with success The Chaplain called me his little Doctor of Theology seven no doubt because of my name Therese During recreation I often gave myself up to serious thoughts while from a distance I watched my companions at play This was my favourite occupation but I had another which gave me real pleasure I would search carefully for any poor little birds that had fallen dead under the big trees and I then buried them with great ceremony all in the same cemetery in a special grass plot Sometimes I told stories to my companions and often even the big girls came to listen but soon our mistress very rightly brought my career as an orator to an end saying she wanted us to exercise our bodies and not our brains At this time I chose as friends two little girls of my own age but how shallow are the hearts of creatures One of them had to stay at home for some months while she was away I thought about her very often and on her return I showed how pleased I was However all I got was a glance of indifference my friendship was not appreciated I felt this very keenly and I no longer sought an affection which had proved so inconstant Nevertheless I still love my little school friend and continue to pray for her for God has given me a faithful heart and when once I love I love for ever Observing that some of the girls were very devoted to one or other of the mistresses I tried to imitate them but I never succeeded in winning special favour O happy failure from how many evils have you saved me I am most thankful to Our Lord that He let me find only bitterness in earthly friendships With a heart like mine I should have been taken captive and had my wings clipped and how then should I have been able to fly away and be at rest eight How can a heart given up to human affections be closely united to God It seems to me that it is impossible I have seen so many souls allured by this false light fly right into it like poor moths and burn their wings and then return wounded to Our Lord the Divine fire which burns and does not consume I know well Our Lord saw that I was too weak to be exposed to temptation for without doubt had the deceitful light of created love dazzled my eyes I should have been entirely consumed Where strong souls find joy and practise detachment faithfully I only found bitterness No merit then is due to me for not having given up to these frail ties since I was only preserved from them by the Mercy of God I fully realised that without Him I should have fallen as low as saint Mary Magdalen and the Divine Master s words re echoed sweetly in my soul Yes I know that To whom less is forgiven he loveth less nine but I know too that Our Lord has forgiven me more than saint Mary Magdalen Here is an example which will at any rate show you some of my thoughts Let us suppose that the son of a very clever doctor stumbling over a stone on the road falls and breaks his leg His father hastens to him lifts him lovingly and binds up the fractured limb putting forth all his skill The son when cured displays the utmost gratitude and he has excellent reason for doing so But let us take another supposition The father aware that a dangerous stone lies in his son s path is beforehand with the danger and removes it unseen by anyone The son thus tenderly cared for not knowing of the mishap from which his father s hand has saved him naturally will not show him any gratitude and will love him less than if he had cured him of a grievous wound But suppose he heard the whole truth would he not in that case love him still more Well now I am this child the object of the foreseeing love of a Father Who did not send His son to call the just but sinners ten He wishes me to love Him because He has forgiven me not much but everything Without waiting for me to love Him much as saint Mary Magdalen did He has made me understand how He has loved me with an ineffable love and forethought so that now my love may know no bounds I had often heard it said both in retreats and elsewhere that He is more deeply loved by repentant souls than by those who have not lost their baptismal innocence Ah If I could but give the lie to those words But I have wandered so far from my subject that I hardly know where to begin again It was during the retreat before my second Communion that I was attacked by the terrible disease of scruples One must have passed through this martyrdom to understand it It would be quite impossible for me to tell you what I suffered for nearly two years All my thoughts and actions even the simplest were a source of trouble and anguish to me I had no peace till I had told Marie everything and this was most painful since I imagined I was obliged to tell absolutely all my thoughts even the most extravagant As soon as I had unburdened myself I felt a momentary peace but it passed like a flash and my martyrdom began again Many an occasion for patience did I provide for my dear sister That year we spent a fortnight of our holidays at the sea side My aunt who always showed us such motherly care treated us to all possible pleasures donkey rides shrimping and the rest She even spoiled us in the matter of clothes I remember one day she gave me some pale blue ribbon although I was twelve and a half I was still such a child that I quite enjoyed tying it in my hair But this childish pleasure seemed sinful to me and I had so many scruples that I had to go to Confession even at Trouville While I was there I had an experience which did me good My cousin Marie often suffered from sick headaches On these occasions my aunt used to fondle her and coax her with the most endearing names but the only response was continual tears and the unceasing cry My head aches I had a headache nearly every day though I did not say so but one evening I thought I would imitate Marie So I sat down in an armchair in a corner of the room and set to work to cry My aunt as well as my cousin Jeanne to whom I was very devoted hastened to me to know what was the matter I answered like Marie My head aches It would seem that complaining was not in my line no one would believe that a headache was the reason of my tears Instead of petting me as usual my aunt spoke to me seriously Even Jeanne reproached me very kindly it is true and was grieved at my want of simplicity and trust in my aunt She thought I had a big scruple and was not giving the real reason of my tears At last getting nothing for my pains I made up my mind not to imitate other people any more I thought of the fable of the ass and the little dog I was the ass who seeing that the little dog got all the petting put his clumsy hoof on the table to try and secure his share If I did not have a beating like the poor beast at any rate I got what I deserved a severe lesson which cured me once for all of the desire to attract attention I must go back now to the subject of my scruples They made me so ill that I was obliged to leave school when I was thirteen In order to continue my education Papa took me several times a week to a lady who was an excellent teacher Her lessons served the double purpose of instructing me and making me associate with other people Visitors were often shown into the old fashioned room where I sat with my books and exercises As far as possible my teacher s mother carried on the conversation but still I did not learn much while it lasted Seemingly absorbed in my book I could hear many things it would have been better for me not to hear One lady said I had beautiful hair another asked as she left who was that pretty little girl Such remarks the more flattering because I was not meant to hear them gave me a feeling of pleasure which showed plainly that I was full of self love I am very sorry for souls who lose themselves in this way It is so easy to go astray in the seductive paths of the world Without doubt for a soul somewhat advanced in virtue the sweetness offered by the world is mingled with bitterness and the immense void of its desires cannot be filled by the flattery of a moment but I repeat if my heart had not been lifted up towards God from the first moment of consciousness if the world had smiled on me from the beginning of my life what should I have become Dearest Mother with what a grateful heart do I sing the Mercies of the Lord Has He not according to the words of Holy Wisdom taken me away from the world lest wickedness should alter my understanding or deceit beguile my soul eleven Meanwhile I resolved to consecrate myself in a special way to Our Blessed Lady and I begged to be enrolled among the Children of Mary twelve To gain this favour I had to go twice a week to the Convent and I must confess this cost me something I was so shy There was no question of the affection I felt towards my mistresses but as I said before I had no special friend among them with whom I could have spent many hours like other old pupils So I worked in silence till the end of the lesson and then as no one took any notice of me I went to the tribune in the Chapel till Papa came to fetch me home Here during this silent visit I found my one consolation for was not Jesus my only Friend To Him alone could I open my heart all conversation with creatures even on holy subjects wearied me It is true that in these periods of loneliness I sometimes felt sad and I used often to console myself by repeating this line of a beautiful poem Papa had taught me Time is thy barque and not thy dwelling place Young as I was these words restored my courage and even now in spite of having outgrown many pious impressions of childhood the symbol of a ship always delights me and helps me to bear the exile of this life Does not the Wise Man tell us Life is like a ship that passeth through the waves when it is gone by the trace thereof cannot be found thirteen When my thoughts run on in this way my soul loses itself as it were in the infinite I seem already to touch the Heavenly Shore and to receive Our Lord s embrace I fancy I can see Our Blessed Lady coming to meet me with my Father and Mother my little brothers and sisters and I picture myself enjoying true family joys for all eternity But before reaching Our Father s Home in Heaven I had to go through many partings on this earth The year in which I was made a Child of Mary Our Lady took from me my sister Marie the only support of my soul fourteen my oracle and inseparable companion since the departure of Pauline As soon as I knew of her decision I made up my mind to take no further pleasure in anything here below I could not tell you how many tears I shed But at this time I was much given to crying not only over big things but over trifling ones too For instance I was very anxious to advance in virtue but I went about it in a strange way I was not accustomed to wait on myself Celine always arranged our room and I never did any household work Sometimes in order to please Our Lord I used to make my bed or if she were out in the evening to bring in her plants and seedlings As I said before it was simply to please Our Lord that I did these things and so I ought not to have expected any thanks from creatures But alas I did expect them and if unfortunately Celine did not seem surprised and grateful for my little services I was not pleased and tears rose to my eyes Again if by accident I offended anyone instead of taking it in the right way I fretted till I made myself ill thus making my fault worse instead of mending it and when I began to realise my foolishness I would cry for having cried In fact I made troubles out of everything Now things are quite different God in His goodness has given me grace not to be cast down by any passing difficulty When I think of what I used to be my heart overflows with gratitude The graces I have received have changed me so completely that I am scarcely the same person After Marie entered the Carmel and I no longer had her to listen to my scruples I turned towards Heaven and confided them to the four little angels who had already gone before me for I thought that these innocent souls who had never known sorrow or fear ought to have pity on their poor little suffering sister I talked to them with childish simplicity telling them that as I was the youngest of the family I had always been the most petted and loved by my parents and sisters that if they had remained on earth they would no doubt have given me the same proofs of their affection The fact that they had gone to Heaven seemed no reason why they should forget me on the contrary as they were able to draw form the treasury of Heaven they ought to obtain for me the grace of peace and prove that they still knew how to love me The answer was not long in coming soon my soul was flooded with the sweetest peace I knew that I was loved not only on earth but also in Heaven From that time my devotion for these little brothers and sisters increased I loved to talk to them and tell them of all the sorrows of this exile and of my wish to join them soon in our Eternal Home one Cf Matt six three two Wisdom four twelve three Imit I ch i three four Cant two one five Gal two twenty six Imit III ch xxvi three seven saint Teresa who reformed the Carmelite Order and died in fifteen eighty two is sometimes called the Doctor of Mystical Theology because of her luminous writings on the relations of the soul with God in prayer Ed eight Ps fifty four fifty five seven nine Luke seven forty seven ten Luke five thirty two eleven Cf Wisdom four eleven twelve It was on May thirty one eighteen eighty six that she became a Sodalist of Our Lady Ed thirteen Wisdom five ten fourteen Marie entered the Carmel of Lisieux on October fifteen eighteen eighty six taking the name of Sister Mary of the Sacred Heart CHAPTER V VOCATION OF THERESE I was far from meriting all the graces which Our Lord showered on me I had a constant and ardent desire to advance in virtue but often my actions were spoilt by imperfections My extreme sensitiveness made me almost unbearable All arguments were useless I simply could not correct myself of this miserable fault How then could I hope soon to be admitted to the Carmel A miracle on a small scale was needed to give me strength of character all at once and God worked this long desired miracle on Christmas Day eighteen eighty six On that blessed night the sweet Infant Jesus scarce an hour old filled the darkness of my soul with floods of light By becoming weak and little for love of me He made me strong and brave He put His own weapons into my hands so that I went from victory to victory beginning if I may say so to run as a giant one The fountain of my tears was dried up and from that time they flowed neither easily nor often Now I will tell you dear Mother how I received this inestimable grace of complete conversion I knew that when we reached home after Midnight Mass I should find my shoes in the chimney corner filled with presents just as when I was a little child which proves that my sisters still treated me as a baby Papa too liked to watch my enjoyment and hear my cries of delight at each fresh surprise that came from the magic shoes and his pleasure added to mine But the time had come when Our Lord wished to free me from childhood s failings and even withdraw me from its innocent pleasures On this occasion instead of indulging me as he generally did Papa seemed vexed and on my way upstairs I heard him say Really all this is too babyish for a big girl like Therese and I hope it is the last year it will happen His words cut me to the quick Celine knowing how sensitive I was whispered Don t go downstairs just yet wait a little you would cry too much if you looked at your presents before Papa But Therese was no longer the same Jesus had changed her heart Choking back my tears I ran down to the dining room and though my heart beat fast I picked up my shoes and gaily pulled out all the things looking as happy as a queen Papa laughed and did not show any trace of displeasure and Celine thought she must be dreaming But happily it was a reality little Therese had regained once for all the strength of mind which she had lost at the age of four and a half On this night of grace the third period of my life began the most beautiful of all the one most filled with heavenly favours In an instant Our Lord satisfied with my good will accomplished the work I had not been able to do during all these years Like the Apostle I could say Master we have laboured all night and have taken nothing two More merciful to me even than to His beloved disciples Our Lord Himself took the net cast it and drew it out full of fishes He made me a fisher of men Love and a spirit of self forgetfulness took possession of me and from that time I was perfectly happy One Sunday closing my book at the end of Mass a picture of Our Lord on the Cross half slipped out showing only one of His Divine Hands pierced and bleeding I felt an indescribable thrill such as I had never felt before My heart was torn with grief to see that Precious Blood falling to the ground and no one caring to treasure It as It fell and I resolved to remain continually in spirit at the foot of the Cross that I might receive the Divine Dew of Salvation and pour it forth upon souls From that day the cry of my dying Saviour I thirst sounded incessantly in my heart and kindled therein a burning zeal hitherto unknown to me My one desire was to give my Beloved to drink I felt myself consumed with thirst for souls and I longed at any cost to snatch sinners from the everlasting flames of hell In order still further to enkindle my ardour Our Divine Master soon proved to me how pleasing to him was my desire Just then I heard much talk of a notorious criminal Pranzini who was sentenced to death for several shocking murders and as he was quite impenitent everyone feared he would be eternally lost How I longed to avert this irreparable calamity In order to do so I employed all the spiritual means I could think of and knowing that my own efforts were unavailing I offered for his pardon the infinite merits of Our Saviour and the treasures of Holy Church Need I say that in the depths of my heart I felt certain my request would be granted But that I might gain courage to persevere in the quest for souls I said in all simplicity My God I am quite sure that Thou wilt pardon this unhappy Pranzini I should still think so if he did not confess his sins or give any sign of sorrow because I have such confidence in Thy unbounded Mercy but this is my first sinner and therefore I beg for just one sign of repentance to reassure me My prayer was granted to the letter My Father never allowed us to read the papers but I did not think there was any disobedience in looking at the part about Pranzini The day after his execution I hastily opened the paper La Croix and what did I see Tears betrayed my emotion I was obliged to run out of the room Pranzini had mounted the scaffold without confessing or receiving absolution and the executioners were already dragging him towards the fatal block when all at once apparently in answer to a sudden inspiration he turned round seized the crucifix which the Priest was offering to him and kissed Our Lord s Sacred Wounds three times I had obtained the sign I asked for and to me it was especially sweet Was it not when I saw the Precious Blood flowing from the Wounds of Jesus that the thirst for souls first took possession of me I wished to give them to drink of the Blood of the Immaculate Lamb that It might wash away their stains and the lips of my first born had been pressed to these Divine Wounds What a wonderful answer After receiving this grace my desire for the salvation of souls increased day by day I seemed to hear Our Lord whispering to me as He did to the Samaritan woman Give me to drink three It was indeed an exchange of love upon souls I poured forth the Precious Blood of Jesus and to Jesus I offered these souls refreshed with the Dew of Calvary In this way I thought to quench His Thirst but the more I gave Him to drink so much the more did the thirst of my own poor soul increase and I accepted it as the most delightful recompense In a short time God in His goodness had lifted me out of the narrow sphere in which I lived The great step was taken but alas I had still a long road to travel Now that I was free from scruples and morbid sensitiveness my mind developed I had always loved what was noble and beautiful and about this time I was seized with a passionate desire for learning Not content with lessons from my teachers I took up certain subjects by myself and learnt more in a few months than I had in my whole school life Was not this ardour vanity and vexation of spirit four For me with my impetuous nature this was one of the most dangerous times of my life but Our Lord fulfilled in me those words of Ezechiel s prophecy Behold thy time was the time of lovers and I spread my garment over thee And I swore to thee and I entered into a covenant with thee saith the Lord God and thou becamest Mine And I washed thee with water and I anointed thee with oil I clothed thee with fine garments and put a chain about thy neck Thou didst eat fine flour and honey and oil and wast made exceedingly beautiful and wast advanced to be a queen five Yes Our Lord has done all this for me I might take each word of that striking passage and show how it has been completely realised in me but the graces of which I have already told you are sufficient proof So I will only speak now of the food with which my Divine Master abundantly provided me For a long time I had nourished my spiritual life with the fine flour contained in the Imitation of Christ It was the only book which did me good for I had not yet found the treasures hidden in the Holy Gospels I always had it with me to the amusement of my people at home My aunt used often to open it and make me repeat by heart the first chapter she chanced to light upon Seeing my great thirst for knowledge God was pleased when I was fourteen to add to the fine flour honey and oil in abundance This honey and oil I found in the conferences of Father Arminjon on The End of this World and the Mysteries of the World to Come While reading this book my soul was flooded with a happiness quite supernatural I experienced a foretaste of what God has prepared for those who love Him and seeing that eternal rewards are so much in excess of the petty sacrifices of this life I yearned to love Our Lord to love Him passionately and to give Him countless proofs of affection while this was still in my power Celine had become the most intimate sharer of my thoughts especially since Christmas Our Lord Who wished to make us advance in virtue together drew us to one another by ties stronger than blood He made us sisters in spirit as well as in the flesh The words of our Holy Father saint John of the Cross were realised in us Treading within Thy Footsteps Young maidens lightly run upon the way From the spark s contact And the spiced wine They give forth aspirations of a balm divine It was lightly indeed that we followed in the footsteps of Our Saviour The burning sparks which He cast into our souls the strong wine which He gave us to drink made us lose sight of all earthly things and we breathed forth sighs of love Very sweet is the memory of our intercourse Every evening we went up to our attic window together and gazed at the starry depths of the sky and I think very precious graces were bestowed on us then As the Imitation says God communicates Himself sometimes amid great light at other times sweetly in signs and figures six In this way He deigned to manifest Himself to our hearts but how slight and transparent was the veil Doubt was no longer possible already Faith and Hope had given place to Love which made us find Him whom we sought even on this earth When He found us alone He gave us His kiss and now no one may despise us seven These divine impressions could not but bear fruit The practice of virtue gradually became sweet and natural to me At first my looks betrayed the effort but little by little self sacrifice seemed to come more easily and without hesitation Our Lord has said To everyone that hath shall be given and he shall abound eight Each grace faithfully received brought many others He gave Himself to me in Holy Communion oftener than I should have dared to hope I had made it my practice to go to Communion as often as my confessor allowed me but never to ask for leave to go more frequently Now however I should act differently for I am convinced that a soul ought to disclose to her director the longing she has to receive her God He does not come down from Heaven each day in order to remain in a golden ciborium but to find another Heaven the Heaven of our souls in which He takes such delight Our Lord Who knew my desire inspired my confessor to allow me to go to Communion several times a week and this permission coming as it did straight from Him filled me with joy In those days I did not dare to speak of my inner feelings the road which I trod was so direct so clear that I did not feel the need of any guide but Jesus I compared directors to mirrors who faithfully reflect Our Saviour to the souls under their care and I thought that in my case He did not use an intermediary but acted directly When a gardener gives special attention to a fruit which he wishes to ripen early he does so not with a view to leaving it on the tree but in order to place it on a well spread table Our Lord lavished His favours on His Little Flower in the same way He wishes His Mercies to shine forth in me He Who while on earth cried out in a transport of joy I bless Thee O Father because Thou hast hidden these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them to little ones nine And because I was small and frail He bent down to me and instructed me sweetly in the secrets of His love As saint John of the Cross says in his Canticle of the Soul On that happy night In secret I went forth beheld by none And seeing naught Having no light nor guide Excepting that which burned within my heart Which lit my way More safely than the glare of noon day sun To where expectant He waited for me Who doth know me well Where none appeared but He This place was Carmel but before I could sit down under His Shadow Whom I desired ten I had to pass through many trials And yet the Divine Call was becoming so insistent that had it been necessary for me to go through fire I would have thrown myself into it to follow my Divine Master Pauline eleven was the only one who encouraged me in my vocation Marie thought I was too young and you dear Mother no doubt to prove me tried to restrain my ardour From the start I encountered nothing but difficulties Then too I dared not speak of it to Celine and this silence pained me deeply it was so hard to have a secret she did not share However this dear sister soon found out my intention and far from wishing to keep me back she accepted the sacrifice with wonderful courage As she also wished to be a nun she ought to have been given the first opportunity but imitating the martyrs of old who used joyfully to embrace those chosen to go before them into the arena she allowed me to leave her and took my troubles as much to heart as if it were a question of her own vocation From Celine then I had nothing to fear but I did not know how to set about telling Papa How could his little Queen talk of leaving him when he had already parted with his two eldest daughters Moreover this year he had been stricken with a serious attack of paralysis and though he recovered quickly we were full of anxiety for the future What struggles I went through before I could make up my mind to speak But I had to act decisively I was now fourteen and a half and in six months time the blessed feast of Christmas would be here I had resolved to enter the Carmel at the same hour at which a year before I had received the grace of conversion I chose the feast of Pentecost on which to make my great disclosure All day I was praying for light from the Holy Ghost and begging the Apostles to pray for me to inspire me with the words I ought to use Were they not the very ones to help a timid child whom God destines to become an apostle of apostles by prayer and sacrifice In the afternoon when Vespers were over I found the opportunity I wanted My Father was sitting in the garden his hands clasped admiring the wonders of nature The rays of the setting sun gilded the tops of the tall trees and the birds chanted their evening prayer His beautiful face wore a heavenly expression I could feel that his soul was full of peace Without a word I sat down by his side my eyes already wet with tears He looked at me with indescribable tenderness and pressing me to his heart said What is it little Queen Tell me everything Then in order to hide his own emotion he rose and walked slowly up and down still holding me close to him Through my tears I spoke of the Carmel and of my great wish to enter soon He too wept but did not say a word to turn me from my vocation he only told me that I was very young to make such a grave decision and as I insisted and fully explained my reasons my noble and generous Father was soon convinced We walked about for a long time my heart was lightened and Papa no longer shed tears He spoke to me as Saints speak and showed me some flowers growing in the low stone wall Picking one of them he gave it to me and explained the loving care with which God had made it spring up and grow till now I fancied myself listening to my own story so close was the resemblance between the little flower and little Therese I received this floweret as a relic and noticed that in gathering it my Father had pulled it up by the roots without breaking them it seemed destined to live on but in other and more fertile soil Papa had just done the same for me He allowed me to leave the sweet valley where I had passed the first years of my life for the mountain of Carmel I fastened my little white flower to a picture of Our Lady of Victories the Blessed Virgin smiles on it and the Infant Jesus seems to hold it in His Hand It is there still but the stalk is broken close to the root God doubtless wishes me to understand that He will soon break all the earthly ties of His Little Flower and will not leave her to wither on this earth Having obtained my Father s consent I thought I could now fly to the Carmel without hindrance Far from it When I told my uncle of my project he declared that to enter such a severe Order at the age of fifteen seemed to him against all common sense and that it would be doing a wrong to religion to let a child embrace such a life He added that he should oppose it in every way possible and that nothing short of a miracle would make him change his mind I could see that all arguments were useless so I left him my heart weighed down by profound sadness My only consolation was prayer I entreated Our Lord to work this miracle for me because thus only could I respond to His appeal Some time went by and my uncle did not seem even to remember our conversation though I learnt later that it had been constantly in his thoughts Before allowing a ray of hope to shine on my soul Our Lord deigned to send me another most painful trial which lasted for three days Never had I understood so well the bitter grief of Our Lady and saint Joseph when they were searching the streets of Jerusalem for the Divine Child I seemed to be in a frightful desert or rather my soul was like a frail skiff without a pilot at the mercy of the stormy waves I knew that Jesus was there asleep in my little boat but how could I see Him while the night was so dark If the storm had really broken a flash of lightning would perhaps have pierced the clouds that hung over me even though it were but a passing ray it would have enabled me to catch a momentary glimpse of the Beloved of my heart but this was denied me Instead it was night dark night utter desolation death Like my Divine Master in the Agony in the Garden I felt that I was alone and found no comfort on earth or in Heaven Nature itself seemed to share my bitter sadness for during these three days there was not a ray of sunshine and the rain fell in torrents I have noticed again and again that in all the important events of my life nature has reflected my feelings When I wept the skies wept with me when I rejoiced no cloud darkened the blue of the heavens On the fourth day a Saturday I went to see my uncle What was my surprise when I found his attitude towards me entirely changed He invited me into his study a privilege I had not asked for then after gently reproaching me for being a little constrained with him he told me that the miracle of which he had spoken was no longer needed He had prayed God to guide his heart aright and his prayer had been heard I felt as if I hardly knew him he seemed so different He embraced me with fatherly affection saying with much feeling Go in peace my dear child you are a privileged little flower which Our Lord wishes to gather I will put no obstacle in the way Joyfully I went home The clouds had quite disappeared from the sky and in my soul also dark night was over Jesus had awakened to gladden my heart I no longer heard the roar of the waves Instead of the bitter wind of trial a light breeze swelled my sail and I fancied myself safe in port Alas more than one storm was yet to rise sometimes even making me fear that I should be driven without hope of return from the shore which I longed to reach I had obtained my uncle s consent only to be told by you dear Mother that the Superior of the Carmelites would not allow me to enter till I was twenty one No one had dreamt of this serious opposition the hardest of all to overcome And yet without losing courage I went with Papa to lay my request before him He received me very coldly and could not be induced to change his mind We left him at last with a very decided No Of course he added I am only the Bishop s delegate if he allows you to enter I shall have nothing more to say When we came out of the Presbytery again it was raining in torrents and my soul too was overcast with heavy clouds Papa did not know how to console me but he promised if I wished to take me to Bayeux to see the Bishop and to this I eagerly consented Many things happened however before we were able to go To all appearances my life seemed to continue as formerly I went on studying and what is more important I went on growing in the love of God Now and then I experienced what were indeed raptures of love One evening not knowing in what words to tell Our Lord how much I loved him and how much I wished that He was served and honoured everywhere I thought sorrowfully that from the depths of hell there does not go up to Him one single act of love Then from my inmost heart I cried out that I would gladly be cast into that place of torment and blasphemy so that He might be eternally loved even there This could not be for His Glory since He only wishes our happiness but love feels the need of saying foolish things If I spoke in this way it was not that I did not long to go to Heaven but for me Heaven was nothing else than Love and in my ardour I felt that nothing could separate me from the Divine Being Who held me captive About this time Our Lord gave me the consolation of an intimate knowledge of the souls of children I gained it in this way During the illness of a poor woman I interested myself in her two little girls the elder of whom was not yet six It was a real pleasure to see how simply they believed all that I told them Baptism does indeed plant deeply in our souls the theological virtues since from early childhood the hope of heavenly reward is strong enough to make us practise self denial When I wanted my two little girls to be specially kind to one another instead of promising them toys and sweets I talked to them about the eternal recompense the Holy Child Jesus would give to good children The elder one who was coming to the use of reason used to look quite pleased and asked me charming questions about the little Jesus and His beautiful Heaven She promised me faithfully always to give in to her little sister adding that all through her life she would never forget what I had taught her I used to compare these innocent souls to soft wax ready to receive any impression evil alas as well as good and I understood the words of Our Lord It were better to be thrown into the sea than to scandalise one of these little ones twelve How many souls might attain to great sanctity if only they were directed aright from the first I know God has not need of anyone to help Him in His work of sanctification but as He allows a clever gardener to cultivate rare and delicate plants giving him the skill to accomplish it while reserving to Himself the right of making them grow so does He wish to be helped in the cultivation of souls What would happen if an ignorant gardener did not graft his trees in the right way if he did not understand the nature of each and wished for instance to make roses grow on peach trees This reminds me that I used to have among my birds a canary which sang beautifully and also a little linnet taken from the nest of which I was very fond This poor little prisoner deprived of the teaching it should have received from its parents and hearing the joyous trills of the canary from morning to night tried hard to imitate them A difficult task indeed for a linnet It was delightful to follow the efforts of the poor little thing his sweet voice found great difficulty in accommodating itself to the vibrant notes of his master but he succeeded in time and to my great surprise his song became exactly like the song of the canary Oh dear Mother you know who taught me to sing from the days of my earliest childhood You know the voices which drew me on And now I trust that one day in spite of my weakness I may sing for ever the Canticle of Love the harmonious notes of which I have often heard sweetly sounding here below But where am I These thoughts have carried me too far and I must resume the history of my vocation On October thirty one eighteen eighty seven alone with Papa I started for Bayeux my heart full of hope but also excited at the idea of presenting myself at the Bishop s house For the first time in my life I was going to pay a visit without any of my sisters and this to a Bishop I who had never yet had to speak except to answer questions addressed to me would have to explain and enlarge on my reasons for begging to enter the Carmel and so give proofs of the genuineness of my vocation It cost me a great effort to overcome my shyness sufficiently to do this But it is true that Love knows no such word as impossible for it deems all things possible all things allowed Nothing whatsoever but the love of Jesus could have made me face these difficulties and others which followed for I had to purchase my happiness by heavy trials Now it is true I think I bought it very cheaply and I would willingly bear a thousand times more bitter suffering to gain it if it were not already mine When we reached the Bishop s house the floodgates of Heaven seemed open once more The Vicar General Father Reverony who had settled the date of our coming received us very kindly though he looked a little surprised and seeing tears in my eyes said Those diamonds must not be shown to His Lordship We were led through large reception rooms which made me feel how small I was and I wondered what I should dare say The Bishop was walking in a corridor with two Priests I saw the Vicar General speak a few words to him then they came into the room where we were waiting There were three large armchairs in front of the fireplace where a bright fire blazed As his Lordship entered my Father and I knelt for his blessing then he made us sit down Father Reverony offered me the armchair in the middle I excused myself politely but he insisted telling me to show if I knew how to obey I did so without any more hesitation and was mortified to see him take an ordinary chair while I was buried in an enormous seat that would comfortably have held four children like me more comfortably in fact for I was far from being at ease I hoped that Papa was going to do all the talking but he told me to explain the reason of our visit I did so as eloquently as I could though I knew well that one word from the Superior would have carried more weight than all my reasons while his opposition told strongly against me The Bishop asked how long I had wanted to enter the Carmel A very long time my Lord Come said the Vicar General laughing it cannot be as long as fifteen years That is true I answered but it is not much less for I have wished to give myself to God from the time I was three The Bishop no doubt to please Papa tried to explain that I ought to remain some time longer with him but to his great surprise and edification my Father took my part adding respectfully that we were going to Rome with the diocesan pilgrimage and that I should not hesitate to speak to the Holy Father if I could not obtain permission before then However it was decided that previous to giving an answer an interview with the Superior was absolutely necessary This was particularly unpleasant hearing for I knew his declared and determined opposition and in spite of the advice not to allow the Bishop to see any diamonds I not only showed them but let them fall He seemed touched and caressed me fondly I was afterwards told he had never treated any child so kindly All is not lost little one he said but I am very glad that you are going to Rome with your good Father you will thus strengthen your vocation Instead of weeping you ought to rejoice I am going to Lisieux next week and I will talk to the Superior about you You shall certainly have my answer when you are in Italy His Lordship then took us to the garden and was much interested when Papa told him that to make myself look older I had put up my hair for the first time that very morning This was not forgotten for I know that even now whenever the Bishop tells anyone about his little daughter he always repeats the story about her hair I must say I should prefer my little secret to have been kept As he took us to the door the Vicar General remarked that such a thing had never been seen a father as anxious to give his child to God as the child was to offer herself We had to return to Lisieux without a favourable answer It seemed to me as though my future were shattered for ever the nearer I drew to the goal the greater my difficulties became But all the time I felt deep down in my heart a wondrous peace because I knew that I was only seeking the Will of my Lord one Cf Psalm eighteen nineteen five two Luke five five three John four seven four Eccl one fourteen five Ezechiel sixteen eight nine thirteen six Cf Imit III ch xliii four seven Cf Cant eight one eight Luke nineteen twenty six nine Cf Luke ten twenty one ten Cant two three eleven Sister Agnes of Jesus twelve Cf Matt eighteen six CHAPTER VI A PILGRIMAGE TO ROME Three days after the journey to Bayeux I started on a much longer one to the Eternal City This journey taught me the vanity of all that passes away Nevertheless I saw splendid monuments I studied the countless wonders of art and religion and better than all I trod the very ground the Holy Apostles had trodden the ground watered by the blood of martyrs and my soul grew by contact with these holy things I was delighted to go to Rome but I could quite understand people crediting Papa with the hope that in this way I should be brought to change my mind about the religious life It might certainly have upset a vocation that was not very strong To begin with Celine and I found ourselves in the company of many distinguished people In fact there were scarcely any others in the pilgrimage but far from being dazzled thereby titles seemed to us but a vapour of smoke one and I understood the words of the Imitation Be not solicitous for the shadow of a great name two I understood that true greatness is not found in a name but in the soul The Prophet Isaias tells us The Lord shall call His servants by another name three and we read in saint John To him that overcometh I will give a white counter and on the counter a new name written which no man knoweth but he that receiveth it four In Heaven therefore we shall know our titles of nobility and then shall every man have praise from God five and he who on earth chose to be poorest and least known for love of his Saviour he will be the first the noblest and the richest The second thing I learnt had to do with Priests Up to this time I had not understood the chief aim of the Carmelite Reform To pray for sinners delighted me to pray for Priests whose souls seemed pure as crystal that indeed astonished me But in Italy I realised my vocation and even so long a journey was a small price to pay for such valuable knowledge During that month I met with many holy Priests and yet I saw that even though the sublime dignity of Priesthood raises them higher than the Angels they are still but weak and imperfect men And so if holy Priests whom Our Lord in the Gospel calls the salt of the earth have need of our prayers what must we think of the lukewarm Has not Our Lord said If the salt lose its savour wherewith shall it be salted six Oh dear Mother how beautiful is our vocation We Carmelites are called to preserve the salt of the earth We offer our prayers and sacrifices for the apostles of the Lord we ourselves ought to be their apostles while they by word and example are preaching the Gospel to our brethren Have we not a glorious mission to fulfill But I must say no more for I feel that on this subject my pen would run on for ever Now let me describe my journey in some detail At three o clock in the morning of November four we passed through the silent streets Lisieux still lay shrouded in the darkness of night I felt that I was going out into the unknown and that great things were awaiting me in Rome When we reached Paris Papa took us to see all the sights For me there was but one Our Lady of Victories I can never tell you what I felt at her shrine the graces Our Lady granted me were like those of my First Communion Day I was filled with peace and happiness In this holy spot the Blessed Virgin my Mother told me plainly that it was really she who had smiled on me and cured me With intense fervour I entreated her to keep me always and to realise my heart s desire by hiding me under her spotless mantle and I also asked her to remove from me every occasion of sin I was well aware that during this journey I should come across things that might disturb me knowing nothing of evil I feared I might discover it As yet I had not experienced that to the pure all things are pure seven that a simple and upright soul does not see evil in anything because evil only exists in impure hearts and not in inanimate objects I prayed specially to saint Joseph to watch over me from my childhood devotion to him has been interwoven with my love for our Blessed Lady Every day I said the prayer beginning saint Joseph Father and Protector of Virgins so I felt I was well protected and quite safe from danger We left Paris on November seven after our solemn Consecration to the Sacred Heart in the Basilica of Montmartre eight Each compartment of the train was named after a Saint and the selection was made in honour of some Priest occupying it his own patron or that of his parish being chosen But in the presence of all the pilgrims our compartment was named after saint Martin My Father deeply touched by this compliment went at once to thank Mgr Legoux Vicar General of Coutances and director of the pilgrimage From this onwards he was often called Monsieur Saint Martin Father Reverony watched my behaviour closely I could tell that he was doing so at table if I were not opposite to him he would lean forward to look at me and listen to what I was saying I think he must have been satisfied with his investigations for towards the end of the journey he seemed more favourably disposed I say towards the end for in Rome he was far from being my advocate as I will tell you presently Still I would not have it thought he deceived me in any way by falling short of the good will he had shown at Bayeux On the contrary I am sure that he always felt kindly towards me and that if he opposed my wishes it was only to put me to the test On our way into Italy we passed through Switzerland with its high mountains their snowy peaks lost in the clouds its rushing torrents and its deep valleys filled with giant ferns and purple heather Great good was wrought in my soul by these beauties of nature so abundantly scattered abroad They lifted it to Him Who had been pleased to lavish such masterpieces upon this transient earth Sometimes we were high up the mountain side while at our feet an unfathomable abyss seemed ready to engulf us A little later we were passing through a charming village with its cottages and graceful belfry above which light fleecy clouds floated lazily Farther on a great lake with its blue waters so calm and clear would blend with the glowing splendour of the setting sun I cannot tell you how deeply I was impressed with this scenery so full of poetry and grandeur It was a foretaste of the wonders of Heaven Then the thought of religious life would come before me as it really is with its constraints and its little daily sacrifices made in secret I understood how easily one might become wrapped in self and forget the sublime end of one s vocation and I thought Later on when the time of trial comes when I am enclosed in the Carmel and shall only be able to see a little bit of sky I will remember this day and it will encourage me I will make light of my own small interests by thinking of the greatness and majesty of God I will love Him alone and will not be so foolish as to attach myself to the fleeting trifles of this world now that my heart has had a glimpse of what is reserved for those who love Him After having contemplated the works of God I turned next to admire those of His creatures Milan was the first Italian town we visited and we carefully studied its Cathedral of white marble adorned with countless statues Celine and I left the timid ones who hid their faces in fear after climbing to the first stage and following the bolder pilgrims we reached the top from whence we viewed the city below When we came down we started on the first of our expeditions these lasted the whole month of the pilgrimage and quite cured me of a desire to be always lazily riding in a carriage The Campo Santo nine charmed us The whole vast enclosure is covered with marble statues so exquisitely carved as to be life like and placed with an apparent negligence that only enhances their charm You feel almost tempted to console the imaginary personages that surround you their expression so exactly portrays a calm and Christian sorrow And what works of art Here is a child putting flowers on its father s grave one forgets how solid is marble the delicate petals appear to slip through its fingers Sometimes the light veils of the widows and the ribbons of the young girls seem floating on the breeze We could not find words to express our admiration but an old gentleman who followed us everywhere regretting no doubt his inability to share our sentiments said in a tone of ill temper Oh what enthusiasts these French people are and yet he also was French I think the poor man would have done better to stay at home Instead of enjoying the journey he was always grumbling nothing pleased him neither cities hotels people nor anything else My Father whose disposition was the exact opposite was quite content no matter what happened and tried to cheer our friend offering him his place in the carriage or elsewhere and with his wonted goodness encouraging him to look on the bright side of things But nothing could cheer him How many different kinds of people we saw and how interesting it is to study the world when one is just about to leave it In Venice the scene changed completely Instead of the bustle of a large city silence reigned broken only by the lapping of the waters and the cries of the gondoliers as they plied their oars it is a city full of charm but full of sadness Even the Palace of the Doges splendid though it be is sad we walked through halls whose vaulted roofs have long since ceased to re echo the voices of the governors in their sentences of life and death Its dark dungeons are no longer a living tomb for unfortunate prisoners to pine within While visiting these dreadful prisons I fancied myself in the times of the martyrs and gladly would I have chosen this sombre abode for my dwelling if there had been any question of confessing my faith Presently the guide s voice roused me from my reverie and I crossed the Bridge of Sighs so called because of the sighs uttered by the wretched prisoners as they passed from their dungeons to sentence and to death After leaving Venice we visited Padua and there venerated the relic of saint Anthony s tongue then Bologna where saint Catherine s body rests Her face still bears the impress of the kiss bestowed on her by the Infant Jesus I was indeed happy when on the way to Loreto Our Lady had chosen an ideal spot in which to place her Holy House Everything is poor simple and primitive the women still wear the graceful dress of the country and have not as in the large towns adopted the modern Paris fashions I found Loreto enchanting And what shall I say of the Holy House I was overwhelmed with emotion when I realised that I was under the very roof that had sheltered the Holy Family I gazed on the same walls Our Lord had looked on I trod the ground once moistened with the sweat of saint Joseph s toil and saw the little chamber of the Annunciation where the Blessed Virgin Mary held Jesus in her arms after she had borne Him there in her virginal womb I even put my Rosary into the little porringer used by the Divine Child How sweet those memories But our greatest joy was to receive Jesus in His own House and thus become His living temple in the very place which He had honoured by His Divine Presence According to Roman custom the Blessed Sacrament is reserved at one Altar in each Church and there only is it given to the faithful At Loreto this Altar was in the Basilica which is built round the Holy House enclosing it as a precious stone might be enclosed in a casket of white marble The exterior mattered little to us it was in the diamond itself that we wished to receive the Bread of Angels My Father with his habitual gentleness followed the other pilgrims but his daughters less easily satisfied went towards the Holy House God favoured us for a Priest was on the point of celebrating Mass we told him of our great wish and he immediately asked for two hosts which he placed on the paten You may picture dear Mother the ecstatic happiness of that Communion no words can describe it What will be our joy when we communicate eternally in the dwelling of the King of Heaven It will be undimmed by the grief of parting and will know no end His House will be ours for all eternity and there will be no need to covet fragments from the walls hallowed by the Divine Presence He will not give us His earthly Home He only shows it to us to make us love poverty and the hidden life What He has in store for us is the Palace of His Glory where we shall no longer see Him veiled under the form of a child or the appearance of bread but as He is in the brightness of His Infinite Beauty Now I am going to tell you about Rome Rome where I thought to find comfort and where I found the cross It was night when we arrived I was asleep and was awakened by the porters calling Roma The pilgrims caught up the cry and repeated Roma Roma Then I knew that it was not a dream I was really in Rome Our first day and perhaps the most enjoyable was spent outside the walls There everything retains its stamp of antiquity whilst in Rome with its hotels and shops one might fancy oneself in Paris This drive in the Roman Campagna has left a specially delightful impression on my mind How shall I describe the feelings which thrilled me when I gazed on the Coliseum At last I saw the arena where so many Martyrs had shed their blood for Christ My first impulse was to kiss the ground sanctified by their glorious combats But what a disappointment The soil has been raised and the real arena is now buried at the depth of about twenty six feet As the result of excavations the centre is nothing but a mass of rubbish and an insurmountable barrier guards the entrance in any case no one dare penetrate into the midst of these dangerous ruins But was it possible to be in Rome and not go down to the real Coliseum No indeed And I no longer listened to the guide s explanations one thought only filled my mind I must reach the arena We are told in the Gospel that saint Mary Magdalen remained close to the Sepulchre and stooped down constantly to look in she was rewarded by seeing two Angels So like her I kept stooping down and I saw not two Angels but what I was in search of I uttered a cry of joy and called out to my sister Come follow me we shall be able to get through We hurried on at once scrambling over the ruins which crumbled under our feet Papa aghast at our boldness called out to us but we did not hear As the warriors of old felt their courage grow in face of peril so our joy increased in proportion to the fatigue and danger we had to face to attain the object of our desires Celine more foreseeing than I had listened to the guide She remembered that he had pointed out a particular stone marked with a cross and had told us it was the place where the Martyrs had fought the good fight She set to work to find it and having done so we threw ourselves on our knees on this sacred ground Our souls united in one and the same prayer My heart beat violently when I pressed my lips to the dust reddened with the blood of the early Christians I begged for the grace to be a martyr for Jesus and I felt in the depths of my heart that my prayer was heard All this took but a short time After collecting some stones we approached the walls once more to face the danger We were so happy that Papa had not the heart to scold us and I could see that he was proud of our courage From the Coliseum we went to the Catacombs and there Celine and I laid ourselves down in what had once been the tomb of saint Cecilia and took some of the earth sanctified by her holy remains Before our journey to Rome I had not felt any special devotion to saint Cecilia but on visiting the house where she was martyred and hearing her proclaimed Queen of harmony because of the sweet song she sang in her heart to her Divine Spouse I felt more than devotion towards her it was real love as for a friend She became my chosen patroness and the keeper of all my secrets her abandonment to God and her boundless confidence delighted me beyond measure They were so great that they enabled her to make souls pure which had never till then desired aught but earthly pleasures saint Cecilia is like the Spouse in the Canticles I find in her the Scriptural choir in an armed camp ten Her life was one melodious song in the midst of the greatest trials and this is not strange because we read that the Book of the Holy Gospels lay ever on her heart eleven while in her heart reposed the Spouse of Virgins Our visit to the Church of saint Agnes was also very delightful I tried but without success to obtain a relic to take back to my little Mother Sister Agnes of Jesus Men refused me but God Himself came to my aid a little bit of red marble from an ancient mosaic dating back to the time of the sweet martyr fell as my feet Was this not touching saint Agnes herself gave me a keepsake from her house We spent six days in visiting the great wonders in Rome and on the seventh saw the greatest of all Leo XIII I longed for yet dreaded that day for on it depended my vocation I had received no answer from the Bishop of Bayeux and so the Holy Father s permission was my one and only hope But in order to obtain this permission I had first to ask it The mere thought made me tremble for I must dare speak to the Pope and that in presence of many Cardinals Archbishops and Bishops On Sunday morning November twenty we went to the Vatican and were taken to the Pope s private chapel At eight o clock we assisted at his Mass during which his fervent piety worthy of the Vicar of Christ gave evidence that he was in truth the Holy Father The Gospel for that day contained these touching words Fear not little flock for it hath pleased your Father to give you a Kingdom twelve My heart was filled with perfect confidence No I would not fear I would trust that the Kingdom of the Carmel would soon be mine I did not think of those other words of Our Lord I dispose to you as my Father hath disposed to Me a Kingdom thirteen That is to say I will give you crosses and trials and thus will you become worthy to possess My Kingdom If you desire to sit on His right hand you must drink the chalice which He has drunk Himself fourteen Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and so to enter into His glory fifteen A Mass of thanksgiving followed and then the audience began Leo XIII whose cassock and cape were of white was seated on a raised chair and round him were grouped various dignitaries of the church According to custom each visitor knelt in turn and kissed first the foot and next the hand of the venerable Pontiff and finally received his blessing then two of the Noble Guard signed to the pilgrim that he must rise and pass on to the adjoining room to make way for those who followed No one uttered a word but I was firmly determined to speak when suddenly the Vicar General of Bayeux Father Reverony who was standing at the Pope s right hand told us in a loud voice that he absolutely forbade anyone to address the Holy Father My heart beat fast I turned to Celine mutely inquiring what I should do Speak she said The next moment I found myself on my knees before the Holy Father I kissed his foot and he held out his hand then raising my eyes which were filled with tears I said entreatingly Holy Father I have a great favour to ask you At once he bent towards me till his face almost touched mine and his piercing black eyes seemed to read my very soul Holy Father I repeated in honour of your jubilee will you allow me to enter the Carmel when I am fifteen The Vicar General surprised and displeased said quickly Holy Father this is a child who desires to become a Carmelite but the Superiors of the Carmel are looking into the matter Well my child said His Holiness do whatever the Superiors decide Clasping my hands and resting them on his knee I made a final effort Holy Father if only you say yes everyone else would agree He looked at me fixedly and said clearly and emphatically Well well You will enter if it is God s Will I was going to speak again when the Noble Guards motioned to me As I paid little attention they came forward the Vicar General with them for I was still kneeling before the Pope with my hands resting on his knee Just as I was forced to rise the dear Holy Father gently placed his hand on my lips then lifted it to bless me letting his eyes follow me for quite a long time My Father was much distressed to find me coming from the audience in tears he had passed out before me and so did not know anything about my request The Vicar General had shown him unusual kindness presenting him to Leo XIII as the father of two Carmelites The Sovereign Pontiff as a special sign of benevolence had placed his hand on his head thus appearing in the name of Christ Himself to mark him with a mysterious seal But now that this father of four Carmelites is in Heaven it is no longer the hand of Christ s Vicar which rests on his brow prophesying his martyrdom it is the hand of the Spouse of Virgins of the King of Heaven and this Divine Hand will never be taken away from the head which it has blessed This trial was indeed a heavy one but I must admit that in spite of my tears I felt a deep inward peace for I had made every effort in my power to respond to the appeal of my Divine Master This peace however dwelt in the depths of my soul on the surface all was bitterness and Jesus was silent absent it would seem for nothing revealed that He was there On that day too the sun dared not shine and the beautiful blue sky of Italy hidden by dark clouds mingled its tears with mine All was at an end My journey had no further charm for me since it had failed in its object It is true the Holy Father s words You will enter if it is God s Will should have consoled me they were indeed a prophecy In spite of all these obstacles what God in His goodness willed has come to pass He has not allowed His creatures to do what they will but only what He wills Sometime before this took place I had offered myself to the Child Jesus to be His little plaything I told Him not to treat me like one of those precious toys which children only look at and dare not touch but to treat me like a little ball of no value that could be thrown on the ground kicked about pierced left in a corner or pressed to His Heart just as it might please Him In a word I wished to amuse the Holy child and to let Him play with me as He fancied Here indeed He was answering my prayer In Rome Jesus pierced His little plaything He wanted to see what was inside and when satisfied He let it drop and went to sleep What was He doing during His sweet slumber and what became of the ball thus cast on one side He dreamed that He was still at play that He took it up or threw it down that He rolled it far away but at last He pressed it to His Heart nor did He allow it again to slip from His tiny Hand Dear Mother you can imagine the sadness of the little ball lying neglected on the ground And yet it continued to hope against hope After our audience my Father went to call on Brother Simeon the founder and director of saint Joseph s College and there he met Father Reverony He reproached him gently for not having helped me in my difficult task and told the whole story to Brother Simeon The good old man listened with much interest and even made notes saying with evident feeling This kind of thing is not seen in Italy The next day we started for Naples and Pompeii Vesuvius did us the honour of emitting from its crater a thick volume of smoke accompanied by numerous loud reports The traces of the devastation of Pompeii are terrifying They show forth the power of God He looketh upon the earth and maketh it tremble He toucheth the mountains and they smoke I should like to have wandered alone among its ruins meditating on the instability of human things but such solitude was not to be thought of At Naples we made an expedition to the monastery of San Martino it crowns a high hill overlooking the whole city On the way back the horses took the bit in their teeth and it is solely to our Guardian Angels that I attribute our safe return to the splendid hotel This word splendid is not too strong to describe it in fact during the whole journey we stayed only at the most expansive hotels I had never been surrounded by such luxury but it is indeed a true saying that riches do not make happiness I should have been a thousand times more contented under a thatched room with the hope of entering the Carmel than I was amid marble staircases gilded ceilings and silken hangings with my heart full of sorrow I realised thoroughly that joy is not found in the things which surround us but lives only in the soul One could possess it as well in an obscure prison as in the palace of a king And so now I am happier at the Carmel in the midst of trials within and without than I was in the world where I had everything I wanted and above all the joys of a happy home Although I felt heavy of heart outwardly I was as usual for I thought no one had any knowledge of my petition to the Pope I was mistaken One day when the other pilgrims had gone to the refreshment room and Celine and I were alone Mgr Legoux came to the door of the carriage He looked at me attentively and smiling said Well and how is our little Carmelite This showed me that my secret was known to all the pilgrims and I gathered it too from their kindly looks but happily no one spoke to me on the subject At Assisi I had a little adventure While visiting the places sanctified by the virtues of saint Francis and saint Clare I lost the buckle of my belt in the monastery It took me some time to find and put it back in place and when I reached the door all the carriages had started except one that belonged to the Vicar General of Bayeux Should I run after those which were no longer in sight and so perhaps miss the train or should I beg for a seat in the carriage of Father Reverony I decided that this was the wiser plan I tried to hide my extreme embarrassment and explained things He was placed in a difficulty himself for all the seats were occupied but one of the party promptly gave me his place and sat by the driver I felt like a squirrel caught in a snare I was ill at ease in the midst of these great people and I had to sit face to face with the most formidable of all He was exceedingly kind however and now and then interrupted his conversation to talk to me about the Carmel and promise that he would do all in his power to realise my desire of entering at fifteen This meeting was like balm to my wounds though it did not prevent me from suffering I had now lost all trust in creatures and could only lean on God Himself And yet my distress did not hinder me from taking a deep interest in the holy places we visited In Florence we saw the shrine of saint Mary Magdalen of Pazzi in the choir of the Carmelite Church All the pilgrims wanted to touch the Saint s tomb with their Rosaries but my hand was the only one small enough to pass through the grating So I was deputed for this important and lengthy task and I did it with pride It was not the first time I had obtained special favours One day at Santa Croce in Rome we venerated the relics of the True Cross together with two of the Thorns and one of the Sacred Nails I wanted to examine them closely so I remained behind and when the monk in charge was going to replace them on the Altar I asked if I might touch the precious treasures He said I might do so but was doubtful if I should succeed however I put my little finger into one of the openings of the reliquary and was able to touch the Sacred Nail once hallowed by the Blood of Our Saviour You see I behaved towards Him like a child who thinks it may do as it pleases and looks on its Father s treasures as its own Having passed through Pisa and Genoa we came back to France by one of the loveliest routes At times we were close to the sea and one day during a storm it seemed as though the waves would reach the train Farther on we travelled through plains covered with orange trees olives and feathery palms while at night the numerous seaports twinkled with lights and stars came out in the deep blue sky But I watched the fairy picture fade away from my eyes without any regret my heart was set elsewhere My Father proposed to take me to Jerusalem but in spite of the natural wish I had to visit the places sanctified by Our Lord s Footsteps I was weary of earthly pilgrimages and only longed for the beauties of Heaven In order to win these beauties for souls I wanted to become a prisoner as quickly as possible I felt that I must suffer and struggle still more before the gates of my blessed prison would open yet my trust in God did not grow less and I still hoped to enter at Christmas We had hardly reached home when I paid a visit to the Carmel You must remember well that interview dear Mother I left myself entirely in your hands for I had exhausted all my resources You told me to write to the Bishop and remind him of his promise I obeyed at once and as soon as my letter was posted I felt I should obtain the coveted permission without any delay Alas each day brought fresh disappointments The beautiful feast of Christmas dawned still Jesus slept He left His little ball on the ground without even glancing that way This was indeed a sore trial but Our Lord Whose Heart is always watching taught me that He granted miracles to those whose faith is small as a grain of mustard seed in the hope of strengthening this slender faith whilst for His intimate friends for His Mother He did not work miracles till He had proved their faith Did He not permit Lazarus to die even though Mary and Martha had sent word that he was sick And at the marriage feast of Cana when Our Lady asked her Divine Son to aid the master of the house did He not answer that His hour had not yet come But after the trial what a reward Water is changed into wine and Lazarus rises from the dead In this way did my Beloved act with His little Therese after He had tried her for a long time He granted all her desires For my New Year s gift of eighteen eighty eight Jesus again gave me His Cross You told me dear Mother that you had had the Bishop s answer since December twenty eight the feast of Holy Innocents that he authorised my immediate entry into the Carmel but that nevertheless you had decided not to open its doors till after Lent I could not restrain my tears at the thought of such a long delay This trial affected me in a special manner for I felt my earthly ties were severed and yet the Ark in its turn refused to admit the poor little dove How did these three months pass They were fruitful in sufferings and still more so in other graces At first the thought came into my mind that I would not put any extra restraint on myself I would lead a life somewhat less strictly ordered than was my custom But Our Lord made me understand the benefit I might derive from this time He had granted me and I then resolved to give myself up to a more serious and mortified life When I say mortified I do not mean that I imitated the penances of the Saints far from resembling those beautiful souls who have practised all sorts of mortifications from their infancy I made mine consist in simply checking my inclinations keeping back an impatient answer doing little services to those around me without setting store thereby and a hundred other things of the kind By practising these trifles I prepared myself to become the Spouse of Jesus and I can never tell you Mother how much the added delay helped me to grow in abandonment in humility and in other virtues one Joel two nineteen two Imitation of Christ III xxiv two three Isa sixty five fifteen four Apoc two seventeen five one Cor four five six

eighty eight being the Feast of the Annunciation transferred from Passiontide was the day chosen for me to enter the Carmel On the evening before we were gathered around the table where I was to take my place for the last time These farewells are in themselves heartrending and just when I would have liked to be forgotten I received the tenderest expressions of affection as if to increase the pain of parting The next morning after a last look at the happy home of my childhood I set out for the Carmel where we all heard Mass At the moment of Communion when Jesus had entered our hearts I heard sobs on all sides I did not shed a tear but as I led the way to the cloister door my heart beat so violently that I wondered if I were going to die Oh the agony of that moment One must have experienced it in order to understand I embraced all my dear ones and knelt for my Father s blessing He too knelt down and blessed me through his tears It was a sight to gladden the Angels this old man giving his child to God while she was yet in the springtime of life At length the doors of the Carmel closed upon me I found a welcome in your arms dear Mother and received the embraces of another family whose devotedness and love is not dreamt of by the outside world At last my desires were realised and I cannot describe the deep sweet peace which filled my soul This peace has remained with me during the eight and a half years of my life here and has never left me even amid the greatest trials Everything in the Convent delighted me especially our little cell one I fancied myself transported to the desert I repeat that my happiness was calm and peaceful not even the lightest breeze ruffled the tranquil waters on which my little barque sailed no cloud darkened the blue sky I felt fully recompensed for all I had gone through and I kept saying Now I am here for ever Mine was no passing joy it did not fade like first illusions From illusions God in His Mercy has ever preserved me I found the religious life just what I expected and sacrifice was never a matter of surprise Yet you know well that from the beginning my ways was strewn with thorns rather than with roses In the first place my soul had for its daily food the bread of spiritual dryness Then too dear Mother Our Lord allowed you unconsciously to treat me very severely You found fault with me whenever you met me I remember once I had left a cobweb in the cloister and you said to me before the whole community It is easy to see that our cloisters are swept by a child of fifteen It is disgraceful Go and sweep away that cobweb and be more careful in future On the rare occasions when I spent an hour with you for spiritual direction you seemed to be scolding me nearly all the time and what pained me most of all was that I did not see how to correct my faults for instance my slow ways and want of throughness in my duties faults which you were careful to point out One day it occurred to me that you would certainly prefer me to spend my free time in work instead of in prayer as was my custom so I plied my needle industriously without even raising my eyes No one ever knew of this as I wished to be faithful to Our Lord and do things solely for Him to see When I was a postulant our Mistress used to send me every afternoon at half past four to weed the garden This was a real penance the more so dear Mother because I was almost sure to meet you on the way and once you remarked Really this child does absolutely nothing What are we to think of a novice who must have a walk every day And yet dear Mother how grateful I am to you for giving me such a sound and valuable training It was an inestimable grace What should I have become if as the world outside believed I had been but the pet of the Community Perhaps instead of seeing Our Lord in the person of my superiors I should only have considered the creature and my heart which had been so carefully guarded in the world would have been ensnared by human affection in the cloister Happily your motherly prudence saved me from such a disaster And not only in this matter but in other and more bitter trials I can truly say that Suffering opened her arms to me from the first and I took her to my heart In the solemn examination before my profession I declared as was customary the reason of my entry into the Carmel I have come to save souls and especially to pray for Priests One cannot attain the end without adopting the means and as Our Lord made me understand that it was by the Cross He would give me souls the more crosses I met with the stronger grew my attraction to suffering For five years this way was mine but I alone knew it this was precisely the flower I wished to offer to Jesus a hidden flower which keeps its perfume only for Heaven Two months after my entry Father Pichon was surprised at the workings of grace in my soul he thought my piety childlike and my path an easy one My conversation with this good Father would have brought me great comfort had it not been for the extreme difficulty I found in opening my heart Nevertheless I made a general confession and after it he said to me Before God the Blessed Virgin and Angels and all the Saints I declare that you have never committed a mortal sin Thank God for the favours He has so freely bestowed on you without any merit on your part Without any merit on my part That was not difficult to believe Fully conscious of my weakness and imperfection my heart overflowed with gratitude I had distressed myself fearing I might have stained my baptismal robe and this assurance coming as it did from the lips of a director a man of wisdom and holiness such as our Mother saint Teresa desired seemed to come from God Himself Father Pichon added May Our Lord always be your Superior and your Novice Master And indeed He ever was and likewise my Director In saying this I do not mean to imply that I was not communicative with my superiors far from being reserved I always tried to be as an open book Our Mistress was a true saint the perfect type of the first Carmelites and I seldom left her side for she had to teach me how to work Her kindness was beyond words I loved and appreciated her and yet my soul did not expand I could not explain myself words failed me and so the time of spiritual direction became a veritable martyrdom One of the older nuns seemed to understand what I felt for she once said to me during recreation I should think child you have not much to tell your superiors Why do you think that dear Mother I asked Because your soul is very simple but when you are perfect you will become more simple still The nearer one approaches God the simpler one becomes This good Mother was right Nevertheless the great difficulty I found in opening my heart though it came from simplicity was a genuine trial Now however without having lost my simplicity I am able to express my thoughts with the greatest ease I have already said that Our Lord Himself had acted as my Spiritual Guide Hardly had Father Pichon become my director when his Superiors sent him to Canada I was only able to hear from him once in the year so now the Little Flower which had been transplanted to the mountain of Carmel quickly turned to the Director of Directors and unfolded itself under the shadow of His Cross having for refreshing dew His Tears His Precious Blood and for radiant sun His Adorable Face Until then I had not appreciated the beauties of the Holy Face it was my dear Mother Agnes of Jesus who unveiled them to me As she had been the first of her sisters to enter the Carmel so she was the first to penetrate the mysteries of love hidden in the Face of Our Divine Spouse Then she showed them to me and I understood better than ever in what true glory consists He whose Kingdom is not of this world two taught me that the only royalty to be coveted lies in being unknown and esteemed as naught three and in the joy of self abasement And I wished that my face like the Face of Jesus should be as it were hidden and despised four so that no one on earth should esteem me I thirsted to suffer and to be forgotten Most merciful has been the way by which the Divine Master has ever led me He has never inspired me with any desire and left it unsatisfied and that is why I have always found His bitter chalice full of sweetness At the end of May Marie our eldest was professed and Therese the Benjamin had the privilege of crowning her with roses on the day of her mystical espousals After this happy feast trials again came upon us Ever since his first attack of paralysis we realised that my Father was very easily tired During our journey to Rome I often noticed that he seemed exhausted and in pain But above all I remarked his progress in the path of holiness he had succeeded in obtaining a complete mastery over the impetuosity of his natural disposition and earthly things were unable to ruffle his calm Let me give you an instance During our pilgrimage we were in the train for days and nights together and to wile away the time our companions played cards and occasionally grew very noisy One day they asked us to join them but we refused saying we knew little about the game we did not find the time long only too short indeed to enjoy the beautiful views which opened before us Presently their annoyance became evident and then dear Papa began quietly to defend us pointing out that as we were on pilgrimage more of our time might be given to prayer One of the players forgetting the respect due to age called out thoughtlessly Thank God Pharisees are rare My Father did not answer a word he even seemed pleased and later on he found an opportunity of shaking hands with this man and of speaking so pleasantly that the latter must have thought his rude words had either not been heard or at least were forgotten His habit of forgiveness did not date from this day my Mother and all who knew him bore witness that no uncharitable word ever passed his lips His faith and generosity were likewise equal to any trial This is how he announced my departure to one of his friends Therese my little Queen entered the Carmel yesterday God alone could ask such a sacrifice but He helps me so mightily that even in the midst of tears my heart is overflowing with joy This faithful servant must needs receive a reward worthy of his virtues and he himself claimed that reward You remember the interview when he said to us Children I have just come back from Alencon and there in the Church of Notre Dame I received such graces and consolations that I made this prayer My God it is too much yes I am too happy I shall not get to Heaven like this I wish to suffer something for Thee and I offered myself as a the word victim died on his lips He dared not pronounce it before us but we understood You know dear Mother the story of our trial I need not recall its sorrowful details And now my clothing day drew near Contrary to all expectations my Father had recovered from a second attack and the Bishop fixed the ceremony for January ten The time of waiting had been long indeed but now what a beautiful feast Nothing was wanting not even snow Do you remember my telling you dear Mother how fond I am of snow While I was still quite small its whiteness entranced me Why had I such a fancy for snow Perhaps it was because being a little winter flower my eyes first saw the earth clad in its beautiful white mantle So on my clothing day I wished to see it decked like myself in spotless white The weather was so mild that it might have been spring and I no longer dared hope for snow The morning of the feast brought no change and I gave up my childish desire as impossible to be realised My Father came to meet me at the enclosure door his eyes full of tears and pressing me to his heart exclaimed Ah Here is my little Queen Then giving me his arm we made our solemn entry into the public Chapel This was his day of triumph his last feast on earth now his sacrifice was complete and his children belonged to God five Celine had already confided to him that later on she also wished to leave the world for the Carmel On hearing this he was beside himself with joy Let us go before the Blessed Sacrament he said and thank God for all the graces He has granted us and the honour He has paid me in choosing His Spouses from my household God has indeed done me great honour in asking for my children If I possessed anything better I would hasten to offer it to Him That something better was himself and God received him as a victim of holocaust He tried him as gold in the furnace and found him worthy of Himself six After the ceremony in the Chapel I re entered the Convent and the Bishop intoned the Te Deum One of the Priests observed to him that this hymn of thanksgiving was only sung at professions but once begun it was continued to the end Was it not right that this feast should be complete since in it all other joyful days were reunited The instant I set foot in the enclosure again my eyes fell on the statue of the Child Jesus smiling on me amid the flowers and lights then turning towards the quadrangle I saw that in spite of the mildness of the weather it was covered with snow What a delicate attention on the part of Jesus Gratifying the least wish of His little Spouse He even sent her this Where is the creature so mighty that he can make one flake of it fall to please his beloved Everyone was amazed and since then many people hearing of my desire have described this event as the little miracle of my clothing day and thought it strange I should be so fond of snow So much the better it shows still more the wonderful condescension of the Spouse of Virgins of Him Who loves lilies white as the snow After the ceremony the Bishop entered He gave me many proofs of his fatherly tenderness and in presence of all the Priests spoke of my visit to Bayeux and the journey to Rome nor did he forget to tell them how I had put up my hair before visiting him Then laying his hand on my head he blessed me affectionately My mind dwelt with ineffable sweetness on the caresses Our Lord will soon lavish upon me before all the Saints and this consoling thought was a foretaste of Heaven I have just said that January ten was a day of triumph for my dear Father I liken it to the feast of the entry of Christ into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday As in the case of Our Divine Master his day of triumph was followed by long days of sorrow and even as the agony of Jesus pierced the heart of His divine Mother so our hearts were deeply wounded by the humiliations and sufferings of him whom we loved best on earth I remember that in the month of June eighteen eighty eight when we were fearing another stroke of paralysis I surprised our Novice Mistress by saying I am suffering a great deal Mother yet I feel I can suffer still more I did not then foresee the trial awaiting us I did not know that on February twelve one month after my clothing day our beloved Father would drink so deeply of such a bitter chalice I no longer said I could suffer more words cannot express our grief nor shall I attempt to describe it here In Heaven we shall enjoy dwelling on these dark days of exile Yet the three years of my Father s martyrdom seem to me the sweetest and most fruitful of our lives I would not exchange them for the most sublime ecstasies and my heart cries out in gratitude for such a priceless treasure We have rejoiced for the days wherein Thou hast afflicted us seven Precious and sweet was this bitter cross and our hearts only breathed out sighs of grateful love We no longer walked we ran we flew along the path of perfection Leonie and Celine though living in the world were no longer of the world The letters they wrote were full of the most edifying resignation And what talks I had with Celine Far from separating us the grating of the Carmel united us more closely the same thoughts the same desires the same love for Our Lord and for souls made our very life Not a word concerning things of earth entered into our conversation but just as in former days we lifted longing eyes to Heaven so now our hearts strained after the joys beyond time and space and for the sake of an eternal happiness we chose to suffer and be despised here below Though my suffering seemed to have reached its height yet my attraction thereto did not grow less and soon my soul shared in the trials my heart had to bear My spiritual aridity increased and I found no comfort either in Heaven or on earth yet amid these waters of tribulation that I had so thirsted for I was the happiest of mortals Thus passed the time of my betrothal too long a time for me At the end of the year you told me dear Mother that I must not yet think of my profession as our Ecclesiastical Superior expressly forbade it I had therefore to wait for eight months more At first I found it very difficult to be resigned to such a sacrifice but divine light penetrated my soul before long At this time I was using for my meditations Surin s Foundations of the Spiritual life One day during prayer it was brought home to me that my too eager desire to take my vows was mingled with much self love as I belonged to Our Lord and was His little plaything to console and please Him it was for me to do His Will not for Him to do mine I also understood that a bride would not be pleasing to the bridegroom on her wedding day were she not magnificently attired But what had I made ready So I said to Our Lord I do not ask Thee to hasten the day of my profession I will wait as long as Thou pleasest only I cannot bear that through any fault of mine my union with Thee should be delayed I will set to work and carefully prepare a wedding dress enriched with diamonds and precious stones and when Thou findest it sufficiently rich I am sure that nothing will keep Thee from accepting me as Thy Spouse I took up the task with renewed zest Since my clothing day I had received abundant lights on religious perfection chiefly concerning the vow of poverty Whilst I was a postulant I liked to have nice things to use and to find everything needful ready to hand Jesus bore with me patiently for He gives His light little by little At the beginning of my spiritual life about the age of fourteen I used to ask myself how in days to come I should more clearly understand the true meaning of perfection I imagined I then understood it completely but I soon came to realise that the more one advances along this path the farther one seems from the goal and now I am resigned to be always imperfect and I even find joy therein To return to the lessons which Our Lord taught me One evening after Compline I searched in vain for our lamp on the shelves where they are kept and as it was the time of the Great Silence I could not recover it I guessed rightly that a Sister believing it to be her own had taken it but just on that evening I had counted much on doing some work and was I to spend a whole hour in the dark on account of this mistake Without the interior light of grace I should undoubtedly have pitied myself but with that light I felt happy instead of aggrieved and reflected that poverty consists in being deprived not only of what is convenient but of what is necessary And in this exterior darkness I found my soul illumined by a brightness that was divine At this time I was seized with a craving for whatever was ugly and inconvenient and was thus quite pleased when a pretty little jug was taken from our cell and a large chipped one put in its place I also tried hard not to make excuses but I found this very difficult especially with our Mistress from her I did not like to hide anything My first victory was not a great one but it cost me a good deal A small jar left behind a window was found broken No one knew who had put it there but our Mistress was displeased and thinking I was to blame in leaving it about told me I was very untidy and must be more careful in future Without answering I kissed the ground and promised to be more observant I was so little advanced in virtue that these small sacrifices cost me dear and I had to console myself with the thought that at the day of Judgment all would be known Above all I endeavoured to practise little hidden acts of virtue thus I took pleasure in folding the mantles forgotten by the Sisters and I sought for every possible occasion of helping them One of God s gifts was a great attraction towards penance but I was not permitted to satisfy it the only mortification allowed me consisted in mortifying my self love and this did me far more good than bodily penance would have done However Our Lady helped me with my wedding dress and as soon as it was finished every obstacle vanished and my profession was fixed for September eight eighteen ninety All that I have set down in these few words would take many pages to relate but those pages will never be read on earth one Nuns in the spirit of poverty avoid using the word my as denoting private possessions so later on our lamp our handkerchief will occur Ed two John eighteen thirty

nun at Caen and took the name of Sister Frances Teresa six Cf Wisdom three fifty six seven Ps eighty nine ninety fifteen CHAPTER VIII PROFESSION OF SOEUR THERESE Need I tell you dear Mother about the retreat before my profession Far from receiving consolation I went through it in a state of utter dryness and as if abandoned by God Jesus as was His wont slept in my little barque How rarely do souls suffer Him to sleep in peace This Good Master is so wearied with continually making fresh advances that He eagerly avails Himself of the repose I offer Him and no doubt He will sleep on until my great and everlasting retreat but instead of being grieved at this I am glad In truth I am no Saint as this frame of mind well shows I ought not to rejoice in my dryness of soul but rather attribute it to my want of fervour and fidelity That I fall asleep so often during meditation and thanksgiving after Communion should distress me Well I am not distressed I reflect that little children are equally dear to their parents whether they are asleep or awake that in order to perform operations doctors put their patients to sleep and finally that The Lord knoweth our frame He remembereth that we are but dust one Yet apparently barren as was my retreat and those which followed have been no less so I unconsciously received many interior lights on the best means of pleasing God and practising virtue I have often observed that Our Lord will not give me any store of provisions but nourishes me each moment with food that is ever new I find it within me without knowing how it has come there I simply believe that it is Jesus Himself hidden in my poor heart who is secretly at work inspiring me with what He wishes me to do as each occasion arises Shortly before my profession I received the Holy Father s blessing through the hands of Brother Simeon and this precious Blessing undoubtedly helped me through the most terrible storm of my whole life On the eve of the great day instead of being filled with the customary sweetness my vocation suddenly seemed to me as unreal as a dream The devil for it was he made me feel sure that I was wholly unsuited for life in the Carmel and that I was deceiving my superiors by entering on a way to which I was not called The darkness was so bewildering that I understood but one thing I had no religious vocation and must return to the world I cannot describe the agony I endured What was I to do in such a difficulty I chose the right course deciding to tell my Novice Mistress of the temptation without delay I sent for her to come out of choir and though full of confusion I confessed the state of my soul Fortunately she saw more clearly than I did and reassured me completely by laughing frankly at my story The devil was put to instant flight by my humble avowal what he wanted was to keep me from speaking and thus draw me into his snares But it was my turn now to ensnare him for to make my humiliation more complete I also told you everything dear Mother and your consoling words dispelled my last fears On the morning of September eight a wave of peace flooded my soul and in that peace which surpasseth all understanding two I pronounced my holy vows Many were the graces I asked I felt myself truly a queen and took advantage of my title to obtain every favour from the King for His ungrateful subjects No one was forgotten I wished that every sinner on earth might be converted that on that day Purgatory should set its captives free and I bore upon my heart this letter containing what I desired for myself O Jesus my Divine Spouse grant that my baptismal robe may never be sullied Take me from this world rather than let me stain my soul by committing the least wilful fault May I never seek or find aught but Thee alone May all creatures be nothing to me and I nothing to them May no earthly thing disturb my peace O Jesus I ask but Peace Peace and above all Love Love without limit Jesus I ask that for Thy sake I may die a Martyr give me martyrdom of soul or body Or rather give me both the one and the other Grant that I may fulfill my engagements in all their perfection that no one may think of me that I may be trodden under foot forgotten as a little grain of sand I offer myself to Thee O my Beloved that Thou mayest ever perfectly accomplish in me Thy Holy Will without let or hindrance from creatures When at the close of this glorious day I laid my crown of roses according to custom at Our Lady s feet it was without regret I felt that time would never lessen my happiness It was the Nativity of Mary What a beautiful feast on which to become the Spouse of Jesus It was the little new born Holy Virgin who presented her little Flower to the little Jesus That day everything was little except the graces I received except my peace and joy in gazing upon the beautiful star lit sky at night and in thinking that soon I should fly away to Heaven and be united to my Divine Spouse amid eternal bliss On September twenty four took place the ceremony of my receiving the veil This feast was indeed veiled in tears Papa was too ill to come and bless his little Queen at the last minute Mgr Hugonin who should have presided was unable to do so and for other reasons also the day was a painful one And yet amid it all my soul was profoundly at peace That day it pleased Our Lord that I should not be able to restrain my tears and those tears were not understood It is true I had borne far harder trials without shedding a tear but then I had been helped by special graces whilst on this day Jesus left me to myself and I soon showed my weakness Eight days after I had taken the veil my cousin Jeanne Guerin was married to doctor La Neele When she came to see us afterwards and I heard of all the little attentions she lavished on her husband my heart thrilled and I thought It shall never be said that a woman in the world does more for her husband than I do for Jesus my Beloved And filled with fresh ardour I set myself more earnestly than ever to please my Heavenly Spouse the King of Kings Who had deigned to honour me by a divine alliance Having seen the letter announcing the marriage I amused myself by composing the following invitation which I read to the novices in order to bring home to them what had struck me so forcibly that the glory of all earthly unions is as nothing compared to the titles of a Spouse of Our Divine Lord God Almighty Creator of Heaven and Earth Sovereign Ruler of the Universe and the Glorious Virgin Mary Queen of the Heavenly Court announce to you the Spiritual Espousals of their August Son Jesus King of Kings and Lord of Lords with little Therese Martin now Princess and Lady of His Kingdoms of the Holy Childhood and the Passion assigned to her as a dowry by her Divine Spouse from which Kingdoms she holds her titles of nobility of the Child Jesus and of the Holy Face It was not possible to invite you to the Wedding Feast which took place on the Mountain of Carmel September eight eighteen ninety the Heavenly Court was alone admitted but you are requested to be present at the Wedding Feast which will take place to morrow the day of Eternity when Jesus the Son of God will come in the clouds of Heaven in the splendour of His Majesty to judge the living and the dead The hour being still uncertain you are asked to hold yourselves in readiness and watch three And now Mother what more shall I say It was through your hands that I gave myself to Our Lord and you have known me from childhood need I write my secrets Forgive me if I cut short the story of my religious life During the general retreat following my profession I received great graces As a rule I find preached retreats most trying but this one was quite an exception I anticipated so much suffering that I prepared myself by a fervent novena It was said that the good Priest understood better how to convert sinners than to direct the souls of nuns Well then I must be a great sinner for God made use of this holy religious to bring me much consolation At that time I had all kinds of interior trials which I found it impossible to explain to anyone suddenly I was able to lay open my whole soul The Father understood me in a marvellous way he seemed to divine my state and launched me full sail upon that ocean of confidence and love in which I had longed to advance but so far had not dared He told me that my faults did not pain the Good God and added At this moment I hold His place and I assure you from Him that He is well pleased with your soul How happy these consoling words made me I had never been told before that it was possible for faults not to pain the Sacred Heart this assurance filled me with joy and helped me to bear with patience the exile of this life It was also the echo of my inmost thoughts In truth I had long known that the Lord is more tender than a mother and I have sounded the depths of more than one mother s heart I know that a mother is ever ready to forgive her child s small thoughtless faults How often have I not had this sweet experience No reproach could have touched me more than one single kiss from my Mother My nature is such that fear makes me shrink while under love s sweet rule I not only advance I fly Two months after this happy retreat our Venerable Foundress Mother Genevieve of saint Teresa quitted our little convent to enter the Heavenly Carmel Before speaking of my impressions at the time of her death I should like to tell you what a joy it was to have lived for some years with a soul whose holiness was not inimitable but lay in the practice of simple and hidden virtues More than once she was to me a source of great consolation One Sunday I went to the infirmary to pay her a visit but as two of the older nuns were there I was retiring quietly when she called me and said with something of inspiration in her manner Wait my child I have just a word for you you are always asking me for a spiritual bouquet well to day I give you this one Serve the Lord in peace and in joy Remember that Our God is the God of peace I thanked her quite simply and went out of the room I was moved almost to tears and was convinced that God had revealed to her the state of my soul That day I had been sorely tried almost to sadness Such was the darkness that I no longer knew if I were beloved of God and so dear Mother you can understand what light and consolation succeeded this gloom The following Sunday I asked her whether she had received any revelation about me but she assured me that she had not and this only made me admire her the more for it showed how intimately Jesus lived in her soul and directed her words and actions Such holiness seems to me the most true the most holy it is the holiness I desire for it is free from all illusion On the day when this revered Mother ended her exile I received a very special grace It was the first time I had assisted at a death bed yet though the sight enchanted me by its beauty my two hours of watching had made me very drowsy I was grieved at this but at the moment her soul took its flight to Heaven my feelings were completely changed In an instant I was filled with an indescribable joy and fervour as if the soul of our blessed Foundress made me share in the happiness she already enjoyed for I am quite convinced she went straight to Heaven I had said to her some time previously You will not go to Purgatory dear Mother I hope not she answered sweetly Certainly God would not disappoint a hope so full of humility and the proof that He did not lies in the many favours we have received The Sisters hastened to claim something belonging to our beloved Mother and you know what a precious relic is mine During her agony I had noticed a tear glistening like a beautiful diamond That tear the last she shed on this earth did not fall I still saw it shining when her body was exposed in the choir When evening came I made bold to approach unseen with a little piece of linen and I now have the happiness of possessing the last tear of a Saint I attach no importance to my dreams and indeed they seldom have any special meaning though I do often wonder how it is that as I think of God all the day my mind does not dwell on Him more in my sleep Generally I dream of the woods and the flowers the brooks and the sea and nearly always of pretty children or I chase birds and butterflies such as I have never seen But if my dreams are sometimes poetical they are never mystical However one night after Mother Genevieve s death I had a more consoling one I thought I saw her giving to each of us something that had belonged to herself When my turn came her hands were empty and I was afraid I was not to receive anything but she looked at me lovingly and said three times To you I leave my heart About a month after that seraphic death towards the close of the year eighteen ninety one an epidemic of influenza raged in the Community I only had it slightly and was able to be about with two other Sisters It is impossible to imagine the heartrending state of our Carmel throughout those days of sorrow The worst sufferers were nursed by those who could hardly drag themselves about death was all around us and when a Sister had breathed her last we had to leave her instantly My nineteenth birthday was saddened by the death of Mother Sub Prioress I assisted with the infirmarian during her agony and two more deaths quickly followed I now had to do the Sacristy work single handed and I wonder sometimes how I was equal to it all One morning when it was time to rise I had a presentiment that Sister Magdalen was no more The dormitory was quite in darkness no one was leaving her cell I decided however to go in to Sister Magdalen and I found her dressed but lying dead on her bed I was not in the least afraid and running to the Sacristy I quickly brought a blessed candle and placed on her head a wreath of roses Amid all this desolation I felt the Hand of God and knew that His Heart was watching over us Our dear Sisters left this life for a happier one without any struggle an expression of heavenly joy shone on their faces and they seemed only to be enjoying a pleasant sleep During all these long and trying weeks I had the unspeakable consolation of receiving Holy Communion every day How sweet it was For a long time Jesus treated me as a spoilt child for a longer time than His more faithful Spouses He came to me daily for several months after the influenza had ceased a privilege not granted to the Community I had not asked this favour but I was unspeakably happy to be united day after day to my Beloved Great was my joy in being allowed to touch the Sacred Vessels and prepare the Altar linen on which Our Lord was to be laid I felt that I must increase in fervour and I often recalled those words addressed to deacons at their ordination Be you holy you who carry the Vessels of the Lord What can I tell you dear Mother about my thanksgivings after Communion There is no time when I taste less consolation But this is what I should expect I desire to receive Our Lord not for my own satisfaction but simply to give Him pleasure I picture my soul as a piece of waste ground and beg Our Blessed Lady to take away my imperfections which are as heaps of rubbish and to build upon it a splendid tabernacle worthy of Heaven and adorn it with her own adornments Then I invite all the Angels and Saints to come and sing canticles of love and it seems to me that Jesus is well pleased to see Himself received so grandly and I share in His joy But all this does not prevent distractions and drowsiness from troubling me and not unfrequently I resolve to continue my thanksgiving throughout the day since I made it so badly in choir You see dear Mother that my way is not the way of fear I can always make myself happy and profit by my imperfections and Our Lord Himself encourages me in this path Once contrary to my usual custom I felt troubled when I approached the Holy Table For several days there had not been a sufficient number of Hosts and I had only received a small part of one this morning I foolishly thought If the same thing happens to day I shall imagine that Jesus does not care to come into my heart I approached the rails What a joy awaited me The Priest hesitated a moment then gave me two entire Hosts Was this not a sweet response I have much to be thankful for I will tell you quite openly what the Lord has done for me He has shown unto me the same mercy as unto King Solomon All my desires have been satisfied not only my desires of perfection but even those of which I understood the vanity in theory if not in practice I had always looked on Sister Agnes of Jesus as my model and I wished to be like her in everything She used to paint exquisite miniatures and write beautiful poems and this inspired me with a desire to learn to paint four and express my thoughts in verse that I might do some good to those around me But I would not ask for these natural gifts and my desire remained hidden in my heart Jesus too had hidden Himself in this poor little heart and He was pleased to show me once more the vanity of all that passes To the great astonishment of the Community I succeeded in painting several pictures and in writing poems which have been a help to certain souls And just as Solomon turning to all the works which his hand had wrought and to the labours wherein he had laboured in vain saw in all things vanity and vexation of mind five so experience showed me that the sole happiness of earth consists in lying hidden and remaining in total ignorance of created things I understood that without love even the most brilliant deeds count for nothing These gifts which Our Lord lavished upon me far from doing me any harm drew me towards Him I saw that He alone is unchangeable He alone can fill the vast abyss of my desires Talking of my desires I must tell you about others of quite a different kind which the Divine Master has also been pleased to grant childish desires like the wish for snow on my clothing day You know dear Mother how fond I am of flowers When I made myself a prisoner at the age of fifteen I gave up for ever the delights of rambling through meadows bright with the treasures of spring Well I never possessed so many flowers as I have had since entering the Carmel In the world young men present their betrothed with beautiful bouquets and Jesus did not forget me For His Altar I received in abundance all the flowers I loved best cornflowers poppies marguerites one little friend only was missing the purple vetch I longed to see it again and at last it came to gladden me and show that in the least as in the greatest God gives a hundred fold even in this life to those who have left all for His Love But one desire the dearest of all and for many reasons the most difficult remained unfulfilled It was to see Celine enter the Carmel of Lisieux However I had made a sacrifice of my longing and committed to God alone the future of my loved sister I was willing she should be sent to far distant lands if it must be so but I wanted above all things to see her like myself the Spouse of Jesus I suffered deeply aware that she was exposed in the world to dangers I had never even known My affection for her was maternal rather than sisterly and I was filled with solicitude for the welfare of her soul She was to go one evening with my aunt and cousins to a dance I know not why but I felt more anxious than usual and I shed many tears imploring Our Lord to hinder her dancing And this was just what happened for He did not suffer His little Spouse to dance that evening although as a rule she did so most gracefully And to the astonishment of everyone her partner too found that he was only able to walk gravely up and down with Mademoiselle The poor young man slipped away in confusion and did not dare appear again that evening This unique occurrence increased my confidence in Our Lord and showed me clearly that He had already set His seal on my sister s brow On July twenty nine eighteen ninety four God called my saintly and much tried Father to Himself For the last two years of his life he was completely paralysed so my uncle took him into his house and surrounded him with the tenderest care He became quite helpless and was only able to visit us once during the whole course of his illness It was a sad interview At the moment of parting as we said good bye he raised his eyes and pointing upwards said in a voice full of tears In Heaven Now that he was with God the last ties which kept his consoling Angel in the world were broken Angels do not remain on this earth when they have accomplished their mission they return instantly to Heaven That is why they have wings Celine tried therefore to fly to the Carmel but the obstacles seemed insurmountable One day when matters were going from bad to worse I said to Our Lord after Holy Communion Thou knowest dear Jesus how earnestly I have desired that the trials my Father endured should serve as his purgatory I long to know if my wish is granted I do not ask Thee to speak to me I only want a sign Thou knowest how much opposed is Sister N to Celine s entering if she withdraw her opposition I shall regard it as an answer from Thee and in this way I shall know that my Father went straight to Heaven God Who holds in His Hand the hearts of His creatures and inclines them as He will deigned in His infinite mercy and ineffable condescension to change that Sister s mind She was the first person I met after my thanksgiving and with tears in her eyes she spoke of Celine s entrance which she now ardently desired Shortly afterwards the Bishop set every obstacle aside and then you were able dear Mother without any hesitation to open our doors to the poor little exile six Now I have no desire left unless it be to love Jesus even unto folly It is Love alone that draws me I no longer wish either for suffering or death yet both are precious to me Long did I call upon them as the messengers of joy I have suffered much and I have thought my barque near indeed to the Everlasting Shore From earliest childhood I have imagined that the Little Flower would be gathered in its springtime now the spirit of self abandonment alone is my guide I have no other compass and know not how to ask anything with eagerness save the perfect accomplishment of God s designs upon my soul I can say these words of the Canticle of our Father saint John of the Cross I drank deep in the cellar of my Friend And coming forth again Knew naught of all this plain And lost the flock I erst was wont to tend My soul and all its wealth I gave to be His Own No more I tend my flock all other work is done And all my exercise is Love alone seven Or rather Love hath so wrought in me Since I have known its sway That all within me whether good or ill It makes subservient to the end it seeks And soon transforms my soul into itself eight Full sweet is the way of Love It is true one may fall and be unfaithful to grace but Love knowing how to profit by everything quickly consumes whatever is displeasing to Jesus leaving in the heart only a deep and humble peace I have obtained many spiritual lights through the works of saint John of the Cross When I was seventeen and eighteen they were my only food but later on and even now all spiritual authors leave me cold and dry However beautiful and touching a book may be my heart does not respond and I read without understanding or if I understand I cannot meditate In my helplessness the Holy Scriptures and the Imitation are of the greatest assistance in them I find a hidden manna genuine and pure But it is from the Gospels that I find most help in the time of prayer from them I draw all that I need for my poor soul I am always discovering in them new lights and hidden mysterious meanings I know and I have experienced that the Kingdom of God is within us nine Our Lord has no need of books or teachers to instruct our souls He the Teacher of Teachers instructs us without any noise of words I have never heard Him speak yet I know He is within me He is there always guiding and inspiring me and just when I need them lights hitherto unseen break in This is not as a rule during my prayers but in the midst of my daily duties Sometimes however as this evening at the close of a meditation spent in utter dryness a word of comfort is given to me Here is the Master I give thee He will teach thee all that thou shouldst do I wish thee to read in the Book of Life in which is contained the science of love ten The Science of Love How sweetly do these words echo in my soul That science alone do I desire Having given all my substance for it like the Spouse in the Canticles I think that I have given nothing eleven After so many graces may I not sing with the Psalmist that the Lord is good that His Mercy endureth for ever twelve It seems to me that if everyone were to receive such favours God would be feared by none but loved to excess that no one would ever commit the least wilful fault and this through love not fear Yet all souls cannot be alike It is necessary that they should differ from one another in order that each Divine Perfection may receive its special honour To me He has given His Infinite Mercy and it is in this ineffable mirror that I contemplate his other attributes Therein all appear to me radiant with Love His Justice even more perhaps than the rest seems to me to be clothed with Love What joy to think that Our Lord is just that is to say that He takes our weakness into account that He knows perfectly the frailty of our nature Of what then need I be afraid Will not the God of Infinite Justice Who deigns so lovingly to pardon the sins of the Prodigal Son be also just to me who am always with Him thirteen In the year eighteen ninety five I received the grace to understand more than ever how much Jesus desires to be loved Thinking one day of those who offer themselves as victims to the Justice of God in order to turn aside the punishment reserved for sinners by taking it upon themselves I felt this offering to be noble and generous but was very far from feeling myself drawn to make it O my Divine Master I cried from the bottom of my heart shall Thy Justice alone receive victims of holocaust Has not Thy Merciful Love also need thereof On all sides it is ignored rejected the hearts on which Thou wouldst lavish it turn to creatures there to seek their happiness in the miserable satisfaction of a moment instead of casting themselves into Thine Arms into the unfathomable furnace of Thine Infinite Love O my God must Thy Love which is disdained lie hidden in Thy Heart Methinks if Thou shouldst find souls offering themselves as victims of holocaust to Thy Love Thou wouldst consume them rapidly Thou wouldst be well pleased to suffer the flames of infinite tenderness to escape that are imprisoned in Thy Heart If Thy Justice which is of earth must needs be satisfied how much more must Thy Merciful Love desire to inflame souls since Thy mercy reacheth even to the Heavens fourteen O Jesus Let me be that happy victim consume Thy holocaust with the Fire of Divine Love Dear Mother you know the love or rather the oceans of grace which flooded my soul immediately after I made that Act of Oblation on June nine eighteen ninety five From that day I have been penetrated and surrounded with love Every moment this Merciful Love renews me and purifies me leaving in my soul no trace of sin I cannot fear Purgatory I know I do not merit to enter even into that place of expiation with the Holy Souls but I also know that the fire of Love is more sanctifying than the fire of Purgatory I know that Jesus could not wish useless suffering for us and He would not inspire me with the desires I feel were He not willing to fulfill them one Psalm one hundred two one hundred three fourteen two Phil four seven three This letter the style of which may seem strange to English ears is modelled closely on the formal and quaint letters whereby French parents of the better class announce to their friends the marriage of their children Such letters of faire part are issued in the name of relatives to the third or fourth degree Ed four Therese had kept this wish hidden in her heart from the days of her childhood and later in life she made the following confidence I was ten the day Papa told Celine that she was to begin painting lessons I felt quite envious Then he turned to me and said Well little Queen would you like to learn painting too I was going to say Yes indeed I should when Marie remarked that I had not the same taste for it as Celine She carried her point and I said nothing thinking it was a splendid opportunity to make a big sacrifice for Our Lord I was so anxious to learn that even now I wonder how I was able to keep silence five Eccl two eleven six Celine entered the Convent on September fourteen eighteen ninety four and took the name of Sister Genevieve of saint Teresa seven Spiritual Canticle Stanzas eighteen

Luke fifteen thirty one fourteen Cf Psalm thirty five thirty six six CHAPTER IX THE NIGHT OF THE SOUL Dear Mother I thought I had written enough and now you wish for more details of my religious life I will not argue but I cannot help smiling when I have to tell you things that you know quite as well as I do Nevertheless I will obey I do not ask what use this manuscript can be to any one I assure you that even were you to burn it before my eyes without having read it I should not mind in the least The opinion is not uncommon in the Community that you have always indulged me ever since I entered the Convent however Man seeth those things that appear but the Lord beholdeth the heart one Dear Mother once again I thank you for not having spared me Jesus knew well that His Little Flower needed the life giving water of humiliation it was too weak to take root otherwise and to you it owes so great a blessing But for some months the Divine Master has entirely changed His method of cultivating His Little Flower Finding no doubt that it has been sufficiently watered He now allows it to expand under the warm rays of a brilliant sun He smiles on it and this favour also comes through you dear Mother but far from doing it harm those smiles make the Little Flower grow in a wondrous way Deep down in its heart it treasures those precious drops of dew the mortifications of other days and they remind it that it is small and frail Even were all creatures to draw near to admire and flatter it that would not add a shade of idle satisfaction to the true joy which thrills it on realising that in God s Eyes it is but a poor worthless thing and nothing more When I say that I am indifferent to praise I am not speaking dear Mother of the love and confidence you show me on the contrary I am deeply touched thereby but I feel that I have now nothing to fear and I can listen to those praises unperturbed attributing to God all that is good in me If it please Him to make me appear better than I am it is nothing to me He can act as He will My God how many ways dost Thou lead souls We read of Saints who left absolutely nothing at their death not the least thing by which to remember them not even a single line of writing and there are others like our holy Mother saint Teresa who have enriched the Church with their sublime teaching and have not hesitated to reveal the secrets of the King two that He may be better known and better loved Which of these two ways is more pleasing to Our Lord It seems to me that they are equally so All those beloved by God have followed the inspiration of the Holy Ghost who commanded the prophets to write Tell the just man that all is well three Yes all is well when one seeks only the Master s Will and so I poor Little Flower obey my Jesus when I try to please you who represent him here on earth You know it has ever been my desire to become a Saint but I have always felt in comparing myself with the Saints that I am as far removed from them as the grain of sand which the passer by tramples underfoot is remote from the mountain whose summit is lost in the clouds Instead of being discouraged I concluded that God would not inspire desires which could not be realised and that I may aspire to sanctity in spite of my littleness For me to become great is impossible I must bear with myself and my many imperfections but I will seek out a means of getting to Heaven by a little way very short and very straight a little way that is wholly new We live in an age of inventions nowadays the rich need not trouble to climb the stairs they have lifts instead Well I mean to try and find a lift by which I may be raised unto God for I am too tiny to climb the steep stairway of perfection I have sought to find in Holy Scripture some suggestion as to what this lift might be which I so much desired and I read these words uttered by the Eternal Wisdom Itself Whosoever is a little one let him come to Me four Then I drew near to God feeling sure that I had discovered what I sought but wishing to know further what He would do to the little one I continued my search and this is what I found You shall be carried at the breasts and upon the knees as one whom the mother caresseth so will I comfort you five Never have I been consoled by words more tender and sweet Thine Arms then O Jesus are the lift which must raise me up even unto Heaven To get there I need not grow on the contrary I must remain little I must become still less O my God thou hast gone beyond my expectation and I I will sing Thy mercies Thou hast taught me O Lord from my youth and till now I have declared Thy wonderful works and thus unto old age and grey hairs six What will this old age be for me It seems to me that it could as well be now as later two thousand years are no more in the Eyes of the Lord than twenty years than a single day But do not think dear Mother that your child is anxious to leave you and deems it a greater grace to die in the morning rather than in the evening of life to please Jesus is what s he really values and desires above all things Now that He seems to come near and draw her to His Heavenly Home she is glad she has understood that God has need of no one to do good upon earth still less of her than of others Meantime I know your will dear Mother You wish me to carry out at your side a work which is both sweet and easy seven and this work I shall complete in Heaven You have said to me as Our Lord said to saint Peter Feed my lambs I am amazed for I feel that I am so little I have entreated you to feed your little lambs yourself and to keep me among them You have complied in part with my reasonable wish and have called me their companion rather than their mistress telling me nevertheless to lead them through fertile and shady pastures to point out where the grass is sweetest and best and warn them against the brilliant but poisonous flowers which they must never touch except to crush under foot How is it dear Mother that my youth and inexperience have not frightened you Are you not afraid that I shall let your lambs stray afar In acting as you have done perhaps you remembered that Our Lord is often pleased to give wisdom to little ones On this earth it is rare indeed to find souls who do not measure God s Omnipotence by their own narrow thoughts The world is always ready to admit exceptions everywhere here below God alone is denied this liberty It has long been the custom among men to reckon experience by age for in his youth the holy King David sang to His Lord I am young and despised eight but in the same Psalm he does not fear to say I have had understanding above old men because I have sought Thy commandments Thy word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my paths I have sworn and I am determined to keep the judgments of Thy Justice nine And you did not even consider it imprudent to assure me one day that the Divine Master had enlightened my soul and given me the experience of years I am too little now to be guilty of vanity I am likewise too little to endeavour to prove my humility by fine sounding words I prefer to own in all simplicity that He that is mighty hath done great things to me ten and the greatest is that He has shown me my littleness and how incapable I am of anything good My soul has known trials of many kinds I have suffered much on this earth In my childhood I suffered with sadness but now I find sweetness in all things Anyone but you dear Mother who know me thoroughly would smile at reading these pages for has ever a soul seemed less tried than mine But if the martyrdom which I have endured for the past year were made known how astonished everyone would be Since it is your wish I will try to describe it but there are no words really to explain these things The words will always fall short of the reality During Lent last year I felt much better than ever and continued so until Holy Week in spite of the fast which I observed in all its rigour But in the early hours of Good Friday Jesus gave me to hope that I should soon join Him in His beautiful Home How sweet is this memory I could not obtain permission to remain watching at the Altar of Repose throughout the Thursday night and I returned to our cell at midnight Scarcely was my head laid on the pillow when I felt a hot stream rise to my lips I thought I was going to die and my heart nearly broke with joy But as I had already put out our lamp I mortified my curiosity until the morning and slept in peace At five o clock when it was time to get up I remembered at once that I had some good news to learn and going to the window I found as I had expected that our handkerchief was soaked with blood Dearest Mother what hope was mine I was firmly convinced that on this anniversary of His Death my Beloved had allowed me to hear His first call like a sweet distant murmur heralding His joyful approach I assisted at Prime and Chapter most fervently and then I hastened to cast myself at my Mother s knees and confide to her my happiness I did not feel the least pain so I easily obtained permission to finish Lent as I had begun and on this Good Friday I shared in all the austerities of the Carmel without any relaxation Never had these austerities seemed sweeter to me the hope of soon entering Heaven transported me with joy Still full of joy I returned to our cell on the evening of that happy day and was quietly falling asleep when my sweet Jesus gave me the same sign as on the previous night of my speedy entrance to Eternal Life I felt such a clear and lively Faith that the thought of Heaven was my sole delight I could not believe it possible for men to be utterly devoid of Faith and I was convinced that those who deny the existence of another world really lie in their hearts But during the Paschal days so full of light our Lord made me understand that there really are in truth souls bereft of Faith and Hope who through abuse of grace lose these precious treasures the only source of pure and lasting joy He allowed my soul to be overwhelmed with darkness and the thought of Heaven which had consoled me from my earliest childhood now became a subject of conflict and torture This trial did not last merely for days or weeks I have been suffering for months and I still await deliverance I wish I could express what I feel but it is beyond me One must have passed through this dark tunnel to understand its blackness However I will try to explain it by means of a comparison Let me suppose that I had been born in a land of thick fogs and had never seen the beauties of nature or a single ray of sunshine although I had heard of these wonders from my early youth and knew that the country wherein I dwelt was not my real home there was another land unto which I should always look forward Now this is not a fable invented by an inhabitant of the land of fogs it is the solemn truth for the King of that sunlit country dwelt for three and thirty years in the land of darkness and alas the darkness did not understand that He was the Light of the World eleven But dear Lord Thy child has understood Thou art the Light Divine she asks Thy pardon for her unbelieving brethren and is willing to eat the bread of sorrow as long as Thou mayest wish For love of Thee she will sit at that table of bitterness where these poor sinners take their food and she will not stir from it until Thou givest the sign But may she not say in her own name and the name of her guilty brethren O God be merciful to us sinners twelve Send us away justified May all those on whom Faith does not shine see the light at last O my God if that table which they profane can be purified by one that loves Thee I am willing to remain there alone to eat the bread of tears until it shall please Thee to bring me to Thy Kingdom of Light the only favour I ask is that I may never give Thee cause for offence From the time of my childhood I felt that one day I should be set free from this land of darkness I believed it not only because I had been told so by others but my heart s most secret and deepest longings assured me that there was in store for me another and more beautiful country an abiding dwelling place I was like Christopher Columbus whose genius anticipated the discovery of the New World And suddenly the mists about me have penetrated my very soul and have enveloped me so completely that I cannot even picture to myself this promised country all has faded away When my heart weary of the surrounding darkness tries to find some rest in the thought of a life to come my anguish increases It seems to me that out of the darkness I hear the mocking voice of the unbeliever You dream of a land of light and fragrance you dream that the Creator of these wonders will be yours for ever you think one day to escape from these mists where you now languish Nay rejoice in death which will give you not what you hope for but a night darker still the night of utter nothingness Dear Mother this description of what I suffer is as far removed from reality as the first rough outline is from the model but I fear that to write more were to blaspheme even now I may have said too much May God forgive me He knows that I try to live by Faith though it does not afford me the least consolation I have made more acts of Faith in this last year than during all the rest of my life Each time that my enemy would provoke me to combat I behave as a gallant soldier I know that a duel is an act of cowardice and so without once looking him in the face I turn my back on the foe then I hasten to my Saviour and vow that I am ready to shed my blood in witness of my belief in Heaven I tell him if only He will deign to open it to poor unbelievers I am content to sacrifice all pleasure in the thought of it as long as I live And in spite of this trial which robs me of all comfort I still can say Thou hast given me O Lord delight in all Thou dost thirteen For what joy can be greater than to suffer for Thy Love The more the suffering is and the less it appears before men the more is it to Thy Honour and Glory Even if but I know it to be impossible Thou shouldst not deign to heed my sufferings I should still be happy to bear them in the hope that by my tears I might perhaps prevent or atone for one sin against Faith No doubt dear Mother you will think I exaggerate somewhat the night of my soul If you judge by the poems I have composed this year it must seem as though I have been flooded with consolations like a child for whom the veil of Faith is almost rent asunder And yet it is not a veil it is a wall which rises to the very heavens and shuts out the starry sky When I sing of the happiness of Heaven and the eternal possession of God I do not feel any joy therein for I sing only of what I wish to believe Sometimes I confess a little ray of sunshine illumines my dark night and I enjoy peace for an instant but later the remembrance of this ray of light instead of consoling me makes the blackness thicker still And yet never have I felt so deeply how sweet and merciful is the Lord He did not send me this heavy cross when it might have discouraged me but at a time when I was able to bear it Now it simply takes from me all natural satisfaction I might feel in my longing for Heaven Dear Mother it seems to me that at present there is nothing to impede my upward flight for I have no longer any desire save to love Him till I die I am free I fear nothing now not even what I dreaded more than anything else a long illness which would make me a burden to the Community Should it please the Good God I am quite content to have my bodily and mental sufferings prolonged for years I do not fear a long life I do not shrink from the struggle The Lord is the rock upon which I stand Who teacheth my hands to fight and my fingers to war He is my Protector and I have hoped in Him fourteen I have never asked God to let me die young It is true I have always thought I should do so but it is a favour I have not tried to obtain Our Lord is often content with the wish to do something for His Glory and you know the immensity of my desires You know also that Jesus has offered me more than one bitter chalice through my dearly loved sisters The holy King David was right when he sang Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity fifteen But such unity can only exist upon earth in the midst of sacrifice It was not in order to be with my sisters that I came to this holy Carmel on the contrary I knew well that in curbing my natural affection I should have much to suffer How can it be said that it is more perfect to separate oneself from home and friends Has anyone ever reproached brothers who fight side by side or together win the martyr s palm It is true no doubt they encourage each other but it is also true that the martyrdom of each is a martyrdom to them all And so it is in the religious life theologians call it a martyrdom A heart given to God loses nothing of its natural affection on the contrary this affection grows stronger by becoming purer and more spiritual It is with this love dear Mother that I love you and my sisters I am glad to fight beside you for the glory of the King of Heaven but I am ready to go to another battlefield did the Divine Commander but express a wish An order would not be necessary a simple look a sign would suffice Ever since I came to the Carmel I have thought that if Our Lord did not take me quickly to Heaven my lot would be that of Noe s dove and that one day he would open the window of the Ark and bid me fly to heathen lands bearing the olive branch This thought has helped me to soar above all created things Knowing that even in the Carmel there must be partings I tried to make my abode in Heaven and I accepted not only exile in the midst of an unknown people but what was far more bitter I accepted exile for my sisters And indeed two of them were asked for by the Carmel of Saigon our own foundation For a time there was serious question of their being sent and I would not say a word to hold them back though my heart ached at the thought of the trials awaiting them Now all that is at an end the superiors were absolutely opposed to their departure and I only touched the cup with my lips long enough to taste of its bitterness Let me tell you dear Mother why if Our Lady cures me I wish to respond to the call from our Mothers of Hanoi It appears that to live in foreign Carmels a very special vocation is needed and many souls think they are called without being so in reality You have told me that I have this vocation and that my health alone stands in the way But if I am destined one day to leave this Carmel it will not be without a pang My heart is naturally sensitive and because this is a cause of much suffering I wish to offer Jesus whatsoever it can bear Here I am loved by you and all the Sisters and this love is very sweet to me and I dream of a convent where I should be unknown where I should taste the bitterness of exile I know only too well how useless I am and so it is not for the sake of the services I might render to the Carmel of Hanoi that I would leave all that is dearest to me my sole reason would be to do God s Will and sacrifice myself for Him And I should not suffer any disappointment for when we expect nothing but suffering then the least joy is a surprise and later on suffering itself becomes the greatest of all joys when we seek it as a precious treasure But I know I shall never recover from this sickness and yet I am at peace For years I have not belonged to myself I have surrendered myself wholly to Jesus and He is free to do with me whatsoever He pleases He has spoken to me of exile and has asked me if I would consent to drink of that chalice At once I essayed to grasp it but He withdrawing His Hand showed me that my consent was all He desired O my God from how much disquiet do we free ourselves by the vow of obedience Happy is the simple religious Her one guide being the will of her superiors she is ever sure of following the right path and has no fear of being mistaken even when it seems that her superiors are making a mistake But if she ceases to consult the unerring compass then at once her soul goes astray in barren wastes where the waters of grace quickly fail Dear Mother you are the compass Jesus has given me to direct me safely to the Eternal Shore I find it most sweet to fix my eyes upon you and then do the Will of my Lord By allowing me to suffer these temptations against Faith He has greatly increased the spirit of Faith which makes me see Him living in your soul and through you communicating His holy commands I am well aware that you lighten the burden of obedience for me but deep in my heart I feel that my attitude would not change nor would my filial affection grow less were you to treat me with severity and this because I should still see the Will of God manifesting itself in another way for the greater good of my soul Among the numberless graces that I have received this year not the least is an understanding of how far reaching is the precept of charity I had never before fathomed these words of Our Lord The second commandment is like to the first Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself sixteen I had set myself above all to love God and it was in loving Him that I discovered the hidden meaning of these other words It is not those who say Lord Lord who enter into the Kingdom of Heaven but he who does the Will of My Father seventeen Jesus revealed me this Will when at the Last Supper He gave His New Commandment in telling His Apostles to love one another as He had loved them eighteen I set myself to find out how He had loved His Apostles and I saw that it was not for their natural qualities for they were ignorant men full of earthly ideas And yet He calls them His Friends His Brethren He desires to see them near Him in the Kingdom of His Father and in order to admit them to this Kingdom He wills to die on the Cross saying Greater love than this no man hath that a man lay down his life for his friends nineteen As I meditated on these Divine words I saw how imperfect was the love I bore my Sisters in religion I understood that I did not love tem as Our Lord loves them I know now that true charity consists in bearing all our neighbours defects not being surprised at their weakness but edified at their smallest virtues Above all I know that charity must not remain shut up in the heart for No man lighteth a candle and putteth it in a hidden place nor under a bushel but upon a candlestick that they who come in may see the light twenty It seems to me dear Mother this candle represents that charity which enlightens and gladdens not only those who are dear to us but all those who are of the household In the Old Law when God told His people to love their neighbour as themselves He had not yet come down upon earth and knowing full well how man loves himself He could not ask anything greater But when Our Lord gave His Apostles a New Commandment His own commandment twenty one He was not content with saying Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself but would have them love even as He had loved and as He will love till the end of time O my Jesus Thou does never ask what is impossible Thou knowest better than I how frail and imperfect I am and Thou knowest that I shall never love my Sisters as Thou hast loved them unless within me Thou lovest them dear Lord It is because Thou dost desire to grant me this grace that Thou hast given a New Commandment Oh how I love it since I am assured thereby that it is Thy Will to love in me all those Thou dost bid me love Yes I know when I show charity to others it is simply Jesus acting in me and the more closely I am united to Him the more dearly I love my Sisters If I wish to increase this love in my heart and the devil tries to bring before me the defects of a Sister I hasten to look for her virtues her good motives I call to mind that though I may have seen her fall once no doubt she has gained many victories over herself which in her humility she conceals It is even possible that what seems to me a fault may very likely on account of her good intention be an act of virtue I have no difficulty in persuading myself of this because I have had the same experience One day during recreation the portress came to ask for a Sister to help her I had a childish longing to do this work and it happened the choice fell upon me I therefore began to fold up our needlework but so slowly that my neighbour who I knew would like to take my place was ready before me The Sister who had asked for help seeing how deliberate I was said laughingly I thought you would not add this pearl to your crown you are so extremely slow and all the Community thought I had yielded to natural reluctance I cannot tell you what profit I derived from this incident and it made me indulgent towards others It still checks any feelings of vanity when I am praised for I reflect that since my small acts of virtue can be mistaken for imperfections why should not my imperfections be mistaken for virtue And I say with saint Paul To me it is a very small thing to be judged by you or by man s day But neither do I judge myself He that judgeth me is the Lord twenty two And it is the Lord it is Jesus Who is my judge Therefore I will try always to think leniently of others that He may judge me leniently or rather not at all since He says Judge not and ye shall not be judged twenty three But returning to the Holy Gospel where Our Lord explains to me clearly in what His New Commandment consists I read in saint Matthew You have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thy enemy but I say unto you Love your enemies and pray for them that persecute you twenty four There are of course no enemies in the Carmel but after all we have our natural likes and dislikes We may feel drawn towards one Sister and may be tempted to go a long way round to avoid meeting another Well Our Lord tells me that this is the Sister to love and pray for even though her behaviour may make me imagine she does not care for me If you love them that love you what thanks are to you For sinners also love those that love them twenty five And it is not enough to love we must prove our love naturally one likes to please a friend but that is not charity for sinners do the same Our Lord also taught me Give to everyone that asketh thee and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again twenty six To give to everyone who asks is not so pleasant as to give of one s own accord If we are asked pleasantly it is easy to give but if we are asked discourteously then unless we are perfect in charity there is an inward rebellion and we find no end of excuses for refusing Perhaps after first pointing out the rudeness of the request we make such a favour of consenting thereto that the slight service takes far less time to perform than was lost in arguing the point And if it is difficult to give to whosoever asks it is far more difficult to let what belongs to us be taken without asking it again Dear Mother I say this is hard but I should rather say that it seems hard for The yoke of the Lord is sweet and His burden light twenty seven And when we submit to that yoke we at once feel its sweetness I have said Jesus does not wish me to ask again for what is my own This ought to seem quite easy for in reality nothing is mine I ought then to be glad when an occasion arises which brings home to me the poverty to which I am vowed I used to think myself completely detached but since Our Lord s words have become clear I see that I am indeed very imperfect For instance when starting to paint if I find the brushes in disorder and a ruler or penknife gone I feel inclined to lose patience and have to keep a firm hold over myself not to betray my feelings Of course I may ask for these needful things and if I do so humbly I am not disobeying Our Lord s command I am then like the poor who hold out their hands for the necessaries of life and if refused are not surprised since no one owes them anything Deep peace inundates the soul when it soars above mere natural sentiments There is no joy equal to that which is shared by the truly poor in spirit If they ask with detachment for something necessary and not only is it refused but an attempt is made to take away what they already possess they are following the Master s advice If any man will take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also twenty eight To give up one s cloak is it seems to me to renounce every right and to regard oneself as the servant the slave of all Without a cloak it is easier to walk or run and so the Master adds And whosoever shall force thee to go one mile go with him other two twenty nine It is therefore not enough for me to give to whoever asks I ought to anticipate the wish and show myself glad to be of service but if anything of mine be taken away I should show myself glad to be rid of it I cannot always carry out to the letter the words of the Gospel for there are occasions when I am compelled to refuse some request Yet when charity is deeply rooted in the soul it lets itself be outwardly seen and there is a way of refusing so graciously what one is unable to give that the refusal affords as much pleasure as the gift would have done It is true that people do not hesitate to ask from those who readily oblige nevertheless I ought not to avoid importunate Sisters on the pretext that I shall be forced to refuse The Divine Master has said From him that would borrow of thee turn not away thirty Nor should I be kind in order to appear so or in the hope that the Sister will return the service for once more it is written If you lend to them of whom you hope to receive what thanks are to you For sinners also lend to sinners for to receive as much But you do good and lend hoping for nothing thereby and your reward shall be great thirty one Verily the reward is great even on earth In this path it is only the first step which costs To lend without hope of being repaid seems hard one would rather give outright for what you give is no longer yours When a Sister says confidently I want your help for some hours I have our Mother s leave and be assured I will do as much for you later one may know well that these hours lent will not be repaid and be sorely tempted to say I prefer to give them But that would gratify self love besides letting the Sister feel that you do not rely much on her promise The Divine precepts run contrary to our natural inclinations and without the help of grace it would be impossible to understand them far less to put them in practice Dear Mother I feel that I have expressed myself with more than usual confusion and I do not know what you can find to interest you in these rambling pages but I am not aiming at a literary masterpiece and if I weary you by this discourse on charity it will at least prove your child s good will I must confess I am far from living up to my ideal and yet the very desire to do so gives me a feeling of peace If I fall into some fault I arise again at once and for some months now I have not even had to struggle I have been able to say with our holy Father saint John of the Cross My house is entirely at peace and I attribute this interior peace to a victory I gained over myself Since that victory the hosts of Heaven have hastened to my aid for they will not allow me to be wounded now that I have fought so valiantly A holy nun of our community annoyed me in all that she did the devil must have had something to do with it and he it was undoubtedly who made me see in her so many disagreeable points I did not want to yield to my natural antipathy for I remembered that charity ought to betray itself in deeds and not exist merely in the feelings so I set myself to do for this sister all I should do for the one I loved most Every time I met her I prayed for her and offered to God her virtues and merits I felt that this was very pleasing to Our Lord for there is no artist who is not gratified when his works are praised and the Divine Artist of souls is pleased when we do not stop at the exterior but penetrating to the inner sanctuary He has chosen admire its beauty I did not rest satisfied with praying for this Sister who gave me such occasions for self mastery I tried to render her as many services as I could and when tempted to answer her sharply I made haste to smile and change the subject for the Imitation says It is more profitable to leave everyone to his way of thinking than to give way to contentious discourses And sometimes when the temptation was very severe I would run like a deserter from the battlefield if I could do so without letting the Sister guess my inward struggle One day she said to me with a beaming face My dear Soeur Therese tell me what attraction you find in me for whenever we meet you greet me with such a sweet smile Ah What attracted me was Jesus hidden in the depths of her soul Jesus who maketh sweet even that which is most bitter I spoke just now dear Mother of the flight that is my last resource to escape defeat It is not honourable I confess but during my noviciate whenever I had recourse to this means it invariably succeeded I will give you a striking example which will I am sure amuse you You had been ill with bronchitis for several days and we were all uneasy about you One morning in my duty as sacristan I came to put back the keys of the Communion grating This was my work and I was very pleased to have an opportunity of seeing you though I took good care not to show it One of the Sisters full of solicitude feared I should awake you and tried to take the keys from me I told her as politely as I could that I was quite as anxious as she was there should be no noise and added that it was my right to return them I see now that it would have been more perfect simply to yield but I did not see it then and so I followed her into the room Very soon what she feared came to pass the noise did awaken you All the blame fell upon me the Sister I had argued with began a long discourse of which the point was Soeur Therese made all the noise I was burning to defend myself but a happy inspiration of grace came to me I thought that if I began to justify myself I should certainly lose my peace of mind and as I had too little virtue to let myself be unjustly accused without answering my last chance of safety lay in flight No sooner thought than done I hurried away but my heart beat so violently I could not go far and I was obliged to sit down on the stairs to enjoy in quiet the fruit of my victory This is an odd kind of courage undoubtedly but I think it is best not to expose oneself in the face of certain defeat When I recall these days of my noviciate I understand how far I was from perfection and the memory of certain things makes me laugh How good God has been to have trained my soul and given it wings All the snares of the hunter can no longer frighten me for A net is spread in vain before the eyes of them that have wings thirty two It may be that some day my present state will appear to me full of defects but nothing now surprises me and I do not even distress myself because I am so weak On the contrary I glory therein and expect each day to find fresh imperfections Nay I must confess these lights on my own nothingness are of more good to my soul than lights on matters of Faith Remembering that Charity covereth a multitude of sins thirty three I draw from this rich mine which Our Saviour has opened to us in the Gospels I search the depths of His adorable words and cry out with david I have run in the way of Thy commandments since Thou hast

has given me a clear insight into the deep mysteries of Charity If I could but express what I know you would hear a heavenly music but alas I can only stammer like a child and if God s own words were not my support I should be tempted to beg leave to hold my peace When the Divine Master tells me to give to whosoever asks of me and to let what is mine be taken without asking it again it seems to me that He speaks not only of the goods of earth but also of the goods of Heaven Besides neither one nor the other are really mine I renounced the former by the vow of poverty and the latter gifts are simply lent If God withdraw them I have no right to complain But our very own ideas the fruit of our mind and heart form a treasury on which none dare lay hands For instance if I reveal to a Sister some light given me in prayer and she repeats it later on as though it were her own it seems as though she appropriates what is mine Or if during recreation someone makes an apt and witty remark which her neighbour repeats to the Community without acknowledging whence it came it is a sort of theft and the person who originated the remark is naturally inclined to seize the first opportunity of delicately insinuating that her thoughts have been borrowed I could not so well explain all these weaknesses of human nature had I not experienced them I should have preferred to indulge in the illusion that I was the only one who suffered thus had you not bidden me advise the novices in their difficulties I have learnt much in the discharge of this duty and especially I feel bound to put in practice what I teach I can say with truth that by God s grace I am no more attached to the gifts of the intellect than to material things If it happens that a thought of mine should please my Sisters I find it quite easy to let them regard it as their own My thoughts belong to the Holy Ghost They are not mine saint Paul assures us that without the Spirit of Love we cannot call God our Father one And besides though far from depreciating those beautiful thoughts which bring us nearer to God I have long been of opinion that we must be careful not to over estimate their worth The highest inspirations are of no value without good works It is true that others may derive much profit therefrom if they are duly grateful to our Lord for allowing them to share in the abundance of one of His privileged souls but should this privileged soul take pride in spiritual wealth and imitate the Pharisee she becomes like to a hostess dying of starvation at a well spread table while her guests enjoy the richest fare and perhaps case envious glances at the possessor of so many treasures Verily it is true that God alone can sound the heart How short sighted are His creatures When they see a soul whose lights surpass their own they conclude that the Divine Master loves them less Since when has He lost the right to make use of one of His children in order to supply the others with the nourishment they need That right was not lost in the days of Pharaoh for God said unto him And therefore have I raised thee that I may show My power in thee and My name may be spoken of throughout all the earth two Generations have passed away since the Most High spoke these words and His ways have not changed He has ever chosen human instruments for the accomplishment of His work If an artist s canvas could but think and speak surely it would never complain of being touched and re touched by the brush nor would it feel envious thereof knowing that all its beauty is due to the artist alone So too the brush itself could not boast of the masterpiece it had helped to produce for it must know that an artist is never at a loss that difficulties do but stimulate him and that at times it pleases him to make use of instruments the most unlikely and defective Dear Mother I am the little brush that Jesus has chosen to paint His likeness in the souls you have confided to my care Now an artist has several brushes two at the least the first which is more useful gives the ground tints and rapidly covers the whole canvas the other and smaller one puts in the lesser touches Mother you represent the big brush which our Lord holds lovingly in His Hand when He wishes to do some great work in the souls of your children and I am the little one He deigns to use afterwards to fill in the minor details The first time the Divine Master took up His little brush was about December eight eighteen ninety two I shall always remember that time as one of special grace When I entered the Carmel I found in the noviciate a companion about eight years older than I was In spite of this difference of age we became the closest friends and to encourage an affection which gave promise of fostering virtue we were allowed to converse together on spiritual subjects My companion charmed me by her innocence and by her open and frank disposition though I was surprised to find how her love for you differed from mine and besides I regretted many things in her behaviour But God had already given me to understand that there are souls for whom in His Mercy He waits unweariedly and to whom He gives His light by degrees so I was very careful not to forestall Him One day when I was thinking over the permission we had to talk together so that we might as our holy constitutions tells us incite ourselves more ardently to the love of our Divine Spouse it came home to me sadly that our conversations did not attain the desired end and I understood that either I must no longer fear to speak out or else I must put an end to what was degenerating into mere worldly talk I begged our Lord to inspire me with words kind and convincing or better still to speak Himself for me He heard my prayer for those who look upon Him shall be enlightened three and to the upright a light is risen in the darkness four The first of these texts I apply to myself the other to my companion who was truly upright in heart The next time we met the poor little Sister saw at once that my manner had changed and blushing deeply she sat down beside me I pressed her to my heart and told her gently what was in my mind then I pointed out to her in what true love consists and proved that in loving her Prioress with such natural affection she was in reality loving herself I confided to her the sacrifices of this kind which I had been obliged to make at the beginning of my religious life and before long her tears were mingled with mine She admitted very humbly that she was in the wrong and that I was right and begging me as a favour always to point out her faults she promised to begin a new life From this time our love for one another became truly spiritual in us were fulfilled these words of the Holy Ghost A brother that is helped by his brother is like a strong city five Dear Mother you know very well that it was not my wish to turn my companion away from you I only wanted her to grasp that true love feeds on sacrifice and that in proportion as our souls renounce natural enjoyments our affections become stronger and more detached I remember that when I was a postulant I was sometimes so violently tempted to seek my own satisfaction by having a word with you that I was obliged to hurry past your cell and hold on to the banisters to keep myself from turning back Numerous permissions I wanted to ask and a hundred pretexts for yielding to my desires suggested themselves but now I am truly glad that I did not listen I already enjoy the reward promised to those who fight bravely I no longer feel the need of refusing myself these consolations for my heart is fixed on God Because it has loved Him only it has grown little by little and now it can give to those who are dear to Him a far deeper and truer love than if it were centred in a barren and selfish affection I have told you of the first piece of work which you accomplished together with Our Lord by means of the little brush but that was only the prelude to the masterpiece which was afterwards to be painted From the moment I entered the sanctuary of souls I saw at a glance that the task was beyond my strength Throwing myself without delay into Our Lord s Arms I imitated those tiny children who when they are frightened hide their faces on their father s shoulder and I said Dear Lord Thou seest that I am too small to feed these little ones but if through me Thou wilt give to each what is suitable then fill my hands and without leaving the shelter of Thine Arms or even turning away I will distribute Thy treasures to the souls who come to me asking for food Should they find it to their taste I shall know that this is due not to me but to Thee and if on the contrary they find fault with its bitterness I shall not be cast down but try to persuade them that it cometh from Thee while taking good care to make no change in it The knowledge that it was impossible to do anything of myself rendered my task easier My one interior occupation was to unite myself more and more closely to God knowing that the rest would be given to me over and above And indeed my hope has never been deceived I have always found my hands filled when sustenance was needed for the souls of my Sisters But had I done otherwise and relied on my own strength I should very soon have been forced to abandon my task From afar it seems so easy to do good to souls to teach them to love God more and to model them according to one s own ideas But when we draw nearer we quickly feel that without God s help this is quite as impossible as to bring back the sun when once it has set We must forget ourselves and put aside our tastes and ideas and guide souls not by our own way but along the path which Our Lord points out Even this is not the most difficult part what costs me more than all is having to observe their faults their slightest imperfections and wage war against them Unhappily for me I was going to say but that would be cowardly so I will say happily for my Sisters ever since I placed myself in the Arms of Jesus I have been like a watchman on the look out for the enemy from the highest turret of a fortified castle Nothing escapes my vigilance indeed I am sometimes surprised at my own clear sightedness and I think it was quite excusable in the prophet Jonas to fly before the face of the Lord that he might not have to announce the ruin of Ninive Rather than make one single reproach I would prefer to receive a thousand yet I feel it is necessary that the task should cause me pain for if I spoke only through natural impulse then the soul in fault would not understand its defects and would simply think This Sister is displeased and her displeasure falls on me although I am full of the best intentions But in this as in all else I must practise sacrifice and self denial Even in the matter of writing a letter I feel that it will produce no fruit unless I am disinclined to write and only do so from obedience When conversing with a novice I am on the watch to mortify myself and I avoid asking questions which would satisfy my curiosity If she begins to speak on an interesting subject and leaving it unfinished passes on to another that wearies me I take care not to remind her of the interruption for it seems to me that no good can come of self seeking I know dear Mother that your little lambs find me severe if they were to read these lines they would say that so far as they can see it does not distress me to run after them and show them how they have soiled their beautiful white fleece or torn it in the brambles Well the little lambs may say what they like in their hearts they know I love them dearly there is no fear of my imitating the hireling who seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and flieth six I am ready to lay down my life for them and my affection is so disinterested that I would not have my novices know this By God s help I have never tried to draw their hearts to myself for I have always understood that my mission was to lead them to Him and to you dear Mother who on this earth hold His place in their regard and whom therefore they must love and respect I said before that I have learnt much by guiding others In the first place I see that all souls have more or less the same battles to fight and on the other hand that one soul differs widely from another so each must be dealt with differently With some I must humble myself and not shrink from acknowledging my own struggles and defeats then they confess more readily the faults into which they fall and are pleased that I know by experience what they suffer With others my only means of success is to be firm and never go back on what I have once said self abasement would be taken for weakness Our Lord has granted me the grace never to fear the conflict at all costs I must do my duty I have more than once been told If you want me to obey you must be gentle and not severe otherwise you will gain nothing But no one is a good judge in his own case During a painful operation a child will be sure to cry out and say that the remedy is worse than the disease but if after a few days he is cured then he is greatly delighted that he can run about and play And it is the same with souls they soon recognise that a little bitter is better than too much sweet and they are not afraid to make the acknowledgment Sometimes the change which takes place from one day to another seems almost magical A novice will say to me You did well to be severe yesterday at first I was indignant but when I thought it all over I saw that you were quite right I left your cell thinking This ends it I will tell Our Mother that I shall never go to Soeur Therese again but I knew this was the devil s suggestion and then I felt you were praying for me and I grew calm I began to see things more clearly and now I come to you for further guidance I am only too happy to follow the dictates of my heart and hasten to console with a little sweetness but I see that one must not press forward too quickly a word might undo the work that cost so many tears If I say the least thing which seems to tone down the hard truths of the previous day I see my little Sister trying to take advantage of the opening thus given her At once I have recourse to prayer I turn to Our Blessed Lady and Jesus always triumphs Verily in prayer and sacrifice lies all my strength they are my invincible arms experience has taught me that they touch hearts far more easily than words Two years ago during Lent a novice came to me smiling and said You would never imagine what I dreamt last night I thought I was with my sister who is so worldly and I wanted to withdraw her from all vain things to this end I explained the words of your hymn They richly lose who love Thee dearest Lord Thine are my perfumes Thine for evermore I felt that my words sank deep into her soul and I was overjoyed This morning it seems to me that perhaps Our Lord would like me to gain Him this soul How would it do if I wrote at Easter and described my dream telling her that Jesus desires to have her for His Spouse I answered that she might certainly ask permission As Lent was not nearly over you were surprised dear Mother at such a premature request and evidently guided by God you replied that Carmelites should save souls by prayer rather than by letters When I heard your decision I said to the little Sister We must set to work and pray hard if our prayers are answered at the end of Lent what a joy it will be O Infinite Mercy of our Lord At the close of Lent one soul more had given herself to God It was a real miracle of grace a miracle obtained through the fervour of a humble novice How wonderful is the power of prayer It is like unto a queen who having free access to the king obtains whatsoever she asks In order to secure a hearing there is no need to recite set prayers composed for the occasion were it so I ought indeed to be pitied Apart from the Divine Office which in spite of my unworthiness is a daily joy I have not the courage to look through books for beautiful prayers I only get a headache because of their number and besides one is more lovely than another Unable therefore to say them all and lost in choice I do as children who have not learnt to read I simply tell Our Lord all that I want and He always understands With me prayer is an uplifting of the heart a glance towards heaven a cry of gratitude and love uttered equally in sorrow and in joy In a word it is something noble supernatural which expands my soul and unites it to God Sometimes when I am in such a state of spiritual dryness that not a single good thought occurs to me I say very slowly the Our Father or the Hail Mary and these prayers suffice to take me out of myself and wonderfully refresh me But what was I speaking of Again I am lost in a maze of reflections Forgive me dear Mother for wandering thus My story is like a tangled skein but I fear I can do no better I write my thoughts as they come I fish at random in the stream of my heart and offer you all that I catch I was telling you about the novices They often say You have an answer for everything This time I thought I should puzzle you Where do you find all that you teach us Some are even simple enough to think I can read their souls because at times it happens I discover to them without revelation the subject of their thoughts The senior novice had determined to hide from me a great sorrow She spent the night in anguish keeping back her tears lest her eyes might betray her Yet she came to me with a smile next day seeming even more cheerful than usual and when I said You are in trouble I am sure she looked at me in inexpressible amazement Her surprise was so great that it reacted on me and imparted a sense of the supernatural I felt that God was close to us Unwittingly for I have not the gift of reading souls I had spoken as one inspired and was able to console her completely And now dear Mother I will tell you wherein I gain most with the novices You know they are allowed without restriction to say anything to me agreeable or the reverse this is all the easier since they do not owe me the respect due to a Novice Mistress I cannot say that Our Lord makes me walk in the way of exterior humiliation He is satisfied with humbling me in my inmost soul In the eyes of creatures all is success and I walk in the dangerous path of honour if a religious may so speak I understand God s way and that of my superiors in this respect for if the Community thought me incapable unintelligent and wanting in judgment I could be of no possible use to you dear Mother This is why the Divine Master has thrown a veil over all my shortcomings both interior and exterior Because of this veil I receive many compliments from the novices compliments without flattery for they really mean what they say and they do not inspire me with vanity for the remembrance of my weakness is ever before me At times my soul tires of this over sweet food and I long to hear something other than praise then Our Lord serves me with a nice little salad well spiced with plenty of vinegar oil alone is wanting and this it is which makes it more to my taste And the salad is offered to me by the novices at the moment I least expect God lifts the veil that hides my faults and my dear little Sisters beholding me as I really am do not find me altogether agreeable With charming simplicity they tell me how I try them and what they dislike in me in fact they are as frank as though they were speaking of someone else for they are aware that I am pleased when they act in this way I am more than pleased I am transported with delight by this splendid banquet set before me How can anything so contrary to our natural inclinations afford such extraordinary pleasure Had I not experienced it I could not have believed it possible One day when I was ardently longing for some humiliation a young postulant came to me and sated my desire so completely that I was reminded of the occasion when Semei cursed David and I repeated to myself the words of the holy King Yea it is the Lord who hath bidden him say all these things seven In this way God takes care of me He cannot always provide that strength giving bread exterior humiliation but from time to time He allows me to eat of the crumbs from the table of the children eight How magnificent are His Mercies Dear Mother since that Infinite Mercy is the subject of this my earthly song I ought also to discover to you one real advantage reaped with many others in the discharge of my task Formerly if I saw a Sister acting in a way that displeased me and was seemingly contrary to rule I would think Ah how glad I should be if only I could warn her and point out where she is wrong Since however this burden has been laid upon me my ideas have changed and when I happen to see something not quite right I say with a sigh of relief Thank God It is not a novice and I am not obliged to correct and at once I try to find excuses and credit the doer with the good intentions she no doubt possesses Your devotedness dear Mother now that I am ill has also taught me many a lesson of charity No remedy is too costly and if one does not succeed you unhesitatingly try something new When I am present at recreation how careful you are to shield me from draughts I feel that I ought to be as compassionate for the spiritual infirmities of my Sisters as you are for my bodily ills I have noticed that it is the holiest nuns who are most deeply loved everyone is anxious to seek their company and do them service without even being asked These very souls who are well able to bear with want of affection and little attentions are always surrounded by an atmosphere of love Our Father saint John of the Cross says with great truth All good things have come unto me since I no longer sought them for myself Imperfect souls on the contrary are left alone They are treated it is true with the measure of politeness which religious life demands yet their company is avoided lest a word might be said which would hurt their feelings When I say imperfect souls I am not referring to souls with spiritual imperfections only for the holiest souls will not be perfect till they are in heaven I mean those who are also afflicted with want of tact and refinement as well as ultra sensitive souls I know such defects are incurable but I also know how patient you would be in nursing and striving to relieve me were my illness to last for many years From all this I draw the conclusion I ought to seek the companionship of those Sisters towards whom I feel a natural aversion and try to be their good Samaritan A word or a smile is often enough to put fresh life in a despondent soul And yet it is not merely in the hope of giving consolation that I try to be kind If it were I know that I should soon be discouraged for well intentioned words are often totally misunderstood Consequently not to lose my time or labour I try to act solely to please Our Lord and follow this precept of the Gospel When thou makest a dinner or a supper call not thy friends or thy brethren lest perhaps they also invite thee again and a recompense be made to thee But when thou makest a feast call the poor the maimed the blind and the lame and thou shalt be blessed because they have naught wherewith to make thee recompense and thy Father Who seeth in secret will repay thee nine What feast can I offer my Sisters but a spiritual one of sweet and joyful charity I know none other and I wish to imitate saint Paul who rejoiced with those who rejoiced It is true that he wept with those who wept and at my feast too the tears must sometimes fall still I shall always try to change them into smiles for God loveth a cheerful giver ten I remember an act of charity with which God inspired me while I was still a novice and this act though seemingly small has been rewarded even in this life by Our Heavenly Father Who seeth in secret Shortly before Sister saint Peter became quite bedridden it was necessary every evening at ten minutes to six for someone to leave meditation and take her to the refectory It cost me a good deal to offer my services for I knew the difficulty or I should say the impossibility of pleasing the poor invalid But I did not want to lose such a good opportunity for I recalled Our Lord s words As long as you did it to one of these my least brethren you did it to Me eleven I therefore humbly offered my aid It was not without difficulty I induced her to accept it but after considerable persuasion I succeeded Every evening when I saw her shake her sand glass I understood that she meant Let us go Summoning up all my courage I rose and the ceremony began First of all her stool had to be moved and carried in a particular way and on no account must there be any hurry The solemn procession ensued I had to follow the good Sister supporting her by her girdle I did it as gently as possible but if by some mischance she stumbled she imagined I had not a firm hold and that she was going to fall You are going too fast she would say I shall fall and hurt myself Then when I tried to lead her more quietly Come quicker I cannot feel you you are letting me go I was right when I said you were too young to take care of me When we reached the refectory without further mishap more troubles were in store I had to settle my poor invalid in her place taking great pains not to hurt her Then I had to turn back her sleeves always according to her own special rubric and after that I was allowed to go But I soon noticed that she found it very difficult to cut her bread so I did not leave her till I had performed this last service She was much touched by this attention on my part for she had not expressed any wish on the subject it was by this unsought for kindness that I gained her entire confidence and chiefly because as I learnt later at the end of my humble task I bestowed upon her my sweetest smile Dear Mother it is long since all this happened but Our Lord allows the memory of it to linger with me like a perfume from Heaven One cold winter evening I was occupied in the lowly work of which I have just spoken when suddenly I heard in the distance the harmonious strains of music outside the convent walls I pictured a drawing room brilliantly lighted and decorated and richly furnished Young ladies elegantly dressed exchanged a thousand compliments as is the way of the world Then I looked on the poor invalid I was tending Instead of sweet music I heard her complaints instead of rich gilding I saw the brick walls of our bare cloister scarcely visible in the dim light The contrast was very moving Our Lord so illuminated my soul with the rays of truth before which the pleasures of the world are but as darkness that for a thousand years of such worldly delights I would not have bartered even the ten minutes spent in my act of charity If even now in days of pain and amid the smoke of battle the thought that God has withdrawn us from the world is so entrancing what will it be when in eternal glory and everlasting repose we realise the favour beyond compare He has done us here by singling us out to dwell in His Carmel the very portal of Heaven I have not always felt these transports of joy in performing acts of charity but at the beginning of my religious life Jesus wished to make me feel how sweet to Him is charity when found in the hearts of his Spouses Thus when I led Sister saint Peter it was with so much love that I could not have shown more were I guiding Our Divine Lord Himself The practice of charity has not always been so pleasant as I have just pointed out dear Mother and to prove it I will recount some of my many struggles For a long time my place at meditation was near a Sister who fidgeted continually either with her Rosary or something else possibly as I am very quick of hearing I alone heard her but I cannot tell you how much it tried me I should have liked to turn round and by looking at the offender make her stop the noise but in my heart I knew that I ought to bear it tranquilly both for the love of God and to avoid giving pain So I kept quiet but the effort cost me so much that sometimes I was bathed in perspiration and my meditation consisted merely in suffering with patience After a time I tried to endure it in peace and joy at least deep down in my soul and I strove to take actual pleasure in the disagreeable little noise Instead of trying not to hear it which was impossible I set myself to listen as though it had been some delightful music and my meditation which was not the prayer of quiet was passed in offering this music to Our Lord Another time I was working in the laundry and the Sister opposite while washing handkerchiefs repeatedly splashed me with dirty water My first impulse was to draw back and wipe my face to show the offender I should be glad if she would behave more quietly but the next minute I thought how foolish it was to refuse the treasures God offered me so generously and I refrained from betraying my annoyance On the contrary I made such efforts to welcome the shower of dirty water that at the end of half an hour I had taken quite a fancy to this novel kind of aspersion and I resolved to come as often as I could to the happy spot where such treasures were freely bestowed Dear Mother you see that I am a very little soul who can only offer very little things to Our Lord It still happens that I frequently let slip the occasion of these slender sacrifices which bring so much peace but this does not discourage me I bear the loss of a little peace and I try to be more watchful for the future How happy does Our Lord make me and how sweet and easy is His service on this earth He has always given me what I desired or rather He has made me desire what He wishes to give A short time before my terrible temptation against Faith I had reflected how few exterior trials worthy of mention had fallen to my lot and that if I were to have interior trials God must change my path and this I did not think He would do Yet I could not always live at ease Of what means then would He make use I had not long to wait for an answer and it showed me that He whom I love is never at a loss for without changing my way He sent me this great trial and thus mingled a healing bitterness with all the sweet one Cf Rom eight fifteen two Exod nine sixteen three Cf Ps thirty three thirty four six four Ps one hundred eleven one hundred twelve four five Prov eighteen nineteen six John ten twelve seven Cf two Kings sixteen ten eight Mark seven twenty eight nine Cf Luke fourteen twelve thirteen fourteen ten two Cor nine seven eleven Matt twenty five forty CHAPTER XI A CANTICLE OF LOVE It is not only when He is about to send me some trial that Our Lord gives me warning and awakens my desire for it For years I had cherished a longing which seemed impossible of realisation to have a brother a Priest I often used to think that if my little brothers had not gone to Heaven I should have had the happiness of seeing them at the Altar I greatly regretted being deprived of this joy Yet God went beyond my dream I only asked for one brother who would remember me each day at the Holy Altar and He has united me in the bonds of spiritual friendship with two of His apostles I should like to tell you dear Mother how Our Divine Master fulfilled my desire In eighteen ninety five our holy Mother saint Teresa sent my first brother as a gift for my feast It was washing day and I was busy at my work when Mother Agnes of Jesus then Prioress called me aside and read me a letter from a young Seminarist in which he said he had been inspired by saint Teresa to ask for a sister who would devote herself specially to his salvation and to the salvation of his future flock He promised always to remember this spiritual sister when saying Mass and the choice fell upon me Dear Mother I cannot tell you how happy this made me Such unlooked for fulfillment of my desire awoke in my heart the joy of a child it carried me back to those early days when pleasures were so keen that my heart seemed too small to contain them Years had passed since I had tasted a like happiness so fresh so unfamiliar as if forgotten chords had been stirred within me Fully aware of my obligations I set to work and strove to redouble my fervour Now and again I wrote to my new brother Undoubtedly it is by prayer and sacrifice that we can help our missionaries but sometimes when it pleases Our Lord to unite two souls for His Glory He permits them to communicate their thoughts and thus inspire each other to love God more Of course an express command from those in authority is needed for this otherwise it seems to me that such a correspondence would do more harm than good if not to the missionary at least to the Carmelite whose manner of life tends to continual introversion This exchange of letters though rare would occupy her mind uselessly instead of uniting her to God she would perhaps fancy she was doing wonders when in reality under cover of zeal she was doing nothing but producing needless distraction And here am I launched not upon a distraction but upon a dissertation equally superfluous I shall never be able to correct myself of these lengthy digressions which must be so wearisome to you dear Mother Forgive me should I offend again Last year at the end of May it was your turn to give me my second brother and when I represented that having given all my merits to one future apostle I feared they could not be given to another you told me that obedience would double their value In the depths of my heart I thought the same thing and since the zeal of a Carmelite ought to embrace the whole world I hope with God s help to be of use to even more than two missionaries I pray for all not forgetting our Priests at home whose ministry is quite as difficult as that of the missionary preaching to the heathen In a word I wish to be a true daughter of the Church like our holy Mother saint Teresa and pray for all the intentions of Christ s Vicar That is the one great aim of my life But just as I should have had a special interest in my little brothers had they lived and that without neglecting the general interests of the Church so now I unite myself in a special way to the new brothers whom Jesus has given me All that I possess is theirs also God is too good to give by halves He is so rich that He gives me all I ask for even though I do not lose myself in lengthy enumerations As I have two brothers and my little sisters the novices the days would be too short were I to ask in detail for the needs of each soul and I fear I might forget something important Simple souls cannot understand complicated methods and as I am one of their number Our Lord has inspired me with a very simple way of fulfilling my obligations One day after Holy Communion He made me understand these words of the Canticles Draw me we will run after Thee to the odour of Thy ointments one O my Jesus there is no need to say In drawing me draw also the souls that I love these words Draw me suffice When a soul has let herself be taken captive by the inebriating odour of Thy perfumes she cannot run alone as a natural consequence of her attraction towards Thee the souls of all those she loves are drawn in her train Just as a torrent carries into the depths of the sea all that it meets on its way so my Jesus does the soul who plunges into the shoreless ocean of Thy Love bring with it all its treasures My treasures are the souls it has pleased thee to unite with mine Thou hast confided them to me and therefore I do not fear to use Thy own words uttered by Thee on the last night that saw Thee still a traveller on this earth Jesus my Beloved I know not when my exile will have an end Many a night I may yet sing Thy Mercies here below but for me also will come the last night and then I shall be able to say I have glorified Thee upon earth I have finished the work which Thou gavest me to do I have manifested Thy name to the men whom Thou hast given me out of the world Thine they were and to me Thou gavest them and they have kept Thy word Now they have known that all things which Thou hast given me are from Thee because the words which Thou gavest me I have given to them and they have received them and have known for certain that I came forth from Thee and they have believed that Thou didst send me I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them whom Thou hast given me because they are Thine And all mine are Thine and Thine are mine and I am glorified in them And now I am no more in the world and these are in the world and I come to Thee Holy Father keep them in Thy name whom Thou hast given me that they may be one as we also are one And now I come to Thee and these things I speak in the world that they may have my joy filled in themselves I do not ask that Thou take them away out of the world but that Thou preserve them from evil They are not of the world as I also am not of the world And not for them only do I pray but for those also who through their word shall believe in me Father I will that where I am they also whom Thou hast given me may be with me that they may see my glory which Thou hast given me because Thou hast loved me before the foundation of the world And I have made known Thy name unto them and will make it known that the love wherewith Thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them two Yea Lord thus would I repeat Thy words before losing myself in Thy loving embrace Perhaps it is daring but for a long time hast thou not allowed me to be daring with Thee Thou hast said to me as the Prodigal s father to his elder son All I have is thine three And therefore I may use thy very own words to draw down favours from Our Heavenly Father on all who are dear to me My God Thou knowest that I have ever desired to love Thee alone It has been my only ambition Thy love has gone before me even from the days of my childhood It has grown with my growth and now it is an abyss whose depths I cannot fathom Love attracts love mine darts towards Thee and would fain make the abyss brim over but alas it is not even as a dewdrop in the ocean To love Thee as Thou lovest me I must make Thy Love mine own Thus alone can I find rest O my Jesus it seems to me that Thou couldst not have overwhelmed a soul with more love than Thou hast poured out on mine and that is why I dare ask Thee to love those Thou hast given me even as Thou lovest me If in Heaven I find that thou lovest them more than Thou lovest me I shall rejoice for I acknowledge that their deserts are greater than mine but now I can conceive no love more vast than that with which Thou hast favoured me without any merit on my part Dear Mother what I have just written amazes me I had no intention of writing it When I said The words which Thou gavest me I have given unto them I was thinking only of my little sisters in the noviciate I am not able to teach missionaries and the words I wrote for them were from the prayer of Our Lord I do not ask that Thou shouldst take them out of the world I pray also for them who through their word shall believe in Thee How could I forget those souls they are to win by their sufferings and exhortations But I have not told you all my thoughts on this passage of the Sacred Canticles Draw me we will run Our Lord has said No man can come to Me except the Father Who hath sent Me draw him four and later He tells us that whosoever seeks shall find whosoever asks shall receive that unto him that knocks it shall be opened and He adds that whatever we ask the Father in His Name shall be given us It was no doubt for this reason that long before the birth of Our Lord the Holy Spirit dictated these prophetic words Draw me we will run By asking to be drawn we desire an intimate union with the object of our love If iron and fire were endowed with reason and the iron could say Draw me would not that prove its desire to be identified with the fire to the point of sharing its substance Well this is precisely my prayer I asked Jesus to draw me into the Fire of His love and to unite me so closely to Himself that He may live and act in me I feel that the more the fire of love consumes my heart so much the more shall I say Draw me and the more also will souls who draw near me run swiftly in the sweet odour of the Beloved Yes they will run we shall all run together for souls that are on fire can never be at rest They may indeed like saint Mary Magdalen sit at the feet of Jesus listening to His sweet and burning words but though they seem to give Him nothing they give much more than Martha who busied herself about many things It is not Martha s work that Our Lord blames but her over solicitude His Blessed Mother humbly occupied herself in the same kind of work when she prepared the meals for the Holy Family All the Saints have understood this especially those who have illumined the earth with the light of Christ s teaching Was it not from prayer that saint Paul saint Augustine saint Thomas Aquinas saint John of the Cross saint Teresa and so many other friends of God drew that wonderful science which has enthralled the loftiest minds Give me a lever and a fulcrum on which to lean it said Archimedes and I will lift the world What he could not obtain because his request had only a material end without reference to God the Saints have obtained in all its fulness They lean on God Almighty s power itself and their lever is the prayer that inflames with love s fire With this lever they have raised the world with this lever the Saints of the Church Militant still raise it and will raise it to the end of time Dear Mother I have still to tell you what I understand by the sweet odour of the Beloved As Our Lord is now in Heaven I can only follow Him by the footprints He has left footprints full of life full of fragrance I have only to open the Holy Gospels and at once I breathe the perfume of Jesus and then I know which way to run and it is not to the first place but to the last that I hasten I leave the Pharisee to go up and full of confidence I repeat the humble prayer of the Publican Above all I follow Magdalen for the amazing rather I should say the loving audacity that delights the Heart of Jesus has cast its spell upon mine It is not because I have been preserved from mortal sin that I lift up my heart to God in trust and love I feel that even had I on my conscience every crime one could commit I should lose nothing of my confidence my heart broken with sorrow I would throw myself into the Arms of my Saviour I know that He loves the Prodigal Son I have heard His words to saint Mary Magdalen to the woman taken in adultery and to the woman of Samaria No one could frighten me for I know what to believe concerning His Mercy and His Love And I know that all that multitude of sins would disappear in an instant even as a drop of water cast into a flaming furnace It is told in the Lives of the Fathers of the Desert how one of them converted a public sinner whose evil deeds were the scandal of the whole country This wicked woman touched by grace followed the Saint into the desert there to perform rigorous penance But on the first night of the journey before even reaching the place of her retirement the bonds that bound her to earth were broken by the vehemence of her loving sorrow The holy man at the same instant saw her soul borne by Angels to the Bosom of God This is a striking example of what I want to say but these things cannot be expressed Dearest Mother if weak and imperfect souls like mine felt what I feel none would despair of reaching the summit of the Mountain of Love since Jesus does not ask for great deeds but only for gratitude and self surrender He says I will not take the he goats from out of the flocks for all the beasts of the forests are mine the cattle on the hills and the oxen I know all the fowls of the air If I were hungry I would not tell thee for the world is Mine and the fulness thereof Shall I eat the flesh of bullocks or shall I drink the blood of goats Offer to God the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving five This is all Our Lord claims from us He has need of our love He has no need of our works The same God Who declares that He has no need to tell us if He be hungry did not disdain to beg a little water from the Samaritan woman He was athirst but when He said Give me to drink six He the Creator of the Universe asked for the love of His creature He thirsted for love And this thirst of Our Divine Lord was ever on the increase Amongst the disciples of the world He meets with nothing but indifference and ingratitude and alas among His own how few hearts surrender themselves without reserve to the infinite tenderness of His Love Happy are we who are privileged to understand the inmost secrets of Our Divine Spouse If you dear Mother would but set down in writing all you know what wonders could you not unfold But like Our Blessed Lady you prefer to keep all these things in your heart seven To me you say that It is honourable to reveal and confess the world of God eight Yet you are right to keep silence for no earthly words can convey the secrets of Heaven As for me in spite of all I have written I have not as yet begun I see so many beautiful horizons such infinitely varied tints that the palette of the Divine Painter will alone after the darkness of this life be able to supply me with the colours wherewith I may portray the wonders that my soul descries Since however you have expressed a desire to penetrate into the hidden sanctuary of my heart and to have in writing what was the most consoling dream of my life I will end this story of my soul by an act of obedience If you will allow me it is to Jesus I will address myself for in this way I shall speak more easily You may find my expressions somewhat exaggerated but I assure you there is no exaggeration in my heart there all is calm and peace O my Jesus who can say how tenderly and gently Thou dost lead my soul The storm had raged there ever since Easter the glorious feast of Thy triumph until in the month of May there shone through the darkness of my night one bright ray of grace My mind dwelt on mysterious dreams sent sometimes to Thy favoured ones and I thought how such a consolation was not to be mine that for me it was night always the dark night And in the midst of the storm I fell asleep The following day May ten just at dawn I dreamt that I was walking in a gallery alone with Our Mother Suddenly without knowing how they had entered I perceived three Carmelites in mantles and long veils and I knew that they came from Heaven Ah I thought how glad I should be if I could but look on the face of one of these Carmelites And as if my wish had been heard I saw the tallest of the three Saints advance towards me An inexpressible joy took possession of me as she raised her veil and then covered me with it At once I recognised our Venerable Mother Anne of Jesus foundress of the Carmel in France nine Her face was beautiful with an unearthly beauty no rays came from it and yet in spite of the thick veil which enveloped us I could see it suffused by a soft light which seemed to emanate from her heavenly countenance She caressed me tenderly and seeing myself the object of such affection I made bold to say Dear Mother I entreat you tell me will Our Lord leave me much longer in this world Will He not soon come to fetch me She smiled sweetly and answered Yes soon very soon I promise you Dear Mother I asked again tell me if He does not want more from me than these poor little acts and desires that I offer Him Is He pleased with me Then our Venerable Mother s face shone with a new splendour and her expression became still more gracious The Good God asks no more of you she said He is pleased quite pleased and taking my head between her hands she kissed me so tenderly that it would be impossible to describe the joy I felt My heart was overflowing with gladness and remembering my Sisters I was about to beseech some favour for them when alas I awoke My happiness was too great for words Many months have passed since I had this wonderful dream and yet its memory is as fresh and delightful as ever I can still picture the loving smiles of this holy Carmelite and feel her fond caresses O Jesus Thou didst command the winds and the storm and there came a great calm ten On waking I realised that Heaven does indeed exist and that this Heaven is peopled with souls who cherish me as their child and this impression still remains with me all the sweeter because up to that time I had but little devotion to the Venerable Mother Anne of Jesus I had never sought her help and but rarely heard her name And now I know and understand how constantly I was in her thoughts and the knowledge adds to my love for her and for all the dear ones in my Father s Home O my Beloved this was but the prelude of graces yet greater which Thou didst desire to heap upon me Let me remind Thee of them to day and forgive my folly if I venture to tell Thee once more of my hopes and my heart s well nigh infinite longings forgive me and grant my desire that it may be well with my soul To be Thy Spouse O my Jesus to be a daughter of Carmel and by my union with Thee to be the mother of souls should not all this content me And yet other vocations make themselves felt I feel called to the Priesthood and to the Apostolate I would be a Martyr a Doctor of the Church I should like to accomplish the most heroic deeds the spirit of the Crusader burns within me and I long to die on the field of battle in defence of Holy Church The vocation of a Priest With what love my Jesus would I bear Thee in my hand when my words brought Thee down from Heaven With what love would I give Thee to souls And yet while longing to be a Priest I admire and envy the humility of saint Francis of Assisi and am drawn to imitate him by refusing the sublime dignity of the Priesthood How reconcile these opposite tendencies eleven Like the Prophets and Doctors I would be a light unto souls I would travel to every land to preach Thy name O my Beloved and raise on heathen soil the glorious standard of Thy Cross One mission alone would not satisfy my longings I would spread the Gospel to the ends of the earth even to the most distant isles I would be a Missionary not for a few years only but were it possible from the beginning of the world till the consummation of time Above all I thirst for the Martyr s crown It was the desire of my earliest days and the desire has deepened with the years passed in the Carmel s narrow cell But this too is folly since I do not sigh for one torment I need them all to slake my thirst Like Thee O Adorable Spouse I would be scourged I would be crucified I would be flayed like saint Bartholomew plunged into boiling oil like saint John or like saint Ignatius of Antioch ground by the teeth of wild beasts into a bread worthy of God twelve With saint Agnes and saint Cecilia I would offer my neck to the sword of the executioner and like Joan of Arc I would murmur the name of Jesus at the stake My heart thrills at the thought of the frightful tortures Christians are to suffer at the time of Anti Christ and I long to undergo them all Open O Jesus the Book of Life in which are written the deeds of Thy Saints all the deeds told in that book I long to have accomplished for Thee To such folly as this what answer wilt Thou make Is there on the face of this earth a soul more feeble than mine And yet precisely because I am feeble it has delighted Thee to accede to my least and most child like desires and to day it is Thy good pleasure to realise those other desires more vast than the Universe These aspirations becoming a true martyrdom I opened one day the Epistles of saint Paul to seek relief in my sufferings My eyes fell on the twelfth and thirteenth chapters of the First Epistle to the Corinthians I read that all cannot become Apostles Prophets and Doctors that the Church is composed of different members that the eye cannot also be the hand The answer was clear but it did not fulfill my desires or give to me the peace I sought Then descending into the depths of my nothingness I was so lifted up that I reached my aim thirteen Without being discouraged I read on and found comfort in this counsel Be zealous for the better gifts And I show unto you a yet more excellent way fourteen The Apostle then explains how all perfect gifts are nothing without Love that Charity is the most excellent way of going surely to God At last I had found rest Meditating on the mystical Body of Holy Church I could not recognise myself among any of its members as described by saint Paul or was it not rather that I wished to recognise myself in all Charity provided me with the key to my vocation I understood that since the Church is a body composed of different members the noblest and most important of all the organs would not be wanting I knew that the Church has a heart that this heart burns with love and that it is love alone which gives life to its members I knew that if this love were extinguished the Apostles would no longer preach the Gospel and the Martyrs would refuse to shed their blood I understood that love embraces all vocations that it is all things and that it reaches out through all the ages and to the uttermost limits of the earth because it is eternal Then beside myself with joy I cried out O Jesus my Love at last I have found my vocation My vocation is love Yes I have found my place in the bosom of the Church and this place O my God Thou hast Thyself given to me in the heart of the Church my Mother I will be LOVE Thus I shall be all things thus will my dream be realised Why do I say I am beside myself with joy This does not convey my thought Rather is it peace which has become my portion the calm peace of the sailor when he catches sight of the beacon which lights him to port O luminous Beacon of Love I know how to come even unto Thee I have found the means of borrowing Thy Fires I am but a weak and helpless child yet it is my very weakness which makes me dare to offer myself O Jesus as victim to Thy Love In olden days pure and spotless holocausts alone were acceptable to the Omnipotent God Nor could His Justice be appeased save by the most perfect sacrifices But the law of fear has given place to the law of love and Love has chosen me a weak and imperfect creature as its victim Is not such a choice worthy of God s Love Yea for in order that Love may be fully satisfied it must stoop even unto nothingness and must transform that nothingness into fire O my God I know it Love is repaid by love alone fifteen Therefore I have sought I have found how to ease my heart by rendering Thee love for love Use the riches that make men unjust to find you friends who may receive you into everlasting dwellings sixteen This O Lord is the advice Thou gavest to Thy disciples after complaining that the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light seventeen Child of light as I am I understood that my desires to be all things and to embrace all vocations were riches that might well make me unjust so I set to work to use them for the making of friends Mindful of the prayer of Eliseus when he asked the Prophet Elias for his double spirit I presented myself before the company of the Angels and Saints and addressed them thus I am the least of all creatures I know my mean estate but I know that noble and generous hearts love to do good Therefore O Blessed Inhabitants of the Celestial City I entreat you to adopt me as your child All the glory that you help me to acquire will be yours only deign to hear my prayer and obtain for me a double portion of the love of God O my God I cannot measure the extent of my request I should fear to be crushed by the very weight of its audacity My only excuse is my claim to childhood and that children do not grasp the full meaning of their words Yet if a father or mother were on the throne and possessed vast treasures they would not hesitate to grant the desires of those little ones more dear to them than life itself To give them pleasure they will stoop even unto folly Well I am a child of Holy Church and the Church is a Queen because she is now espoused to the Divine King of Kings I ask not for riches or glory not even the glory of Heaven that belongs by right to my brothers the Angels and Saints and my own glory shall be the radiance that streams from the queenly brow of my Mother the Church Nay I ask for Love To love Thee Jesus is now my only desire Great deeds are not for me I cannot preach the Gospel or shed my blood No matter My brothers work in my stead and I a little child stay close to the throne and love Thee for all who are in the strife But how shall I show my love since love proves itself by deeds Well The little child will strew flowers she will embrace the Divine Throne with their fragrance she will sing Love s Canticle in silvery tones Yes my Beloved it is thus my short life shall be spent in Thy sight The only way I have of proving my love is to strew flowers before Thee that is to say I will let no tiny sacrifice pass no look no word I wish to profit by the smallest actions and to do them for Love I wish to suffer for Love s sake and for Love s sake even to rejoice thus shall I strew flowers Not one shall I find without scattering its petals before Thee and I will sing I will sing always even if my roses must be gathered from amidst thorns and the longer and sharper the thorns the sweeter shall be my song But of what avail to thee my Jesus are my flowers and my songs I know it well this fragrant shower these delicate petals of little price these songs of love from a poor little heart like mine will nevertheless be pleasing unto Thee Trifles they are but Thou wilt smile on them The Church Triumphant stooping towards her child will gather up these scattered rose leaves and placing them in Thy Divine Hands there to acquire an infinite value will shower them on the Church Suffering to extinguish its flames and on the Church Militant to obtain its victory O my Jesus I love Thee I love my Mother the Church I bear in mind that the least act of pure love is of more value to her than all other works together eighteen But is this pure love really in my heart Are not my boundless desires but dreams but foolishness If this be so I beseech Thee to enlighten me Thou knowest I seek but the truth If my desires be rash then deliver me from them and from this most grievous of all martyrdoms And yet I confess if I reach not those heights to which my soul aspires this very martyrdom this foolishness will have been sweeter to me than eternal bliss will be unless by a miracle Thou shouldst take from me all memory of the hopes I entertained upon earth Jesus Jesus If the mere desire of Thy Love awakens such delight what will it be to possess it to enjoy it for ever How can a soul so imperfect as mine aspire to the plenitude of Love What is the key of this mystery O my only Friend why dost Thou not reserve these infinite longings to lofty souls to the eagles that soar in the heights Alas I am but a poor little unfledged bird I am not an eagle I have but the eagle s eyes and heart Yet notwithstanding my exceeding littleless I dare to gaze upon the Divine Sun of Love and I burn to dart upwards unto Him I would fly I would imitate the eagles but all that I can do is to lift up my little wings it is beyond my feeble power to soar What is to become of me Must I die of sorrow because of my helplessness Oh no I will not even grieve With daring self abandonment there will I remain until death my gaze fixed upon that Divine Sun Nothing shall affright me nor wind nor rain And should impenetrable clouds conceal the Orb of Love and should I seem to believe that beyond this life there is darkness only that would be the hour of perfect joy the hour in which to push my confidence to its uttermost bounds I should not dare to detach my gaze well knowing that beyond the dark clouds the sweet Sun still shines So far O my God I understand Thy Love for me But Thou knowest how often I forget this my only care I stray from Thy side and my scarcely fledged wings become draggled in the muddy pools of earth then I lament like a young swallow nineteen and my lament tells Thee all and I remember O Infinite Mercy that Thou didst not come to call the just but sinners twenty Yet shouldst Thou still be deaf to the plaintive cries of Thy feeble creature shouldst Thou still be veiled then I am content to remain benumbed with cold my wings bedraggled and once more I rejoice in this well deserved suffering O Sun my only Love I am happy to feel myself so small so frail in Thy sunshine and I am in peace I know that all the eagles of Thy Celestial Court have pity on me they guard and defend me they put to flight the vultures the demons that fain would devour me I fear them not these demons I am not destined to be their prey but the prey of the Divine Eagle O Eternal Word O my Saviour Thou art the Divine Eagle Whom I love Who lurest me Thou Who descending to this land of exile didst will to suffer and to die in order to bear away the souls of men and plunge them into the very heart of the Blessed Trinity Love s Eternal Home Thou Who reascending into inaccessible light dost still remain concealed here in our vale of tears under the snow white semblance of the Host and this to nourish me with Thine own substance O Jesus forgive me if I tell Thee that Thy Love reacheth even unto folly And in face of this folly what wilt Thou but that my heart leap up to Thee How could my trust have any limits I know that the Saints have made themselves as fools for Thy sake being eagles they have done great things I am too little for great things and my folly it is to hope that Thy Love accepts me as victim my folly it is to count on the aid of Angels and Saints in order that I may fly unto Thee with thine own wings O my Divine Eagle For as long a time as Thou willest I shall remain my eyes fixed upon Thee I long to be allured by Thy Divine Eyes I would become Love s prey I have the hope that Thou wilt one day swoop down upon me and bearing me away to the Source of all Love Thou wilt plunge me at last into that glowing abyss that I may become for ever its happy Victim O Jesus would that I could tell all little souls of Thine ineffable condescension I feel that if by any possibility Thou couldst find one weaker than my own Thou wouldst take delight in loading her with still greater favours provided that she abandoned herself with entire confidence to Thine Infinite Mercy But O my Spouse why these desires of mine to make known the secrets of Thy Love Is it not Thyself alone Who hast taught them to me and canst Thou not unveil them to others Yea I know it and this I implore Thee I ENTREAT THEE TO LET THY DIVINE EYES REST UPON A VAST NUMBER OF LITTLE SOULS I ENTREAT THEE TO CHOOSE IN THIS

was her spiritual director for fourteen years described her as a seraph incarnate and her prudence and sanctity were held in such esteem that the most learned men consulted her in their doubts and accepted her answers as oracles She was always faithful to the spirit of saint Teresa and had received from Heaven the mission to restore the Carmel to its primitive perfection Having founded three

EPILOGUE A VICTIM OF DIVINE LOVE Many pages of this story said its writer will never be read upon earth It is necessary to repeat and emphasize her words There are sufferings which are not to be disclosed here below Our Lord has jealously reserved to Himself the right to reveal their merit and glory in the clear vision where all veils shall be removed My God she cried on the day of her religious profession give me martyrdom of soul or body or rather give me both the one and the other And Our Lord Who as she herself avowed fulfilled all her desires granted this one also and in more abundant measure than the rest He caused the floods of infinite tenderness pent up in His Divine Heart to overflow into the soul of His little Spouse This was the Martyrdom of Love so well described in her melodious song But it was her own doctrine that to dedicate oneself as a Victim of Love is not to be dedicated to sweetness and consolations it is to offer oneself to all that is painful and bitter because Love lives only by sacrifice and the more we would surrender ourselves to Love the more we must surrender ourselves to suffering Therefore because she desired to attain the loftiest height of Love the Divine Master led her thither by the rugged path of sorrow and it was only on its bleak summit that she died a Victim of Love We have seen how great was her sacrifice in leaving her happy home and the Father who loved her so tenderly It may be imagined that this sacrifice was softened because at the Carmel she found again her two elder and dearly loved sisters On the contrary this afforded the young postulant many an occasion for repressing her strong natural affections The rules of solitude and silence were strictly observed and she only saw her sisters at recreation Had she been less mortified she might often have sat beside them but by preference she sought out the company of those religious who were least agreeable to her and no one could tell whether or not she bore a special affection towards her own sisters Some time after her entrance she was appointed as aid to Sister Agnes of Jesus her dear Pauline this was a fresh occasion for sacrifice Therese knew that all unnecessary conversation was forbidden and therefore she never allowed herself even the least word O my little Mother she said later how I suffered I could not open my heart to you and I thought you no longer knew me After five years of this heroic silence Sister Agnes of Jesus was elected Prioress On the evening of the election Therese might well have rejoiced that henceforth she could speak freely to her little Mother and as of old pour out her soul But sacrifice had become her daily food If she sought one favour more than another it was that she might be looked on as the lowest and the least and among all the religious not one saw less of the Mother Prioress She desired to live the life of Carmel with all the perfection required by saint Teresa and although a martyr to habitual dryness her prayer was continuous On one occasion a novice entering her cell was struck by the heavenly expression of her countenance She was sewing industriously and yet seemed lost in deep contemplation What are you thinking of the young Sister asked I am meditating on the Our Father Therese answered It is so sweet to call God Our Father and tears glistened in her eyes Another time she said I cannot well see what more I shall have in Heaven than I have now I shall see God it is true but as to being with Him I am that already even on earth The flame of Divine Love consumed her and this is what she herself relates A few days after the oblation of myself to God s Merciful Love I was in the choir beginning the Way of the Cross when I felt myself suddenly wounded by a dart of fire so ardent that I thought I should die I do not know how to explain this transport there is no comparison to describe the intensity of that flame It seemed as though an invisible force plunged me wholly into fire But oh what fire what sweetness When Mother Prioress asked her if this rapture was the first she had experienced she answered simply Dear Mother I have had several transports of love and one in particular during my Noviciate when I remained for a whole week far removed from this world It seemed as though a veil were thrown over all earthly things But I was not then consumed by a real fire I was able to bear those transports of love without expecting to see the ties that bound me to earth give way whilst on the day of which I now speak one minute one second more and my soul must have been set free Alas I found myself again on earth and dryness at once returned to my heart True the Divine Hand had withdrawn the fiery dart but the wound was unto death In that close union with God Therese acquired a remarkable mastery over self All sweet virtues flourished in the garden of her soul but do not let us imagine that these wondrous flowers grew without effort on her part In this world there is no fruitfulness without suffering either physical pain secret sorrow or trials known sometimes only to God When good thoughts and generous resolutions have sprung up in our souls through reading the lives of the Saints we ought not to content ourselves as in the case of profane books with paying a certain tribute of admiration to the genius of their authors we should rather consider the price which doubtless they have paid for that supernatural good they have produced one And if to day Therese transforms so many hearts and the good she does on earth is beyond reckoning we may well believe she bought it all at the price with which Jesus bought back our souls by suffering and the Cross Not the least of these sufferings was the unceasing war she waged against herself refusing every satisfaction to the demands of her naturally proud and impetuous nature While still a child she had acquired the habit of never excusing herself or making a complaint at the Carmel she strove to be the little servant of her Sisters in religion and in that same spirit of humility she endeavoured to obey all without distinction One evening during her illness the Community had assembled in the garden to sing a hymn before an Altar of the Sacred Heart Soeur Therese who was already wasted by fever joined them with difficulty and arriving quite exhausted was obliged to sit down at once When the hymn began one of the Sisters made her a sign to stand up Without hesitation the humble child rose and in spite of the fever and great oppression from which she was suffering remained standing to the end The Infirmarian had advised her to take a little walk in the garden for a quarter of an hour each day This recommendation was for her a command One afternoon a Sister noticing what an effort it cost her said Soeur Therese you would do much better to rest walking like this cannot do you any good You only tire yourself That is true she replied but do you know what gives me strength I offer each step for some missionary I think that possibly over there far away one of them is weary and tired in his apostolic labours and to lessen his fatigue I offer mine to the Good God She gave her novices some beautiful examples of detachment One year the relations of the Sisters and the servants of the Convent had sent bouquets of flowers for Mother Prioress s feast Therese was arranging them most tastefully when a Lay sister said crossly It is easy to see that the large bouquets have been given by your friends I suppose those sent by the poor will again be put in the background A sweet smile was the only reply and notwithstanding the unpleasing effect she immediately put the flowers sent by the servants in the most conspicuous place Struck with admiration the Lay sister went at once to the Prioress to accuse herself of her unkindness and to praise the patience and humility shown by Soeur Therese After the death of Therese that same Sister full of confidence pressed her forehead against the feet of the saintly nun once more asking forgiveness for her fault At the same instant she felt herself cured of cerebral anaemia from which she had suffered for many years and which had prevented her from applying herself either to reading or mental prayer Far from avoiding humiliations Soeur Therese sought them eagerly and for that reason she offered herself as aid to a Sister who she well knew was difficult to please and her generous proposal was accepted One day when she had suffered much from this Sister a novice asked her why she looked so happy Great was her surprise on receiving the reply It is because Sister N has just been saying disagreeable things to me What pleasure she has given me I wish I could meet her now and give her a sweet smile As she was still speaking the Sister in question knocked at the door and the astonished novice could see for herself how the Saints forgive Soeur Therese acknowledged later on she soared so high above earthly things that humiliations did but make her stronger To all these virtues she joined a wonderful courage From her entrance into the Carmel at the age of fifteen she was allowed to follow all the practices of its austere Rule the fasts alone excepted Sometimes her companions in the noviciate seeing how pale she looked tried to obtain a dispensation for her either from the Night Office or from rising at the usual hour in the morning but the Mother Prioress would never yield to these requests A soul of such mettle she would say ought not to be dealt with as a child dispensations are not meant for her Let her be for God sustains her Besides if she is really ill she should come and tell me herself two But it was always a principle with Therese that We should go to the end of our strength before we complain How many times did she assist at Matins suffering from vertigo or violent headaches I am able to walk she would say and so I ought to be at my duty And thanks to this undaunted energy she performed acts that were heroic It was with difficulty that her delicate stomach accustomed itself to the frugal fare of the Carmel Certain things made her ill but she knew so well how to hide this that no one ever suspected it Her neighbour at table said that she had tried in vain to discover the dishes that she preferred and the kitchen Sisters finding her so easy to please invariably served her with what was left It was only during her last illness when she was ordered to say what disagreed with her that her mortifications came to light When Jesus wishes us to suffer she said at that time there can be no evading it And so when Sister Mary of the Sacred Heart three was procuratrix she endeavoured to look after me with a mother s tenderness To all appearances I was well cared for and yet what mortifications did she not impose upon me for she served me according to her own taste which was entirely opposed to mine Therese s spirit of sacrifice was far reaching she eagerly sought what was painful and disagreeable as her rightful share All that God asked she gave Him without hesitation or reserve During my postulancy she said it cost me a great deal to perform certain exterior penances customary in our convents but I never yielded to these repugnances it seemed to me that the image of my Crucified Lord looked at me with beseeching eyes and begged these sacrifices Her vigilance was so keen that she never left unobserved any little recommendations of the Mother Prioress or any of the small rules which render the religious life so meritorious One of the old nuns having remarked her extraordinary fidelity on this point ever afterwards regarded her as a Saint Soeur Therese was accustomed to say that she never did any great penances That was because her fervour counted as nothing the few that were allowed her It happened however that she fell ill through wearing for too long a time a small iron Cross studded with sharp points that pressed into her flesh Such a trifle would not have caused this she said afterwards if God had not wished thus to make me understand that the greater austerities of the Saints are not meant for me nor for the souls that walk in the path of spiritual childhood The souls that are the most dear to My Father Our Lord once said to Saint Teresa are those He tries the most and the greatness of their trials is the measure of His Love Therese was a soul most dear to God and He was about to fill up the measure of His Love by making her pass through a veritable martyrdom The reader will remember the call on Good Friday April three eighteen ninety six when to use her own expression she heard the distant murmur which announced the approach of the Bridegroom but she had still to endure long months of pain before the blessed hour of her deliverance On the morning of that Good Friday she made so little of the haemorrhage of the previous night that Mother Prioress allowed her to practise all the penances prescribed by the Rule for that day In the afternoon a novice saw her cleaning windows Her face was livid and in spite of her great energy it was evident that her strength was almost spent Seeing her fatigue the novice who loved her dearly burst into tears and begged leave to obtain her some little reprieve But the young novice mistress strictly forbade her saying that she was quite able to bear this slight fatigue on the day on which Jesus had suffered and died Soon a persistent cough made the Mother Prioress feel anxious she ordered Soeur Therese a more strengthening diet and the cough ceased for some time Truly sickness is too slow a liberator exclaimed our dear little Sister I can only rely upon Love She was strongly tempted to respond to the appeal of the Carmelites of Hanoi who much desired to have her and began a novena to the Venerable Theophane Venard four to obtain her cure but alas that novena proved but the beginning of a more serious phase of her malady Like her Divine Master she passed through the world doing good like Him she had been forgotten and unknown and now still following in His Footsteps she was to climb the hill of Calvary Accustomed to see her always suffering yet always joyous and brave Mother Prioress doubtless inspired by God allowed her to take part in the Community exercises some of which tired her extremely At night she would courageously mount the stairs alone pausing at each step to take breath It was with difficulty that she reached her cell and then in so exhausted a state that sometimes as she avowed later it took her quite an hour to undress After all this exertion it was upon a hard pallet that she took her rest Her nights too were very bad and when asked if she would not like someone to be near her in her hours of pain she replied Oh no on the contrary I am only too glad to be in a cell away from my Sisters that I may not be heard I am content to suffer alone as soon as I am pitied and loaded with attentions my happiness leaves me What strength of soul these words betray Where we find sorrow she found joy What to us is to hard to bear being overlooked and ignored by creatures became to her a source of delight And her Divine Spouse knew well how to provide that bitter joy she found so sweet Painful remedies had often to be applied One day when she had suffered from them more than usual she was resting in her cell during recreation and overheard a Sister in the kitchen speaking of her thus Soeur Therese will not live long and really sometimes I wonder what our Mother Prioress will find to say about her when she dies five She will be sorely puzzled for this little Sister amiable as she is has certainly never done anything worth speaking about The Infirmarian who had also overheard the remark turned to Therese and said If you relied upon the opinion of creatures you would indeed be disillusioned today The opinion of creatures she replied happily God has given me the grace to be absolutely indifferent to that Let me tell you something which showed me once and for all how much it is worth A few days after my Clothing I went to our dear Mother s room and one of the Sisters who happened to be there said on seeing me Dear Mother this novice certainly does you credit How well she looks I hope she may be able to observe the Rule for many years to come I was feeling decidedly pleased at this compliment when another Sister came in and looking at me said Poor little Soeur Therese how very tired you seem You quite alarm me If you do not soon improve I am afraid you will not be able to keep the Rule very long I was then only sixteen but this little incident made such an impression on me that I never again set store on the varying opinion of creatures On another occasion someone remarked It is said that you have never suffered much Smiling she pointed to a glass containing medicine of a bright red colour You see this little glass she said One would suppose that it contained a most delicious draught whereas in reality it is more bitter than anything else I take It is the image of my life To others it has been all rose colour they have thought that I continually drank of a most delicious wine yet to me it has been full of bitterness I say bitterness and yet my life has not been a bitter one for I have learned to find my joy and sweetness in all that is bitter You are suffering very much just now are you not Yes but then I have so longed to suffer How it distresses us to see you in such pain and to think that it may increase said her novices Oh Do not grieve about me I have reached a point where I can no longer suffer because all suffering is become so sweet Besides it is quite a mistake to trouble yourselves as to what I may still have to undergo It is like meddling with God s work We who run in the way of Love must never allow ourselves to be disturbed by anything If I did not simply live from one moment to another it would be impossible for me to be patient but I only look at the present I forget the past and I take good care not to forestall the future When we yield to discouragement or despair it is usually because we think too much about the past and the future But pray much for me for it is often just when I cry to Heaven for help that I feel most abandoned How do you manage not to give way to discouragement at such times I turn to God and all His Saints and thank them notwithstanding I believe they want to see how far my trust may extend But the words of Job have not entered my heart in vain Even if God should kill me I would still trust in Him six I own it has taken a long time to arrive at this degree of self abandonment but I have reached it now and it is the Lord Himself Who has brought me there Another time she said Our Lord s Will fills my heart to the brim and hence if aught else is added it cannot penetrate to any depth but like oil on the surface of limpid waters glides easily across If my heart were not already brimming over and must needs be filled by the feelings of joy and sadness that alternate so rapidly then indeed would it be flooded by a wave of bitter pain but these quick succeeding changes scarcely ruffle the surface of my soul and in its depths there reigns a peace that nothing can disturb And yet her soul was enveloped in thick darkness and her temptations against Faith ever conquered but ever returning were there to rob her of all feeling of happiness at the thought of her approaching death Were it not for this trial which is impossible to understand she would say I think I should die of joy at the prospect of soon leaving this earth By this trial the Divine Master wished to put the finishing touches to her purification and thus enable her not only to walk with rapid steps but to run in her little way of confidence and abandonment Her words repeatedly proved this I desire neither death nor life Were Our Lord to offer me my choice I would not choose I only will what He wills it is what He does that I love I do not fear the last struggle nor any pains however great my illness may bring God has always been my help He has led me by the hand from my earliest childhood and on Him I rely My agony may reach the furthest limits but I am convinced He will never forsake me Such confidence in God of necessity stirred the fury of the devil of him who at life s close tries every ruse to sow the seeds of despair in the hearts of the dying Last night I was seized with a terrible feeling of anguish she confessed to Mother Agnes of Jesus on one occasion I was lost in darkness and from out of it came an accursed voice Are you certain God loves you Has He Himself told you so The opinion of creatures will not justify you in His sight These thoughts had long tortured me when your little note like a message from Heaven was brought to me You recalled to me dear Mother the special graces Jesus had lavished upon me and as though you had had a revelation concerning my trial you assured me I was deeply loved by God and was on the eve of receiving from His Hands my eternal crown Immediately peace and joy were restored to my heart Yet the thought came to me It is my little Mother s affection that makes her write these words Straightway I felt inspired to take up the Gospels and opening the book at random I lighted on a passage which had hitherto escaped me He whom God hath sent speaketh the Words of God for God doth not give the Spirit by measure seven Then I fell asleep fully consoled It was you dear Mother whom the Good God sent me and I must believe you because you speak the Words of God For several days during the month of August Therese remained so to speak beside herself and implored that prayers might be offered for her She had never before been seen in this state and in her inexpressible anguish she kept repeating Oh how necessary it is to pray for the agonising If one only knew One night she entreated the Infirmarian to sprinkle her bed with Holy Water saying I am besieged by the devil I do not see him but I feel him he torments me and holds me with a grip of iron that I may not find one crumb of comfort he augments my woes that I may be driven to despair And I cannot pray I can only look at Our Blessed Lady and say Jesus How needful is that prayer we use at Compline Procul recedant somnia et noctium phantasmata Free us from the phantoms of the night Something mysterious is happening within me I am not suffering for myself but for some other soul and satan is angry The Infirmarian startled lighted a blessed candle and the spirit of darkness fled never to return but the sufferer remained to the end in a state of extreme anguish One day while she was contemplating the beautiful heavens some one said to her soon your home will be there beyond the blue sky How lovingly you gaze at it She only smiled but afterwards she said to the Mother Prioress Dear Mother the Sisters do not realise my sufferings Just now when looking at the sky I merely admired the beauty of the material heaven the true Heaven seems more than ever closed against me At first their words troubled me but an interior voice whispered Yes you were looking to Heaven out of love Since your soul is entirely delivered up to love all your actions even the most indifferent are marked with this divine seal At once I was consoled In spite of the darkness which enveloped her her Divine Saviour sometimes left the door of her prison ajar Those were moments in which her soul lost itself in transports of confidence and love Thus it happened that on a certain day when walking in the garden supported by one of her own sisters she stopped at the charming spectacle of a hen sheltering its pretty little ones under its wing Her eyes filled with tears and turning to her companion she said I cannot remain here any longer let us go in And even when she reached her cell her tears continued to fall and it was some time before she could speak At last she looked at her sister with a heavenly expression and said I was thinking of Our Lord and the beautiful comparison He chose in order to make us understand His ineffable tenderness This is what He has done for me all the days of my life He has completely hidden me under His Wing I cannot express all that has just stirred my heart it is well for me that God conceals Himself and lets me see the effects of His Mercy but rarely and as it were from behind the lattices Were it not so I could never bear such sweetness Disconsolate at the prospect of losing their treasure the Community began a novena to Our Lady of Victories on June five eighteen ninety seven in the fervent hope that she would once again miraculously raise the drooping Little Flower But her answer was the same as that given by the blessed Martyr Theophane Venard and they were forced to accept with generosity the bitterness of the coming separation At the beginning of July her state became very serious and she was at last removed to the Infirmary Seeing her empty cell and knowing she would never return to it Mother Agnes of Jesus said to her When you are no longer with us how sad I shall feel when I look at this cell For consolation little Mother you can think how happy I am up there and remember that much of my happiness was acquired in that little cell for she added raising her beautiful eyes to Heaven I have suffered so much there and I should have been happy to die there As she entered the Infirmary she looked towards the miraculous statue of Our Lady which had been brought thither It would be impossible to describe that look What is it you see said her sister Marie the witness of her miraculous cure as a child And Therese answered Never has she seemed to me so beautiful but to day it is the statue whereas that other day as you well know it was not the statue And from that time she often received similar consolations One evening she exclaimed Oh how I love Our Blessed Lady Had I been a Priest how I would have sung her praises She is spoken of as unapproachable whereas she should be represented as easy of imitation She is more Mother than Queen I have heard it said that her splendour eclipses that of all the Saints as the rising sun makes all the stars disappear It sounds so strange That a Mother should take away the glory of her children I think quite the reverse I believe that she will greatly increase the splendour of the elect Our Mother Mary Oh how simple her life must have been and continuing her discourse she drew such a sweet and delightful picture of the Holy Family that all present were lost in admiration A very heavy cross awaited her before going to join her Spouse From August sixteen to September thirty the happy day of her death she was unable to receive Holy Communion because of her continual sickness Few have hungered for the Bread of Angels like this seraph of earth Again and again during that last winter of her life after nights of intolerable pain she rose at early morn to partake of the Manna of Heaven and she thought no price too heavy to pay for the bliss of feeding upon God Before depriving her altogether of this Heavenly Food Our Lord often visited her on her bed of pain Her Communion on July sixteen the feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel was specially touching During the previous night she composed some verses which were to be sung before Communion Thou know saint the baseness of my soul O Lord Yet fearest not to stoop and enter me Come to my heart O Sacrament adored Come to my heart it craveth but for Thee And when Thou comest straightway let me die Of very love for Thee this boon impart Oh hearken Jesus to my suppliant cry Come to my heart In the morning when the Holy Viaticum was carried to the Infirmary the cloisters were thickly strewn with wild flowers and rose petals A young Priest who was about to say his first Mass that day in the Chapel of the Carmel bore the Blessed Sacrament to the dying Sister and at her desire Sister Mary of the Eucharist whose voice was exceptionally sweet sang the following couplet Sweet martyrdom to die of love s keen fire The martyrdom of which my heart is fain Hasten ye Cherubim to tune your lyre I shall not linger long in exile s pain Fulfill my dream O Jesus since I sigh Of love to die A few days later Therese grew worse and on July thirty she received Extreme Unction Radiant with delight the little Victim of Love said to us The door of my dark prison is ajar I am steeped in joy especially since our Father Superior has assured me that to day my soul is like unto that of a little child after Baptism No doubt she thought she was quickly to join the white robed band of the Holy Innocents She little knew that two long months of martyrdom had still to run their course Dear Mother she said I entreat you give me leave to die Let me offer my life for such and such an intention naming it to the Prioress And when the permission was refused she replied Well I know that just at this moment Our Lord has such a longing for a tiny bunch of grapes which no one will give Him that He will perforce have to come and steal it I do not ask anything this would be to stray from my path of self surrender I only beseech Our Lady to remind her Jesus of the title of Thief which He takes to Himself in the Gospels so that He may not forget to come and carry me away One day Soeur Therese took an ear of corn from a sheaf they had brought her It was so laden with grain that it bent on its stalk and after gazing upon it for some time she said to the Mother Prioress Mother that ear of corn is the image of my soul God has loaded it with graces for me and for many others And it is my dearest wish ever to bend beneath the weight of God s gifts acknowledging that all comes from Him She was right Her soul was indeed laden with graces and it was easy to discern the Spirit of God speaking His praises out of the mouth of that innocent child Had not this Spirit of Truth already dictated these words to the great Teresa of Avila Let those souls who have reached to perfect union with God hold themselves in high esteem with a humble and holy presumption Let them keep unceasingly before their eyes the remembrance of the good things they have received and beware of the thought that they are practising humility in not recognising the gifts of God Is it not clear that the constant remembrance of gifts bestowed serves to increase the love of the giver How can he who ignores the riches he possesses spend them generously upon others But the above was not the only occasion on which the little Therese of Lisieux eight gave utterance to words that proved prophetic In the month of April eighteen ninety five while she was still in excellent health she said in confidence to one of the older nuns I shall die soon I do not say that it will be in a few months but in two or three years at most I know it because of what is taking place in my soul The novices betrayed surprise when she read their inmost thoughts This is my secret she said to them I never reprimand you without first invoking Our Blessed Lady and asking her to inspire me as to what will be most for your good and I am often astonished myself at the things I teach you At such times I feel that I make no mistake and that it is Jesus Who speak by my lips During her illness one of her sisters had experienced some moments of acute distress amounting almost to discouragement at the thought of the inevitable parting Immediately afterwards she went to the Infirmary but was careful not to let any sign of grief be seen What was her surprise when Therese in a sad and serious tone thus addressed her We ought not to weep like those who have no hope One of the Mothers having come to visit her did her a trifling service How happy I should be thought the Mother if this Angel would only say I will repay you in Heaven At that instant Soeur Therese turning to her said Mother I will repay you in Heaven But more surprising than all was her consciousness of the mission for which Our Lord had destined her The veil which hides the future seemed lifted and more than once she revealed to us its secrets in prophecies which have already been realised I have never given the Good God aught but love it is with Love He will repay AFTER MY DEATH I WILL LET FALL A SHOWER OF ROSES At another time she interrupted a Sister who was speaking to her of the happiness of Heaven by the sublime words It is not that which attracts me And what attracts you asked the other Oh it is Love To love to be beloved and to return to earth to win love for our Love One evening she welcomed Mother Agnes of Jesus with an extraordinary expression of joy Mother she said some notes from a concert far away have just reached my ears and have made me think that soon I shall be listening to the wondrous melodies of Paradise The thought however gave me but a moment s joy one hope alone makes my heart beat fast the Love that I shall receive and the Love I shall be able to give I feel that my mission is soon to begin my mission to make others love God as I love Him to each souls my little way I WILL SPEND MY HEAVEN IN DOING GOOD UPON EARTH Nor is this impossible since from the very heart of the Beatific Vision the Angels keep watch over us No there can be no rest for me until the end of the world But when the Angel shall have said Time is no more then I shall rest then I shall be able to rejoice because the number of the elect will be complete And what is this little way that you would teach to souls IT IS THE WAY OF SPIRITUAL CHILDHOOD THE WAY OF TRUST AND ABSOLUTE SELF SURRENDER I want to point out to them the means that I have always found so perfectly successful to tell them that there is but one thing to do here below we must offer Jesus the flowers of little sacrifices and win Him by a caress That is how I have won Him and that is why I shall be made so welcome Should I guide you wrongly by my little way of love she said to a novice do not fear that I shall allow you to continue therein I should soon come back to the earth and tell you to take another road If I do not return then believe in the truth of these my words We can never have too much confidence in the Good God He is so mighty so merciful As we hope in Him so shall we receive On the eve of the feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel a novice said to her I think that if you were to die to morrow after Holy Communion I should be quite consoled it would be such a beautiful death Therese answered quickly Die after Holy Communion Upon a great feast Nay not so In my little way everything is most ordinary all that I do little souls must be able to do likewise And to one of her missionary brothers she wrote What draws me to my Heavenly Home is the summons of my Lord together with the hope that at length I shall love Him as my heart desires and shall be able to make Him loved by a multitude of souls who will bless Him throughout eternity And in another letter to China I trust fully that I shall not remain idle in Heaven my desire is to continue my work for the Church and for souls I ask this of God and I am convinced He will hear my prayer You see that if I quit the battle field so soon it is not from a selfish desire of repose For a long time now suffering has been my Heaven here upon earth and I can hardly conceive how I shall become acclimatised to a land where joy is unmixed with sorrow Jesus will certainly have to work a complete change in my soul else I could never support the ecstasies of Paradise It was quite true suffering had become her Heaven upon earth she welcomed it as we do happiness When I suffer much she would say when something painful or disagreeable happens to me instead of a melancholy look I answer by a smile At first I did not always succeed but now it has become a habit which I am glad to have acquired A certain Sister entertained doubts concerning the patience of Therese One day during a visit she remarked that the invalid s face wore an expression of unearthly joy and she sought to know the reason It is because the pain is so acute just now Therese replied I have always forced myself to love suffering and to give it a glad welcome Why are you so bright this morning asked Mother Agnes of Jesus Because of two little crosses Nothing gives me little joys like little crosses And another time You have had many trials to day Yes but I love them I love all the Good God sends me Your sufferings are terrible No they are not terrible can a little Victim of Love find anything terrible that is sent by her Spouse Each moment He sends me what I am able to bear and nothing more and if He increase the pain my strength is increased as well But I could never ask for greater sufferings I am too little a soul They would then be of my own choice I should have to bear them all without Him and I have never been able to do anything when left to myself Thus spoke that wise and prudent Virgin on her deathbed and her lamp filled to the brim with the oil of virtue burned brightly to the end If as the Holy Spirit reminds us in the Book of Proverbs A man s doctrine is proved by his patience nine those who have heard her may well believe in her doctrine for she has proved it by a patience no test could overcome At each visit the doctor expressed his admiration If only you knew what she has to endure I have never seen any one suffer so intensely with such a look of supernatural joy I shall not be able to cure her she was not made for this earth In view of her extreme weakness he ordered some strengthening remedies Therese was at first distressed because of their cost but she afterwards admitted I am no longer troubled at having to take those expensive remedies for I have read that when they were given to saint Gertrude she was gladdened by the thought that it would redound to the good of our benefactors since Our Lord Himself has said Whatever you do to the least of My little ones you do unto Me ten I am convinced that medicines are powerless to cure me she added but I have made a covenant with God that the poor missionaries who have neither time nor means to take care of themselves may profit thereby She was much moved by the constant gifts of flowers made to her by her friends outside the Convent and again by the visits of a sweet little redbreast that loved to play about her bed She saw in these things the Hand of God Mother I feel deeply the many touching proofs of God s Love for me I am laden with them nevertheless I continue in the deepest gloom I suffer much very much and yet my state is one of profound peace All my longings have been realised I am full of confidence Shortly afterwards she told me this touching little incident One evening during the Great Silence the Infirmarian brought me a hot water bottle for my feet and put tincture of iodine on my chest I was in a burning fever and parched with thirst and whilst submitting to these remedies I could not help saying to Our Lord My Jesus Thou seest I am already burning and they have brought me more heat and fire Oh if they had brought me even half a glass of water what a comfort it would have been My Jesus Thy little child is so thirsty But she is glad to have this opportunity of resembling Thee more closely and thus helping Thee to save souls The Infirmarian soon left me and I did not expect to see her again until the following morning What was my surprise when she returned a few minutes later with a refreshing drink It has just struck me that you may be thirsty she said so I shall bring you something every evening I looked at her astounded and when I was once more alone I melted into tears Oh how good Jesus is how tender and loving How easy it is to reach His Heart On September six the little Spouse of Jesus received a touching proof of the loving thought of His Sacred Heart She had frequently expressed a wish to possess a relic of her special patron the Venerable Theophane Venard but as her desire was not realised she said no more She was quite overcome therefore when Mother Prioress brought her the longed for treasure received that very day She kissed it repeatedly and would not consent to part with it It may be asked why she was so devoted to this young Martyr She herself explained the reason in an affectionate interview with her own sisters Theophane Venard is a little saint his life was not marked by anything extraordinary He had an ardent devotion to Our Immaculate Mother and a tender love of his own family Dwelling on these words she added And I too love my family with a tender love I fail to understand those Saints who do not share my feelings As a parting gift I have copied for you some passages from his last letters home His soul and mine have many points of resemblance and his words do but re echo my thoughts We give here a copy of that letter which one might have believed was composed by Therese herself I can find nothing on earth that can make me truly happy the desires of my heart are too vast and nothing of what the world calls happiness can satisfy it Time for me will soon be no more my thoughts are fixed on Eternity My heart is full of peace like a tranquil lake or a cloudless sky I do not regret this life on earth I thirst for the waters of Life Eternal Yet a little while and my soul will have quitted this earth will have finished her exile will have ended her combat I go to Heaven I am about to enter the Abode of the Blessed to see what the eye hath never seen to hear what the ear hath never heard to enjoy those things the heart of man hath not conceived I have reached the hour so coveted by us all It is indeed true that Our Lord chooses the little ones to confound the great ones of this earth I do not rely upon my own strength but upon Him Who on the Cross vanquished the powers of hell I am a spring flower which the Divine Master culls for His pleasure We are all flowers planted on this earth and God will gather us in His own good time some sooner some later I little flower of one day am the first to be gathered But we shall meet again in Paradise where lasting joy will be our portion Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus using the words of the angelic martyr Theophane Venard Toward the end of September when something was repeated to her that had been said at recreation concerning the responsibility of those who have care of souls she seemed to revive a little and gave utterance to these beautiful words To him that is little mercy is granted eleven It is possible to remain little even in the most responsible position and is it not written that at the last day the Lord will arise to save the meek and lowly ones of the earth twelve He does not say to judge but to save As time went on the tide of suffering rose higher and higher and she became so weak that she was unable to make the slightest movement without assistance Even to hear anyone whisper increased her discomfort and the fever and oppression were so extreme that it was with the greatest difficulty she was able to articulate a word And yet a sweet smile was always on her lips Her only fear was lest she should give her Sisters any extra trouble and until two days before her death she would never allow any one to remain with her during the night However in spite of her entreaties the Infirmarian would visit her from time to time On one occasion she found Therese with hands joined and eyes raised to Heaven What are you doing she asked you ought to try and go to sleep I cannot Sister I am suffering too much so I am praying And what do you say to Jesus I say nothing I only love Him Oh how good God is she sometimes exclaimed Truly He must be very good to give me strength to bear all I have to suffer One day she said to the Mother Prioress Mother I would like to make known to you the state of my soul but I cannot I feel too much overcome just now In the evening Therese sent her these lines written in pencil with a trembling hand O my God how good Thou art to the little Victim of Thy Merciful Love Now even when Thou joinest these bodily pains to those of my soul I cannot bring myself to say The anguish of death hath encompassed me thirteen I rather cry out in my gratitude I have gone down into the valley of the shadow of death but I fear no evil because Thou O Lord art with me fourteen Her little Mother said to her Some think that you are afraid of death That may easily come to pass she answered I do not rely on my own feelings for I know how frail I am It will be time enough to bear that cross if it comes meantime I wish to rejoice in my present happiness When the Chaplain asked me if I was resigned to die I answered Father I need rather to be resigned to live I feel nothing but joy at the thought of death Do not be troubled dear Mother if I suffer much and show no sign of happiness at the end Did not Our Lord Himself die a Victim of Love and see how great was His Agony At last dawned the eternal day It was Thursday September thirty eighteen ninety seven In the morning the sweet Victim her eyes fixed on Our Lady s statue spoke thus of her last night on earth Oh with what fervour I have prayed to her And yet it has been pure agony without a ray of consolation Earth s air is failing me when shall I breathe the air of Heaven For weeks she had been unable to raise herself in bed but at half past two in the afternoon she sat up and exclaimed Dear Mother the chalice is full to overflowing I could never have believed that it was possible to suffer so intensely I can only explain it by my extreme desire to save souls And a little while after Yes all that I have written about my thirst for suffering is really true I do not regret having surrendered myself to Love She repeated these last words several times A little later she added Mother prepare me to die well The good Mother Prioress encouraged her with these words My child you are quite ready to appear before God for you have always understood the virtue of humility Then in striking words Therese bore witness to herself Yes I feel it my soul has ever sought the truth I have understood humility of heart At half past four her agony began the agony of this Victim of Divine Love When the Community gathered round her she thanked them with the sweetest smile and then completely given over to love and suffering the Crucifix clasped in her failing hands she entered on the final combat The sweat of death lay heavy on her brow she trembled but as a pilot when close to harbour is not dismayed by the fury of the storm so this soul strong in faith saw close at hand the beacon lights of Heaven and valiantly put forth every effort to reach the shore As the convent bells rang the evening Angelus she fixed an inexpressible look upon the statue of the Immaculate Virgin the Star of the Sea Was it not the moment to repeat her beautiful prayer O thou who camest to smile on me in the morn of my life come once again and smile Mother for now it is eventide fifteen A few minutes after seven turning to the Prioress the poor little Martyr asked Mother is it not the agony am I not going to die Yes my child it is the agony but Jesus perhaps wills that it be prolonged for some hours In a sweet and plaintive voice she replied Ah very well then very well I do not wish to suffer less Then looking at her crucifix Oh I love Him My God I love Thee These were her last words She had scarcely uttered them when to our great surprise she sank down quite suddenly her head inclined a little to the right in the attitude of the Virgin Martyrs offering themselves to the sword or rather as a Victim of Love awaiting from the Divine Archer the fiery shaft by which she longs to die Suddenly she raised herself as though called by a mysterious voice and opening her eyes which shone with unutterable happiness and peace fixed her gaze a little above the statue of Our Lady Thus she remained for about the space of a Credo when her blessed soul now become the prey of the Divine Eagle was borne away to the heights of Heaven A few days before her death this little Saint had said The death of Love which I so much desire is that of Jesus upon the Cross Her prayer was fully granted Darkness enveloped her and her soul was steeped in anguish And yet may we not apply to her also that sublime prophecy of saint John of the Cross referring to souls consumed by the fire of Divine Love They die Victims of the onslaughts of Love in raptured ecstasies like the swan whose song grows sweeter as death draws nigh Wherefore the Psalmist declared Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His Saints sixteen For then it is that the rivers of love burst forth from the soul and are whelmed in the Ocean of Divine Love No sooner had her spotless soul taken its flight than the joy of that last rapture imprinted itself on her brow and a radiant smile illumined her face We placed a palm branch in her hand and the lilies and roses that adorned her in death were figures of her white robe of baptism made red by her Martyrdom of Love On the Saturday and Sunday a large crowd passed before the grating of the nuns chapel to gaze on the mortal remains of the Little Flower of Jesus Hundreds of medals and rosaries were brought to touch the Little Queen as she lay in the triumphant beauty of her last sleep On October four the day of the funeral there gathered in the Chapel of the Carmel a goodly company of Priests The honour was surely due to one who had prayed so earnestly for those called to that sacred office After a last solemn blessing this grain of priceless wheat was cast into the furrow by the hands of Holy Mother Church Who shall tell how many ripened ears have sprung forth since how many the sheaves that are yet to come Amen amen I say to you unless the grain of wheat

of saint Antony of Padua recognized in Soeur Therese an heroic soul filled with holiness and capable of becoming one day an excellent Prioress With this end in view she trained her with a strictness for which the young Saint was most grateful In the arms of Mother Mary of Gonzaga the Little Flower of Jesus was welcomed to the Carmel and in those arms she died happy she declared not to have in that hour as Superioress her little Mother in order the better to exercise her spirit of faith in authority Ed three As will be remembered this was Marie her eldest sister Ed four The Blessed Theophane Venard was born at saint Loup in the diocese of Poitiers on the Feast of the Presentation of Our Lady Nov twenty one eighteen twenty nine He was martyred at Kecho Tong King on the Feast of the Presentation of Our Lord Feb two eighteen sixty one at the age of thirty two A long and delightful correspondence with his family begun in his college days and completed from his cage at Kecho reveals a kinship of poesy as well as of sanctity and of the love of home between the two spring flowers The beauty of his soul was so visible in his boyish face that he was spared all torture during his two months in the cage In nineteen oh nine the year in which Therese became Servant of God by the commencement of the Episcopal Process her patron received the honours of Beatification Another child of France Joan its Martyr Maid whose praises have been sung in affectionate verse by the Saints of saint Loup and Lisieux was beatified that same year Ed five An allusion to the obituary notice sent to each of the French Carmels when a Carmelite nun dies in that country In the case of those who die in the odour of sanctity these notices sometimes run to considerable length Four notices issued from the Carmel of Lisieux are of great interest to the clients of Soeur Therese and are in course of publication at the Orphans Press Rochdale those of the Carmel s saintly Foundress Mother

interesting of all the long sketch partly autobiographical of Mother Mary of saint Angelus Marie Ange the trophy of Therese brought by her intercession to the Carmel in nineteen oh two where the writer made her acquaintance in the following spring she became Prioress in nineteen oh eight dying eighteen months later in the odour of sanctity aged only twenty eight Ed six Cf Job thirteen fifteen

And at Gallipoli on the occasion of her celebrated apparition in the Carmel there when the Prioress taking her to be saint Teresa of Avila addressed her as our holy Mother the visitor adopting her then official title replied Nay I am not our holy Mother I am the Servant of God Soeur Therese of Lisieux This her own name of Soeur Therese has been retained in the present edition unless where it was advisable to set down her name in full Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and of the Holy Face The name of the Little Flower borrowed by her from the Blessed Theophane Venard and used so extensively

hundred sixteen fifteen seventeen John twelve twenty four twenty five COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES OF SOEUR THERESE THE LITTLE FLOWER OF JESUS Most of what follows has been gathered from the conversations of Soeur Therese with her novices Her advice cannot but prove helpful to souls within the cloister and likewise to many in the world who may be attracted by her simple and easy little way to God One of the novices greatly discouraged at the thought of her imperfections tells us that her mistress spoke to her as follows You make me think of a little child that is learning to stand but does not yet know how to walk In his desire to reach the top of the stairs to find his mother he lifts his little foot to climb the first step It is all in vain and at each renewed effort he falls Well be like that little child Always keep lifting your foot to climb the ladder of holiness and do not imagine that you can mount even the first step All God asks of you is good will From the top of the ladder He looks lovingly upon you and soon touched by your fruitless efforts He will Himself come down and taking you in His Arms will carry you to His Kingdom never again to leave Him But should you cease to raise your foot you will be left for long on the earth The only way to advance rapidly in the path of love is to remain always very little That is what I did and now I can sing with our holy Father saint John of the Cross Then I abased myself so low so very low That I ascended to such heights such heights indeed That I did overtake the prey I chased Under a temptation which seemed to me irresistible I said to her This time I cannot surmount it She replied Why seek to surmount it Rather pass beneath It is all well for great souls to soar above the clouds when the storm rages we have simply to suffer the showers What does it matter if we get wet We shall dry ourselves in the sunshine of love It recalls a little incident of my childhood One day a horse was standing in front of the garden gate and preventing us from getting through My companions talked to him and tried to make him move off but while they were still talking I quietly slipped between his legs Such is the advantage of remaining small Our Lord said to the mother of the sons of Zebedee To sit on my right or left hand is for them for whom it is prepared by my Father one I imagine that these chosen places which have been refused alike to great Saints and Martyrs will be reserved for little children and did not David foretell it when he said that the little Benjamin will preside amidst the assemblies two of the Saints You are wrong to find fault with this thing and with that or to try and make everyone see things as you see them We desire to be as little children and little children do not know what is best to them all seems right Let us imitate their ways Besides there is no merit in doing what reason dictates My patrons and my special favourites in Heaven are those who so to speak stole it such as the Holy Innocents and the Good Thief The great Saints won it by their works I wish to be like the thieves and to win it by stratagem a stratagem of love which will open its gates both to me and to poor sinners In the Book of Proverbs the Holy Ghost encourages me for He says Come to me little one to learn subtlety three What would you do if you could begin over again your religious life I think I should do as I have already done Then you do not share the feeling of the hermit who said While a quarter of an hour or even a breath of life still remains to me I shall fear the fires of hell even though I should have spent long years in penance No I do not share that fear I am too small Little children are not damned You are ever seeking to be as little children are but tell us what must be done to obtain that childlike spirit Remaining little what does it mean Remaining little means to recognise one s nothingness to await everything from the Goodness of God to avoid being too much troubled at our faults finally not to worry over amassing spiritual riches not to be solicitous about anything Even amongst the poor while a child is still small he is given what is necessary but once he is grown up his father will no longer feed him and tells him to seek work and support himself Well it was to avoid hearing this that I have never wished to grow up for I feel incapable of earning my livelihood which is Life Eternal In imitation of our saintly Mistress I also wished never to grow up she called me therefore the little one and during a retreat she wrote to me the following notes Do not fear to tell Jesus that you love him even though you may not feel that love In this way you will compel Him to come to your aid and to carry you like a little child who is too weak to walk It is indeed a great source of trial when everything looks black but this does not depend entirely on yourself Do all in your power to detach your heart from earthly cares especially from creatures then be assured Our Lord will do the rest He could not permit you to fall into the abyss Be comforted little one In Heaven everything will no longer look black but dazzling white There all will be clothed in the Divine radiance of Our Spouse the Lily of the Valley Together we will follow Him whithersoever He goeth Meantime we must make good use of this life s brief day Let us give Our Lord pleasure let us by self sacrifice give Him souls Above all let us be little so little that everyone might tread us underfoot without our even seeming to suffer pain I am not surprised at the failures of the little one she forgets that in her role of missionary and warrior she ought to forgo all childish consolations It is wrong to pass one s time in fretting instead of sleeping on the Heart of Jesus Should the little one fear the dark of the night or complain at not seeing Him who carries her let her shut her eyes It is the one sacrifice God asks By remaining thus the dark will cease to terrify because she will not see it and before long peace if not joy will re enter her soul To help me accept a humiliation she confided to me what follows If I had not been received into the Carmel I would have entered a Refuge and lived there unknown and despised among the poor penitents My joy would have been to pass for one and I would have become an apostle among my companions telling them my thoughts on the Infinite Mercy of God But how could you have hidden your innocence from your Confessor I would have told him that while still in the world I made a general confession and that it was forbidden me to repeat it Oh When I think of all I have to acquire Or rather to lose It is Jesus Who takes upon Himself to fill your soul according as you rid it of imperfections I see clearly that you are mistaking the road and that you will never arrive at the end of your journey You want to climb the mountain whereas God wishes you to descend it He is awaiting you in the fruitful valley of humility To me it seems that humility is truth I do not know whether I am humble but I do know that I see the truth in all things Indeed you are a Saint No I am not a Saint I have never wrought the works of a Saint I am but a tiny soul whom Almighty God has loaded with His favours The truth of what I say will be made known to you in Heaven But have you not always been faithful to those favours Yes from the age of three I have never refused our Good God anything Still I cannot glorify myself See how this evening the tree tops are gilded by the setting sun So likewise my soul appears to you all shining and golden because it is exposed to the rays of Love But should the Divine Sun no longer shine thereon it would instantly be sunk in gloom We too would like to become all golden what must we do You must practise the little virtues This is sometimes difficult but God never refuses the first grace courage for self conquest and if the soul correspond to that grace she at once finds herself in God s sunlight The praise given to Judith has always struck me Thou hast done manfully and thy heart has been strengthened four In the onset we must act with courage By this means the heart gains strength and victory follows victory In conformity with the Rule Soeur Therese never raised her eyes in the refectory and as I found great difficulty in this observance she composed for me the following prayer It reveals her exceeding humility because in it she asked a grace of which I alone stood in need O Jesus in honour and in imitation of the example Thou gavest in the house of Herod Thy two little Spouses resolve to keep their eyes cast down in the refectory When that impious king scoffed at Thee O Infinite Beauty no complaint came from Thy Lips Thou didst not even deign to fix on him Thy Adorable Eyes He was not worthy of the favour but we who are Thy Spouses we desire to draw Thy Divine Gaze upon ourselves As often as we refrain from raising our eyes we beg Thee to reward us by a glance of love and we even dare ask Thee not to refuse this sweet glance when we fail in our self control for we will humble ourselves most sincerely before Thee I confided to her that I made no progress and that consequently I had lost heart Up to the age of fourteen she said I practised virtue without tasting its sweetness I desired suffering but I did not think of making it my joy that grace was vouchsafed me later My soul was like a beautiful tree the flowers of which had scarcely opened when they fell Offer to God the sacrifice of never gathering any fruit If He will that throughout your whole life you should feel a repugnance to suffering and humiliation if He permit that all the flowers of your desires and of your good will should fall to the ground without any fruit appearing do not worry At the hour of death in the twinkling of an eye He will cause fair fruits to ripen on the tree of your soul We read in the Book of Ecclesiasticus There is an inactive man that wanteth help is very weak in ability and full of poverty yet the Eye of God hath looked upon him for good and hath lifted him up from his low estate and hath exalted his head and many have wondered at him and have glorified God Trust in God and stay in thy place For it is easy in the Eyes of God on a sudden to make the poor man rich The blessing of God maketh haste to reward the just and in a swift hour His blessing beareth fruit five But if I fall I shall always be found imperfect whereas you are looked upon as holy That is perhaps because I have never desired to be considered so But that you should be found imperfect is just what is best Here is your harvest To believe oneself imperfect and others perfect this is true happiness Should earthly creatures think you devoid of holiness they rob you of nothing and you are none the poorer it is they who lose For is there anything more sweet than the inward joy of thinking well of our neighbour As for myself I am glad and rejoice not only when I am looked upon as imperfect but above all when I feel that it is true Compliments on the contrary do but displease me God has a special love for you since He entrusts souls to your care That makes no difference and I am really only what I am in His Eyes It is not because He wills me to be His interpreter among you that He loves me more rather He makes me your little handmaid It is for you and not for myself that He has bestowed upon me those charms and those virtues which you see I often compare myself to a little bowl filled by God with good things All the kittens come to eat from it and they sometimes quarrel as to which will have the largest share But the Holy Child Jesus keeps a sharp watch I am willing you should feed from My little bowl He says but take heed lest you upset and break it In truth there is no great danger because I am already on the ground Not so with Prioresses set as they are on tables they run far more risks Honours are always dangerous What poisonous food is served daily to those in high positions What deadly fumes of incense A soul must be well detached from herself to pass unscathed through it all It is a consolation for you to do good and to procure the Glory of God I wish I were equally favoured What if God does make use of me rather than of another to procure His Glory Provided His Kingdom be established among souls the instrument matters not Besides He has no need of anyone Some time ago I was watching the flicker almost invisible of a tiny night light when one of the Sisters drew near and lighting her candle in the dying flame passed it round to light all those of the Community Who dare glory in his own good works I reflected From one faint spark such as this it would be possible to set the whole earth on fire We often think we receive graces and are divinely illumined by means of brilliant candles But from whence comes their light From the prayers perhaps of some humble hidden soul whose inward shining is not apparent to human eyes a soul of unrecognised virtue and in her own sight of little value a dying flame What mysteries will yet be unveiled to us I have often thought that perhaps I owe all the graces with which I am laden to some little soul whom I shall know only in Heaven It is God s Will that in this world souls shall dispense to each other by prayer the treasures of Heaven in order that when they reach their Everlasting Home they may love one another with grateful hearts and with an affection far in excess of that which reigns in the most perfect family on earth There no looks of indifference will meet us because all the Saints will be mutually indebted to each other No envious glances will be cast for the happiness of each one of the Blessed will be the happiness of all With the Doctors of the Church we shall be like unto Doctors with the Martyrs like unto Martyrs with the Virgins like unto Virgins and just as the members of one family are proud one of the other so without the least jealousy shall we take pride in our brothers and sisters When we see the glory of the great Saints and know that through the secret working of Providence we have contributed to it who knows whether the joy we shall feel will not be as intense perhaps sweeter than the happiness they themselves possess And do you not think that the great Saints on their side seeing what they owe to all little souls will love them with a love beyond compare The friendships of Paradise will be both sweet and full of surprise of this I am certain The familiar friend of an Apostle or of a great Doctor of the Church may be a shepherd boy and a simple little child may be united in closest intimacy with a Patriarch I long to enter that Kingdom of Love Believe me the writing of pious books the composing of the sublimest poetry all that does not equal the smallest act of self denial When however our inability to do good gives us pain our only resource is to offer up the good works of others and in this lies the benefit of the Communion of Saints Recall to mind that beautiful verse of the canticle of our Father saint John of the Cross Return my dove See on the height The wounded Hart To whom refreshment brings The breeze stirred by thy wings Thus the Spouse the wounded Hart is not attracted by the height but only by the breeze from the pinions of the dove a breeze which one single stroke of wing is sufficient to create The one thing which is not open to envy is the lowest place Here alone therefore there is neither vanity nor affliction of spirit Yet the way of a man is not his own six and sometimes we find ourselves wishing for what dazzles In that hour let us in all humility take our place among the imperfect and look upon ourselves as little souls who at every instant need to be upheld by the goodness of God From the moment He sees us fully convinced of our nothingness and hears us cry out My foot stumbles Lord but Thy Mercy is my strength seven He reaches out His Hand to us But should we attempt great things even under pretext of zeal He deserts us It suffices therefore to humble ourselves to bear with meekness our imperfections Herein lies for us true holiness One day I was complaining of being more tired than my Sisters for besides the ordinary duties I had other work unknown to the rest Soeur Therese replied I should like always to see you a brave soldier never grumblng at hardships but considering the wounds of your companions as most serious and your own as mere scratches You feel this fatigue so much because no one is aware of it Now the Blessed Margaret Mary at the time she had two whitlows confessed that she really suffered from the hidden one only The other which she was unable to hide excited her Sisters pity and made her an object of compassion This is indeed a very natural feeling the desire that people should know of our aches and pains but in giving way to it we play the coward When we are guilty of a fault we must never attribute it to some physical cause such as illness or the weather We must ascribe it to our own imperfections without being discouraged thereby Occasions do not make a man frail but show what he is eight God did not permit that our Mother should tell me to write my poems as soon as I had composed them and fearful of committing a sin against poverty I would not ask leave I had therefore to wait for some free time and at eight o clock in the evening I often found it extremely difficult to remember what I had composed in the morning True these trifles are a species of martyrdom but we must be careful not to alleviate the pain of the martyrdom by permitting ourselves or securing permission for a thousand and one things which would tend to make the religious life both comfortable and agreeable One day as I was in tears Soeur Therese told me to avoid the habit of allowing others to see the trifles that worried me adding that nothing made community life more trying than unevenness of temper You are indeed right I answered such was my own thought Henceforward my tears will be for God alone I shall confide my worries to One Who will understand and console me Tears for God she promptly replied that must not be Far less to Him than to creatures ought you to show a mournful face Our Divine Master has only our monasteries where He may obtain some solace for His Heart He comes to us in search of rest to forget the unceasing complaints of His friends in the world who instead of appreciating the value of the Cross receive it far more often with moans and tears Would you then be as the mediocre souls Frankly this is not disinterested love It is for us to console our Lord and not for Him to console us His Heart is so tender that if you cry He will dry your tears but thereafter He will go away sad since you did not suffer Him to repose tranquilly within you Our Lord loves the glad of heart the children that greet Him with a smile When will you learn to hide your troubles from Him or to tell Him gaily that you are happy to suffer for Him The face is the mirror of the soul she said once and yours like that of a contented little child should always be calm and serene Even when alone be cheerful remembering always that you are in the sight of the Angels I was anxious she should congratulate me on what in my eyes was an heroic act of virtue but she said to me Compare this little act of virtue with what our Lord has the right to expect of you Rather should you humble yourself for having lost so many opportunities of proving your love Little satisfied with this answer I awaited an opportunity of finding out how Soeur Therese herself would act under trial and the occasion was not long in coming Reverend Mother asked us to do some extremely tiring work which bristled with difficulties and on purpose I made it still more difficult for our Mistress Not for one second however could I detect her in fault and heedless of the fatigue involved she remained gracious and amiable eager throughout to help others at her own expense At last I could resist no longer and I confessed to her what my thoughts had been How comes it I said that you can be so patient You are ever the same calm and full of joy It was not always the case with me she replied but since I have abandoned all thought of self seeking I live the happiest life possible Our dear Mistress used to say that during recreation more than at any other time we should find opportunities for practising virtue If your desire be to draw great profit do not go with the idea of procuring relaxation but rather with the intention of entertaining others and practising complete detachment from self Thus for instance if you are telling one of the Sisters something you think entertaining and she should interrupt to tell you something else show yourself interested even though in reality her story may not interest you in the least Be careful also not to try to resume what you were saying In this way you will leave recreation filled with a great interior peace and endowed with fresh strength for the practice of virtue because you have not sought to please yourself but others If only we could realise what we gain by self denial in all things You realise it certainly for you have always practised self denial Yes I have forgotten myself and I have tried not to see myself in anything When some one knocks at our door or when we are rung for we must practise mortification and refrain from doing even another stitch before answering I have practised this myself and I assure you that it is a source of peace After this advice and according as occasion offered I promptly answered every summons One day during her illness she was witness of this and said At the hour of death you will be very happy to find this to your account You have just done something more glorious than if through clever diplomacy you had procured the good will of the Government for all religious communities and had been proclaimed throughout France as a second Judith Questioned as to her method of sanctifying meals she answered In the refectory we have but one thing to do perform a lowly action with lofty thoughts I confess that the sweetest aspirations of love often come to me in the refectory Sometimes I am brought to a standstill by the thought that were Our Lord in my place He would certainly partake of those same dishes which are served to me It is quite probable that during His lifetime He tasted of similar food He must have eaten bread and fruit Here are my little rubrics I imagine myself at Nazareth in the house of the Holy Family If for instance I am served with salad cold fish wine or anything pungent in taste I offer it to saint Joseph To our Blessed Lady I offer hot foods and ripe fruit and to the Infant Jesus our feast day fare especially rice and preserves Lastly when I am served a wretched dinner I say cheerfully To day my little one it is all for you Thus in many pretty ways she hid her mortifications One fast day however when our Reverend Mother ordered her some special food I found her seasoning it with wormwood because it was too much to her taste On another occasion I saw her drinking very slowly a most unpleasant medicine Make haste I said drink it off at once Oh no she answered must I not profit of these small opportunities for penance since the greater ones are forbidden me Toward the end of her life I learned that during her noviciate one of our Sisters when fastening the scapular for her ran the large pin through her shoulder and for hours she bore the pain with joy On another occasion she gave me proof of her interior mortification I had received a most interesting letter which was read aloud at recreation during her absence In the evening she expressed the wish to read it and I gave it to her Later on when she returned it I begged her to tell me what she thought of one of the points of the letter which I knew ought to have charmed her She seemed rather confused and after a pause she answered God asked of me the sacrifice of this letter because of the eagerness I displayed the other day so I have not read it When speaking to her of the mortifications of the Saints she remarked It was well that Our Lord warned us In My Father s House there are many mansions otherwise I would have told you nine For if every soul called to perfection were obliged to perform these austerities in order to enter Heaven He would have told us and we should have willingly undertaken them But He has declared that there are many mansions in His House If there are some for great souls for the Fathers of the Desert and for Martyrs of penance there must also be one for little children And in that one a place is kept for us if we but love Him dearly together with Our Father and the Spirit of Love While in the world I used on waking to think of all the pleasant or unpleasant things which might happen throughout the day and if I foresaw nothing but worries I got up with a heavy heart Now it is quite the reverse I think of the pains and of the sufferings awaiting me and I rise feeling all the more courageous and light of heart in proportion to the opportunities I foresee of proving my love for Our Lord and of gaining mother of souls as I am my children s livelihood Then I kiss my crucifix and laying it gently on my pillow I leave it there while I dress and I say My Jesus Thou hast toiled and wept enough during Thy three and thirty years on this miserable earth Rest Thee to day It is my turn to suffer and to fight One washing day I was sauntering towards the laundry and looking at the flowers as I passed Soeur Therese was following and quickly overtook me Is that she said quietly how people hurry themselves when they have children and are obliged to work to procure them food Do you know which are my Sundays and feast days They are the days on which God tries me the most I was distressed at my want of courage and Soeur Therese said to me You are complaining of what should be your greatest happiness If you fought only when you felt eagerness where would be your merit What does it matter even if you are devoid of courage provided you act as though you possessed it If you feel too lazy to pick up a bit of thread and yet do so for love of Jesus you acquire more merit than for a much nobler action done in a moment of fervour Instead of grieving be glad that by allowing you to feel your own weakness Our Lord is furnishing you with an opportunity of saving a greater number of souls I asked her whether Our Lord were not displeased at the sight of my many failings This was her answer Be comforted for He Whom you have chosen as your Spouse has every imaginable perfection but dare I say it He has one great infirmity too He is blind And there is a science about which He knows nothing addition These two great defects much to be deplored in an earthly bridegroom do but make ours infinitely more lovable Were it necessary that He should be clear sighted and familiar with the science of figures do you not think that confronted with our many sins He would send us back to our nothingness But His Love for us makes him actually blind If the greatest sinner on earth should repent at the moment of his death and draw His last breath in an act of love neither the many graces he had abused nor the multiplied crimes he had committed would stand in his way Our Lord would see nothing count nothing but the sinner s last prayer and without delay He would receive him into the arms of His Mercy But to make Him thus blind and to prevent Him doing the smallest sum of addition we must approach Him through His Heart on that side He is vulnerable and defenceless I had grieved her and had gone to ask her pardon If you but knew what I feel she exclaimed Never have I more clearly understood the love with which Jesus receives us when we seek His forgiveness If I His poor little creature feel so tenderly towards you when you come back to me what must pass through Our Lord s Divine Heart when we return to Him Far more quickly than I have just done will He blot out our sins from His memory Nay He will even love us more tenderly than before we fell I had an immense dread of the judgments of God and no argument of Soeur Therese could remove it One day I put to her the following objection It is often said to us that in God s sight the angels themselves are not pure How therefore can you expect me to be otherwise than filled with fear She replied There is but one means of compelling God not to judge us and it is to appear before Him empty handed And how can that be done It is quite simple lay nothing by spend your treasures as you gain them Were I to live to be eighty I should always be poor because I cannot economise All my earnings are immediately spent on the ransom of souls Were I to await the hour of death to offer my trifling coins for valuation Our Lord would not fail to discover in them some base metal and they would certainly have to be refined in Purgatory Is it not recorded of certain great Saints that on appearing before the Tribunal of God their hands laden with merit they have yet been sent to that place of expiation because in God s Eyes all our justice is unclean But I replied if God does not judge our good actions He will judge our bad ones Do not say that Our Lord is Justice itself and if He does not judge our good actions neither will He judge our bad ones It seems to me that for Victims of Love there will be no judgment God will rather hasten to reward with eternal delights His own Love which He will behold burning in their hearts To enjoy such a privilege would it suffice to repeat that Act of Oblation which you have composed Oh no words do not suffice To be a true Victim of Love we must surrender ourselves entirely Love will consume us only in the measure of our self surrender I was grieving bitterly over a fault I had committed Take your Crucifix she said and kiss it I kissed the Feet Is that how a child kisses its father Throw your arms at once round His Neck and kiss His Face When I had done so she continued That is not sufficient He must return your caress I had to press the Crucifix to both my cheeks whereupon she added Now all is forgiven I told her one day that if I must be reproached I preferred deserving it to being unjustly accused For my part she replied I prefer to be charged unjustly because having nothing to reproach myself with I offer gladly this little injustice to God Then humbling myself I think how easily I might have deserved the reproach The more you advance the fewer the combats or rather the more easy the victory because the good side of things will be more visible Then your soul will soar above creatures As for me I feel utterly indifferent to all accusations because I have learned the hollowness of human judgment She added further When misunderstood and judged unfavourably what benefit do we derive from defending ourselves Leave things as they are and say nothing It is so sweet to allow ourselves to be judged anyhow rightly or wrongly It is not written in the Gospel that Saint Mary Magdalen put forth excuses when charged by her sister with sitting idle at Our Lord s Feet She did not say Martha if you knew the happiness that is mine and if you heard the words that I hear you too would leave everything to share my joy and my repose No she preferred to keep silent Blessed silence which giveth such peace to the soul At a moment of temptation and struggle I received this note The just man shall correct me in mercy and shall reprove me but let not the oil of the sinner perfume my head ten It is only by the just that I can be either reproved or corrected because all my Sisters are pleasing to God It is less bitter to be rebuked by a sinner than by a just man but through compassion for sinners to obtain their conversion I beseech Thee O my God to permit that I may be well rebuked by those just souls who surround me I ask also that the oil of praise so sweet to our nature may not perfume my head that is to say my mind by making me believe that I possess virtues when I have merely performed a few good actions Jesus Thy Name is as oil poured out eleven and it is into this divine perfume that I desire wholly to plunge myself far from the gaze of mankind It is not playing the game to argue with a Sister that she is in the wrong even when it is true because we are not answerable for her conduct We must not be Justices of the peace but Angels of peace only You give yourselves up too much to what you are doing she used to say to us you worry about the future as though it were in your hands Are you much concerned at this moment as to what is happening in other Carmelite convents and whether the nuns there are busy or otherwise Does their work prevent you praying or meditating Well just in the same way you ought to detach yourselves from your own personal labours conscientiously spending on them the time prescribed but with perfect freedom of heart We read that the Israelites while building the walls of Jerusalem worked with one hand and held a sword in the other twelve This is an image of what we should do avoid being wholly absorbed in our work One Sunday Therese relates I was going toward the chestnut avenue full of rejoicing for it was spring time and I wanted to enjoy nature s beauties What a bitter disappointment My dear chestnuts had been pruned and the branches already covered with buds now lay on the ground On seeing this havoc and thinking that three years must elapse before it could be repaired my heart felt very sore But the grief did not last long If I were in another convent I reflected what would it matter to me if the chestnut trees of the Carmel at Lisieux were entirely cut down I will not worry about things that pass God shall be my all I will take my walks in the wooded groves of His Love whereon none dare lay hands A novice asked her Sisters to help her shake some blankets As they were somewhat liable to tear because of their worn condition she insisted rather sharply on their being handled with care What would you do said Therese to the impatient one if it were not your duty to mend these blankets There would be no thought of self in the matter and if you did call attention to the fact that they are easily torn it would be done in quite an impersonal way In all your actions you should avoid the least trace of self seeking Seeing one of our Sisters very much fatigued I said to Soeur Therese It grieves me to see people suffer especially those who are holy She instantly replied I do not feel as you do Saints who suffer never excite my pity I know they have strength to bear their sufferings and that through them they are giving great glory to God But I compassionate greatly those who are not Saints and who do not know how to profit by suffering They indeed awake my pity I would strain every nerve to help and comfort them Were I to live longer it is the office of Infirmarian that would most please me I would not ask for it but were it imposed through obedience I should consider myself highly favoured I think I should fulfill its duties with much affection always mindful of Our Lord s words I was sick and you visited Me thirteen The infirmary bell should be for you as heavenly music and you ought purposely to pass by the windows of the sick that it might be easy for them to summon you Consider yourself as a little slave whom everyone has the right to command Could you but see the Angels who from the heights of Heaven watch your combats in the arena They are awaiting the end of the fight to crown you and cover you with flowers You know that we claim to rank as little Martyrs but we must win our palms God does not despise these hidden struggles with ourselves so much richer in merit because they are unseen The patient man is better than the valiant and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh cities fourteen Through our little acts of charity practised in the dark as it were we obtain the conversion of the heathen help the missionaries and gain for them plentiful alms thus building both spiritual and material dwellings for Our Eucharistic God I had seen Mother Prioress showing as I thought more confidence and affection to one of our Sisters than she extended to me Expecting to win sympathy I told my trouble to Soeur Therese and great was my surprise when she put me the question Do you think you love our Mother very much Certainly otherwise I should be indifferent if others were preferred to me Well I shall prove that you are absolutely mistaken and that it is not our Mother that you love but yourself When we really love others we rejoice at their happiness and we make every sacrifice to procure it Therefore if you had this true disinterested affection and loved our Mother for her own sake you would be glad to see her find pleasure even at your expense and since you think she has less satisfaction in talking with you than with another Sister you ought not to grieve at being apparently neglected I was distressed at my many distractions during prayers I also have many she said but as soon as I am aware of them I pray for those people the thought of whom is diverting my attention and in this way they reap benefit from my distractions I accept all for the love of God even the wildest fancies that cross my mind I was regretting a pin which I had been asked for and which I had found most useful How rich you are said Therese you will never be happy The grotto of the Holy Child was in her charge and knowing that one of our Mothers greatly disliked perfumes she never put any sweet smelling flowers there not even a tiny violet This cost her many a real sacrifice One day just as she had placed a beautiful artificial rose at the foot of the statue the Mother called her Soeur Therese surmising that it was to bid her remove the rose was anxious to spare her any humiliation She therefore took the flower to the good Sister and forestalling all observations said Look Mother how well nature is imitated nowadays would you not think this rose had been freshly gathered from the garden There are moments she told us when we are so miserable within that there is nothing for it but to get away from ourselves At those times God does not oblige us to remain at home He even permits our own company to become distasteful to us in order that we may leave it Now I know no other means of exit save through the doorway of charitable works on a visit to Jesus and Mary When I picture the Holy Family the thought that does me most good is the simplicity of their home life Our Lady and saint Joseph were well aware that Jesus was God while at the same time great wonders were hidden from them and like us they lived by faith You have heard those words of the Gospel They understood not the word that He spoke unto them fifteen and those others no less mysterious His Father and Mother were wondering at those things which were spoken concerning Him sixteen They seemed to be learning something new for this word wondering implies a certain amount of surprise There is a verse in the Divine Office which I recite each day with reluctance I have inclined my heart to do Thy justifications for ever because of the reward seventeen I hasten to add in my heart My Jesus Thou knowest I do not serve Thee for sake of reward but solely out of love and a desire to win Thee souls In Heaven only shall we be in possession of the clear truth On earth even in matters of Holy Scripture our vision is dim It distresses me to see the differences in its translations and had I been a Priest I would have learned Hebrew so as to read the Word of God as He deigned to utter it in human speech Soeur Therese often spoke to me of a well known toy with which she had amused herself when a child This was the kaleidoscope shaped like a small telescope through which as it is made to revolve one perceives an endless variety of pretty coloured figures This toy she said excited my admiration and I wondered what could provide so charming a phenomenon when one day after a lengthy examination I found that it consisted simply of tiny bits of paper and cloth scattered inside A further examination revealed that there were three mirrors inside the tube and the problem was solved It became for me the illustration of a great truth So long as our actions even the most trivial remain within Love s kaleidoscope so long the Blessed Trinity figured by the three mirrors imparts to them a wonderful brightness and beauty The eye piece is Jesus Christ and He looking from outside through Himself into the kaleidoscope finds perfect all our works But should we leave that ineffable abode of Love He would see but the rags and chaff of unclean and worthless deeds I told Soeur Therese of the strange phenomena produced by magnetism on persons who surrender their will to the hypnotiser It seemed to interest her greatly and next day she said to me Your conversation yesterday did me so much good How I long to be hypnotised by Our Lord It was my waking thought and verily it was sweet to surrender Him my will I want Him to take possession of my faculties in such wise that my acts may no more be mine or human but Divine inspired and guided by the Spirit of Love Before my profession I received through my saintly Novice mistress a very special grace We had been washing all day I was worn out with fatigue and harassed with spiritual worries That night before meditation I wanted to speak to her but she dismissed me with the remark That is the bell for meditation and I have not time to console you besides I see plainly that it would be useless trouble For the present God wishes you to suffer alone I followed her to meditation so discouraged that for the first time I doubted of my vocation I should never be able to be a Carmelite The life was too hard I had been kneeling for some minutes when all at once in the midst of this interior struggle without having asked or even wished for peace I felt a sudden and extraordinary change of soul I no longer knew myself My vocation appeared to me both lovely and lovable I saw the sweetness and priceless value of suffering All the privations and fatigues of the religious life appeared to me infinitely preferable to worldly pleasures and I came away from my meditation completely transformed Next day I told my Mistress what had taken place and seeing she was deeply touched I begged to know the reason God is good she exclaimed Last evening you inspired me with such profound pity that I prayed incessantly for you at the beginning of meditation I besought Our Lord to bring you comfort to change your dispositions and show you the value of suffering He has indeed heard my prayers Being somewhat of a child in my ways the Holy Child to help me in the practice of virtue inspired me with the thought of amusing myself with Him and I chose the game of ninepins I imagined them of all sizes and colours representing the souls I wished to reach The ball was love In December eighteen ninety six the novices received for the benefit of the Foreign Missions various trifles towards a Christmas tree and at the bottom of the box containing them was a top a rare thing in a Carmelite convent My companions remarked What an ugly thing of what use will it be But I who knew the game caught hold of it exclaiming Nay what fun it will spin a whole day without stopping if it be well whipped and thereupon I spun it around to their great surprise Soeur Therese was quietly watching us and on Christmas night after midnight Mass I found in our cell the famous top with a delightful letter addressed as follows To My Beloved Little Spouse Player of Ninepins on the Mountain of Carmel Christmas Night eighteen ninety six MY BELOVED LITTLE SPOUSE I am well pleased with thee All the year round thou hast amused Me by playing at ninepins I was so overjoyed that the whole court of Angels was surprised and charmed Several little cherubs have asked me why I did not make them children Others wanted to know if the melody of their instruments were not more pleasing to me than thy joyous laugh when a ninepin fell at the stroke of thy love ball My answer to them was that they must not regret they are not children since one day they would play with thee in the meadows of Heaven I told them also that thy smiles were certainly more sweet to Me than their harmonies because these smiles were purchased by suffering and forgetfulness of self And now my cherished Spouse it is my turn to ask something of thee Thou wilt not refuse Me thou lovest Me too much Let us change the game Ninepins amuse me greatly but at present I should like to play at spinning a top and if thou dost consent thou shalt be the top I give thee one as a model Thou seest that it is ugly to look at and would be kicked aside by whosoever did not know the game But at the sight of it a child would leap for joy and shout What fun it will spin a whole day without stopping Although thou too art not attractive I the little Jesus love thee and beg of thee to keep always spinning to amuse Me True it needs a whip to make a top spin Then let thy Sisters supply the whip and be thou most grateful to those who shall make thee turn fastest When I shall have had plenty of fun I will bring thee to join Me here and our games shall be full of unalloyed delight Thy little Brother JESUS I had the habit of constantly crying about the merest trifles and this was a source of great pain to Soeur Therese One day a bright idea occurred to her taking a mussel shell from her painting table and holding my hands lest I should prevent her she gathered my tears in the shell and soon they were turned into merry laughter There she said from this onwards I permit you to cry as much as you like on condition that it is into the shell A week however before her death I spent a whole evening in tears at the thought of her fast approaching end She knew it and said You have been crying Was it into the shell I was unable to tell an untruth and my answer grieved her I am going to die she continued and I shall not be at rest about you unless you promise to follow faithfully my advice I consider it of the utmost importance for the good of your soul I promised what she asked begging leave however as a favour to be allowed to cry at her death But she answered why cry at my death Those tears will certainly be useless You will be bewailing my happiness Still I have pity on your weakness and for the first few days you have leave to cry though afterwards you must again take up the shell It has cost me some heroic efforts but I have been faithful I have kept the shell at hand and each time the wish to cry overcame me I laid hold of the pitiless thing However urgent the tears the trouble of passing it from one eye to the other so distracted my thoughts that before very long this ingenious method entirely cured me of my sensibility Owing to a fault which had caused Soeur Therese much pain but of which I had deeply repented I intended to deprive myself of Holy Communion I wrote to her of my resolution and this was her reply Little flower most dear to Jesus by this humiliation your roots are feeding upon the earth You must now open wide your petals or rather lift high your head so that the Manna of the Angels may like a divine dew come down to strengthen you and supply all your wants Good night poor little flower Ask of Jesus that all the prayers offered for my cure may serve to increase the fire which ought to consume me At the moment of Communion I sometimes liken my soul to that of a little child of three or four whose hair has been ruffled and clothes soiled at play This is a picture of what befalls me in my struggling with souls But Our Blessed Lady comes promptly to the rescue takes off my soiled pinafore and arranges my hair adorning it with a pretty ribbon or a simple flower Then I am quite nice and able without any shame to seat myself at the Banquet of Angels In the infirmary we scarcely waited for the end of her thanksgiving before seeking her advice At first this somewhat distressed her and she would make gentle reproaches but soon she yielded to us saying I must not wish for more rest than Our Lord When He withdrew into the desert after preaching the crowds would come and intrude upon His solitude Come then to me as much as you like I must die sword in hand the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God eighteen Advise us we said to her how to profit by our spiritual instructions Go for guidance with great simplicity not counting too much on help which may fail you at any moment You would then have to say with the Spouse in the Canticles The keepers took away my cloak and wounded me when I had a little passed by them I found Him whom my soul loveth nineteen If you ask with humility and with detachment after your Beloved the keepers will tell you More often you will find Jesus only when you have passed by all creatures Many times have I repeated this verse of the Spiritual Canticle of saint John of the Cross Messengers I pray no more Between us send who know not how To tell me what my spirit longs to know For they Thy charms who read For ever telling of a thousand more Make all my wounds to bleed While deeper then before Doth an I know not what my spirit grieve With stammerings vague and of all life bereave If supposing the impossible God Himself could not see my good actions I would not be troubled I love Him so much I would like to give Him joy without His knowing who gave When He sees the gift being made He is as it were obliged to make a return I should wish to spare Him the trouble Had I been rich I could never have seen a poor person hungry without giving him to eat This is my way also in the spiritual life There are many souls on the brink of hell and as my earnings come to hand they are scattered among these sinners The time has never yet been when I could say Now I am going to work for myself There are people who make the worst of everything As for me I do just the contrary I always see the good side of things and even if my portion be suffering without a glimmer of solace well I make it my joy Whatever has come from God s Hands has always pleased me even those things which have seemed to me less good and less beautiful than the gifts made to others When staying with my aunt while I was still a little girl I was given a certain book to read In one of the stories great praise was bestowed on a schoolmistress who by her tact escaped from every difficulty without hurting anyone s feelings Her method of saying to one person You are right and to another You are not wrong struck me particularly and as I read I reflected that I would not have acted in that way because we should always tell the truth And this I always do though I grant it is much more difficult It would be far less trouble for us when told of a worry to cast the blame on the absent Less trouble nevertheless I do just the contrary and if I am disliked it cannot be helped Let the novices not come to me if they do not want to learn the truth Before a reproof twenty bear fruit it must cost something and be free from the least trace of passion Kindness must not degenerate into weakness When we have had good reason for finding fault we must leave it and not allow ourselves to worry over having given pain To seek out the delinquent for the purpose of consoling her is to do more harm than good Left alone she is compelled to look beyond creatures and to turn to God she is forced to see her faults and to humble herself Otherwise she would become accustomed to expect consolation after a merited rebuke and would act like a spoilt child who stamps and screams knowing well that by this means its mother will be forced to return and dry its tears Let the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God be ever in your mouth and in your hearts twenty one If we find any one particular person disagreeable we should never be disheartened much less cease our endeavour to reform that soul We should wield the sword of the Spirit and so correct her faults Things should never be allowed to pass for the sake of our own ease We must carry on the war even when there is no hope of victory Success matters nothing and we must fight on and never complain I shall gain nothing from that soul she does not understand there is nothing for it but to abandon her That would be the act of a coward We must do our duty to the very end Formerly if any of my friends were in trouble and I did not succeed in consoling them when they came to see me I left the parlour quite heart broken Soon however Our Lord made me understand how incapable I was of bringing comfort to a soul and from that day I no longer grieved when my visitors went away downcast I confided to God the sufferings of those so dear to me and I felt sure that He heard my prayer At their next visit I learned that I was not mistaken After this experience I no longer worry when I have involuntarily given pain I simply ask Our Lord to make amends What do you think of all the graces that have been heaped upon you I think the Spirit of God breatheth where He will twenty two Mother she one day said to the Prioress were I unfaithful were I to commit even the smallest infidelity I feel that my soul would be plunged into the most terrible anguish and I should be unable to welcome death Mother Prioress evinced surprise at hearing her speak in this strain and she continued I am speaking of infidelity in the matter of pride If for example I were to say I have acquired such or such a virtue and I can practise it or again My God Thou knowest I love Thee too much to dwell on one single thought against faith straightway I should be assailed by the most dangerous temptations and should certainly yield To prevent this misfortune I have but to say humbly and from my heart My God I beseech Thee not to let me be unfaithful I understand clearly how saint Peter fell He placed too much reliance on his own ardent nature instead of leaning solely on the Divine strength Had he only said Lord give me strength to follow Thee unto death the grace would not have been refused him How is it Mother that Our Lord knowing what was about to happen did not say to him Ask of Me the strength to do what is in thy mind I think His purpose was to give us a twofold lesson first that He taught His Apostles nothing by His presence which He does not teach us through the inspirations of grace and secondly that having made choice of saint Peter to govern the whole Church wherein there are many sinners He wished him to test in himself what man can do without God s help This is why Jesus said to him before his fall Thou being once converted confirm thy brethren twenty three that is Tell them the story of thy sin show them by thy own experience how necessary it is for salvation to rely solely upon Me I was much afflicted at seeing her ill and I often exclaimed Life is so dreary Life is not dreary she would immediately say on the contrary it is most gay Now if you said Exile is dreary I could understand It is a mistake to call life that which must have an end Such a word should be only used of the joys of Heaven joys that are unfading and in this true meaning life is not sad but gay most gay Her own gaiety was a thing of delight For several days she had been much better and we were saying to her We do not yet know of what disease you will die But she answered I shall die of death Did not God tell Adam of what he would die when He said to him Thou shalt die of death twenty four Then death will come to fetch you No not death but the Good God Death is not as pictures tell us a phantom a horrid spectre The Catechism says that it is the separation of soul and body no more Well I do not fear a separation which will unite me for ever to God Will the Divine Thief some one asked soon come to steal His little bunch of grapes I see Him in the distance and I take good care not to cry out Stop thief Rather I call to Him This way this way Asked under what name we should pray to her in Heaven she answered humbly Call me Little Therese I was telling her that the most beautiful angels all robed in white would bear her soul to Heaven Fancies like those she answered do not help me and my soul can only feed upon truth God and His Angels are pure spirits No human eye can see them as they really are That is why I have never asked extraordinary favours I prefer to await the Eternal Vision To console me at your death I have asked God to send me a beautiful dream That is a thing I would never do ask for consolations Since you wish to resemble me you know what are my ideas on this Fear not O Lord that I shall waken Thee I shall await in peace the Heavenly Shore It is so sweet to serve God in the dark night and in the midst of trial After all we have but this life in which to live by faith I am happy at the thought of going to Heaven but when I reflect on these words of Our Lord I come quickly and My reward is with Me to render to every man according to his works twenty five I think that He will find my case a puzzle I have no works Well He will render unto me according to His own works The chief plenary indulgence which is within reach of everybody and can be gained without the ordinary conditions is that of charity which covereth a multitude of sins twenty six Surely you will not even pass through Purgatory If such a thing should happen then certainly nobody goes straight to Heaven That gives me little thought I shall be quite content with the Merciful God s decision Should I go to Purgatory I shall like the three Hebrew children in the furnace walk amid the flames singing the Canticle of Love In Heaven you will be placed among the Seraphim If so I shall not imitate them At the sight of God they cover themselves with their wings twenty seven I shall take good care not to hide myself with mine I showed her a picture which represented Joan of Arc being comforted in prison by her Voices and she remarked I also am comforted by an interior voice From above the Saints encourage me saying So long as thou art a captive in chains thou canst not fulfill thy mission but later on after thy death will come thy day of triumph In Heaven God will do all I desire because on earth I have never done my own will You will look down upon us from Heaven will you not No I will come down Some months before the death of Soeur Therese The Life of saint Aloysius was being read in the refectory and one of the Mothers was struck by the mutual and tender affection which existed between the young Saint and the aged Jesuit Father Corbinelli You are little Aloysius she said to Therese and I am old Father Corbinelli be mindful of me when you enter Heaven Would you like me to fetch you thither soon dear Mother No I have not yet suffered enough Nay Mother I tell you that you have suffered quite enough To which Mother Hermance replied I dare not say Yes In so grave a matter I must have the sanction of authority So the request was made to Mother Prioress who without attaching much importance to it gave her sanction Now on one of the last days of her life Soeur Therese scarcely able to speak owing to her great weakness received through the infirmarian a bouquet of flowers It had been gathered by Mother Hermance and was accompanied by an entreaty for one word of affection The message Tell Mother Hermance of the Heart of Jesus that during Mass this morning I saw Father Corbinelli s grave close to that of little Aloysius That is well replied the good Mother greatly touched tell Soeur Therese that I have understood And from that moment she felt convinced her death was near It took place just one year later and according to the prediction of the Little Aloysius the two graves lie side by side The last words penned by the hand of Soeur Therese were O Mary were I Queen of Heaven and wert thou Therese I should wish to be Therese that I might see thee Queen of Heaven one Cf Matt twenty twenty three two Cf Ps sixty seven sixty eight twenty

CELINE There are moments when I wonder whether I am really and truly in the Carmel sometimes I can scarcely believe it What have I done for God that He should shower so many graces upon me A whole month has passed since we parted but why do I say parted Even were the wide ocean between us our souls would remain as one And yet I know that not to have me is real suffering and if I listened to myself I should ask Jesus to let me bear the sadness in your stead I do not listen as you see I should be afraid of being selfish in wishing for myself the better part I mean the suffering You are right life is often burdensome and bitter It is painful to begin a day of toil especially when Jesus hides Himself from our love What is this sweet Friend about Does He not see our anguish and the burden that weighs us down Why does He not come and comfort us Be not afraid He is here at hand He is watching and it is He who begs from us this pain these tears He needs them for souls for our souls and He longs to give us a magnificent reward I assure you that it costs Him dear to fill us with bitterness but He knows that it is the only means of preparing us to know Him as He knows Himself and to become ourselves Divine Our soul is indeed great and our destiny glorious Let us lift ourselves above all things that pass and hold ourselves far from the earth Up above the air is so pure Jesus may hide Himself but we know that He is there II October twenty eighteen eighty eight MY DEAREST SISTER Do not let your weakness make you unhappy When in the morning we feel no courage or strength for the practice of virtue it is really a grace it is the time to lay the axe to the root of the tree one relying upon Jesus alone If we fall an act of love will set all right and Jesus smiles He helps us without seeming to do so and the tears which sinners cause Him to shed are wiped away by our poor weak love Love can do all things The most impossible tasks seem to it easy and sweet You know well that Our Lord does not look so much at the greatness of our actions nor even at their difficulty as at the love with which we do them What then have we to fear You wish to become a Saint and you ask me if this is not attempting too much Celine I will not tell you to aim at the seraphic holiness of the most privileged souls but rather to be perfect as your Heavenly Father is perfect two You see that your dream that our dreams and our desires are not fancies since Jesus Himself has laid their realisation upon us as a commandment III January eighteen eighty nine MY DEAR LITTLE CELINE Jesus offers you the cross a very heavy cross and you are afraid of not being able to carry it without giving way Why Our Beloved Himself fell three times on the way to Calvary and why should we not imitate our Spouse What a favour from Jesus and how He must love us to send us so great a sorrow Eternity itself will not be long enough to bless Him for it He heaps his favours upon us as upon the greatest Saints What then are His loving designs for our souls That is a secret which will only be revealed to us in our Heavenly Home on the day when the Lord shall wipe away all our tears three Now we have nothing more to hope for on earth the cool evenings are passed four for us suffering alone remains Ours is an enviable lot and the Seraphim in Heaven are jealous of our happiness The other day I came across this striking passage To be resigned and to be united to the will of God are not the same there is the same difference between them as that which exists between union and unity in union there are still two in unity there is but one five Yes let us be one with God even in this life and for this we should be more than resigned we should embrace the Cross with joy IV February twenty eight eighteen eighty nine MY DEAR LITTLE SISTER Jesus is a Spouse of blood six He wishes for Himself all the blood of our hearts You are right it costs us dear to give Him what He asks But what a joy that it does cost It is happiness to bear our crosses and to feel our weakness in doing so Celine far from complaining to Our Lord of this cross which He sends us I cannot fathom the Infinite Love which had led Him to treat us in this way Our dear Father must indeed be loved by God to have so much suffering given to him I know that by humiliation alone can Saints be made and I also know that our trial is a mine of gold for us to turn to account I who am but a little grain of sand wish to set to work though I have neither courage nor strength Now this very want of power will make my task easier for I wish to work for love Our martyrdom is beginning Let us go forth to suffer together dear sister and let us offer our sufferings to Jesus for the salvation of souls V March twelve eighteen ninety nine I must forget this world Here everything wearies me I find only one joy that of suffering and this joy which is not one of sense is above all joy Life is passing and eternity is drawing near Soon we shall live the very life of God After we have been filled at the source of all bitterness our thirst will be quenched at the very Fountain of all sweetness The figure of this world passeth away seven soon we shall see new skies a more radiant sun will light with its splendour crystal seas and infinite horizons We shall no longer be prisoners in a land of exile all will have passed away and with our Heavenly Spouse we shall sail upon boundless seas Now our harps are hanging on the willows which grow by the rivers of Babylon eight but in the day of our deliverance what harmonies will they not give forth how joyfully shall we make all their strings vibrate Now we shed tears as we remember Sion for how can we sing the songs of the Lord in a land of exile nine The burden of our song is suffering Jesus offers us a chalice of great bitterness Let us not withdraw our lips from it but suffer in peace He who says peace does not say joy or at least sensible joy to suffer in peace it is enough to will heartily all that Our Lord wills Do not think we can find love without suffering for our nature remains and must be taken into account but it puts great treasures within our reach Suffering is indeed our very livelihood and is so precious that Jesus came down upon earth on purpose to possess it We should like to suffer generously and nobly we should like never to fall What an illusion What does it matter to me if I fall at every moment In that way I realise my weakness and I gain thereby My God Thou seest how little I am good for when Thou dost carry me in Thy Arms and if Thou leavest me alone well it is because it pleases Thee to see me lie on the ground Then why should I be troubled If you are willing to bear in peace the trial of not being pleased with yourself you will be offering the Divine Master a home in your heart It is true that you will suffer because you will be like a stranger to your own house but do not be afraid the poorer you are the more Jesus will love you I know that He is better pleased to see you stumbling in the night upon a stony road than walking in the full light of day upon a path carpeted with flowers because these flowers might hinder your advance VI July fourteen eighteen eighty nine MY DARLING SISTER I am ever with you in spirit Yes it is very hard to live upon this earth but to morrow in a brief hour we shall be at rest O my God what shall we then see What is this life which will have no end Our Lord will be the soul of our soul O unsearchable mystery Eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither hath it entered into the heart of man what things God hath prepared for them that love Him ten And all this will come soon very soon if we love Jesus ardently It seems to me that God has no need of years to perfect His labour of love in a soul One ray from His Heart can in an instant make His flower blossom forth never to fade Celine during the fleeting moments that remain to us let us save souls I feel that Our Spouse asks us for souls above all for the souls of Priests It is He Who bids me tell you this There is but one thing to be done here below to love Jesus and to save souls for Him that He may be more loved We must not let slip the smallest opportunity of giving Him joy We must refuse Him nothing He is in such need of love We are His chosen lilies He dwells as a King in our midst He lets us share the honours of His Royalty His Divine Blood bedews our petals and His Thorns as they wound us spread abroad the perfume of our love VII October twenty two eighteen eighty nine MY DEAREST CELINE I send you a picture of the Holy Face The contemplation of this Divine subject seems to me to belong in a special way to my little sister truly the sister of my soul May she be another Veronica and wipe away all the Blood and Tears of Jesus her only Love May she give Him souls May she force her way through the soldiers that is the world to come close to His side Happy will she be when she sees in Heaven the value of that mysterious draught with which she quenched the thirst of her Heavenly Spouse when she sees His Lips once parched with burning thirst speaking to her the one eternal word love and the thanks which shall have no end Good bye dear little Veronica eleven to morrow no doubt your Beloved will ask some new sacrifice a fresh relief for His thirst but let us go and die with Him VIII July eighteen eighteen ninety MY DEAR LITTLE SISTER I send you a passage from Isaias which will comfort you Long ago the Prophet s soul was filled with the thought of the hidden beauties of the Divine Face as our souls are now Many a century has passed since then It makes me wonder what is Time Time is but a mirage a dream Already God sees us in glory and rejoices in our everlasting bliss How much good I derive from this thought I understand now why He allows us to suffer Since Our Beloved has trodden the wine press alone twelve the wine press from which He gives us to drink on our side let us not refuse to be clothed in blood stained garments or to tread out for Jesus a new wine which may quench His thirst When He looks around Him He will not be able to say now that He is alone thirteen we shall be there to help Him His look as it were hidden fourteen Alas it is so even to this day and no one understands His Tears Open to Me My Sister My Spouse he says to us for My Head is full of dew and My Locks of the drops of the night fifteen Thus Jesus complains to our souls when He is deserted and forgotten To be forgotten It is this I think which gives Him most pain And our dear Father it is heartrending but how can we repine since Our Lord Himself was looked upon as one struck by God and afflicted sixteen In this great sorrow we should forget ourselves and pray for Priests our lives must be entirely devoted to them Our Divine Master makes me feel more and more that this is what He asks of you and me IX September twenty three eighteen ninety O Celine how can I tell you all that is happening within me What a wound I have received And yet I feel it is inflicted by a loving Hand by a Hand divinely jealous All was ready for my espousals seventeen but do you not think that something was still wanting to the feast It is true Jesus had already enriched me with many jewels but no doubt there was one of incomparable beauty still missing this priceless diamond He has given me to day Papa will not be here to morrow Celine I confess that I have cried bitterly I am still crying so that I can scarcely hold my pen You know how intensely I longed to see our dearest Father again but now I feel that it is God s Will that he should not be at my feast God has allowed it simply to try our love Jesus wishes me to be an orphan to be alone with Him alone so that He may unite Himself more closely to me He wishes too to give me back in Heaven this joy so lawfully desired but which He has denied me here on earth To day s trial is one of those sorrows that are difficult to understand a joy was set before us one most natural and easy of attainment We stretched forth our hands and the coveted joy was withdrawn But it is not the hand of man which has done this thing it is God s work Celine understand your Therese and let us accept cheerfully the thorn which is offered us To morrow s feast will be one of tears but I feel that Jesus will be greatly consoled X October fourteen eighteen ninety MY DARLING SISTER I know quite well all you are suffering I know your anguish and I share it Oh If I could but impart to you the peace which Jesus has put into my soul amid my most bitter tears Be comforted all passes away Our life of yesterday is spent death too will come and go and then we shall rejoice in life true life for countless ages for evermore Meanwhile let us make of our heart a garden of delights where Our sweet Saviour may come and take His rest Let us plant only lilies there and sing with saint John of the Cross There I remained in deep oblivion My head reposing upon Him I love Lost to myself and all I cast my cares away And let them heedless mid the lilies lie eighteen XI April twenty six eighteen ninety one MY DEAR LITTLE SISTER Three years ago our hearts had not yet been bruised and life was one glad smile Then Jesus looked down upon us and all things were changed into an ocean of tears but likewise into an ocean of grace and of love God has taken from us him whom we loved so tenderly was it not that we might be able to say more truly than ever Our Father Who art in heaven How consoling is this divine word and what vast horizons it opens before us My darling Celine you who asked me so many questions when we were little I wonder how it was you never asked Why has God not made me an Angel Well I am going to tell you Our Lord wishes to have His Court here on earth as He has in Heaven He wishes for angel martyrs and angel apostles and if He has not made you an Angel in Heaven it is because He wishes you to be an Angel of earth so that you may be able to suffer for His Love Dearest sister the shadows will soon disappear the rays of the Eternal Sun will thaw the hoar frost of winter A little longer and we shall be in our true country and our childhood s joys those Sunday evenings those outpourings of the heart will be given back to us for ever XII August fifteen eighteen ninety two MY DEAR LITTLE SISTER To write to you to day I am obliged to steal a little time from Our Lord He will forgive because it is of Him that we are going to speak together The vast solitudes and enchanting views which unfold themselves before you ought to uplift your soul I do not see those things and I content myself by saying with saint John of the Cross in his Spiritual Canticle In Christ I have the mountains The quiet wooded valleys Lately I have been thinking what I could undertake for the salvation of souls and these simple words of the Gospel have given me light Pointing to the fields of ripe corn Jesus once said to His disciples Lift up your eyes and see the fields for they are already white with the harvest nineteen and again The harvest indeed is great but the labourers are few pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He send forth labourers twenty Here is a mystery indeed Is not Jesus all powerful Do not creatures belong to Him who hade them Why does He deign to say Pray ye the Lord of the harvest that He send forth labourers It is because His Love for us is so unsearchable so tender that He wishes us to share in all He does The Creator of the Universe awaits the prayer of a poor little soul to save a multitude of other souls ransomed like her at the price of His Blood Our vocation is not to go forth and reap in Our Father s fields Jesus does not say to us Look down and reap the harvest Our mission is even more sublime Lift up your eyes and see saith our Divine Master see how in Heaven there are empty thrones It is for you to fill them You are as Moses praying on the mountain so ask Me for labourers and they shall be sent I only await a prayer a sigh Is not the apostolate of prayer so to speak higher than that of the spoken word It is for us by prayer to train workers who will spread the glad tidings of the Gospel and who will save countless souls the souls to whom we shall be the spiritual Mothers What then have we to envy in the Priests of the Lord XIII MY DARLING SISTER The affection of our childhood days has changed into a closest union of mind and heart Jesus has drawn us to Him together for are you not already His He has put the world beneath our feet Like Zaccheus we have climbed into a tree to behold Him mysterious tree raising us high above all things from whence we can say All is mine all is for me the Earth and the Heavens are mine God Himself is mine and the Mother of my God is for me twenty one Speaking of that Blessed Mother I must tell you of one of my simple ways Sometimes I find myself saying to her Dearest Mother it seems to me that I am happier than you I have you for my Mother and you have no Blessed Virgin to love It is true you are the Mother of Jesus but you have given Him to me and He from the Cross has given you to be our Mother thus we are richer than you Long ago in your humility you wished to become the little handmaid of the Mother of God and I poor little creature am not your handmaid but your child You are the Mother of Jesus and you are also mine Our greatness in Jesus is verily marvellous my Celine He has unveiled for us many a mystery by making us climb the mystical tree of which I spoke above And now what science is He going to teach Have we not learned all things from Him Make haste to come down for this day I must abide in thy house twenty two Jesus bids us come down Where then must we go The Jews asked Him Master where dwellest thou twenty three And He answered The foxes have holes and the birds of the air nests but the Son of Man hath not where to lay His Head twenty four If we are to be the dwelling place of Jesus we must come down even to this we must be so poor that we have not where to lay our heads This grace of light has been given to me during my retreat Our Lord desires that we should receive Him into our hearts and no doubt they are empty of creatures Alas mine is not empty of self that is why He bids me come down And I shall come down even to the very ground that Jesus may find within my heart a resting place for His Divine Head and may feel that there at least He is loved and understood XIV April twenty five eighteen ninety three MY LITTLE CELINE I must come and disclose the desires of Jesus with regard to your soul Remember that He did not say I am the flower of the gardens a carefully tended Rose but I am the Flower of the fields and the Lily of the valleys twenty five Well you must be always as a drop of dew hidden in the heart of this beautiful Lily of the valley The dew drop what could be simpler what more pure It is not the child of the clouds it is born beneath the starry sky and survives but a night When the sun darts forth its ardent rays the delicate pearls adorning each blade of grass quickly pass into the lightest of vapour There is the portrait of my little Celine She is a drop of dew an offspring of Heaven her true Home Through the night of this life she must hide herself in the Field flower s golden cup no eye must discover her abode Happy dewdrop known to God alone think not of the rushing torrents of this world Envy not even the crystal stream which winds among the meadows The ripple of its waters is sweet indeed but it can be heard by creatures Besides the Field flower could never contain it in its cup One must be so little to draw near to Jesus and few are the souls that aspire to be little and unknown Are not the river and the brook they urge of more use than a dewdrop Of what avail is it Its only purpose is to refresh for one moment some poor little field flower Ah They little know the true Flower of the field Did they know Him they would understand better Our Lord s reproach to Martha Our Beloved needs neither our brilliant deeds nor our beautiful thoughts Were He in search of lofty ideas has He not His Angels whose knowledge infinitely surpasses that of the greatest genius of earth Neither intellect nor other talents has He come to seek among us He has become the Flower of the field to show how much He loves simplicity The Lily of the valley asks but a single dewdrop which for one night shall rest in its cup hidden from all human eyes But when the shadows shall begin to fade when the Flower of the field shall have become the Sun of Justice twenty six then the dewdrop the humble sharer of His exile will rise up to Him as love s vapour He will shed on her a ray of His light and before the whole court of Heaven she will shine eternally like a precious pearl a dazzling mirror of the Divine Sun XV August two eighteen ninety three MY DEAR CELINE What you write fills me with joy you are making your way by a royal road The Spouse in the Canticles unable to find her Beloved in the time of repose went forth to seek Him in the city But in vain it was only without the walls she found Him It is not in the sweetness of repose that Jesus would have us discover His Adorable Presence He hides Himself and shrouds Himself in darkness True this was not His way with the multitude for we read that all the people were carried away as soon as He spoke to them The weaker souls He charmed by His divine eloquence with the aim of strengthening them against the day of temptation and trial but His faithful friends were few that day when He was silent twenty seven in the presence of His judges Sweet melody to my heart is that silence of the Divine Master He would have us give Him alms as to a poor man and puts Himself so to speak at our mercy He will take nothing that is not cheerfully given and the veriest trifle is precious in His Divine Eyes He stretches forth His Hand to receive a little love that in the radiant day of the Judgment He may speak to us those ineffably sweet words Come ye blessed of My Father for I was hungry and you gave Me to drink I was a stranger and you took Me in I was sick and you visited Me I was in prison and you came to Me twenty eight Dearest Celine let us rejoice in the lot that is ours Let us give and give again and give royally never forgetting that Our Beloved is a hidden Treasure which few souls know how to find Now to discover that which is hidden we must needs hide ourselves in the hiding place Let our life then be one of concealment The author of the Imitation tells us If thou would saint know and learn something to the purpose love to be unknown and to be esteemed as nothing twenty nine Having forsaken all things a man should forsake himself thirty Let this man glory in this and another in that but thou for thy part rejoice neither in this nor in that but in the contempt of thyself thirty one XVI MY DEAR CELINE You tell me that my letters do good to you I am indeed glad but I assure you that I am under no misapprehension Unless the Lord build the house they labour in vain who build it thirty two The greatest eloquence cannot call forth a single act of love without that grace which touches the heart Think of a beautiful peach with its delicate tint of rose with its flavour so sweet that no human skill could invent such nectar Tell me Celine is it for the peach s own sake that God created that colour so fair to the eye that velvety covering so soft to the touch Is it for itself that He made it so sweet Nay it is for us the only thing that is all its own and is essential to its being is the stone it possesses nothing beyond Thus also it pleases Jesus to lavish His gifts on certain souls in order to draw yet others to Himself in His Mercy He humbles them inwardly and gently compels them to recognise their nothingness and His Almighty Power Now this sentiment of humility is like a kernel of grace which God hastens to develop against that blessed day when clothed with an imperishable beauty they will be placed without danger on the banqueting table of Paradise Dear little sister sweet echo of my soul Therese is far from the heights of fervour at this moment but when I am in this state of spiritual dryness unable to pray or to practise virtue I look for little opportunities for the smallest trifles to please my Jesus a smile or a kind word for instance when I would wish to be silent or to show that I am bored If no such occasion offer I try at least to say over and over again that I love Him This is not hard and it keeps alive the fire in my heart Even should the fire of love seem dead I would still throw my tiny straws on the ashes and I am confident it would light up again It is true I am not always faithful but I never lose courage I leave myself in the Arms of Our Lord He teaches me to draw profit from everything from the good and from the bad which He finds in me thirty three He teaches me to speculate in the Bank of Love or rather it is He Who speculates for me without telling me how He does it that is His affair not mine I have but to surrender myself wholly to Him to do so without reserve without even the satisfaction of knowing what it is all bringing to me After all I am not the prodigal child and Jesus need not trouble about a feast for me because I am always with Him thirty four I have read in the Gospel that the Good Shepherd leaves the faithful ones of His flock in the desert to hasten after the lost sheep This confidence touches me deeply You see He is sure of them How could they stray away They are prisoners of Love In like manner does the Beloved Shepherd of our souls deprive us of the sweets of His Presence to give His consolations to sinners or if He lead us to Mount Thabor it is but for one brief moment the pasture land is nearly always in the valleys it is there that He takes His rest at mid day thirty five XVII October twenty eighteen ninety three MY DEAR SISTER I find in the Canticle of Canticles this passage which may be fitly applied to you What dost thou see in thy beloved but a band of musicians in an armed camp thirty six Through suffering your life has in truth become a battle field and there must be a band of musicians so you shall be the little harp of Jesus But no concert is complete without singing and if Jesus plays must not Celine make melody with her voice When the music is plaintive she will sing the songs of exile when the music is gay she will lilt the airs of her Heavenly Home Whatever may happen all earthly events be they happy or sad will be but distant sounds unable to awake a vibration from the harp of Jesus He reserves to Himself alone the right of lightly touching its strings I cannot think without delight of that sweet saint Cecilia What an example she gives us In the midst of a pagan world in the very heart of danger at the moment when she was to be united to a man whose love was so utterly of earth it seems to me as if she should have wept and trembled with fear But instead during the music of the marriage feast Cecilia kept singing in her heart thirty seven What perfect resignation No doubt she heard other melodies than those of this world her Divine Spouse too was singing and the Angels repeated in chorus the refrain of Bethlehem s blessed night Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to men of goodwill thirty eight The Glory of God saint Cecilia understood it well and longed for it with all her heart She guessed that her Jesus was thirsting for souls and that is why her whole desire was to bring to Him quickly the soul of the young Roman whose only thought was of human glory This wise Virgin will make of him a Martyr and multitudes will follow in his footsteps She knows no fear the Angels in their song made promise of peace She knows that the Prince of Peace is bound to protect her to guard her virginity and to make her recompense Oh how beautiful is the chaste generation thirty nine Dearest sister I hardly know what I write I let my pen follow the dictates of my heart You tell me that you feel your weakness but that is a grace It is Our Lord Who sows the seeds of distrust of self in your soul Do not be afraid If you do not fail to give Him pleasure in small things he will be obliged to help you in great ones The Apostles laboured long without Him they toiled a whole night and caught no fish Their labours were not inacceptable to him but He wished to prove that He is the Giver of all things So an act of humility was asked of the Apostles and Our loving Lord called to them Children have you anything to eat forty saint Peter avowing his helplessness cried out Lord we have laboured all the night and have taken nothing forty one It is enough the Heart of Jesus is touched Had the Apostle caught some small fish perhaps our Divine Master would not have worked a miracle but he had caught nothing and so through the power and goodness of God his nets were soon filled with great fishes Such is Our Lord s way He gives as God with divine largesse but He insists on humility of heart XVIII July seven eighteen ninety four MY DEAR LITTLE SISTER I do not know if you are still in the same frame of mind as when you last wrote to me I presume that you are and I answer with this passage of the Canticle of Canticles which explains so well the state of a soul in utter dryness a soul which cannot find joy or consolation in anything I went down into the garden of nut trees to see the fruits of the valleys and to look if the vineyard had flourished and the pomegranates were in bud I no longer knew where I was my soul was troubled because of the chariots of Aminadab forty two There is the true picture of our souls Often we go down in the fertile valleys where our heart loves to find its nourishment and the vast fields of Holy Scripture which have so often opened to yield us richest treasures now seem but an arid and waterless waste We no longer even know where we stand In place of peace and light all is sorrow and darkness But like the Spouse in the Canticles we know the cause of this trial My soul was troubled because of the chariots of Aminadab We are not as yet in our true country and as gold is tired in the fire so must our souls be purified by temptation We sometimes think we are abandoned Alas the chariots that is to say the idle clamours which beset and disturb us are they within the soul or without We cannot tell but Jesus knows He sees all our grief and in the night on a sudden His Voice is heard Return return O Sulamitess return return that we may behold thee forty three O gracious call We dared no longer even look upon ourselves the sight filled us with horror and Jesus calls us that He may look upon us at leisure He wills to see us He comes and with Him come the other two Persons of the Adorable Trinity to take possession of our soul Our Lord had promised this when with unspeakable tenderness He had said of old If anyone love Me he will keep My word and My Father will love him and We will come to him and will make Our abode with him forty four To keep the word of Jesus then is one condition of our happiness the proof of our love for Him and this word seems to me to be His very Self for He calls Himself the Uncreated Word of the Father In the same Gospel of saint John He makes the sublime prayer Sanctify them by Thy word Thy word is truth forty five And in another passage Jesus teaches us that He is the Way and the Truth and the Life forty six We know then what is this word which must be kept we cannot say like Pilate What is truth forty seven We possess the Truth for our Beloved dwells in our hearts Often this Beloved is to us a bundle of myrrh forty eight We share the chalice of His sufferings but how sweet it will be to us one day to hear these gentle words You are they who have continued with Me in My temptations and I dispose to you as My Father hath disposed to Me a kingdom forty nine XIX August nineteen eighteen ninety four This is perhaps the last time that I need have recourse to writing in order to talk to you my dear little sister God in His goodness has granted my dearest wish Come and we will suffer together Then Jesus will take one of us and the others will remain in exile yet a little longer Now listen well to what I am going to say God will never never separate us and if I die before you do not think that I shall be far away never shall we have been more closely united You must not be grieved at my childish prophecy I am not ill I have an iron constitution but the Lord can break iron as if it were clay Our dear Father makes his presence felt in a way which touches me deeply After a death lasting for five long years what joy to find him as he used to be nay more a father than ever How well he is going to repay you for the care you so generously bestowed on him You were his Angel now he will be yours He has only been one month in heaven and already through the power of his intercession all your plans are succeeding It is easy for him now to arrange matters for us and he has had less to suffer on Celine s account than he had for his poor little Queen For a long time you have been asking me for news about the noviciate especially about my work and now I am going to satisfy you In my dealings with the novices I am like a setter on the scent of game The role gives me much anxiety because it so very exacting You shall decide for yourself if this be not the case All day long from morn till night I am in pursuit of game Mother Prioress and the Novice Mistress play the part of sportsmen but sportsmen are too big to be creeping through the cover whereas a little dog can push its way in anywhere and then its scent is so keen I keep a close watch upon my little rabbits I do not want to do them any harm but I tell them gently You must keep your fur glossy and must not look foolishly about as does a rabbit of the warren In fact I try to make them such as the Hunter of Souls would have them simple little creatures that go on browsing heedless of everything else I laugh now but seriously I am quite convinced that one of these rabbits you know which one I mean is worth a hundred times more than the setter it has run through many a danger and I own that had I been in its place I should have long since been lost for ever in the great forest of the world XX I am so glad dearest Celine that you do not feel any particular attraction at the thought of entering the Carmel This is really a mark of Our Lord s favour and shows that He looks for a gift from your hands He knows that it is so much sweeter to give than to receive What happiness to suffer for Him Who loves us even unto folly and to pass for fools in the eyes of the world We judge others by ourselves and as the world will not hearken to reason it calls us unreasonable too We may console ourselves we are not the first Folly was the only crime with which Herod could reproach Our Lord and after all Herod was right Yes indeed it was folly to come and seek the poor hearts of mortal men to make them thrones for Him the King of Glory Who sitteth above the Cherubim Was He not supremely happy in the company of His Father and the Holy Spirit of Love Why then come down on earth to seek sinners and make of them His closest friends Nay our folly could never exceed His and our deeds are quite within the bounds of reason The world may leave us alone I repeat it is the world that is insane because it heeds not what Jesus has done and suffered to save it from eternal damnation We are neither idlers nor spendthrifts Our Divine Master has taken our defence upon Himself Remember the scene in the house of Lazarus Martha was serving while Mary had no thought of food but only of how she could please her Beloved And she broke her alabaster box and poured out upon her Saviour s Head the precious spikenard fifty and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment fifty one The Apostles murmured against Magdalen This still happens for so do men murmur against us Even some fervent Catholics think our ways are exaggerated and that with Martha we ought to wait upon Jesus instead of pouring out on Him the odorous ointment of our lives Yet what does it matter if these ointment jars our lives be broken since Our Lord is consoled and the world in spite of itself is forced to inhale the perfumes they give forth It has much need of these perfumes to purify the unwholesome air it breathes For a while only good bye dearest sister Your barque is near to port The breezes filling its sails are the zephyrs of Love breezes that speed more swiftly than the lightning flash Good bye in a few days we shall be together within these Carmel walls and in the after days together in Paradise Did not Jesus say during His Passion Hereafter you shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power of God and coming in the clouds of heaven fifty two We shall be there THERESE one Matt three ten two Matt five forty eight three Apoc twenty one four four saint John of the Cross five Mme Swetchine six Exodus

John twelve three fifty two Matt twenty six sixty four LETTERS TO MOTHER AGNES OF JESUS Selections I Written in eighteen eighty seven shortly before Therese entered the Carmel MY DARLING LITTLE MOTHER You are right when you tell me that every cup must contain its drop of gall I find that trials are a great help towards detachment from the things of earth they make one look higher than this world Nothing here can satisfy and we can find rest only in holding ourselves ready to do God s will My frail barque has great difficulty in reaching port I sighted it long since and still I find myself afar off Yet Jesus steers this little barque and I am sure that on His appointed day it will come safely to the blessed haven of the Carmel O Pauline when Jesus shall have vouchsafed me this grace I wish to give myself entirely to Him to suffer always for Him to live for Him alone I do not fear His rod for even when the smart is keenest we feel that it is His sweet Hand which strikes It is such joy to think that for each pain cheerfully borne we shall love God more through eternity Happy should I be if at the hour of my death I could offer Jesus a single soul There would be one soul less in hell and one more to bless God in Heaven II Written during her retreat before receiving the habit January eighteen eighty nine Dryness and drowsiness such is the state of my soul in its intercourse with Jesus But since my Beloved wishes to sleep I shall not prevent Him I am only too happy that He does not treat me as a stranger but rather in a homely way He riddles his little ball with pin pricks that hurt indeed though when they come from the Hand of this loving Friend the pain is all sweetness so gentle in His touch How different the hand of man Yet I am happy most happy to suffer If Jesus Himself does not pierce me He guides the hand which does Mother If you knew how utterly indifferent to earthly things I desire to be and of how little concern to me are all the beauties of creation I should be wretched were I to possess them My heart seems so vast when I think of the goods of earth all of them together unable to fill it But by the side of Jesus how small does it appear He is full good to me this God who soon will be my Spouse He is divinely lovable for not permitting me to be the captive of any passing joy He knows well that if He sent me but a shadow of earthly happiness I should cling to it with all the intense ardour of my heart and He refuses even this shadow He prefers to leave me in darkness rather than afford me a false glimmer which would not be Himself I do not wish creatures to have one atom of my love I wish to give all to Jesus since He makes me understand that He alone is perfect happiness All all shall be for Him And even when I have nothing as is the case to night I will give Him this nothing III eighteen eighty nine I have a longing for those heart wounds those pin pricks which inflict so much pain I know of no ecstasy to which I do not prefer sacrifice There I find happiness and there alone The slender reed has no fear of being broken for it is planted beside the waters of Love When therefore it bends before the gale it gathers strength in the refreshing stream and longs for yet another storm to pass and sway its head My very weakness makes me strong No harm can come to me since in whatever happens I see only the tender Hand of Jesus Besides no suffering is too big a price to pay for the glorious palm IV Written during her retreat before profession September eighteen ninety MY DEAREST MOTHER Your little hermit must give you an account of her journey Before starting my Beloved asked me in what land I wished to travel and what road I wished to take I told him that I had only one desire that of reaching the summit of the Mountain of Love Thereupon roads innumerable spread before my gaze but so many of these were perfect that I felt incapable of choosing any of my own free will Then I said to my Divine Guide Thou knowest where lies the goal of my desire and for Whose sake I would climb the Mountain Thou knowest Who possesses the love of my heart For Him only I set out on this journey lead me therefore by the paths of His choosing my joy shall be full if only He is pleased And Our Lord took me by the hand and led me through an underground passage where it is neither hot nor cold where the sun shines not and where neither wind nor rain can enter a place where I see nothing but a half veiled light the light that gleams from the downcast Eyes of the Face of Jesus My Spouse speaks not a word and I say nothing save that I love Him more than myself and in the depths of my heart I know this is true for I am more His than mine I cannot see that we are advancing toward our journey s goal since we travel by a subterranean way and yet without knowing how it seems to me that we are nearing the summit of the Mountain I give thanks to my Jesus for making me walk in darkness and in this darkness I enjoy profound peace Willingly do I consent to remain through all my religious life in this gloomy passage into which He has led me I desire only that my darkness may obtain light for sinners I am content nay full of joy to be without all consolation I should be ashamed if my love were like that of those earthly brides who are ever looking for gifts from their bridegrooms or seeking to catch the loving smile which fills them with delight Therese the little Spouse of Jesus loves Him for Himself she only looks on the Face of her Beloved to catch a glimpse of the Tears which delight her with their secret charm She longs to wipe away those Tears or to gather them up like priceless diamonds with which to adorn her bridal dress Jesus Oh I would so love Him Love Him as He has never yet been loved At all cost I must win the palm of saint Agnes if it cannot be mine through blood I must win it by Love V eighteen ninety one Love can take the place of a long life Jesus does not consider time for He is Eternal He only looks at the love My little Mother beg Him to bestow it upon me in full measure I do not desire that thrill of love which I can feel if Jesus feel its thrill then that is enough for me It is so sweet to love Him to make Him loved Ask Him to take me to Him on my profession day if by living on I should ever offend Him because I wish to bear unsullied to Heaven the white robe of my second Baptism one Now Jesus can grant me the grace never to offend Him more or rather never to commit any faults but those which do not offend Him or give Him pain faults which serve but to humble me and strengthen my love There is no one to lean on apart from Jesus He alone faileth not and it is exceeding joy to think that He can never change VI eighteen ninety one MY DEAREST LITTLE MOTHER Your letter has done me such good The sentence Let us refrain from saying a word which could raise us in the eyes of others has indeed enlightened my soul Yes we must keep all for Jesus with jealous care It is so good to work for Him alone How it fills the heart with joy and lends wings to the soul Ask of Jesus that Therese His grain of sand may save Him a multitude of souls in a short space of time so that she may the sooner behold His Adorable Face VII eighteen ninety two Here is the dream of this grain of sand Love Jesus alone and naught else beside The grain of sand is so small that if it wished to open its heart to any other but Jesus there would no longer be room for this Beloved What happiness to be so entirely hidden that no one gives us a thought to be unknown even to those with whom we live My little Mother I long to be unknown to everyone of God s creatures I have never desired glory amongst men and if their contempt used to attract my heart I have realized that even this is too glorious for me and I thirst to be forgotten The Glory of Jesus this is my sole ambition I abandon my glory to Him and if He seem to forget me well He is free to do so since I am no longer my own but His He will weary sooner of making me wait than I shall of waiting VIII One day when Soeur Therese was suffering acutely from feverishness one of the Sisters urged her to help in a difficult piece of painting For a moment Therese s countenance betrayed an inward struggle which did not escape the notice of Mother Agnes of Jesus That same evening Therese wrote her the following letter May twenty eight eighteen ninety seven MY DEAREST MOTHER I have just been shedding sweet tears tears of repentance but still more of thankfulness and love To day I showed you the treasure of my patience and how virtuous I am I who preach so well to others I am glad that you have seen my want of perfection You did not scold me and yet I deserved it But at all times your gentleness speaks to me more forcibly than would severe words To me you are the image of God s Mercy Sister N on the contrary is more often the image of God s severity Well I have just met her and instead of passing me coldly by she embraced me and said Poor little Sister I am so sorry I do not want to tire you it was wrong of me to ask your help leave the work alone In my heart I felt perfect sorrow and I was much surprised to escape all blame I know she must really deem me imperfect She spoke in this way because she thinks I am soon to die However that may be I have heard nothing but kind and tender words from her and so I consider her most kind and myself an unamiable creatures When I returned to our cell I was wondering what Jesus thought when all at once I remembered His words to the woman taken in adultery Hath no man condemned thee two With tears in my eyes I answered Him No one Lord neither my little Mother the image of Thy Mercy nor Sister N the image of Thy Justice I feel that I can go in peace because neither wilt Thou condemn me I confess I am much happier because of my weakness than if sustained by grace I had been a model of patience It does me so much good to see that Jesus is always sweet and tender towards me Truly it is enough to make me die of grateful love My little Mother you will understand how this evening the vessel of God s Mercy has overflowed for your child Even now I know it Yea all my hopes will be fulfilled VERILY THE LORD WILL WORK WONDERS FOR ME AND THEY WILL INFINITELY SURPASS MY BOUNDLESS DESIRES one Soeur Therese here alludes to the probable opinion of theologians that as in Baptism all stain of sin is removed and all temporal punishment for sin remitted by the vows taken on the day of religious profession Ed two John eight ten LETTERS TO SISTER MARY OF THE SACRED HEART I February twenty one eighteen eighty eight MY DEAR MARIE You cannot think what a lovely present Papa made me last week I believe if I gave you a hundred or even a thousand guesses you would never find out what it was Well my dear Father bought me a new born lamb all white and fleecy He said that before I entered the Carmel he wanted me to have this pleasure We were all delighted especially Celine What touched me more than anything was Papa s thoughtfulness Besides a lamb is symbolic and it made me think of Pauline So far so good but now for the sequel We were already building castles in the air and expected that in two or three days the lamb would be frisking round us But the pretty creature died that same afternoon Poor little thing scarcely was it born when it suffered and died It looked so gentle and innocent that Celine made a sketch of it and then we laid it in a grave dug by Papa It appeared to be asleep I did not want the earth to be its covering so we put snow upon our pet and all was over You do not know dearest Godmother how this little creature s death has made me reflect Clearly we must not become attached to anything no matter how innocent because it will slip from our grasp when least expected nothing but the eternal can content us II Written during her retreat before receiving the habit January eight eighteen eighty nine Your little Lamb as you love to call me dearest sister would borrow from you some strength and courage I cannot speak to Our Lord and He is silent too Pray that my retreat may be pleasing to the Heart of Him Who alone reads the secrets of the soul Life is full of sacrifice it is true but why seek happiness here For life is but a night to be spent in a wretched inn as our holy Mother saint Teresa says I assure you my heart thirsts ardently for happiness but I see clearly that no creature can quench that thirst On the contrary the oftener I would drink from these seductive waters the more burning will my thirst become I know a source where they that drink shall yet thirst one but with a delicious thirst a thirst one can always allay That source is the suffering known to Jesus only III August fourteen eighteen eighty nine You ask for a word from your little Lamb But what shall I say Is it not you who have taught me Remember those days when I sat upon your knee and you talked to me of Heaven I can still hear you say Look at those who want to become rich and see how they toil to obtain money Now my little Therese through every moment of the day and with far less trouble we can lay up riches in Heaven Diamonds are so plentiful we can gather them together as with a rake and we do this by performing all our actions for the love of God Then I would leave you my heart overflowing with joy and fully bent on amassing great wealth Time has flown since those happy hours spent together in our dear nest Jesus has visited us and has found us worthy to be tried in the crucible of suffering God has said that on the last day He will wipe away all tears from our eyes two and no doubt the more tears there are to dry the greater will be the happiness Pray to morrow for the little one who owes you her upbringing and who without you might never have come to the Carmel IV During her retreat before profession September four eighteen ninety The heavenly music falls but faintly on the ear of your child and it has been a dreary journey towards her Bridal Day It is true her Betrothed has led her through fertile lands and gorgeous scenery but the dark night has prevented her admiring much less revelling in the beauty all around Perhaps you think this grieved her Oh no she is happy to follow her Betrothed for His own sake and not for the sake of His gifts He is so ravishingly beautiful even when silent even when concealed Weary of earthly consolation your little child wishes for her Beloved alone I believe that the work of Jesus during this retreat has been to detach me from everything but Himself My only comfort is the exceeding strength and peace that is mine Besides I hope to be just what He wills I should be and in this lies all my happiness Did you but know how great is my joy at giving pleasure to Jesus through being utterly deprived of all joy Truly this is the very refinement of all joy joy we do not feel V September seven eighteen ninety To morrow I shall be the Spouse of Jesus of Him Whose look was as it were hidden and despised three What a future this alliance opens up How can I thank Him how render myself less unworthy of so great a favour I thirst after Heaven that blessed abode where our love for Jesus will be without bounds True we must pass through suffering and tears to reach that home but I wish to suffer all that my Beloved is pleased to send me I wish to let Him do as He wills with His little ball You tell me dearest Godmother that my Holy Child is beautifully adorned for my wedding day four perhaps however you wonder why I have not put new rose coloured candles The old ones appeal to me more because they were lighted for the first time on my clothing day They were then fresh and of rosy hue Papa had given them to me he was there and all was joyful But now their tint has faded Are there yet any rose coloured joys on earth for your little Therese No for her there are only heavenly joys joys where the hollowness of all things gives place to the Uncreated Reality VI MY DEAREST SISTER I do not find it difficult to answer you How can you ask me if it be possible for you to love God as I love Him My desire for martyrdom is as nothing it is not to that I owe the boundless confidence that fills my heart Such desires might be described as spiritual riches which are the unjust mammon five when one is complacent in them as in something great These aspirations are a consolation Jesus sometimes grants to weak souls like mine and there are many such But when He withholds this consolation it is a special grace Remember these words of a holy monk The martyrs suffered with joy and the King of Martyrs in sorrow Did not Jesus cry out My father remove this chalice from Me six Do not think then that my desires are a proof of my love Indeed I know well that it is certainly not these desires which make God take pleasure in my soul What does please Him is to find me love my littleness my poverty it is the blind trust which I have in His Mercy There is my sole treasure dearest Godmother and why should it not be yours Are you not ready to suffer all that God wills Assuredly and so if you wish to know joy and to love suffering you are really seeking your own consolation because once we love all suffering disappears Verily if we were to go together to martyrdom you would gain great merit and I should have none unless it pleased Our Lord to change my dispositions Dear sister do you not understand that to love Jesus and to be His Victim of Love the more weak and wretched we are the better material do we make for this consuming and transfiguring Love The simple desire to be a Victim suffices but we must also consent to ever remain poor and helpless and here lies the difficulty Where shall we find one that is truly poor in spirit We must seek him afar off says the author of the Imitation seven He does not say that we must search among great souls but afar off that is to say in abasement and in nothingness Let us remain far from all that dazzles loving our littleness and content to have no joy Then we shall be truly poor in spirit and Jesus will come to seek us however far off we may be and transform us into flames of Love I long to make you understand what I feel Confidence alone must lead us to Love Does not fear lead to the thought of the strict justice that is threatened to sinners But that is not the justice Jesus will show to such as love Him God would not vouchsafe you the desire to be the Victim of His Merciful Love were this not a favour in store or rather already granted since you are wholly surrendered unto Him and long to be consumed by Him and God never inspires a longing which He cannot fulfill The road lies clear and along it we must run together I feel that Jesus wishes to bestow on us the same graces He wishes to grant us both a free entrance into His Heavenly Kingdom Dearest Godmother you would like to hear still more of the secrets which Jesus confides to your child but human speech cannot tell what the human heart itself can scarcely conceive Besides Jesus confides His secrets to you likewise This I know for you it was who taught me to listen to His Divine teaching On the day of my Baptism you promised in my name that I would serve Him alone You were the Angel who led me and guided me in my days of exile and offered me to Our Lord As a child loves its mother I love you in Heaven only will you realise the gratitude with which my heart is full to overflowing Your little daughter Teresa of the Child Jesus one Eccles twenty four twenty nine two Apoc twenty one four three Isa fifty three three four She alludes to the Statue of the Holy Child in the cloister which was under her own special care Ed five Luke sixteen two six Luke twenty two forty two seven Cf Imit II xi four LETTERS TO SISTER FRANCES TERESA one I August thirteen eighteen ninety three DEAR LITTLE SISTER At last your desires are satisfied Like the dove sent forth from the ark you have been unable to find a spot on earth whereon to rest and have long been on the wing seeking to re enter the blessed abode where your heart had for ever fixed its home Jesus has kept you waiting but at last touched by the plaintive cry of His dove He has put forth His Divine Hand and taking hold of it has set it in His Heart that sanctuary of His Love It is quite a spiritual joy this joy of mine For I shall never look upon you again never hear your voice as I outpour my heart into yours Yet I know that earth is but a halting place to us who journey towards a Heavenly Home What matter if the routes we follow lie apart Our goal is the same that Heaven where we shall meet no more to be separated There we shall taste for ever the sweets of our earthly home We shall have much to tell one another when this exile is ended Speech here below is so inadequate but a single glance will be enough for perfect understanding in our home beyond and I believe that our happiness will be greater than if we had never been parted here Meanwhile we must live by sacrifice Without it there would be no merit in the religious life As someone told us in a conference The reason why the forest oak raises its head so high is because hemmed in on all sides it wastes no sap in putting forth branches underneath but towers aloft Thus in the religious life the soul hedged in all around by the rule and by the practice of community life of necessity finds there a means of lifting a high head towards Heaven Dearest sister pray for your little Therese that she may draw profit from her exile on earth and from the plentiful means granted her of meriting Heaven II January eighteen ninety five DEAR LITTLE SISTER How fruitful for Heaven has been the year that is gone Our dear Father has seen that which the eye of man cannot see he has heard the minstrelsy of the angels now his heart understands and his soul enjoys the things which God hath prepared for those who love Him two Our turn will come and it is full sweet to think our sails are set towards the Eternal Shore Do you not find as I do that our beloved Father s death has drawn us nearer to Heaven More than half of our loved ones already enjoy the Vision of God and the five who remain in exile will follow soon This thought of the shortness of life gives me courage and helps me to put up with the weariness of the journey What matters a little toil upon earth We pass We have not here a lasting city three Think of your Therese during this month consecrated to the Infant Jesus and beg of Him that she may always remain a very little child I will offer the same prayer for you because I know your desires and that humility is your favourite virtue Which Therese will be the more fervent She who will be the more humble the more closely united to Jesus and the more faithful in making love the mainspring of every action We must not let slip one single occasion of sacrifice everything has such value in the religious life Pick up a pin from a motive of love and you may thereby convert a soul Jesus alone can make our deeds of such worth so let us love Him with every fibre of our heart III July twelve eighteen ninety six MY DEAR LITTLE LEONIE I should have answered your letter last Sunday if it had been given to me but you know that being the youngest I run the risk of not seeing letters for some considerable time after my sisters and occasionally not at all I only read yours on Friday so forgive my delay You are right Jesus is content with a tender look or a sigh of love For my part I find it quite easy to practise perfection now that I realise it only means making Jesus captive through His Heart Look at a little child who has just vexed its mother either by giving way to temper or by disobedience If it hides in a corner and is sulky or if it cries for fear of being punished its mother will certainly not forgive the fault But should it run to her with its little arms outstreteched and say Kiss me Mother I will not do it again what mother would not straightway clasp her child lovingly to her heart and forget all it had done She knows quite well that her little one will repeat the fault no matter her darling will escape all punishment so long as it makes appeal to her heart Even when the law of fear was in force before Our Lord s coming the prophet Isaias said speaking in the name of the King of Heaven Can a woman forget her babe And if she should forget yet will I not forget thee four What a touching promise We who live under the law of Love shall we not profit by the loving advances made by our Spouse How can anybody fear Him Who allows Himself to be made captive with one hair of our neck five Let us learn to keep Him prisoner this God the Divine Beggar of love By telling us that a single hair can work this wonder He shows us that the smallest actions done for His Love are those which charm His Heart If it were necessary to do great things we should be deserving of pity but we are happy beyond measure because Jesus lets Himself be led captive by the smallest action With you dear Leonie little sacrifices are never lacking Is not your life made up of them I rejoice to see you in presence of such wealth especially when I remember that you know how to make profit thereby not only for yourself but likewise for poor sinners It is so sweet to help Jesus to save the souls which He has ransomed at the price of His Precious Blood and which only await our help to keep them from the abyss It seems to me that if our sacrifices take Jesus captive our joys make Him prisoner too All that is needful to attain this end is that instead of giving ourselves over to selfish happiness we offer to our Spouse the little joys He scatters in our path to charm our hearts and draw them towards Him You ask for news of my health Well my cough has quite disappeared Does that please you It will not prevent Our Lord from taking me to Himself whensoever He wishes And I need not prepare for that journey since my whole endeavour is to remain as a little child Jesus Himself must pay all its expenses as well as the price of my admission to Heaven Good bye dearest one pray to Him without fail for the last and least of your sisters IV July seventeen eighteen ninety seven MY DEAR LEONIE I am so pleased to be able to write to you again Some days ago I thought I should never again have this consolation but it seems God wishes to prolong somewhat the time of my exile This does not trouble me I would not enter Heaven one moment sooner through my own will The only real happiness on earth is to strive always to think how goodly is the chalice six that Jesus give us Yours is indeed a goodly one dear Leonie If you wish to be a Saint and it will not be hard keep only one end in view give pleasure to Jesus and bind yourself more closely to Him Good bye my dear sister I should wish the thought of my entering Heaven to fill you with joy because I shall then be better able to give you proof of my tender love In the Heart of our Heavenly Spouse we shall live His very life and through eternity I shall remain Your very little sister TERESA OF THE CHILD JESUS one Nearly all the letters written by Soeur Therese to her sister Leonie are lost These few have been recovered It will be remembered that Leonie entered the Convent of the Visitation at Caen See note page one hundred thirteen two Cf I Cor two nine three Heb thirteen fourteen four Isa forty nine fifteen five Cant four nine six Ps twenty two twenty three five LETTERS TO HER COUSIN MARIE GUERIN I eighteen eighty eight Before you confided in me one I felt you were suffering and my heart was one with yours Since you have the humility to ask advice of your little Therese this is what she thinks you have grieved me greatly by abstaining from Holy Communion because you have grieved Our Lord The devil must be very cunning to deceive a soul in this way Do you not know dear Marie that by acting thus you help him to accomplish his end The treacherous creature knows quite well that when a soul is striving to belong wholly to God he cannot cause her to sin so he merely tries to persuade her that she has sinned This is a considerable gain but not enough to satisfy his hatred so he aims at something more and tries to shut out Jesus from a tabernacle which Jesus covets Unable to enter this sanctuary himself he wishes that at least it remain empty and without its God Alas what will become of that poor little heart When the devil has succeeded in keeping a soul from Holy Communion he has gained all his ends while Jesus weeps Remember little Marie that this sweet Jesus is there in the Tabernacle expressly for you and you alone Remember that He burns with the desire to enter your heart Do not listen to satan Laugh him to scorn and go without fear to receive Jesus the God of peace and of love Therese thinks all this you say because she does not know my difficulties She does know and knows them well she understands everything and she tells you confidently that you can go without fear to receive your only true Friend She too has passed through the martyrdom of scruples but Jesus gave her the grace to receive the Blessed Sacrament always even when she imagined she had committed great sins I assure you I have found that this is the only means of ridding oneself of the devil When he sees that he is losing his time he leaves us in peace In truth it is impossible that a heart which can only find rest in contemplation of the Tabernacle and yours is such you tell me could so far offend Our Lord as not to be able to receive Him What does offend Jesus what wounds Him to the Heart is want of confidence Pray much that the best portion of your life may not be overshadowed by idle fears We have only life s brief moments to spend for the Glory of God and well does satan know it This is why he employs every ruse to make us consume them in useless labour Dear sister go often to Holy Communion go very often that is your one remedy II eighteen ninety four You are like some little village maiden who when sought in marriage by a mighty king would not dare to accept him on the plea that she is not rich enough and is strange to the ways of a court But does not her royal lover know better than she does the extent of her poverty and ignorance Marie though you are nothing do not forget that Jesus is All You have only to lose your own nothingness in that Infinite All and thenceforth to think only of that All who alone is worthy of your love You tell me you wish to see the fruit of your efforts That is exactly what Jesus would hide from you He likes to contemplate by Himself these little fruits of our virtue They console Him You are quite wrong Marie if you think that Therese walks eagerly along the way of Sacrifice her weakness is still very great and every day some new and wholesome experience brings this home more clearly Yet Jesus delights to teach her how to glory in her infirmities two It is a great grace and I pray Him to give it to you for with it come peace and tranquillity of heart When we see our misery we do not like to look at ourselves but only upon our Beloved You ask me for a method of obtaining perfection I know of Love and Love only Our hearts are made for this alone Sometimes I endeavour to find some other word for love but in a land of exile words which have a beginning and an end three are quite unable to render adequately the emotions of the soul and so we must keep to the one simple word LOVE But on whom shall our poor hearts lavish this love and who will be worthy of this treasure Is there anyone who will understand it and above all is there anyone who will be able to repay Marie Jesus alone understands love He alone can give back all yea infinitely more than the utmost we can give one The allusion is to the scruples from which Marie suffered Having read this letter which is a strong plea for Frequent Communion Pope Pius X declared it most opportune Therese was but fifteen when she wrote it Ed two two Cor eleven five three saint Augustine LETTER TO HER COUSIN JEANNE GUERIN MADAME LA NEELE August eighteen ninety five It is a very great sacrifice that God has asked of you my dear Jeanne in calling your little Marie to the Carmel but remember that He has promised a hundredfold to anyone who for His Love hath left father or mother or sister one Now for love of Jesus you have not hesitated to part with a sister dearer to you than words can say and therefore He is bound to keep His promise I know that these words are generally applied to those who enter the religious life but my heart tells me they were spoken too for those whose generosity is such that they will sacrifice to God even the loved ones they hold dearer than life itself one Mark ten thirty LETTERS TO HER BROTHER MISSIONARIES I eighteen ninety five Our Divine Lord asks no sacrifice beyond our strength At times it is true He makes us taste to the full the bitterness of the chalice He puts to our lips And when He demands the sacrifice of all that is dearest on earth it is impossible without a very special grace not to cry out as He did during His Agony in the Garden My Father let this chalice pass from me But we must hasten to add Yet not as I will but as Thou wilt one It is so consoling to think that Jesus the Strong God two has felt all our weaknesses and shuddered at the sight of the bitter chalice that very chalice He had so ardently desired Your lot is indeed a beautiful one since Our Lord has chosen it for you and has first touched with His own Lips the cup which He holds out to yours A Saint has said The greatest honour God can bestow upon a soul is not to give to it great things but to ask of it great things Jesus treats you as a privileged child It is His wish you should begin your mission even now three and save souls through the Cross Was it not by suffering and death that He ransomed the world I know that you aspire to the happiness of laying down your life for Him but the martyrdom of the heart is not less fruitful than the shedding of blood and this martyrdom is already yours Have I not then good reason to say that your lot is a beautiful one worthy an apostle of Christ II eighteen ninety six Let us work together for the salvation of souls We have but the one day of this life to save them and so give to Our Lord a proof of our love To morrow will be Eternity then Jesus will reward you a hundredfold for the sweet joys you have given up for Him He knows the extent of your sacrifice He knows that the sufferings of those you hold dear increase your own but He has suffered this same martyrdom for our salvation He too left His Mother He beheld that sinless Virgin standing at the foot of the Cross her heart pierced through with a sword of sorrow and I hope he will console your own dear mother I beg Him most earnestly to do so Ah If the Divine Master would permit those you are about to leave for His Love but one glimpse of the glory in store and the vast retinue of souls that will escort you to Heaven already they would be repaid for the great sacrifice that is at hand III February twenty four eighteen ninety six Please say this little prayer for me each day it sums up all my desires Merciful Father in the name of Thy sweet Jesus of the Blessed Virgin and all the Saints I beg Thee to consume my sister with Thy spirit of love and to grant her the grace to make Thee greatly loved If Our Lord takes me soon to Himself I ask you still to continue this prayer because my longing will be the same in Heaven as upon earth to love Jesus and to make Him loved IV All I desire is God s Holy Will and if in Heaven I could no longer work for His glory I should prefer exile to Home V June twenty one eighteen ninety seven You may well sing of the Mercies of God They shine forth in you with splendour You love saint Augustine and saint Mary Magdalen those souls to whom many sins were forgiven because they loved much I love them too I love their sorrow and especially their audacious love When I see Mary Magdalen come forth before all Simon s guests to wash with her tears her Master s Feet those Feet that for the first time she touches I feel her heart has fathomed that abyss of love and mercy the Heart of Jesus and I feel too that not only was He willing to forgive but even liberally to dispense the favours of a Divine and intimate friendship and to raise her to the loftiest heights of prayer My Brother since I also have been given to understand the Love of the Heart of Jesus I confess that all fear has been driven from mine The remembrance of my faults humbles me and it helps me never to rely upon my own strength which is but weakness but more than all it speaks to me of mercy and of love When a soul with childlike trust casts her faults into Love s all devouring furnace how shall they escape being utterly consumed I know that many Saints have passed their lives in the practice of amazing penance for the sake of expiating their sins But what of that In my Father s house there are many mansions four These are the words of Jesus and therefore I follow the path He marks out for me I try to be nowise concerned about myself and what Jesus deigns to accomplish in my soul VI eighteen ninety seven On this earth where everything changes one thing alone does never change our Heavenly King s treatment of His friends From the day He raised the standard of the Cross in its shadow all must fight and win The life of every missionary abounds in crosses said Theophane Venard And again True happiness consists in suffering and in order to live we must die Rejoice my Brother that the first efforts of your Apostolate are stamped with the seal of the Cross Far more by suffering and by persecution than by eloquent discourses does Jesus wish to build up His Kingdom You are still you tell me a little child who cannot speak Neither could Father Mazel who was ordained with you and yet he has already won the palm Far beyond our thoughts are the thoughts of God When I learnt that this young missionary had died before he had set foot on the field of his labours I felt myself drawn to invoke him I seemed to see him amidst the glorious Martyr choir No doubt in the eyes of men he does not merit the title of Martyr but in the eyes of God this inglorious death is no less precious than the sacrifice of him who lays down his life for the Faith Though one must be exceeding pure before appearing in the sight of the All Holy God still I know that He is infinitely just and this very Justice which terrifies so many souls is the source of all my confidence and joy Justice is not only stern severity towards the guilty it takes account of the good intention and gives to virtue its reward Indeed I hope as much from the Justice of God as from His Mercy It is because He is just that He is compassionate and merciful longsuffering and plenteous in mercy For He knoweth our frame He remembereth that we are dust As a father hath compassion on his children so hath the Lord compassion on us five O my Brother after these beautiful and consoling words of the Royal Prophet how can we doubt God s power to open the gates of His Kingdom to His children who have loved Him unto perfect sacrifice who have not only left home and country so as to make Him known and loved but even long to lay down their lives for Him Jesus said truly there is no greater love than this Nor will He be outdone in generosity How could He cleanse in the flames of Purgatory souls consumed with the fire of Divine Love I have used many words to express my thought and yet I fear I have failed What I wish to convey is that in my opinion all missionaries are Martyrs by will and desire and not even one should pass through the purifying flames This then is what I think about the Justice of God my own way is all confidence and love and I cannot understand those souls who are afraid of so affectionate a Friend Sometimes when I read books in which perfection is put before us with the goal obstructed by a thousand obstacles my poor little head is quickly fatigued I close the learned treatise which tires my brain and dries up my heart and I turn to the Sacred Scriptures Then all becomes clear and lightsome a single word opens out infinite vistas perfection appears easy and I see that it is enough to acknowledge our nothingness and like children surrender ourselves into the Arms of the Good God Leaving to great and lofty minds the beautiful books which I cannot understand still less put in practice I rejoice in my littleness because only little children and those who are like them shall be admitted to the Heavenly banquet six Fortunately there are many mansions in my Father s House seven if there were only those to me incomprehensible mansions with their baffling roads I should certainly never enter there VII July thirteen eighteen ninety seven Your soul is too great to cling to the consolations of earth and even now its abode should be in Heaven for it is written Where your treasure is there will your heart be also eight Is not Jesus your only treasure Now that He is in Heaven it is there your heart should dwell This sweet Saviour has long since forgotten your infidelities He sees only your longing after perfection and the sight makes glad His Heart Stay no longer at His Feet I beseech you but follow this first impulse to throw yourself into His Arms Your place is there and I see clearly more clearly than in your former letters that all other heavenly route is barred to you save the way your little sister treads I hold with you when you say that the Heart of Jesus is more grieved by the thousand little imperfections of His friends than by the faults even grave which His enemies commit Yet it seems to me dear Brother it is only when those who are His own are habitually guilty of want of thought and neglect to seek His pardon that He can say These Wounds which you see in the midst of My Hands I have received in the house of those who love Me nine But His Heart thrills with you when He had to deal with all those who truly love and who after each little fault come to fling themselves into His Arms imploring forgiveness He says to His Angels what the prodigal s father said to his servants Put a ring upon his finger and let us rejoice ten O Brother Verily the Divine Heart s Goodness and Merciful Love are little known It is true that to enjoy these treasures we must humble ourselves must confess our nothingness and here is where many a soul draws back VIII eighteen ninety seven What attracts me towards our Heavenly Home is the Master s call the hope of loving Him at last to the fulfilling of all my desire the thought that I shall be able to win Him the love of a multitude of souls who will bless Him through all eternity I have never asked God that I might die young that to me were a cowardly prayer but from my childhood He has deigned to inspire me with a strong conviction that my life would be a short one I feel we must tread the same road to Heaven the road of suffering and love When I myself have reached the port I will teach you how best to sail the world s tempestuous sea with the self abandonment of a child well aware of a father s love and of his vigilance in the hour of danger I long so much to make you understand the expectant love of the Heart of Jesus Your last letter has made my own heart thrill sweetly I learnt how closely your soul is sister to mine since God calls that soul to mount to Himself by the lift of love without climbing the steep stairway of fear I am not surprised you find it hard to be familiar with Jesus one cannot become so in a day but this I do know I shall aid you much more to tread this beautiful path when I lay aside the burden of this perishable body Ere long you will exclaim with saint Augustine Love is my lodestone IX July twenty six eighteen ninety seven When you read these few lines I shall perhaps be no more I know not the future yet I can confidently say that my Spouse is at the door It would need a miracle to keep me in exile and I do not think that Jesus will work that miracle He does nothing that is of no avail Brother I am so happy to die Yes happy not because I shall be free from suffering on the contrary suffering combined with love seems the one thing worthy of desire in this vale of tears but happy to die because far more than on earth I shall help the souls I hold dear Jesus has always treated me as a spoilt child It is true that His Cross has been with me from the cradle but for that Cross He has given me a passionate love X August fourteen eighteen ninety seven I am about to go before God and I understand now more than ever that one thing only is needful to work for Him alone and do nothing for self or creatures Jesus wishes to own your heart completely Before this can be you will have much to suffer but oh what joy when comes the happy hour of going Home I shall not die I do but enter into Life and whatsoever I cannot tell you here upon earth I will make you understand from the heights of Heaven one Matt twenty six thirty nine two Isa nine six three This letter and the following are addressed to a Seminarist Ed four

of the Holy Face in the copy of the Gospels which she carried night and day close to her heart O my God O Most Blessed Trinity I desire to love Thee and to make Thee loved to labour for the glory of Holy Church by saving souls here upon earth and by delivering those suffering in Purgatory I desire to fulfill perfectly Thy Holy Will and to reach the degree of glory Thou hast prepared for me in Thy Kingdom In a word I wish to be holy but knowing how helpless I am I beseech Thee my God to be Thyself my holiness Since Thou hast loved me so much as to give me Thy Only Begotten Son to be my Saviour and my Spouse the infinite treasures of His merits are mine Gladly do I offer them to Thee and I beg of Thee to behold me only through the Eyes of Jesus and in His Heart aflame with love Moreover I offer Thee all the merits of the Saints both of Heaven and of earth together with their acts of love and those of the holy Angels Lastly I offer Thee O Blessed Trinity the love and the merits of the Blessed Virgin my dearest Mother to her I commit this Oblation praying her to present it to Thee During the days of His life on earth her Divine Son my sweet Spouse spake these words If you ask the Father anything in My Name He will give it you one Therefore I am certain Thou wilt fulfill my longing O my God I know that the more Thou wishest to bestow the more Thou dost make us desire In my heart I feel boundless desires and I confidently beseech Thee to take possession of my soul I cannot receive Thee in Holy Communion as often as I should wish but O Lord art Thou not all powerful Abide in me as Thou dost in the Tabernacle never abandon Thy Little Victim I long to console Thee for ungrateful sinners and I implore Thee to take from me all liberty to sin If through weakness I should chance to fall may a glance from Thine Eyes straightway cleanse my soul and consume all my imperfections as fire transforms all things into itself I thank Thee O my God for all the graces Thou hast granted me especially for having purified me in the crucible of suffering At the Day of Judgment I shall gaze on Thee with joy as Thou bearest Thy sceptre of the Cross And since Thou hast deigned to give me this precious Cross as my portion I hope to be like unto Thee in Paradise and to behold the Sacred Wounds of Thy Passion shine on my glorified body After earth s exile I trust to possess Thee in the Home of our Father but I do not seek to lay up treasures in Heaven I wish to labour for Thy Love alone with the sole aim of pleasing Thee of consoling Thy Sacred Heart and of saving souls who will love Thee through eternity When comes the evening of life I shall stand before Thee with empty hands because I do not ask Thee my God to take account of my works All our works of justice are blemished in Thine Eyes I wish therefore to be robed with Thine own Justice and to receive from Thy Love the everlasting gift of Thyself I desire no other Throne no other Crown but Thee O my Beloved In Thy sight time is naught one day is a thousand years two Thou canst in a single instant prepare me to appear before Thee In order that my life may be one Act of perfect Love I offer myself as a Victim of Holocaust to Thy Merciful Love imploring Thee to consume me unceasingly and to allow the floods of infinite tenderness gathered up in Thee to overflow into my soul that so I may become a very martyr of Thy Love O my God May this martyrdom after having prepared me to appear in Thy Presence free me from this life at the last and may my soul take its flight without delay into the eternal embrace of Thy Merciful Love O my Beloved I desire at every beat of my heart to renew this Oblation an infinite number of times till the shadows retire three and everlastingly I can tell Thee my love face to face MARY FRANCES TERESA OF THE CHILD JESUS AND OF THE HOLY FACE The ninth of June Feast of the Most Blessed Trinity In the year of grace eighteen ninety five A MORNING PRAYER O my God I offer Thee all my actions of this day for the intentions and for the glory of the Sacred Heart of Jesus I desire to sanctify every beat of my heart my every thought my simplest works by uniting them to Its infinite merits and I wish to make reparation for my sins by casting them into the furnace of Its Merciful Love O my God I ask of Thee for myself and for those whom I hold dear the grace to fulfil perfectly Thy Holy Will to accept for love of Thee the joys and sorrows of this passing life so that we may one day be united together in Heaven for all Eternity Amen AN ACT OF CONSECRATION TO THE HOLY FACE Written for the Novices O Adorable Face of Jesus since Thou hast deigned to make special choice of our souls in order to give Thyself to them we come to consecrate these souls to Thee We

Thy sweet Face and to console Thee for the contempt of the wicked In their eyes Thou art still as it were hidden they esteem Thee an object of reproach five O Blessed Face more lovely than the lilies and the roses of the spring Thou art not hidden from us The tears which dim Thine Eyes are as precious pearls which we delight to gather and through their infinite value to purchase the souls of our brethren From Thy Adorable Lips we have heard Thy loving plaint I thirst Since we know that this thirst which consumes Thee is a thirst for love to quench it we would wish to possess an infinite love Dear Spouse of our souls if we could love with the love of all hearts that love would be Thine Give us O Lord this love Then come to thy Spouses and satisfy Thy Thirst And give to us souls dear Lord We thirst for souls Above all for the souls of Apostles and Martyrs that through them we may inflame all poor sinners with love of Thee O Adorable Face we shall succeed in winning this grace from Thee Unmindful of our exile by the rivers of Babylon we will sing in Thine Ears the sweetest of melodies Since Thou art the true and only Home of our souls our songs shall not be sung in a strange land six O Beloved Face of Jesus while we await the Eternal Day when we shall gaze upon Thine Infinite Glory our only desire is to delight Thy Divine Eyes by keeping our faces hidden too so that no one on earth may recognize us Dear Jesus Heaven for us is Thy Hidden Face VARIOUS PRAYERS If you ask the Father anything in My Name He will give it you John sixteen twenty three O Eternal Father Thy Only Begotten Son the dear Child Jesus belongs to me since Thou hast given Him I offer Thee the infinite merits of His Divine Childhood and I beseech Thee in His Name to open the gates of Heaven to a countless host of little ones who will for ever follow this Divine Lamb Just as the King s image is a talisman through which anything may be purchased in his Kingdom so through My Adorable Face that priceless coin of my Humanity you will obtain all you desire Our Lord to Sister Mary of saint Peter seven Eternal Father since Thou hast given me for my inheritance the Adorable Face of Thy Divine Son I offer that Face to Thee and I beg Thee in exchange for this coin of infinite value to forget the ingratitude of those souls who are consecrated to Thee and to pardon all poor sinners PRAYER TO THE HOLY CHILD O Jesus dear Holy Child my only treasure I abandon myself to Thy every whim I seek no other joy than that of calling forth Thy sweet Smile Vouchsafe to me the graces and the virtues of Thy Holy Childhood so that on the day of my birth into Heaven the Angels and Saints may recognise in Thy Spouse Teresa of the Child Jesus PRAYER TO THE HOLY FACE O Adorable Face of Jesus sole beauty which ravisheth my heart vouchsafe to impress on my soul Thy Divine Likeness so that it may not be possible for Thee to look at Thy Spouse without beholding Thyself O my Beloved for love of Thee I am content not to see here on earth the sweetness of Thy Glance nor to feel the ineffable Kiss of Thy Sacred Lips but I beg of Thee to inflame me with Thy Love so that it may consume me quickly and that soon Teresa of the Holy Face may behold Thy glorious Countenance in Heaven PRAYER Inspired by the sight of a statue of The Blessed Joan of Arc O Lord God of Hosts who hast said in Thy Gospel I am not come to bring peace but a sword eight arm me for the combat I burn to do battle for Thy Glory but I pray Thee to enliven my courage Then with holy David I shall be able to exclaim Thou alone art my shield it is Thou O Lord Who teachest my hands to fight nine O my Beloved I know the warfare in which I am to engage it is not on the open field I shall fight I am a prisoner held captive by Thy Love of my own free will I have riveted the fetters which bind me to Thee and cut me off for ever from the world My sword is Love with it like Joan of Arc I will drive the strangers from the land and I will have Thee proclaimed King over the Kingdom of souls Of a truth Thou hast no need of so weak an instrument as I but Joan thy chaste and valiant Spouse has said We must do battle before God gives the victory O my Jesus I will do battle then for Thy love until the evening of my life As Thou didst not will to enjoy rest upon earth I wish to follow Thy example and then this promise which came from thy Sacred Lips will be fulfilled in me If any man minister to me let him follow Me and where I am there also shall My servant be and him will My Father honour ten To be with Thee to be in Thee that is my one desire this promise of fulfilment which Thou dost give helps me to bear with my exile as I wait the joyous Eternal Day when I shall see Thee face to face PRAYER TO OBTAIN HUMILITY Written for a Novice O JESUS When Thou wast a wayfarer upon earth Thou didst say Learn of Me for I am Meek and Humble of Heart and you shall find rest to your souls eleven O Almighty King of Heaven my soul indeed finds rest in seeing Thee condescend to wash the feet of Thy Apostles having taken the form of a slave twelve I recall the words Thou didst utter to teach me the practice of humility I have given you an example that as I have done to you so you do also The servant is not greater than his Lord If you know these things you shall be blessed if you do them thirteen I understand dear Lord these words which come from Thy Meek and Humble Heart and I wish to put them in practice with the help of Thy grace I desire to humble myself in all sincerity and to submit my will to that of my Sisters without ever contradicting them and without questioning whether they have the right to command No one O my Beloved had that right over Thee and yet Thou didst obey not only the Blessed Virgin and saint Joseph but even Thy executioners And now in the Holy Eucharist I see Thee complete Thy self abasement O Divine King of Glory with wondrous humility Thou dost submit Thyself to all Thy Priests without any distinction between those who love Thee and those who alas are lukewarm or cold in Thy service They may advance or delay the hour of the Holy Sacrifice Thou art always ready to come down from Heaven at their call O my Beloved under the white Eucharistic Veil Thou dost indeed appear to me Meek and Humble of Heart To teach me humility Thou canst not further abase Thyself and so I wish to respond to Thy Love by putting myself in the lowest place by sharing Thy humiliations so that I may have part with Thee fourteen in the Kingdom of Heaven I implore Thee dear Jesus to send me a humiliation whensoever I try to set myself above others And yet dear Lord Thou knowest my weakness Each morning I resolve to be humble and in the evening I recognise that I have often been guilty of pride The sight of these faults tempts me to discouragement yet I know that discouragement is itself but a form of pride I wish therefore O my God to build all my trust upon Thee As Thou canst do all things deign to implant in my soul this virtue which I desire and to obtain it from Thy Infinite Mercy I will often say to Thee Jesus Meek and Humble of Heart make my heart like unto Thine one
