eight PART I INTRODUCTION Of Propriety of Deportment and its Advantages Propriety of deportment or bienseance is a happy union of the moral and the graceful it should be considered in two points of view and ought therefore to direct us in our important duties as well as our more trifling enjoyments When we regard it only under this last aspect some contend that mere intercourse with the world gives a habit and taste for those modest and obliging observances which constitute true politeness but this is an error Propriety of deportment is the valuable result of a knowledge of one s self and of respect for the rights of others it is a feeling of the sacrifices which are imposed on self esteem by our social relations it is in short a sacred requirement of harmony and affection But the usage of the world is merely the gloss or rather the imitation of propriety since instead of being like that based upon sincerity modesty and courtesy it consists in not being constant in anything and in amusing itself by playing off its feelings and ridicule against the defects and excellences of others provided that this is done with grace and is never carried so far as to wound the self esteem of any one Thanks to custom it is sufficient in order to be recognised as amiable that he who is the subject of a malicious pleasantry may laugh as well as the author of it The usage of the world is therefore often nothing more than a skilful calculation of vanity a futile game a superficial observance of form a false politeness which would lead to frivolity or perfidy did not true politeness animate it with delicacy reserve and benevolence Would that custom had never been separated from this virtuous amiableness We should then never see well intentioned and good people suspicious of politeness and when victims to the deceitful justly exclaim with bitterness This is your man of politeness nor should we ever have made a distinction between the fixed principles of virtue and what is fit and expedient The love of good in a word virtue is then the soul of politeness the feeling of a just harmony between our interest and our social relations is also indispensable to this agreeable quality Excessive gaiety extravagant joy great depression anger love jealousy avarice and generally all the passions are too often dangerous shoals to propriety of deportment Moderation in everything is so essential that it is even a violation of propriety itself to affect too much the observance of it It is to propriety its justice and attractions that we owe all the charm I might almost say the being able to live in society At once the effect and cause of civilization it avails itself of the grand spring of the human mind self love in order to purify and ennoble it to substitute for pride and all those egotistical or offensive feelings which it generates benevolence with all the amiable and generous sentiments which it inspires In an assembly of truly polite people all evil seems to be unknown what is just estimable and good or what we call fit or suitable is felt on all sides and actions manners and language alike indicate it Now if we place in this select assembly a person who is a stranger to the advantages of a polite education he will at once be made sensible of the value of it and will immediately desire to display the same urbanity by which he has himself been pleased If politeness is necessary in general it is not less so in particular cases Neither rank talents fortune nor beauty can dispense with this amenity of manners nor can any thing inspire regard or love without that graceful affability that mild dignity that elegant simplicity which make the name of Frenchman synonymous with amiable and make Paris dear to whatever has understanding and taste If all the world feels the truth of the verse which is now a proverb Cette grace plus belle encors que la beaute one every one also is sensible that grace in conferring a favor affects us more than the favor itself and that a kind smile and an affectionate tone penetrate the heart more deeply than the most brilliant elocution As to the technical part of politeness or forms alone the intercourse of society and good advice are undoubtedly useful but the grand secret of never failing in propriety of deportment is to have an intention of always doing what is right With such a disposition of mind exactness in observing what is proper appears to all to possess a charm and influence and then not only do mistakes become excusable but they become even interesting from their thoughtlessness and naivete After the manner of saint Augustine who used to say Love God and then do what you wish we would say to those just making their debut in society Be modest benevolent and do not distress yourself on account of the mistakes of your inexperience a little attention and the advice of a friend will soon correct these trifling errors Such a friend I wish to be to you In undertaking to revise and almost entirely remodel the Manual of Good Society I have wished and have engaged to be useful to you A more methodical arrangement of the work more precise and varied details in short important applications to all conditions and circumstances of life I venture to believe will make this treatise worthy of its design one That grace which is more beautiful than beauty itself T CHAPTER I Of propriety of conduct in relation to religious duties We have said that propriety ought to preside over the sublimest instructions of morality as it also regulates the gayest movements of pleasure We proceed first therefore to consider religious deportment SECTION I Of respectful deportment at Church Religious sentiment is the great perhaps the only difference which we find between man and other animals However it may absorb you by its depth exalt you with delight or withdraw from you in misfortune this mysterious and sublime sentiment ought always to command your respect Therefore without objecting to particular differences of worship never enter a church without submitting to the requirements of religion two Observe silence or at least speak seldom and in a low voice uncover yourself advance with a slow and grave step stop at the same time making an inclination of your body if any ceremony engages the assembly Whether the church be Jewish Catholic or Protestant recollect that in this place men honor the Creator of the Universe that here they seek consolation in their troubles and pardon of their sins If you visit a church or any similar edifice from curiosity endeavor to do it out of the time of service Contemplate silently the pictures monuments c beware of imitating those vandals who deface with their obscure and ephemeral names those monuments which are destined to endure for ages Do not like them forget that the only thing which you can expect is a smile of contempt from all enlightened friends of the arts Do not wait till the keepers remind you of the remuneration due to their kindness in conducting you offering it to them with your thanks on taking leave and in order to this be always provided with small change The respect due to the place requires us to abstain from everything which resembles the cares of business I have thus far spoken only the language of toleration and of religious worship in general but I am now going to use that of faith and devotion Let the neatness and modesty of your apparel and your discreet and respectful deportment show that you perceive what is due to the house of God Incline your body on entering take the holy water three then advance by the shortest way and without precipitation to the place which you are to occupy if possible do not change it neither put yourself in the passage nor carry the chairs to a distance take two together to avoid turning your seat as circumstances may require in the course of the ceremony four If the services have commenced place yourself in the rear in order not to disturb those present by your coming The same motive ought to prevent your going away before the end except from pressing necessity If you are accompanied by a lady to whom you owe deference advance and present to her the holy water prepare two chairs for her and place yourself near In leaving church clear the passage for her carry her prayer book present her again with the holy water and hold the door open to let her pass Indeed these two last marks of politeness should be shown indiscriminately by well bred people to any who happen to be near them in entering or leaving the church Kind regards towards our neighbors are a worthy accompaniment of devotion If on a crowded occasion you have two chairs it is well to offer one of them to those who have none a man ought even to give up his own to a lady who might be standing Every one knows that it is contrary to the sanctity of the place to walk in a church as upon a public promenade to convene there as in a private house to cast on one side and the other looks of curiosity to have a mien which displays uneasiness or weariness to balance yourself upon the seat or shake in an annoying manner that of the person before you to carry with you dogs packets c During the sermon it is necessary to endeavor to make no noise and to bow with profound respect every time the preacher pronounces the sacred name of Jesus Christ five Whether you give or withhold an offering to the mendicants of either sex they should be answered by a kind salutation It is entirely contrary to religious propriety to press forward in going to the altar you ought to wait in silence your turn without trying to supplant those before you however should you have any urgent motives you can make them known with mildness and politeness Disputes which arise with regard to this are at the same time an absurdity and impiety When you take a place at the holy table you should lay aside gloves book cane c It is well for ladies to cover themselves with a veil half drawn it is a mark of reverence as well as modesty two The directions which here follow are obviously intended for those who profess the Catholic religion but most of them are also applicable to other denominations of Christians T three This refers to the usage in Catholic churches in which the consecrated or holy water is kept in a vase appropriated to the purpose near the entrance and in other parts of the church T four These directions are more particularly applicable to Catholic churches in foreign countries where it is not the general custom as in the United States to have pews The whole floor is an open area and supplied with chairs each person during service takes two one of which he sits in and places the other before him to kneel upon This custom of using chairs however is not universal even in Europe and the author observes in a note that it were to be wished that in all parts of France they would adopt the custom observed at Havre Dieppe and other cities of Normandy where instead of having chairs the churches are furnished throughout with fixed seats or benches by which means the service is conducted with much more order and decorum T five This latter direction is more particularly applicable to Catholic usage T

none	none	Of religious propriety in our intercourse with the world If it is a fundamental principle of propriety of conduct not to wound any one in his self esteem his tastes or interests much more is it necessary to respect his religious opinions To make sport of faith that powerful deep and involuntary sentiment before which the law yields to deliver to the pain of doubting hearts just become pious and tranquil to awaken a spirit of fanaticism and religious excesses to cause one s self to be considered by some as an imprudent by others an unworthy person and by all as an enemy to politeness and tolerance are the sad results of raillery against religious observances raillery too almost always dictated by a desire of showing off one s wit These results take place without any exception impious sarcasms in serious people constantly do injury but they become still more revolting in the mouths of females who like angels ought ever to show themselves lovely pure and free from passion whom Bernardin Saint Pierre designates with much feeling and justice the pious sex We ought not however to proscribe entirely delicate and happy allusions or comparisons drawn from the sacred books and made in a proper spirit It is useless I think to adduce instances suffice it to add that rigor alone can reprove them and that the occasion sometimes renders them very seasonable As to religious discussions they above all demand the most reserve and care since without our knowledge conscience frequently becomes in them auxiliary to pride If then you are unable to command yourself if you do not feel enough of logical power enough of grace or at least of exactness of elocution to contend with success avoid controversies avoid them through fear of committing in the eyes of weak people that religion which you defend and of exposing yourself to lasting ridicule But whatever be the skill which you exhibit in eluding the arguments of your adversary whatever be your triumph and although your disposition should urge you never turn a serious discussion into jest from that moment you would lose all your advantages and although overthrown your antagonist will recover himself with this just reflection that nothing is proved by a jest Finally while you manifest on every occasion a sincere and profound respect for religion beware above all things of making a proclamation of your piety Avoid talking with those in your parish about your confessor and your religious observances If you do not distinguish yourself from the crowd they will take you for a hypocrite or a person of small mind If you recommend yourself on the contrary by superior merit they will think that you take pleasure in showing the contrast which exists between your exalted talents and your humble faith Between ourselves would they be in the wrong CHAPTER II Of propriety of conduct in relation to domestic duties Since we admit that there are duties of propriety relative to piety there are also duties relative to filial piety that other worship that familiar veneration of the Deity whom our parents represent on earth The most sublime the most touching marks of religion and of nature unite in commanding us to love and honor those from whom we have received life We shall not offend our readers by supposing it requisite to insist upon the necessity of fulfilling a duty which is felt by all correct minds and all good hearts The custom has prevailed of addressing the father and mother in the second person six This mark of great confidence and affectionate freedom ought never to degenerate into an offensive familiarity We ought always to address them in a respectful and kind tone to anticipate them in every thing to ask their advice to receive their reproofs with submission to be silent with regard to the errors they may commit to show them a lively gratitude on every occasion in short whatever advantage you have over them be careful to conceal it and consider them always your superiors your benefactors and your guides Besides the daily marks of deference which we should show to our parents there are other particular attentions for which our affection should seek every occasion At certain periods such as the new year the birth day or day of baptism we should offer them tender congratulations or ingeniously devised presents We are not allowed to dispense with these delicate attentions If you have success in the sciences or arts make appropriate presents to those from whom you have derived the benefits of your education If you are separated from your father and mother write to them frequently let your style be impressed with a devoted affection repeat more particularly at the end of your letters the sentiments of respect and of love with which you should be inspired As to what your uncles aunts brothers sisters and cousins require of you you will know what are the duties of propriety in that respect if you feel how dear family ties are you will show towards some a respectful and towards the others a friendly politeness They should claim on every occasion your first visits and your first attentions you should identify yourself with them in all their prosperity or adversity invite them above all others to fetes and meetings at your house unless when you assemble a party on a special occasion at which they would be entire strangers You should always take care to invite your relations by themselves from time to time to prove that you have no intention of slighting them You may be more intimate with some of your family and give them particular proofs of affection but in these meetings you will do well to abstain from every act of preference Without being at all wanting in cordiality a little more ceremony should be used towards your relations by marriage to whom you indeed owe as much respect as to your own relations six This is an allusion to the idiom of the French language and is inapplicable in English T CHAPTER III Of propriety of conduct in conjugal and domestic relations If any thing can render politeness ridiculous and even odious it is the disposition of certain persons who in society are moderate amiable and gracious but in private show themselves morose rough and ill natured 
7246-110053-0000	train-other-500	This fault much too common is one of the greatest inconsistencies of the human mind You use all your exertions to please the world which you only see cursorily
none	none	 and in which you have only 
7246-110053-0001	train-other-500	power to procure a few moments of pleasure and you neglect to be agreeable to your husband or wife from whom you expect the happiness of a whole life
none	none	 Perhaps it would be better to be continually capricious or harsh for the contrast of your politeness in the drawing room with your impoliteness at home makes you appear still more odious Conjugal intimacy it is true dispenses with the etiquette established by politeness but it does not dispense with attentions In the presence of your wife or husband you ought never to do those things which carry with them an idea of disgust nor perform those duties of the toilet which before any one but yourself offend decency and cleanliness seven One ought never to permit disorder in his wardrobe under the excuse that he is just up or at his own house To dress with neatness and elegant simplicity is important even at home The conversation of husband and wife cannot be elegant 
7246-110053-0002	train-other-500	and sustained in the same manner
none	none	 that it is in society it would indeed be superlatively ridiculous 
7246-110053-0003	train-other-500	that it should not have interruption or relaxation but it should be free from all impoliteness and indelicacy
none	none	 If at any time the society of your husband or wife causes you ennui you ought neither to say so 
7246-110053-0004	train-other-500	nor give any suspicion of the cause by abruptly changing the conversation In
none	none	 all discussions you should watch yourself attentively 
7246-110053-0005	train-other-500	lest domestic familiarity raise itself by degrees to the pitch of a quarrel It is especially to females that this advice is addressed and to the impressive words of Scripture woman was not created for wrath
7246-110053-0006	train-other-500	we may add these she was created for gentleness To entertain with a politeness particularly affectionate the friends of a person with whom you are connected by marriage to respect inviolably the letters
none	none	 which she writes or receives to avoid prying into the secrets which she conceals from you through delicacy 
7246-110053-0007	train-other-500	never to act contrary to her inclinations unless they are injurious to herself and even in this case not to oppose her but to endeavor to check them with address and kindness
7246-110053-0008	train-other-500	to beware of confiding to strangers or to domestics the little vexations which she causes you to dread like poison marks of contempt
none	none	 coldness suspicion or reproaches to apologize promptly 
7246-110053-0009	train-other-500	and in an affectionate manner if you have allowed yourself to run into any ill humor to receive her counsels with attention and benevolence and to execute them as quickly as possible
7246-110053-0010	train-other-500	these are the obligations of propriety and love to which husbands
none	none	 possessed 
7246-110053-0011	train-other-500	of gentleness bind themselves by the sanctity of the vows
none	none	 which they have taken before God 
7246-110053-0012	train-other-500	There is a still more rigorous duty for a new husband and for well married persons they must abstain in public from every mark of affection too conspicuous and every exclusive attention
7246-110053-0013	train-other-500	Married persons who in society place themselves continually near
none	none	 one another and who converse and dance together do not escape the ridicule to which their feelings blind them In society we ought above every thing to avoid being personal 
7246-110053-0014	train-other-500	for a husband or a wife is another self and we must forget that self Mothers in particular spare no caresses towards your children occupy yourselves entirely with them
none	none	 unless perhaps you fear to render them proud difficult and insupportable if you fatigue people by having them always present if you encourage or repeat their prattle and their sports 
7246-110053-0015	train-other-500	if on the other hand you treat them with severity before strangers if you reprimand or punish them be assured every one will consider you
7246-110053-0016	train-other-500	importunate as well as ridiculous Domestic propriety which is at once a duty of justice
none	none	 religion and humanity is also a source of peace and pleasure 
7246-110053-0017	train-other-500	Servants treated with suitable regard are attentive zealous and grateful and consequently every thing is done with propriety and affection Who does not know the charm and value of this
7246-110053-0018	train-other-500	Duties of this class require that you should never command your domestics with hauteur and harshness Every time that they render you a service it claims an expression a gesture or at least a look of thankfulness
7246-110053-0019	train-other-500	it requires that you should be still more affectionate towards the domestics of your acquaintances and especially
none	none	 towards those of your friends 
7246-110053-0020	train-other-500	whom you ought always to treat kindly As to your own domestics
none	none	 you should 
7246-110053-0021	train-other-500	carefully beware of addressing to them any confidential or even useless conversation for fear of rendering them insolent or familiar but propriety requires you to listen to them with kindness
7246-110053-0022	train-other-500	and give them salutary advice when it is for their interest It commands us also to show them indulgence frequently in order to be able when there is cause
none	none	 to reprove them with firmness without being obliged to have recourse to the false energy of anger The ton of domestics ordinarily announces that of their masters Never suffer them to remain seated while answering distinguished persons who ask for you Take care that they do it always in a civil and polite manner let them lose no time if there is occasion in relieving your visitors of their over shoes umbrellas cloaks c let them go before to save your visitors the trouble of opening and shutting the door When an announcement is made let them inform themselves respectfully of the name of the person and pronounce it while holding open for them the door of your room If you are not there let them offer a seat requesting the guests to wait a moment while they go to call you When visitors take leave domestics ought to manifest a promptness in opening the outer door they should hold the door by the handle while you converse with the person whom you reconduct they should present them respectfully with whatever garments they may have thrown off and aid them in again putting them on and should if occasion requires light them to the door going slowly behind them Accustom your domestics never to appear before you too poorly or too much dressed never to sit in your presence especially while waiting upon the table not to enter into conversation never to answer by signs or in coarse terms It is only among the badly educated people of the small towns that they say the maid the boy the domestic the servant and among the proud ill bred fashionables who ape grandeur the lackey the valet 
7246-110053-0023	train-other-500	my people well bred persons simply say the nurse the cook the chamber maid
none	none	 c and 
7246-110053-0024	train-other-500	what is still better they designate
none	none	 their domestics by their christian names 
7246-110053-0025	train-other-500	If you have ever met with those merciless housekeepers
none	none	 who give you a whole tariff 
7246-110053-0026	train-other-500	of the commodities which they have been to market to purchase
none	none	 attended by their maid who entertain you constantly with the insults and unfaithfulness of their domestics who fly into a passion before you on account of a glass broken 
7246-110053-0027	train-other-500	of which they require the value and make you witness and judge of pert discussions
none	none	 occasioned by servants mistakes if you have had the misfortune to dine with such persons 
7246-110053-0028	train-other-500	and have seen them hand reluctantly to
none	none	 their sullen maid servants 
7246-110053-0029	train-other-500	one key after another
none	none	 to arrange the dessert 
7246-110053-0030	train-other-500	brought by them with a good supply of ill humor if you have seen them go to the cellar themselves and when
none	none	 they have just left the table to arrange in a surly manner the wine sugar and delicacies tell me poor guest 
7246-110053-0031	train-other-500	if turning your head away with confusion and disgust you have not an hundred times said to yourself
none	none	 Oh what living and disgusting models of upstarts or provincials seven As washing the feet cutting the nails c CHAPTER IV Of propriety as regards one s self 
7982_110054_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Attention to one s person and reputation is also a duty 
7982_110054_000003_000001	train-clean-360	If vanity pride or prudery have frequently given to these attentions the names of coquetry ambition or folly this is a still stronger reason why we should endeavor to clear up these points 
none	none	SECTION I Of the toilet 
7982_110054_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Propriety requires that we should always be clothed in a cleanly and becoming manner even in private in leaving our bed or in the presence of no one 
7982_110054_000006_000001	train-clean-360	It requires that our clothing be in keeping with our sex fortune profession age and form as well as with the season the different hours of the day and our different occupations 
7982_110054_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Let us now descend to the particulars of these general rules 
7982_110054_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The dress for a man on his first rising is a cap of cotton or silk and cotton a morning gown or a vest with sleeves for a lady a small muslin cap bonnet de percale a camisole or common robe 
7982_110054_000008_000001	train-clean-360	It is well that a half corset should precede the full corset which last is used only when one is dressed for it is bad taste for a lady not to be laced at all 
7982_110054_000008_000002	train-clean-360	The hair papers which cannot be removed on rising because the hair would not keep in curl till evening should be concealed under a bandeau of lace or of the hair 
7982_110054_000008_000003	train-clean-360	They should be removed as soon as may be 
7982_110054_000008_000004	train-clean-360	In this dress we can receive only intimate friends or persons who call upon urgent or indispensable business even then we ought to offer some apology for it 
7982_110054_000008_000005	train-clean-360	To neglect to take off this morning dress as soon as possible is to expose one s self to embarrassments often very painful and to the appearance of a want of education 
7982_110054_000008_000006	train-clean-360	Moreover it is well to impose upon yourself a rule to be dressed at some particular hour the earliest possible since occupations will present themselves to hinder your being ready for the day and you will easily acquire the habit of this 
7982_110054_000008_000007	train-clean-360	Such disorder of the toilet can be excused when it occurs rarely or for a short time as in such cases it seems evidently owing to a temporary embarrassment but if it occur daily or constantly if it seems the result of negligence and slovenliness it is unpardonable particularly in ladies whose dress seems less designed for clothing than ornament 
7982_110054_000009_000000	train-clean-360	To suppose that great heat of weather will authorise this disorder of the toilet and will permit us to go in slippers or with our legs and arms bare or to take nonchalant or improper attitudes is an error of persons of a low class or destitute of education 
7982_110054_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Even the weather of dog days would not excuse this and if we would remain thus dressed we must give directions that we are not at home 
7982_110054_000009_000002	train-clean-360	On the other hand to think that cold and rainy weather excuses like liberties is equally an error 
none	none	You ought not to be in the habit of wearing large socks this is addressed particularly to ladies as socks of list and similar materials much less noisy shoes such as wooden ones galoches lined with fur shoes with wooden soles socks c this custom is in the worst taste 
7982_110054_000009_000004	train-clean-360	When you go to see any one you cannot dispense with taking off your socks or clogs before you are introduced into the room 
7982_110054_000009_000005	train-clean-360	For to make a noise in walking is entirely at variance with good manners 
none	none	However pressed one may be a lady of good breeding should not go out in a morning dress neither with an apron nor cap even if it is made of fine cloth and trimmed with ribbands nor should a well bred man show himself in the street in a waistcoat only a jacket without sleeves c We said before that the dress should be adapted to the different hours of the day 
7982_110054_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Ladies should make morning calls in an elegant and simple neglige all the details of which we cannot give on account of their multiplicity and the numerous modification of fashion 
7982_110054_000010_000002	train-clean-360	We shall only say that ladies generally should make these calls in the dress which they wear at home 
7982_110054_000010_000003	train-clean-360	Gentlemen may call in an outside coat in boots and pantaloons as when they are on their ordinary business 
7982_110054_000010_000004	train-clean-360	In short this dress is proper for gentlemen s visits in the middle of the day 
7982_110054_000010_000005	train-clean-360	With regard to ladies it is necessary for them when visiting at this time to arrange their toilet with more care 
7982_110054_000010_000006	train-clean-360	Ceremonious visits evening visits and especially balls require more attention to the dress of gentlemen and a more brilliant costume for ladies 
none	none	There are for the latter head dresses particularly designed for such occasions and for no other such as rich blond caps ornamented with flowers brilliant berrets and toques appropriate to the drawing room The nicest cloth new and very fine linen an elegant but plain waistcoat a beautiful watch to which is attached a single costly key thin and well polished shoes an entirely new hat of a superior quality this is a dress at once recherche and rigorously exact for gentlemen of good taste and ton One s profession requires very little modification of this costume we should observe however that men of science savans and literary men and those in the profession of the law should avoid having a fashionable or military costume which is generally adopted by students commercial men and exquisites for the sake of ton or for want of something to do 
7982_110054_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Situation in the world determines among ladies those differences which though otherwise well marked are becoming less so every day 
none	none	Every one knows that whatever be the fortune of a young lady her dress ought always in form as well as ornaments to exhibit less of a recherche appearance and should be less showy than that of married ladies 
7982_110054_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Costly cashmeres very rich furs and diamonds as well as many other brilliant ornaments are to be forbidden a young lady and those who act in defiance of these rational marks of propriety make us believe that they are possessed of an unrestrained love of luxury and deprive themselves of the pleasure of receiving these ornaments from the hand of the man of their choice 
7982_110054_000013_000000	train-clean-360	All ladies cannot use indiscriminately the privilege which marriage confers upon them in this respect and the toilet of those whose fortune is moderate should not pass the bounds of an elegant simplicity Considerations of a more elevated nature as of good domestic order the dignity of a wife and the duties of a mother come in support of this law of propriety for it concerns morality in all its branches 
7982_110054_000014_000000	train-clean-360	We must beware of a shoal in this case frequently a young lady of small fortune desiring to appear decently in any splendid assembly makes sacrifices in order to embellish her modest attire 
none	none	But these sacrifices are necessarily inadequate a new and brilliant article of dress is placed by the side of a mean or old one 
7982_110054_000014_000002	train-clean-360	The toilet then wants harmony which is the soul of elegance as well as of beauty 
7982_110054_000014_000003	train-clean-360	Moreover whatever be the opulence which you enjoy luxury encroaches so much upon it that no riches are able to satisfy its demands but fortunately propriety always in accordance with reason encourages by this maxim social and sensible women 
7982_110054_000014_000004	train-clean-360	Neither too high nor too low it is equally ridiculous either to pretend to be the most showy or to display the meanest attire in an assembly 
none	none	The rules suitable to age resemble those which mediocrity of fortune imposes for instance old ladies ought to abstain from gaudy colors recherche designs too late fashions and graceful ornaments as feathers flowers and jewels A lady in her decline dressed in her hair and wearing a dress with short sleeves adorned with collars bracelets c offends against propriety as much as against her interest and dignity 
7982_110054_000016_000000	train-clean-360	The rigorous simplicity of the dress of men establishes but very little difference between that of young and old 
none	none	The latter however ought to choose grave colors not to follow the fashions too closely to avoid garments too tight or too short and not to have in view in their toilet any other object but ease and neatness Unless the care of their health or complete baldness requires them to wear a wig eight it is more proper that old persons should show their white and noble heads Old ladies whom custom requires to conceal this respectable sign of a long life should at least avoid hair too thick or too full of curls If they would not appear ridiculous and clothed in a manner disagreeable or offensive ladies ought to adopt in summer light garments and delicate colors and in winter furs thick and warm fabrics and deep colors 
7982_110054_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Men till lately were almost free from this obligation they used to be constantly clothed in broadcloth in all seasons but now although this may form the basis of their toilet they must select stuffs for winter or summer as may be suitable 
none	none	It is in good ton for gentlemen to wear a rich cloak an outer garment over the coat especially one of silk is left for men of a certain age 
7982_110054_000017_000003	train-clean-360	It only belongs to septuagenarians and ecclesiastics to wear doublets or wadded outer coats 
7982_110054_000018_000000	train-clean-360	To finish our instructions relative to the toilet it only remains for us to make a few observations 
7982_110054_000019_000000	train-clean-360	It is superlatively ridiculous for a lady to go on foot when dressed in her hair or attired for the drawing room or a ball 
7982_110054_000019_000001	train-clean-360	If one dwells in a provincial town where it is not customary to use carriages they should go in a chair 
7982_110054_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Who does not perceive how laughable it is to see a lady who is clothed in satin lace or velvet laboriously travelling in the dust or mud 
7982_110054_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Vary your toilet as much as possible for fear that idlers and malignant wits who are always a majority in the world should amuse themselves by making your dress the description of your person 
7982_110054_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Certain fashionables seek to gain a kind of reputation by the odd choice of their attire and by their eagerness to seize upon the first caprices of the fashions 
7982_110054_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Propriety with difficulty tolerates these fancies of a spoiled child but it applauds a woman of sense and taste who is not in a hurry to follow the fashions and asks how long they will probably last before adopting them finally who selects and modifies them with success according to her size and figure 
7982_110054_000022_000000	train-clean-360	It would be extremely clownish to carry dirt into a decent house especially if one makes a ceremonious visit and when there is much mud or when we cannot walk with skill it is proper to go in a carriage or at least to put in requisition the services of a shoe black at a short distance from the house 
none	none	eight Young people who become bald should not hesitate to have recourse to wigs Nothing more saddens the appearance than those bald skulls which seem always to invite the observations of the anatomist SECTION II Of Reputation 
7982_110054_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Among the cares which propriety obliges us to take of our person to please is but an accessary circumstance the principal end is to indicate by cleanliness and the suitableness of apparel that good order a sense of what is right and politeness in all things direct our thoughts and actions 
7982_110054_000026_000001	train-clean-360	In this point of view we see that a regard to reputation is the necessary consequence of the duties of propriety toward one s self 
7982_110054_000027_000000	train-clean-360	To inspire esteem and consideration is then the grand object of propriety of conduct for without this treasure the relations of society would be a humiliation and punishment 
7982_110054_000027_000001	train-clean-360	They are obtained by the accomplishment of our obligations of family and of our profession by our probity and good manners by our fortune and situation in society 
7982_110054_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Consideration is not acquired by words an article so precious demands a real value it demands also the assistance of discretion 
7982_110054_000028_000001	train-clean-360	So that we must begin by fulfilling exactly our duties towards relations but we must beware of making public those petty quarrels and little differences of interest of ill humor or opinion which sometimes trouble families most closely united 
none	none	These momentary clouds soon dissipated by affection and confidence would be engraven on the memory of others as a proof of your domestic discords and in the end of your faults nine 
7982_110054_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Probity that powerful means of obtaining consideration by its elevated and religious nature is not within our investigation of the principles of politeness 
7982_110054_000030_000000	train-clean-360	This is not the case with that consideration which is attached to purity of morals 
none	none	The proof of probity is in probity itself but thanks to the delicate shades of reputation in regard to chastity there exists independently of good conduct a multitude of cares and precautions which however minute and embarrassing at times ought never to be neglected 
7982_110054_000030_000002	train-clean-360	Ladies to whom the advice contained in this paragraph is particularly addressed know how the shadow of suspicion withers and torments them 
7982_110054_000030_000003	train-clean-360	This shadow it is necessary to avoid at all hazards and on that account to submit to all the requirements of propriety 
7982_110054_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Young married ladies are at liberty to visit by themselves their acquaintances but they cannot present themselves in public without their husband or an aged lady 
7982_110054_000031_000001	train-clean-360	They are at liberty however to walk with young married ladies or unmarried ones while the latter should never walk alone with their companions 
7982_110054_000031_000002	train-clean-360	Neither should they show themselves except with a gentleman of their family and then he should be a near relation or of respectable age 
none	none	Except in certain provincial towns where there is a great strictness in behavior young married ladies receive the visits of gentlemen they permit their company in promenades without suffering the least injury to their reputation provided it is always with men of good morals and that they take care to avoid every appearance of coquetry 
7982_110054_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Young widows have equal liberty with married ladies 
7982_110054_000033_000000	train-clean-360	A lady ought not to present herself alone in a library or a museum unless she goes there to study or work as an artist 
7982_110054_000034_000000	train-clean-360	A lady ought to have a modest and measured gait too great hurry injures the grace which ought to characterize her 
7982_110054_000034_000001	train-clean-360	She should not turn her head on one side and the other especially in large towns where this bad habit seems to be an invitation to the impertinent 
7982_110054_000034_000002	train-clean-360	If such persons address her in any flattering or insignificant terms she should take good care not to answer them a word 
7982_110054_000034_000003	train-clean-360	If they persist she should tell them in a brief and firm though polite tone that she desires to be left to herself 
7982_110054_000034_000004	train-clean-360	If a man follow her in silence she should pretend not to perceive him and at the same time hasten a little her step 
7982_110054_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Towards the close of the day a young lady would conduct herself in an unbecoming manner if she should go alone and if she passes the evening with any one she ought to see that a domestic comes to accompany her if not to request the person whom she is visiting to allow some one to do so 
7982_110054_000035_000001	train-clean-360	But however much this may be considered proper and consequently an obligation a married lady well educated will disregard it if circumstances prevent her being able without trouble to find a conductor 
7982_110054_000036_000000	train-clean-360	If the master of the house wishes to accompany you himself you must excuse yourself politely from giving him so much trouble but finish however by accepting 
7982_110054_000036_000001	train-clean-360	On arriving at your house you should offer him your thanks 
none	none	In order to avoid these two inconveniences it will be well to request your husband or some one of your relations to come and wait upon you you will in this way avoid still another inconvenience in small towns where malice is excited by ignorance and want of something to do they frequently censure the most innocent acts it is not uncommon to hear slanderous and silly gossips observe that madame such a one goes to madame such a one s for the sake of returning with her husband 
7982_110054_000036_000003	train-clean-360	The seeds of such an imputation once sown quickly come to maturity 
7982_110054_000037_000000	train-clean-360	The care of the reputation of ladies further demands that they should have a modest deportment should abstain from forward manners and free speeches 
none	none	nine As to the means of obtaining consideration in performing the duties appertaining to our station in life see the following chapters CHAPTER V 
7843-110055-0000	train-other-500	Of propriety in regard to one s business or profession Besides general politeness that ready money which is current with all there is a polite deportment suited to every profession
7843-110055-0001	train-other-500	Interest custom and the desire of particular esteem the necessity of moderating the enthusiasm which almost constantly animates us are the motives which determine the different kinds of politeness that we are going to consider
7843-110055-0002	train-other-500	as regards shopkeepers people in office lawyers physicians artists military men and ecclesiastics As all this politeness is mutual
7843-110055-0003	train-other-500	we shall necessarily speak of the obligations imposed upon people who have intercourse with these different persons
none	none	 SECTION I 
7843-110055-0004	train-other-500	Politeness of Shopkeepers and Customers Politeness in shopkeepers is a road to fortune which the greater part of them are careful not to neglect especially at Paris where we find particularly the model of a well bred shopkeeper
7843-110055-0005	train-other-500	It is this model that we wish to hold up even to some Parisians and to the retail dealers of the provincial towns as well as to those who are unacquainted with trade but are destined to that profession When a customer calls
7843-110055-0006	train-other-500	the shopkeeper should salute him politely without inquiring after his health unless he be intimately acquainted with him He then waits until the customer has made known his wishes advances toward him or brings forward a seat
none	none	 then shows him with great civility 
7843-110055-0007	train-other-500	the articles for which he has inquired If the purchaser be difficult to suit capricious ridiculous or even disdainful the shopkeeper ought not to appear to perceive it he may however in such cases
7843-110055-0008	train-other-500	show a little coldness of manner The part which shopkeepers have to act is frequently painful we must allow there are some people who treat them like servants there are some capricious fashionables who go into a shop only to pass the time
7843-110055-0009	train-other-500	to see the new fashions and who with this object make the shopkeeper open a hundred bundles show heaps of goods and finish by going out saying in a disdainful tone that nothing suits them There are some merciless purchasers
7843-110055-0010	train-other-500	who contend for a few cents with all the tenacity of avarice obstinacy and pride however under all these vexations the shopkeeper must show constant urbanity
7843-110055-0011	train-other-500	He waits upon such imperious purchasers with readiness but nevertheless in silence for he must be convinced that the more complying we are to people of this sort the more haughty and difficult they show themselves
7843-110055-0012	train-other-500	With capricious fashionables his patience should never forsake him and although he well knows what will be the result of their fatiguing call he nevertheless should show them his goods as if he thought they really intended to buy
7843-110055-0013	train-other-500	for sometimes this tempts them to purchase Even though his politeness should be all lost he should still express his regret at not having been able to suit the lady and hope to be more fortunate another time
7843-110055-0014	train-other-500	he should then conduct her politely to the door which he should hold open until her carriage leaves it A shopkeeper who wishes to save time words and vexation who even feels the dignity of his profession ought to sell at a fixed price
7843-110055-0015	train-other-500	or if he does not announce that he sells in that mode he ought at least to adopt it and not to have what is called an asking price If however he has to do with those gossips who think themselves cheated unless something is abated
7843-110055-0016	train-other-500	or who design to impose sacrifices on the shopkeepers it is necessary to carry on this ridiculous skirmishing politely and to yield by degrees without exhibiting any marks of displeasure at these endless debates
7843-110055-0017	train-other-500	But the dealer of bon ton abstains from those lofty assurances those laughable adjurations declarations of loss and of preference as I lose all profit it is because it is you and other foolish things
7843-110055-0018	train-other-500	which make a lackey s office of a truly respectable profession The clerks should carry the articles purchased to the desk
none	none	 whither they should politely conduct the purchaser they then should make up the bundle which they should not deliver until the bill is settled 
7843-110055-0019	train-other-500	and the purchaser is ready to depart If the latter is not on foot the bundle should not be delivered until he is seated in the carriage and the door is ready to be shut If on the contrary the purchaser is not in a carriage
7843-110055-0020	train-other-500	he must be asked whether he wishes to have the bundle carried home This politeness is indispensable if the bundle is large and especially if the purchaser is a lady It is further necessary that the person at the desk should offer small change for the balance of the purchase
none	none	 and should apologise if he is obliged to give copper or heavy money 
7843-110055-0021	train-other-500	he ought to present a bill of the articles and not show any ill humor if the purchaser thinks proper to look over it There is one circumstance which tries the politeness of the most civil shopkeepers it is when an assortment is wanted
7843-110055-0022	train-other-500	It is indeed irksome enough to show a great quantity of goods and give patterns of them
none	none	 with the certainty almost that all you do will avail nothing But it ought not to be forgotten 
7843-110055-0023	train-other-500	that like all other qualities politeness has its trials
none	none	 and that perhaps the person who has thus chanced to call at their shop 
7843-110055-0024	train-other-500	will be induced by this amenity of behavior to continue always a customer
none	none	 We trust that the shopkeepers clerks 
7843-110055-0025	train-other-500	in the recommendations which we are now about to give them will not see any silly attempt to address them with smart sayings By enjoining upon them to avoid volubility a disrespectful familiarity toward ladies extravagant praises of their goods
7843-110055-0026	train-other-500	an affected zeal in serving rich persons an impolite tardiness and disdainful inattention to people of a diffident manner the ridiculous habit of wishing to make conversation to urge people to buy whether they wish to or not
7843-110055-0027	train-other-500	to stun them with the names of all the goods in the shop by enjoining upon them to avoid these things we intend less to join in than to preserve them from the reproaches of fault finders Every civility ought to be reciprocal or nearly so
7843-110055-0028	train-other-500	If the officious politeness of the shopkeeper does not require an equal return he has at least a claim to civil treatment and finally if this politeness proceed from interest is this a reason why purchasers should add to the unpleasantness of his profession
7843-110055-0029	train-other-500	and trouble themselves little at violating the laws of politeness Many very respectable people allow themselves so many infractions on this point that I think it my duty to dwell upon it You should never say
7843-110055-0030	train-other-500	I want such a thing but have the goodness to show me or show me if you please that article or use some other polite form of address
none	none	 If they do not show you at first the articles you desire and you are obliged to examine a great number 
7843-110055-0031	train-other-500	apologize to the shopkeeper for the trouble you give him If after all you cannot suit yourself renew your apologies when you go away If you make small purchases say I ask your pardon or I am sorry for having troubled you for so trifling a thing
7843-110055-0032	train-other-500	If you spend a considerable time in the selection of articles apologize to the shopkeeper who waits for you to decide If the price seems to you too high and that the shop has not fixed prices
7843-110055-0033	train-other-500	ask an abatement in brief and civil terms and without ever appearing to suspect the good faith of the shopkeeper If he does not yield do not enter into a contest with him but go away after telling him politely that you think you can obtain the article cheaper elsewhere
7843-110055-0034	train-other-500	but if not that you will give him the preference If the clerk ends by asking whether you wish for any other article answer always in a manner to encourage him that you will call again We should never neglect to be agreeable Thank him always when you go out
none	none	 SECTION II Politeness between Persons in Office and the Public This is not very conspicuous nor can it be since in this case the desire of pleasing and the expectation of gain have no influence Besides 
7843-110055-0036	train-other-500	as we remain but a moment with these gentlemen and as they have business with a great many people the observances and forms of politeness would be misplaced The following are points to be observed by them and are by no means rigid
7843-110055-0037	train-other-500	the greater therefore the reason for conforming to them A man in office is not obliged to rise and salute people nor to offer them a seat it is enough for him to receive them by an inclination of the head and make a sign with the hand
7843-110055-0038	train-other-500	to intimate to them to be seated The business being finished he salutes them on leaving as before and never conducts them back to the door It would be ridiculous to be offended with these bureaucratic forms and still more so to wish to enter into conversation
none	none	 to make inquiries concerning the health c In proportion to their official habits those in office ought to watch themselves with care in society 
7962_110061_000030_000000	train-clean-360	SECTION III 
none	none	Politeness of Lawyers and their Clients Politeness is a very difficult thing for this respectable class who see constantly before their eyes people always animated with a feeling which renders them little amiable namely 
7843-110055-0040	train-other-500	interest Besides being in the habit of refuting their adversaries and being obliged to do it promptly they acquire in general a kind of bluntness a decisive tone a spirit of contradiction of which they ought to be distrustful in society
7843-110055-0041	train-other-500	and also in their places of business The familiar usage of common inquiries after the health is not customary between attorneys or advocates and their clients unless they have before been acquainted with them
7843-110055-0042	train-other-500	They are however bound to observe attentions which are not practised by persons in office They rise to salute their clients offer them a seat and conduct them to the door when they take leave they observe what is due to sex rank and age
7843-110055-0043	train-other-500	As to clients they ought to conform to the ordinary rules of civility they ought moreover not to exhibit any signs of impatience while they are waiting until they can be received They should take care to be clear and precise in the narration of their business
7843-110055-0044	train-other-500	and not to importune by vain repetitions or passionate declamations the counsellor who is listening to them They should also consider that his moments are precious and should retire so soon as they shall have sufficiently instructed him in their business
none	none	 SECTION IV Politeness of Physicians and their Patients 
7843-110055-0045	train-other-500	The observances adopted in the offices of lawyers are likewise practised with consulting physicians
none	none	 but sympathy should give to the tone or manner of the latter a more affectionate character Patients well educated will beware of abusing it and will keep to themselves all complaints which are useless towards a knowledge of their malady They will answer the questions of the doctor in a clear brief and polite manner and when these questions do not embrace the observations which they may have made on their own disorder they will say so at the same time observing some excuse like the following 
7843-110055-0046	train-other-500	I ask your pardon this observation is perhaps idle but being myself ignorant and wishing to omit nothing I submit it to your good judgment You ought to give frequent and heartfelt thanks to the physician who affords you his advice or attentions
7843-110055-0047	train-other-500	The circumstance of his being unsuccessful does not exonerate you from these testimonies of gratitude it renders them perhaps more obligatory for delicacy requires that you should not appear tacitly to reproach him
7843-110055-0048	train-other-500	on account of his having been unfortunate in his efforts Being obliged to speak of different wants and of different parts of the body for which politeness has no appropriate language the physician ought to avoid being obscure or gross
7843-110055-0049	train-other-500	particularly when addressing ladies A forgetfulness of these forms often renders insupportable even a meritorious and learned man
none	none	 Every one knows with what delicate precautions a physician ought to speak 
7843-110055-0050	train-other-500	before the patient and his family of the nature of the illness and of the probable consequences when there exists any danger in what guarded terms he should at last disclose to them a fatal termination if unfortunately it has become inevitable
7843-110055-0051	train-other-500	Every body knows also that however poignant may be the grief of parents they ought never to let it appear in their conversations with the physician that they regard him as the cause of their affliction
none	none	 SECTION V 
7843-110055-0052	train-other-500	Politeness of Artists and Authors and the Deference due to them Do artists come under the common rule it will perhaps be said and I shall ask in my turn Do they live like others
7843-110055-0053	train-other-500	these men always absorbed in one strong and single conception with which they like the Creator wish to animate matter who seek everywhere the secret of the beautiful which goads infatuates and evades them
7843-110055-0054	train-other-500	passionate absorbed in thought ingenuous almost always strangers to calculation to pleasure and to the occupations of the world No they have a separate existence one which the world does not comprehend
7843-110055-0055	train-other-500	and which they ought to conceal from the world If as we shall see hereafter one should avoid speaking of his profession and of his personal affairs for a still stronger reason an artist ought to be silent about his own labors his success and his hopes
7843-110055-0056	train-other-500	People will accuse him of arrogance of vanity and perhaps even of madness for enthusiasm is not included in nor admitted into society because there the ridiculous is feared above everything and from the sublime to the ridiculous there is but one step
7843-110055-0057	train-other-500	Let him then reserve only for his friends for true friends of the arts his noble and striking bursts of inspiration People are also generally prone to suspect artists of jealousy In order to escape this accusation
none	none	 and at the same time preserve the right of telling their thoughts 
7843-110055-0058	train-other-500	they ought to commend warmly what appears to them good and criticise with much moderation and without any raillery what is defective These observations are addressed equally to authors with this important addition Besides the charge of arrogance
7843-110055-0059	train-other-500	people are much disposed to accuse them of pedantry
none	none	 Let them therefore be careful and check constantly the desire of entering into conversation upon the interesting subjects 
7843-110055-0060	train-other-500	with which they are continually occupied Let them always be in fear of obtaining the name of a bel esprit a name which calls up so many recollections of pedantry and affectation A graceful simplicity
7843-110055-0061	train-other-500	a happy mixture of elevation and naivete should characterise authors and artists but particularly female authors and artists Ladies who handle the pen the lyre or the pencil
7843-110055-0062	train-other-500	ought to be well persuaded that any vestige of prejudice raises against them especially in provincial places a multitude of unfavorable observations And besides so many half instructed women have had so much the air and manners of upstarts
7843-110055-0063	train-other-500	that this opinion is almost excusable Now this prejudice lays it down as a rule that every female author or artist may be known at first sight by her oddities her want of modesty or her pedantic folly
7843-110055-0064	train-other-500	Do away this unjust prejudice my female friends it will be both easy and pleasant you will have only to follow the influence of an elevated soul a pure taste you will have but to remind yourselves that simplicity is the coquetry of genius
7843-110055-0065	train-other-500	But if people who cultivate literature and the arts ought to apply themselves without reluctance or ill humor to all the requirements of society if they ought to strip themselves of all pretension and forget themselves others should not forget them
7843-110055-0066	train-other-500	Politeness requires that we converse with an author concerning his works
none	none	 that we congratulate him on his success 
7843-110055-0067	train-other-500	that we bestow upon him suitable and delicate praises If any of his works are unknown to us we should ask of him the loan of it with earnestness we should read it with promptitude
none	none	 and prove to him by our citations that we have a thorough acquaintance with it 
7843-110055-0068	train-other-500	If he makes us a present of any of his productions we shall owe him a call or at least a billet of thanks Handsome compliments and lively testimonials of acknowledgment ought to fill up this visit or billet Remember also
7843-110055-0069	train-other-500	that to please an artist it is necessary to flatter at once his taste his self esteem and his cultivation of the fine arts Speak to him therefore like a connoisseur or at least an admirer of music or of painting
7843-110055-0070	train-other-500	Ask the favor of seeing his pictures or of hearing his symphonies Contemplate the former a long time listen to the latter with great attention address to him lively congratulations mingled with thanks then by an adroit transition
7843-110055-0071	train-other-500	put to him questions which prove your desire to be initiated into a knowledge of the arts
none	none	 When an artist or a writer obtains any honorable distinction as a prize a medal 
7843-110055-0072	train-other-500	dramatic success or an academical title his friends and acquaintances should lose no time in offering him their compliments Those at a distance may perform this duty of politeness by writing
7843-110055-0073	train-other-500	Not only authors by profession but literary persons who publish a discourse a little work or a pamphlet should send in an envelope a copy to their family friends professional brethren authors who have addressed to them similar presents
7843-110055-0074	train-other-500	to their intimate acquaintances their superiors and to those persons to whom they owe respect according to the nature of the work and to the people with whom they have relations of pleasure or of business
7843-110055-0075	train-other-500	It is an affectionate and very polite custom for the author to write with his own hand at the top of the first leaf or of the cover
none	none	 some kind or respectful words according to the person to whom it is addressed 
7843-110055-0076	train-other-500	These words which are designed to make of the gift a remembrance or homage are always written under the name of the person and signed by the author We will here speak of a dedication only to observe
7843-110055-0077	train-other-500	that we cannot dedicate a work to any one without having previously obtained his consent either verbally or by writing When it is to the king queen or princes it is necessary to write to their secretary to know their wish in this respect
7843-110055-0078	train-other-500	As to any other person of dignity we may write to him without any intermediate agency If the members of the royal family have accepted the dedication the author is generally allowed the honor of presenting his work to them
none	none	 SECTION VI 
7843-110055-0079	train-other-500	Politeness of Military Men Military politeness has as we know some particular characteristics Officers and soldiers do not uncover themselves on entering a church if they are under arms only during the elevation of the host
none	none	 ten they raise the right hand to the front part of their helmet cap or shako eleven 
7843-110055-0080	train-other-500	When soldiers converse with their superiors they constantly hold the edge of the hand to their forehead On entering a drawing room an officer lays down his sabre or his sword It is not in good ton for a man to present himself before ladies
7843-110055-0081	train-other-500	in the uniform of the national guard unless some circumstance excuses or authorises this liberty In a citizen s dress officers may wear a black cravat If we are acquainted with military men
none	none	 in addressing them we call them only general or captain but it would be uncivil to give them the title of an inferior grade thus we should not say lieutenant ten This has reference of course to Catholic countries only eleven A kind of military cap SECTION VII Politeness of Ecclesiastics and Females of Religious Orders and the Deference due to them twelve A priest should be considered in two points of view when he is exercising his holy office and when he is taking part in the relations of society In the first case 
7843-110055-0082	train-other-500	he is an object of special respect
none	none	 and even the title to be given him the words to be addressed to him the attitude to be taken in speaking to him 
7843-110055-0083	train-other-500	are regulated by the liturgy But although the ecclesiastic be not now in society an object of religious veneration he has as the representative of God or as a minister of the altar a right to much respect and deference
7843-110055-0084	train-other-500	Too light conversation dancing and love songs would be out of place in his presence Ecclesiastics have two shoals to avoid Their custom of preaching a severe and sacred morality and of catechising or censuring with authority the penitent
7843-110055-0085	train-other-500	gives them sometime a dogmatical and rigid tone a pedantry of morality altogether contrary to social affability Sometimes also to guard against this result which they feel to be almost inevitable
7843-110055-0086	train-other-500	ecclesiastics especially the more aged indulge themselves in unsuitable pleasantries which they would not dare to allow in men of the world A mild gravity a moderate gaiety a noble and affectionate urbanity
none	none	 these are the characteristics which ought to distinguish the ecclesiastic in society twelve These remarks have particular reference to Catholic countries and forms but may many of them be applied to other denominations PART II OF PROPRIETY OF DEPORTMENT IN REGARD TO OUR SOCIAL RELATIONS CHAPTER I Of Deportment in the Street Some readers will perhaps be surprised to see me commence a chapter with the duty we owe to persons passing the street but if they reflect upon it they will see that there are even on this subject a sufficient number of things proper to be mentioned When you are passing in the street and see coming towards you a person of your acquaintance whether a lady a man raised to dignity or an elderly person you should offer them the wall that is to say the side next the houses If a carriage happen to stop in such a manner as to leave only a narrow passage between it and the houses beware of elbowing and rudely crowding the passengers with a view to getting by more expeditiously wait your turn and if any one of the persons before mentioned comes up you should edge up to the wall in order to give them the place 
7932_110056_000007_000001	train-clean-360	They also as they pass ought to bow politely to you 
none	none	If stormy weather has made it necessary to lay a plank across the gutters which have become suddenly full of water it is not proper to crowd before another in order to pass over the frail bridge 
7932_110056_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Further a young man of good breeding should promptly offer his hand to ladies even if they are not acquaintances when they pass such a place 
none	none	You must pay attention to your manner of walking for fear of throwing mud around you and spattering yourself as well as those who accompany you or who walk behind you 
7932_110056_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Any person particularly a lady who walks in this improper manner whatever her education may be in other respects will always appear awkward and clumsy 
none	none	Every one knows that the Parisian ladies are celebrated for their skill in walking we see them in white stockings and thin shoes passing through long dirty and blocked up streets gliding by careless persons and by vehicles crossing each other in every direction and yet return home after a walk of several hours without soiling their clothes in the least To arrive at this astonishing result which causes the wonder and vexation of provincial visitors on their first coming to Paris we must be careful to put the foot on the middle of the paving stones and never on the edges for in that case one inevitably slips into the interstice between one pavement and another we must begin by supporting the toe before we do the heel and even when the mud is quite deep we must put down the heel but seldom When the street becomes less muddy we can compensate ourselves for this fatigue which however in the end leaves us hardly sensible This manner of walking is strictly necessary when you offer your arm to any one When tripping over the pavement as the saying is a lady should gracefully raise her dress a little above her ancle 
7932_110056_000013_000002	train-clean-360	With the right hand she should hold together the folds of her gown and draw them towards the right side 
7932_110056_000013_000003	train-clean-360	To raise the dress on both sides and with both hands is vulgar 
7932_110056_000013_000004	train-clean-360	This ungraceful practice can be tolerated only for a moment when the mud is very deep 
none	none	It is an important thing in the streets of a large city to edge one s self along that is to avoid jostling and being jostled by those who are passing A neglect of this attention will make you appear not only awkward and ridiculous but you will receive or give dangerous blows One can edge along by turning sideways contracting his arms and watching with his eye the direction which it is best to take in order not to come in contact with the person who meets him A little practice and care will soon make this duty familiar To make our way along becomes more difficult when we have a packet or an umbrella to carry especially if the latter is open It is then necessary to lower or raise it or to turn it on one side If you neglect these precautions you run the risk of striking it against those who are coming and going or of seeing it twirled round and of being thrown against a carriage or against some one who will complain bitterly of your incivility and awkwardness If you have no umbrella and find yourself overtaken by a sudden shower and any person provided with one is going in the same direction you may request them to shelter you they should receive your request with much politeness inform themselves of the place where you wish to stop and offer to conduct you there unless it is too much out of the way or they be pressed for business in this case they should express their regret at not being able to accompany you so far as you wish What we are now about to say proves that a person truly polite will not wait for you to make this request but will use every exertion to anticipate it we must observe however whether age sex or dress present no objection for sometimes one would be treated with ill humor and contempt and if you are a lady particularly arrived at a certain age it would be extremely unpleasant to accost a person who on his part ought never to offer this favor nor any other to ladies and whose air and immodest manners indicate at once his vulgarity It would be equally out of place to address such a request to those of a very low class but if such an one asks the favor of you it is proper to receive it with politeness Another not uncommon point of propriety to be observed consists in asking and pointing out the different streets If you have occasion for this service you speak politely and say in a kind tone Madam or Sir where is such a street if you please You should be careful to give this title to persons whom you address even if they should be porters or hucksters It is particularly to these that you should have recourse for in addressing persons passing by you are liable to meet those who as well as yourself are strangers to the neighborhood or to hinder those who are busy it is moreover impolite to trouble shopkeepers in their places of business 
7932_110056_000018_000003	train-clean-360	The direction being given us we should thank them at the same time bowing 
none	none	Parisians are justly celebrated for the politeness and complaisance with which they show the way to passengers and you ought to imitate them every time that occasion offers 
7932_110056_000018_000005	train-clean-360	If you are a man and a lady or distinguished person asks this favor of you you should take off your hat while answering them 
none	none	There are some ill mannered and malicious persons who take pleasure in misleading strangers by wrong directions It will be enough to mention such impertinence in order to despise it as we ought As to those young men who entertain a false idea that Parisian ladies are coquettes or forward in their manners and besides that everything is allowable in a large city let them be assured that a man who dares as often happens to address improper compliments to ladies to follow them to listen to their conversation or to finish a sentence which they have begun is a model of rudeness an object of aversion to ladies and of contempt to gentlemen A young man of good manners ought not to look at a lady too narrowly or he will pass for an impertinent fellow who as the saying is stares people full in the face sous le nez It is especially when there are many persons assembled in one place that these boors play off their rude tricks to which they give the name hoaxes for the multitude at first because they are unperceived and afterwards because the least bad among them think that the crowd are out of the jurisdiction of propriety 
7932_110056_000021_000001	train-clean-360	This opinion which obtains among some persons is an error 
none	none	Politeness becomes still more indispensable in proportion to the assemblage Why are crowds usually so disagreeable and even dangerous It is because they are composed of people without education who rudely push against their neighbors with their fist or elbow who neglect to follow the movement of going and coming who on occasion of the slightest collision raise loud complaints and by their lamentations their cries and continual trepidation render insupportable a situation which without this would be but troublesome enough 
7932_110056_000022_000000	train-clean-360	When we meet in the street a person of our acquaintance we salute them by bowing and uncovering ourselves if there is occasion 
none	none	Sometimes it is not enough to give a simple salutation but we must go to the person and inquire how they are if we see them frequently While we are speaking if there is occasion and it be a lady or an aged and respectable man we remain uncovered it is for the latter who see how troublesome this politeness is in winter to insist that the person addressing them should put on his hat It also belongs to the person who is the more important of the two to take leave first For example in a meeting of this kind a gentleman never leaves a lady until she takes leave of him nor is a young lady allowed to leave first a married or elderly lady 
7932_110056_000022_000005	train-clean-360	During this interview which should be very short the speaker of least importance ought to take the lower part of the side walk in order to keep the person with whom he is conversing from the neighborhood of the carriages 
none	none	It would be supremely ridiculous to enter into a long conversation and thus detain against their will the person accosted If we have anything urgent to say to them we may ask permission to accompany them 
7932_110056_000022_000008	train-clean-360	We will add that at Paris a young man ought to avoid approaching and even saluting a young lady of his acquaintance out of regard to the natural timidity of her sex 
none	none	If there is a stranger with the one whom we meet we must be contented with saluting the latter without stopping otherwise we put his companion in a disagreeable position 
7932_110056_000023_000001	train-clean-360	This civility becomes a rigorous duty if they are accompanied by a lady 
none	none	Ancient gallantry required that in this last case we not only should not stop but still more that we should not salute an acquaintance or friend who may pass this is in order not to force her companion to salute an unknown person for one should bow every time that the person bows with whom we are but this custom may be modified If it is a friend or young man one may be content with making merely a motion but if it be an elderly man a distinguished character or a lady it is necessary to salute them saying to the companion I take the liberty to salute mister or Madam N If a person of your acquaintance is at a window and you are thought to perceive them you ought to address a salutation to them But it is necessary to avoid speaking to them from the street or of making signs to them for this is a custom of bad ton To enter into a long conversation with common and low people who make their door step their parlor is to be almost as ill bred as they themselves are CHAPTER II Of different Kinds of Visits Visits are a very important part of the social relations they are not merely the simple means of communication established by necessity since they have at once for their object duty and pleasure and they enter into almost all the acts of life There are many kinds of visits but we shall confine ourselves to the principal ones as for those which only occur under peculiar circumstances the reader will find them mentioned in the course of this work The first are the visits on new year s day next visits of friendship and of ceremony we shall not speak of visits of business what we have said in speaking of propriety in relation to different professions will dispense with our entering into new details At the return of each new year custom and duty require us to present ourselves to our relations first afterwards to our patrons our friends and those who have done any kindness for us These visits are divided into several classes those of the evening or afternoon which are the most polite of the morning which are the most friendly and respectful by cards and presenting one s self and by cards without presenting one s self visits weekly which are confined to acquaintances with whom we have not very close relations monthly which are less ceremonious but however partake of coldness it is at Paris more than any other place that these visits are permitted such calls demand much attention to the toilet they should be as short as possible a visit of quarter of an hour is long enough and we should be careful to retire when other persons come in We should appear ridiculous to wish persons a happy new year in ceremonious visits I shall not mention friendly calls except to remind my readers that almost all ceremony should be dispensed with They are made at all hours without preparation without dressing a too brilliant attire would be out of place and if the engagements of the day carry you in such a costume at the house of a friend you ought obligingly to make an explanation Should you not find them at home do not leave a card such useless ceremony would astonish your friends Merely remind the domestics to mention your calling and do not leave your card except the servants are absent then the card should be rolled up and put in the key hole It will be well to call again soon With a friend or relation whom we treat as such we do not keep an account of our visits The one who has most leisure calls upon him who has the least but this privilege ought not to be abused it is necessary to make our visits of friendship at suitable times On the contrary a visit of ceremony should never be made without keeping an account of it and we should even remember the intervals at which they are returned for it is indispensably necessary to let a similar interval elapse People in this way give you notice whether they wish to see you often or seldom There are some persons whom one goes to see once in a month others once a fortnight c others however less frequently In order not to omit visits which are to be made or to avoid making them from misinformation when a preceding one has not been returned persons who have an extensive acquaintance will do well to keep a little memorandum for this purpose We cannot make ceremonious visits in a becoming manner if we have any slight indisposition which may for the time affect our appearance our voice which may embarrass our thoughts and render our company fatiguing such for instance as a swelled face a cold a slight headache in that case it would appear impolite and familiar On the contrary make visits of friendship under such circumstances and then you will appear more amiable and zealous To take a suitable time is as indispensable in visiting as in any thing else One can attain this by remembering the habits of the person he is going to see by making your arrangements so as not to call at the time of taking meals in moments of occupation and when our friends are walking This time necessarily varies but as a general rule we must take care not to make ceremonious visits either before the middle of the day or after five o clock To do otherwise would on the one hand look like importunity by presenting one s self too early and on the other might interfere with arrangements that had been made for the evening After making one s toilet with care visiters should furnish themselves with cards that is with small pieces of card or pasteboard upon which their name is printed or well written Gentlemen ought simply to put their cards in their pocket but ladies may carry them in a small elegant portfolio called a card case This they can hold in their hand and it will contribute essentially with an elegant handkerchief of embroidered battise to give them an air of good taste We shall here make a digression in relation to cards It was not considered impolite formerly to take the cards of a cast off pack cut them crosswise into three parts and write one s name upon them this however is now a subject of ridicule and is only seen in provincial towns where they sometimes also substitute for these cards small pieces of thick paper Next to these cards come those made of thin pasteboard smooth gilt edged watered and intended to have the name in writing These are suitable for young gentlemen and young ladies and they answer for half ceremonious visits After these come lithographic cards then printed ones and last those which are engraved Some cards are figured in a rich manner presenting every degree of expensive elegance Every one will choose these according to his taste but it is well to observe that cards ornamented with borders and those of the color of the rose and sky blue are not suitable for men nor for ladies of mature years because they have an air of over nicety The title is usually placed under the name and in large cities the address at the bottom of the card and in smaller letters Mourning cards are surmounted with a black margin half mourning ones are of a bright gray It is bad ton to keep the cards you have received around the frame of a looking glass such an exposure shows that you wish to make a display of the names of distinguished visiters At the beginning of a new year or when from some cause or other which multiplies visiters at your house such as a funeral or a marriage you are obliged to return these numerous calls it is not amiss to preserve the cards in a convenient place and save yourself the trouble of writing a list but if during the year your glass is always seen bristling with smoke dried cards it will be attributed without doubt to an ill regulated self esteem But let us return to our visiters If the call is made in a carriage the servant will ask if the lady you wish to see is at home If persons call in a hired carriage or on foot they go themselves to ask the servants Servants are considered as soldiers on duty if they reply that the person has gone out we should by no means urge the point even if we were certain it was not the case and if by chance we should see the person we should appear not to have noticed it but leave our card and retire When the servant informs us that the lady or gentleman is unwell engaged in business or dining we must act in a similar manner We should leave as many cards as there are persons we wish to see in the house for example one for the husband another for his wife another for the aunt c When admitted we should lay aside our over shoes umbrella cloak c in the ante chamber even ladies should lay aside their cloaks in the houses of distinguished persons In the provincial towns they commonly keep them on We then are announced by the servant if it is the custom of the house or at least we wait until without announcing us he opens the door of the apartment In case of the absence of the servants you ought not to enter immediately but knock gently with the finger and wait until some one opens the door or bids you come in If he does neither you open the door slowly and softly should you find no one do not go about and open other doors or pass into an inner room but retrace your steps immediately return to the ante room and remain until some one comes to give you an introduction If you are obliged to stay very long you can leave your card on a piece of furniture or with the porter This is a case of rare occurrence but it is well to provide for it in order not to be taken unawares When admitted a gentleman presents himself with his hat in his hand and advancing towards the lady salutes her gracefully and respectfully As soon as he observes the lady is looking for a seat to offer him he must lose no time in providing one for himself commonly a chair this he places towards the door by which he entered and at some distance from the lady to whom he should leave the upper part of the room He ought by no means to sit except she is seated and holding his hat upon his knee must not balance himself or sink down in his chair but preserve an easy polite and becoming attitude It would be familiar and bad ton to put down the hat or cane before the gentleman and particularly the lady of the house has invited you to do it Even then it is proper to refuse and not to do it until asked two or three times In putting down the hat we should not do it carelessly nor ought we to place it on a couch for this is impolite The couch which in ancient times was regarded as a sanctuary ought neither to be touched nor approached by a man It is best to put the hat on a bracket or chandelier stand c The lady of a house does not attempt to take the hats of gentlemen except she wishes to treat them with familiarity and this is seldom done in calls of pure ceremony These remarks will apply also to ladies Within fifteen years past it has been their custom to lay aside their hats and shawls but that supposes an intimacy which would authorize their abstaining from it at the houses of those with whom they are not much acquainted and if they are invited to lay them aside they should refuse The short time devoted to a ceremonious visit the necessity of consulting a glass in replacing the head dress and of being assisted in putting on the shawl prevent ladies from accepting the invitation to lay them aside If they are slightly familiar with the person they are visiting and wish to be more at ease they should ask permission which we should grant them at the same time rising to assist them in taking off their hat and shawl An arm chair or a piece of furniture at a distant part of the room should receive these articles they should not be placed upon the couch without the mistress of the house puts them there At the house of a person we visit habitually we can lay them aside without saying a word and a lady can even adjust her hair and handkerchief ficher before the glass provided she occupies only a few moments in doing it If the person you call upon is preparing to go out or to sit down at table you ought although he asks you to remain to retire as soon as possible The person visited so unseasonably should on her part be careful to conceal her knowledge that the other wishes the visit ended quickly We should always appear delighted to receive a visiter and should he make a short visit we must express to him our regret Ceremonious visits should be short if the conversation ceases without being again continued by the person you have come to see if she gets up from her seat under any pretext whatever custom requires you to make your salutation and withdraw If before this tacit invitation to retire other visiters are announced you should adroitly leave them without saying anything In case the master of the house in waiting upon you to the door should ask you to remain longer you should briefly reply to him that an indispensable engagement calls you and you must entreat him with earnestness not to detain you You should terminate your visit by briskly shutting the door If on entering the room you find strangers engaged in conversation content yourself with the few words which the master or mistress of the house shall address to you stop only a few moments make a general salutation and conduct yourself as in the preceding case When you have happened to meet the strangers elsewhere they may unite sometimes with the person you are visiting to prevent your taking leave reply in a polite and flattering manner but still persist in retiring If while you are present a letter is brought to the person you are visiting and she should lay it down without opening it you must entreat her to read it she will not do it and this circumstance will warn you to shorten your visit When you make a half ceremonious call and the person you are visiting insists upon your stopping it is proper to do so but after a few minutes you should rise to go if you are urged still further and are taken by the hands and made to sit down as it were by force to leave immediately would be impolite but nevertheless you must after a short interval get up a third time and then certainly retire If during your call a member of the family enters the room you need not on this account take leave but content yourself by rising and saluting the person If a lady you must not seat yourself until she sits down if a gentleman you can yield to the invitation made you to take your seat while the other remains standing If you make a visit with others there are some points to be observed in relation to your companions In going up the staircase it is rigorously the custom to give precedence to those to whom you owe respect and to yield to such persons the most convenient part of the stairs which is that next the wall Above all do not forget this last caution if you accompany a lady and a well bred gentleman at such a time should offer his arm When there are many persons he should bestow this mark of respect on the oldest If you meet any one on the staircase place yourself on the side opposite to the one he occupies It would be vexatious and out of place to make an everlasting ceremony as to who should be announced first the preference must be given to ladies next to them to age and rank The time of taking leave should be also determined by ladies or by aged persons and those who are of consequence It would be impolite to wish to retire before they gave the signal We should add that it is unsuitable for more than three or four to visit together Persons of high ton are accompanied even to the ante room by one or two servants who receive them again when going out To carry children or dogs with one on a visit of ceremony is altogether vulgar and provincial Even in half ceremonious visits it is necessary to leave one s dog in the ante room as well as the nurse who holds the infant for this circumstance alone excuses such a suite As to animals it is a thousand times better not to have them at all We justly reproach inhabitants of the province for lavishing salutations in meeting people or in taking leave of them This custom which may make us contract a reservedness or too much familiarity is extremely ridiculous Is it not difficult to keep one s countenance when we see a visiter salute every article of furniture to turn and turn again twenty times as you conduct him and pour forth at every pause a volley of salutations and adieus Our readers will beware of this over politeness they will salute the first time at the moment they take leave and again when the person who conducts them back shall have stopped at the door We have before said that when we do not find persons at home or when we are afraid of disturbing them we leave a card but this is not what we call particularly visits by card visites par cartes In these last visits it is not our object to see the persons since we do not ask for them and we confine ourselves to giving our card to the porter or domestic This custom which has been introduced necessarily among persons of very general acquaintance and especially at times when every one ought to be visited as on the new year s day this custom so far is not ridiculous but it becomes so by the great extent which has been given to it for some time past This extent consists in making a visit without leaving our apartment that is to say merely by sending our card by a domestic or indeed by means of an agency established for this purpose The practice of visits by cards seems to persons of good society the most impertinent and vulgar thing which can be imagined Do not then permit it except when the question is about returning visits made in this way and do not use such retaliations except to prevent these ill advised visiters from thinking that you put yourself out to oblige them In works devoted to the instruction of the laws of propriety we think only of fortune and affluence we entirely forget people of a more modest condition and when we find ourselves in connexion with them we cry out against their impoliteness It is an injustice and in my opinion a false calculation An injustice because true politeness pertains less to rank than to uprightness and goodness of heart a false calculation for to refuse to initiate people into what renders the social relations easy and agreeable is to prepare for ourselves collision and vexation and to retard as much as is in our power the practice of the forms of civilization Despising then this foolish disdain we shall applaud the great care of persons not in affluence who having neither porter nor domestic place at their door a slate furnished with a pencil that in their absence visiters may write their names for these visiters are seldom such as carry cards We shall applaud the benevolent care of persons whose staircase is not lighted or whose apartment is in the upper stories and who leave with the porter a candle which every one who arrives takes in order to ascend and returns it again on descending If any of our rich readers should be tempted to smile at the announcement of these precautions of the more humble citizens we would remind them that they are entirely strangers to the spirit of politeness of which these precautions are a striking example This digression naturally leads us to the second part of our task relative to visits concerning the duties which politeness imposes as to receiving them for it is not less important to receive people well than to present ourselves well to them Before passing to this important subject it would seem my duty to finish what remains for me to say concerning visits by the mention of visits of audience of congratulation of condolence and of repast but except the first to which I am going to devote a few words details of all the others will be found in the chapters devoted to conversation to formalities of repasts of mourning c We should not merely call upon ministers heads of the public administration and very distinguished persons we must beforehand request of them by writing a place of meeting and must specify the object of our visit We must call upon them at the appointed hour we must abstain from inquiring after their health and observe strictly the obligations of decorum These visits which are the acme of ceremony ought necessarily to be very short We shall see in the chapter on Epistolary Propriety what titles are proper to be given to these important personages It is well to be furnished with a letter of admission that in case of necessity we may show it to the servant CHAPTER III Of the Manner of Receiving Visitors To receive visitors with ease and elegance and in such a manner that everything in you and about you shall partake of propriety and grace to endeavor that people may always be satisfied when they leave you and desirous to come again such are the obligations of the master and especially of the mistress of a house Everything in the house ought as far as possible to offer English comfort and French grace Perfect order exquisite neatness and elegance which easily dispenses with being sumptuous ought to mark the entrance of the house the furniture and the dress of the lady In a house where affluence abounds it is indispensable to have a drawing room for it is troublesome and in bad ton to receive visits in a lodging room at one s own dwelling This may indeed do for a mere call but it becomes almost ridiculous when after dinner it is necessary to pass into this room to take coffee if you are receiving a small company c This custom is not any longer adopted except in the provincial towns and among persons who do not pride themselves on their good ton To receive company in a dining room is not allowed except among those persons who cannot bear the expense of furnishing a parlor or drawing room Simplicity admitted into an apartment of this kind suited to the smallness of their means we cannot but approve while we regret nevertheless the disagreeable things to which such a residence subjects them But we have in this respect an express warning to make to people who give themselves up to it unnecessarily for it is altogether opposed to the received usages of good society to put yourselves in a situation which you cannot adorn where you cannot place arm chairs a chimney piece a glass a clock and all things useful to persons who come to see you where you are exposed to receiving twenty visits during dinner of seeing as many interruptions during the setting of your table since it is impossible to spread the cloth while strangers remain finally of making them witnesses of your domestic cares while removing the remains of a repast the table cloth dishes c Young mothers of families who wish to have with them their children troublesome guests in a drawing room as every one knows think that they may remain in the dining room and have strangers conducted into an adjacent apartment That this may not be inconvenient it is necessary to observe three things first that strangers be admitted into this apartment before seeing the mistress of the house because they would not fail to create difficulties by saying that they did not wish to disturb her second that the apartment be constantly warmed in winter third that in summer it should be furnished precisely as an occupied chamber for nothing is worse than to conduct people into a room which seems to be to let Unless from absolute inability you ought to light your staircase If the practices of good domestic economy regulated by the cares of civilization were more generally extended a staircase not lighted would not often be found After having thus cast a rapid glance into the interior of the house let us see in what manner it is necessary to receive visitors When we see any one enter whether announced or not we rise immediately advance toward them request them to sit down avoiding however the old form of Take the trouble to be seated If it is a young man we offer him an arm chair or a stuffed one if an elderly man we insist upon his accepting the arm chair if a lady we beg her to be seated upon the ottoman If the master of the house receives the visitors he will take a chair and place himself at a little distance from them if on the contrary it is the mistress of the house and if she is intimate with the lady who visits her she will place herself near her If several ladies come at a time we give this last place to the one most distinguished by rank In winter the most honorable places are those at the corner of the fire place in proportion as they place you in front of the fire your seat is considered inferior in rank Moreover when it happens to be a respectable married lady and one to whom we wish to do honor we take her by the hand and conduct her to the corner of the fire place If this place is occupied by a young lady she ought to rise and offer her seat to the other lady taking for herself a chair in the middle of the circle A mistress of a house ought to watch anxiously that they experience no restraint before her consequently she will take care to present screens to the ladies seated in front of the fire she will move under their feet tabourets or what is better pads coussins but never foot stoves If she is alone with an intimate acquaintance she will request her to take hers but she will never extend this politeness to a gentleman If a door or window happens to be open in the room in summer time we should ask of visitors if it incommodes them If a lady who receives a half ceremonious visit is sewing she ought to leave off immediately and not resume it except at the request of the visitor If they are on quite intimate terms she ought herself to request permission to continue If a person visits in an entirely ceremonious way it would be very impolite to work even an instant Moreover even with friends we should hardly be occupied with our work but should seem to forget it on their account In proportion as the visitor is a stranger the master or mistress of the house rises and any persons who may be already there are obliged to do the same Some of them then withdraw in this case if the master and the mistress of the house have with them any persons of their family after having conducted as far as the door those who are going they request one of their relations to take their place If the case be otherwise it is necessary to choose between the persons who remain and those who retire If the latter are superior in rank age or consideration we must give them the preference and vice versa But however respectable the person be who departs we may dispense with conducting them farther than the door of the room The manner in which we should usually re conduct visitors is regulated in an invariable manner If it is a lady who is to be accompanied the master of the house takes her hand passes it under his arm and thus leads her as far as the bottom of the staircase unless the steps be so narrow that two cannot go abreast It is no longer the custom to give the hand to ladies but to offer them the arm This new custom does not at all change the ancient rule of propriety which requires that in descending a staircase we should give the side next the wall to the lady whom we accompany we commonly present to her the right arm provided however that necessity does not oblige us in order to avoid placing her next the balustrade to offer the left If she is to return in a carriage we should politely hand her into it In the provincial towns they conduct all or almost all visitors as far as the street door unless they are gentlemen and have visited a lady She ought then to accompany them as is always done in Paris that is to say as far as the door of the room or the head of the stairs Parisians add to this custom an agreeable civility they hold the door open and standing upon the threshold or edge of the staircase follow with their eyes the visitor until he turns round to make the last salutation or adieu or to request the host to return We no longer practice that frank and open hospitality of the provinces by virtue of which in the middle of winter we request people to refresh themselves with some solid eatables Such a proposal would now excite a smile We do not make any such offer to visitors but under these circumstances First during very hot weather we invite them to take a glass of syrup or of iced water Second if any one is reading we offer him eau sucree that is the little household article to which we have given that name Third we offer orange flower water to a lady who happens to be suddenly indisposed Excepting these cases we make no offer of this kind If any one wishes to refresh himself he requests the mistress of the house to allow him to ring the bell After assent is given he asks of the domestic who comes whatever he desires CHAPTER IV Of the Carriage of the Body The carriage of the body seems so simple so common and so easy a thing that undoubtedly on seeing this title many readers will think I design to send them back to puerile and plain civility But if they will take the pains to reflect upon the numberless violations of propriety in the carriage of the body of which they are daily witnesses if they will call to the mind the many strange motions ridiculous gestures pretending attitudes affected looks and clownish movements if they will recollect that the carriage of the body ought to be in perfect harmony with the situation age mind and sex and a distinguishing trait of the physiognomy if they will consider the unfavorable prejudices to which a disdainful immodest or vulgar deportment give rise they will understand my anxiety in this respect It is without doubt impossible to notice all faults in the carriage of the body This volume would not be sufficient for it we must be satisfied therefore with designating the principal ones To look steadily at any one especially if you are a lady and are speaking to a gentleman to turn the head frequently on one side and the other during conversation to balance yourself upon your chair to bend forward to strike your hands upon your knees to hold one of your knees between your hands locked together to cross your legs to extend your feet on the andirons to admire yourself with complacency in a glass to adjust in an affected manner your cravat hair dress handkerchief to remain without gloves to fold carefully your shawl instead of throwing it with graceful negligence upon a table c to fret about a hat which you have just left off to laugh immoderately to place your hand upon the person with whom you are conversing to take him by the buttons the collar of his coat the cuffs the waist c to seize ladies by the waist or to touch their person to roll the eyes or to raise them with affectation to take snuff from the box of your neighbor or to offer it to strangers especially to ladies to play continually with the seals of your watch a chain or a fan to beat time with the feet and hands to whirl round a chair on one leg to shake with your feet the chair of your neighbor to stroke your face rub your hands continually wink your eyes shrug up your shoulders stamp with your feet c all these bad habits of which we ought never to speak to people among those who are witnesses of them and are in the highest degree displeasing The carriage of the body is as expressive as the tone of voice and perhaps more so because it is more constant it betrays to the observer all the shades of character and we ought to be very careful of thus making a general confession by affected manners a pretending deportment sneering ways rough movements a hard countenance impertinent signs and looks simpering smiles clownish gestures a nonchalant and effeminate posture or a carriage of the body distinguished by prudery and stiffness Young ladies and very young men little habituated to the world ought to be on their guard against excessive timidity for it not only paralyzes their powers renders them awkward and gives them an almost silly air but it may even cause them to be accused of pride among people who do not know that embarrassment frequently takes the form of superciliousness How often does it happen that timid persons do not salute you at all answer in a low voice or very ill omit a thousand little duties of society and fail in a numberless agreeable attentions for want of courage These attentions and these duties they discharge in petto but who will thank them for it A proper degree of confidence but not degenerating into assurance still less into boldness or familiarity is then one of the most desirable qualities in the world To obtain which we most observe the ton and the manners of polite and benevolent people take them for our guides and under their direction make continual efforts to conquer our timidity Propriety in the carriage of the body is especially indispensable to ladies It is by this that in a walk a ball or any assembly people who cannot converse with them judge of their merit and their good education How many dancers move off and how many persons sigh with pity at the sight of a beautiful woman who has a mincing way affects grace inclines her head affectedly and who seems to admire herself incessantly and to invite others to admire her also Who ever makes up his mind to enter into conversation with an immovable lady and one who is formal and precise lengthening out the body pressing the lips and carrying back the elbows as if they were fastened to her side The gait of a lady ought neither to be too quick nor too slow the most easy and most convenient step is that which fatigues the least and pleases most The body and the head should be erect without affectation and without haughtiness the movements especially those of the arms easy and natural The countenance should be pleasant and modest It is not in good ton for a lady to speak too quick or too loud When seated she ought neither to cross her legs nor take a vulgar attitude She should occupy her chair entirely and appear neither too restless nor too immovable It is altogether out of place for her to throw her drapery around her in sitting down or to spread out her dress for display as upstarts do in order to avoid the least rumple But what is especially insupportable in this sex is an inquiet bold and imperious air for it is unnatural and not allowable in any case If a lady has cares let her conceal them from the world or not go into it Whatever be her merit let her not forget that she may be a man by the superiority of her mind and decision of character but that externally she ought to be a woman She ought to present herself as a being made to please to love and to seek a support a being inferior to man and near to angels An affectionate complying and almost timid aspect a tender solicitude for those who are about her should be shown in her whole person Her face should breathe hope gentleness and satisfaction dejection anxiety and ill humor should be constantly banished Before leaving a subject so fruitful I shall point out to my readers two examples of a bad position The one is a fashionable with his head stiff a borrowed air his leg strained out trembling lest he should disarrange the symmetry of his cravat and lest he should pucker his pantaloons his sleeve or the collar of his coat The other is an awkward person with his feet drawn together and placed upon the round of the chair his hands spread out upon his knees his shoulders sunk and his mouth half open Between these two caricatures there are many degrees which are ridiculous but which we leave to the sagacity of our readers to appreciate We come now to our instructions in respect to conversation They are so important that we think it our duty to divide them into two parts namely physical proprieties and moral proprieties CHAPTER V Of Physical Proprieties in Conversation This first division will comprehend the physical care of the organs we use in conversation our movements the manner of listening pronunciation and purity of speech in a grammatical view SECTION I Physical Observances in Conversation Conversation is the principal not to say the only means of pleasing and making our way in the world How does it happen then that so many persons converse without being troubled at the ridicule thrown upon themselves and the ennui they occasion their hearers without going into the inquiry whether they have not some physical qualities which present more or less obstacles to the art of conversing well or without thinking of the means of correcting them We shall point out some faults and the means of remedying them It is essential in speaking to be well on our guard not to protrude the tongue too near the edge of the lips This bad habit has many great inconveniences it occasions a kind of disagreeable hissing produced by the immediate contact of this organ as it passes the teeth and exposes us to throw out saliva thirteen When an unfortunate habit or too great a development of the tongue produces these accidents we should take care to keep this unlucky organ out of the way on one side of the gums or the other As to the fault which is opposite to this that is stammering by reason of too small size of the tongue we should practice when we are alone speaking distinctly To declaim and to exercise ourselves upon the words which present the greatest difficulties is a useful exercise There are some persons in whom the saliva is so abundant that it makes their pronunciation thick such persons should accustom themselves to swallow it before beginning to speak Politeness in accordance with health requires that our teeth should be perfectly clean A yellow and foul set of teeth which emit an odor will not suffer any one to be sensible to our grace or the eloquence of our language Feelings of disgust are without appeal Some persons who have fine teeth have the lamentable fault of showing them in speaking this ridiculous vanity excites laughter and besides injures the physiognomy it is not necessary to conceal the teeth to the utmost but always without affectation To use a tooth pick while speaking to carry the fingers to the gums to hold a flower between the teeth are habits of bad ton To open the mouth widely when one speaks especially when making an exclamation of wonder or surprise to draw the mouth on one side to give ourselves the air of an original to contract it in order to make it small to laugh violently in an unmeaning and boisterous manner to impart to the lips trembling and convulsive motions when any one relates or reads something sad or terrible to force our breath into the face of the person we are conversing with all these are shocking faults and insupportable grimaces thirteen When this accident happens to any one you must appear not to perceive it SECTION II Of Gestures To act a pantomine with every word cannot be tolerated extended or numerous gestures which do not accord with the conversation mysterious signs accompanying the announcement of the most simple thing abrupt gestures in friendly conversation mincing gestures in serious conversation rapid movements of the person sitting or standing and who seems to be performing a sort of a dance all these are equally great faults against propriety and good taste We should not absolutely condemn gestures which according to the Abbe Delille give physiognomy to our conversation Moderate action corresponding to our words and by turns a little comic lively and graceful are allowable and even indispensable The left hand must not move but a significant and exact company operation of the right hand should never be wanting in conversation but I must censure dialogists who put their hand into their pockets or work bags who always rest them joined or crossed without making any gesture Such persons give themselves the air of automatons while on the other hand excessive gesticulators have the appearance of madmen Those persons who in conversing violently seize hold of the arm of their chair play with little objects which come under their hands who amuse themselves by scratching or defacing furniture turning their hat backwards and forwards twisting and untwisting the strings of their bag or the ends of their cravat are without doubt ignorant how much opposed to politeness are these degrees of familiarity childishness and embarrassment I will briefly add that those who are witnesses of all these ridiculous actions ought never to notice them unless they wish to be still more ridiculous themselves SECTION III Of the Talent of Listening to Others To converse is not to talk continually as prattlers suppose it is to listen and speak in our turn we must not acquit ourselves the less well in the one than in the other To do this we should attend half of the time to the person who is addressing us on this account it is impolite to do any work while talking if they hesitate or are embarrassed you should appear not to notice it and in case you are a little acquainted after a few moments you should in a very modest manner supply the word which seems to have escaped them If they are interrupted by any incident when the cause of the interruption shall have ceased you will not wait until they resume the conversation but with a smile of benevolence and an engaging gesture request them to proceed please to continue you were just saying If we are obliged in this manner to palliate any such interruption much more ought we never to allow ourselves to be the cause of it This is so rigorous a rule that if in the warmth of conversation two persons commence speaking at once both ought to stop immediately when they perceive it and each while excusing themselves to decline proceeding It is proper for the one worthy of the most respect to resume the conversation If a person shall relate anything to you who without having any pleasantry makes attempts at it and without being affecting endeavors to move you however wearied you may be appear pleased and assume an air of interest If the narrator wanders into long digressions have patience to let him extricate himself alone from the labyrinth of his story If the history is interminable be resigned and do not appear less attentive This condescension is especially to be observed if you are listening to an elderly or respectable person If the merciless story teller is your equal or friend you may say to him in order to induce him to finish his narration and finally Novices in the customs of the world think they can abruptly interrupt a conversation which is begun by asking to have some incidents which they have not understood explained or by making the person who is telling the story repeat the names this should not be done until after some consideration and in the most polite manner If the narrator pronounces badly if you see that other hearers are in the same situation as yourself if you foresee that for want of having followed him in his narration you will not be able to reply with politeness you can in this case interrupt but in some such manner as this I ask your pardon Sir I fear I have lost some part of your interesting conversation will you be kind enough to repeat it c It is necessary also to choose a favorable moment as for instance when the narrator pauses hesitates for a word or stops to take his handkerchief When a person relates to you a plain falsehood the art of listening becomes embarrassing for if you seem to believe it you would pass for a fool and if you appear to doubt it you will pass for an uncivil person An air of coldness a slight attention an expression like the following That is astonishing will extricate you honorably from your embarrassment but when an event is narrated which is only extraordinary or not improbable your manner should be otherwise Your countenance should express astonishment and you should reply by a phrase of this kind If I did not know your strict regard for the truth or if any person but you had told me this I should have hardly believed it Under no circumstances should you interrupt him It happens sometimes that you foresee some incident in an interesting story and the pleasure that you find in this the desire of showing that you have guessed correctly and the intention of proving how much you are interested induce you to interrupt suddenly in this manner I see it it is so exactly An interruption of this kind although well meant and natural will offend old persons who like to tell a story at full length and will confound formal narrators who will be in despair that a phrase is taken from them which they had intended for effect these interruptions are only allowable among our intimate friends or inferiors for otherwise you will have an ill humored answer to your I see it c as with a triumphant air egad but you can t see it c which is always embarrassing The worst kind of interruption of all others is that which hauteur dictates A clever person seizing hold of a story which another is telling and with the intention of making it more lively becomes notwithstanding his eloquence a model of impertinence and vulgarity It is doubtless hard to see a fool spoil a good anecdote of which he might have made something interesting but if we should not be restrained by politeness from expressing our feelings we ought to be by interest Now hearers of delicacy will remain silent to the conclusion of the recital and will address themselves with good feelings to the poor narrator who is injured in his rights Interruption is pardonable if it is made to prove or clear up a fact in favor of a person who is absent When they accuse you you can according to strict rules interrupt by an exclamation but it is better to do it by a gesture There is often much art and grace in listening while you gesticulate gently for example by counting upon the fingers by making a gesture of surprise by a motion of assent or an exclamation This is a tacit manner of saying ah I recollect you are right and charms the narrator without interrupting him In a lively animated and friendly dialogue we can interrupt each other by turns in order to finish a sentence which is begun or to improve an epithet this contributes to vivacity in discourse but it ought not however to be too often repeated There are many shoals to be avoided in listening and which always betray inexperience in society To say from time to time to the narrator Yes yes by nodding the head making motions with the hand a custom of old persons and which is a good representation of a pendulum to keep the eyes fixed and the mouth gaping open to have an air of an absent person or of one in a reverie to point the finger at persons designated by the narrator to gape without concealing by the hand or the handkerchief which is by no means flattering to the speaker to cast your eye frequently towards the clock all these habits are offences against good ton SECTION IV Of Pronunciation Pronunciation is still more indispensable in conversation than elocution for indeed before selecting our expressions we must make them understood and one can do this but imperfectly if he pronounces badly From this fault arise forced repetitions the loss of what is appropriate fatigue disgust the impatience of the two persons speaking and in fine all the sad results of deafness Should we not use every effort to rid ourselves of this The first the greatest impediment to pronouncing well is volubility By speaking too fast we speak confusedly and utter inarticulate and unintelligible sounds and this without dispute is of all the faults in pronunciation the most insupportable We know very well that to speak too slowly and as they say to listen to our own words is a caprice which seems to denote pride or nonchalance and that in certain cases it is necessary to speak quickly but we ought never to speak precipitately even on subjects which require us to be brief Besides the physical inconvenience indistinctness has other moral inconveniences it supposes heedlessness loquacity or foolishness Next comes hesitancy which is little less troublesome for it fills the conversation with ridiculous and painful efforts This defect which is sometimes owing to the organization happens still more frequently from neglecting to think before we speak from timidity from some lively emotion which obliges us to stammer or from a formal anxiety to make use of select terms This last motive is almost an excess With the intention of pleasing persons you weary them by repetitions by far fetched mincing words and in order to appear clever you render yourself excessively annoying The habits acquired in childhood and in small towns and a provincial accent are frequently obstacles to good pronunciation let us instance some examples of this It is not uncommon to hear even among those who are considered as correct speakers in general such a misuse of words as the following Me for I Miss for Mrs set for sit sat out for set out expect of a passed event lay for lie shew for showed would for should hadn t ought for ought not c As to accent each province has its peculiarities To discover it to shun it and to modify it by an opposite effort are the means of avoiding these shoals but however ridiculous we may appear in running upon them continually we are a hundred times less so than those people who like true pedagogues stop you in the midst of an affecting recital to repeat with a sardonic smile a vulgar phrase a word badly pronounced or a wrong accent which happens to escape you Not only among persons of good society should we condemn pedantry in pronunciation but we ought moreover with Rousseau to blame over nicety of pronunciation or purism He could not tolerate and many others like him those people so particular in sounding every letter of a word fourteen Besides a general accent there is also a particular accent which gives a shade to the words when we express a sentiment We feel all its delicacy and its charm but we feel also that it ought to be in perfect harmony with the language that it ought to be free from all affectation and all exaggeration To utter hard things in a tone of mildness to display in a humble voice proud pretensions to open a political discussion in a caressing tone to recount an affair of pleasantry with a melancholy accent is ridiculous in the highest degree It is no less so to force the accent to pervert it into irony or to introduce into discourse a sort of declamation or tone We cannot judge by the accent of a person who speaks too high or too low but we decide in the first case that he is vulgar and in the second that he is disdainful fourteen The examples in the original are the final letters of the words tabac sang estomac In English some persons are as scrupulous in the distinct pronunciation of every letter in such words as extra ordinary Wed nes day c T SECTION V Of Correctness in Speaking Surtout qu en vos discours la langue reveree In addressing this advice to readers we shall beware of considering them as strangers to the rules of grammar it is so shameful at the present day to be ignorant of one s own language that it would not be less so to suspect others of not knowing it but although we may not be deprived of this indispensable knowledge it is still necessary carefully to beware of contracting bad habits in language of using bad phrases and even of using terms of which we know not the import a little study and attention will afford a certain remedy to the embarrassment which we might experience Young people cannot too much guard against these faults which show an education that has been little attended to They will arrive at it by studying a good grammarian and by paying attention to the sense of their words If in the silence of the study we have much trouble in rendering correctly a long sentence how must it be in the world when the earnestness of conversation prevents us from reflecting To make long phrases is to be willing to make mistakes in language and if we take time to present these interminable sentences in a correct form we only appear the more clumsy or the more pretending for conversation ought never to seem labored and the expression and the thoughts ought to be of a simultaneous casting Avoid the pronouns who which particularly when they are interrogatives for although the grammar does not absolutely condemn their frequency yet as it is useless and disagreeable to the ear we should endeavor to avoid it Thus instead of who is it who did such a thing what is this thing that is here say who did such a thing what is this thing Persons who are careful of their conversation avoid as faults of language expressions which certainly do not deserve this title but which injure the clearness elegance and harmony of conversation Thus they will abstain from uniting those words which being in conflict as to their meaning and pronunciation make an ambiguity except when written They carefully beware of accumulating synonymes and epithets profusely or at least of forgetting with regard to these last the laws of gradation of multiplying adverbs which burden and weaken discourse they pay great attention to the requirements of euphony and in order to this avoid bringing near to each other words of similar sound and of repeating similar words even of the same meaning such as at present we offer a present it does a good deal of good These scrupulous and privileged talkers are particularly careful of the connecting particles for they know how much their omission injures euphony how it causes persons who are little charitable to believe that it is a covering under which are adroitly concealed doubt or ignorance and this opinion is not always a prejudice I had forgotten to say that our skilful talkers endeavor not to furnish by fortuitous coincidences of words opportunities for puns that in the mode of their conversation they avoid rhymes so unfortunate and even ridiculous in prose that they dread repetitions of phrases and axioms as the repetitions of words that by short and judicious pauses they mark the punctuation in the spoken as in the written language finally that they endeavor to render their conversation clear correct and elegant but these talking models would be in less danger of defeating their object if they had less of the precise air of a pedagogue So far from this if a grammatical error escapes them they quickly correct it but with ease and gaiety If they hear a gross grammatical error they do not allow themselves even a smile or a look which could indicate their feeling or trouble the one guilty of the error CHAPTER VI Of the Moral Observances in Conversation Goodness moderation and decorum these are the motto and the soul of moral propriety in conversation A solicitude to be always agreeable and obliging of observing a proper medium in everything of respecting the rights of others even in the most trifling things susceptibility for every thing which is connected with delicacy piety and modesty all these qualities which belong to politeness are included in these expressive words goodness moderation decorum SECTION I Of Formal and Vulgar Usages In the first rank of customary formalities we place those concerning information about the health 
7962_110061_000005_000001	train-clean-360	We shall necessarily have little to say on this head there are however some little rules which are not to be neglected 
7962_110061_000006_000000	train-clean-360	It is proper to vary the phraseology of these formal questions as much as possible and we must abstain from them entirely towards a superior or a person with whom we are but little acquainted for such inquiries presuppose some degree of intimacy 
7962_110061_000006_000001	train-clean-360	In the last case there is a method of manifesting our interest without violating etiquette it consists in making these inquiries of the domestics or of other persons of the house and of saying afterwards when introduced I am happy Sir to hear that you are in good health 
none	none	Custom forbids a lady to make these inquiries of a gentleman unless he is ill or very aged 
7962_110061_000007_000001	train-clean-360	To put a corrective upon this mark of regard a lady who addresses a gentleman should be earnest in her inquiries of the health of his family however little intimacy she may have with them 
7962_110061_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Many persons ask this question mechanically without waiting for the answer or else hasten to reply before they have received it 
none	none	This is in bad ton Inquiries about the health it is true are frequently unimportant but they should appear to be dictated by attention and kindness We must not however be deceived but be careful not to mention a slight indisposition to persons who are strangers to us because their interest can be only formal After we are informed of the health of the person we are visiting it is proper to inquire of them in relation to the health of their families but it would be wearisome to them to make a long enumeration of the members who compose the family 
7962_110061_000008_000001	train-clean-360	We can put a general question designating the most important members 
7962_110061_000008_000002	train-clean-360	In case of the absence of near relations we ask the person we are visiting if they have heard from them lately if the news is favorable 
7962_110061_000008_000003	train-clean-360	They on their part ask the same of us 
none	none	When you are not on visits of great ceremony at the time of taking leave you are commonly desired to give the compliments and salutations of the persons you are visiting to those with whom you live then you should reply briefly but give them assurances of your regard and thank them 
7962_110061_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Politeness infuses into visits of some little ceremony a coloring of modesty grace and deference which should be preserved with the greatest care 
none	none	In speaking it is always proper to give the name of Sir Madam or Miss and if the sentence is somewhat long the title ought to be repeated If the question is with regard to answering in the affirmative or negative we ought never to say roughly yes or no If the person addressed has a title or that which he has from his profession we should give it him as Count Doctor c In case we meet with many persons of the same profession we can then distinguish them adding their name to the title A lady will not say my husband except among intimates in every other case she should address him by his name calling him Mr It is equally good ton that except on occasions of ceremony and while she is quite young to designate him by his christian name But when one speaks to a gentleman of the lady to whom he is married he should not say your wife unless he is intimately acquainted but Mrs such a one is the most proper 
7962_110061_000014_000001	train-clean-360	The rules of politeness in this respect are the same in speaking of the husband 
none	none	When we speak of ourself and another person whether he is absent or present propriety requires us to mention ourselves last Thus we should say he and I you and I When you relate a personal occurrence the circumstances connected with which are honorable to yourself and a distinguished person had also a share in the honor you should only mention him and instead of the plural form we resolved we did such a thing you should forget yourself and say Mr N resolved or did such a thing so and so Delicacy will dictate this degree of modesty to you and your superior in his turn will proclaim at his own expense your merit on the occasion We know that the word false is not to be found in the dictionary of politeness and that when we are obliged to deny the assertion of any one we employ apologetical forms The most proper ones are such as the following I may be mistaken I am undoubtedly mistaken but Be so good as to excuse my mistake but it seems to me I ask pardon but I thought c Those persons are but ill bred who think to soften down a denial merely by expressions of doubt They say if what you advance is true if what madam says is positive c 
7962_110061_000017_000004	train-clean-360	With these forms they think they comply with the rules of politeness 
7962_110061_000017_000005	train-clean-360	It is incivility with affectation 
none	none	However persons may say invidiously that forms avail much in the world I agree with them but in quite another sense We should never ask a thing of any one without saying will you have the goodness will you do me the favor will you be so good c In a circle we should not pass before a lady and should never present any thing by extending the arm over her but we pass round behind and present it In case we cannot do it we say I ask your pardon c To a question which we do not fully comprehend we never answer Ha What but Be so good as c Pardon me I did not understand Never refuse with disdain a pinch of snuff and rather than disoblige people take one even if you throw it away after having pretended to take it Beware of presenting to ladies in balls or assemblies a box of sweet things under penalty of having the air of a caricature 
7962_110061_000022_000000	train-clean-360	If you strike against any one in the least ask pardon for it immediately 
none	none	The other should at the same time answer you It is nothing nothing at all c even if the blow should have been violent 
7962_110061_000023_000000	train-clean-360	It is customary to employ the few moments of a visit of mere politeness in looking at the portraits which adorn the fireplace and even taking them down if you are invited to do it 
none	none	It would be the extreme of impoliteness to say that they were flattered or to pretend to recognize in the portrait of a young lady the likeness of an elderly lady or of one less favored by nature 
7962_110061_000023_000002	train-clean-360	It would moreover be improper to make long compliments indirect and ingenious praise is all that is proper 
none	none	SECTION II Of Questions and frequently recurring Expressions It is an axiom of propriety that we should never speak of ourselves except to intimate friends and that we should converse with strangers about themselves and everything which can interest them 
7962_110061_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Questions are therefore necessary but they demand infinite delicacy and tact in order neither to fatigue nor ever wound the feelings 
none	none	If instead of expressing a mild and heartfelt interest you ask a dry question dictated by a cold curiosity if you seem to pay no attention to the answers which you call forth if you mal adroitly take a commanding tone if you prolong without bounds this kind of conversation if perceiving that you are embarrassed and that you endeavor to save yourself by an evasive answer instead of keeping silence you witness the foolish regrets of your indiscretion be assured that both your questions and yourself will be considered as a torment 
7962_110061_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Madame Necker ingeniously observes that these favorite and frequently repeated terms with which we fill our conversation serve ordinarily as a mark of people s character 
none	none	Thus says she those who exceed the truth are in the habit of saying You may rely upon it it is the truth long talkers say In a word to be brief and the proud say Without boasting c This striking observation is well founded and consequently we ought to take good care not to let people into the secret of our peculiarities But independently of this motive it is necessary for us carefully to avoid frequently recurring words as in time habit multiplies them to an inconceivable degree 
7962_110061_000028_000001	train-clean-360	They embarrass and overwhelm our conversation turn away the attention of those who listen to us and render us importunate and ridiculous without our being able to perceive it 
none	none	If habitual terms which on no other account are reprehensible can become so troublesome what results may these trite phrases trivial expressions and vulgar transitions produce when they become frequent SECTION III Of Narrations Analysis and Digressions 
7962_110061_000032_000000	train-clean-360	There are many conditions indispensable to the success of a narrative These conditions are first novelty the best stories weary when they are multiplied too much because every one wishes to be an actor in his turn upon the stage of the world 
none	none	So that when you have anything excellent to relate consult less your own desire to tell it than the wishes of others to hear you 
7962_110061_000032_000002	train-clean-360	There are but too many people who discover the secret of wearying while telling very good things on account of their too great eagerness to tell them 
7962_110061_000033_000000	train-clean-360	The next thing is to take a suitable opportunity 
none	none	Let your narration spring naturally from the conversation let it explain a fact or come in support of an opinion but let it never appear to be introduced by the foolish pleasure of talking or by a not less foolish desire of making a display of talent Remember that the most meagre recitals when they are apropos frequently please more than the best things in the world when they are said out of time And even endeavoring to monopolize the conversation is in bad ton particularly for young persons and ladies especially if it is but a few moments since they occupied the attention of the company It is an agreeable and modest mark of propriety to request some one to relate an anecdote of the day of which you have made mention and the circumstances of which you desire to know This is well suited to persons of distinguished talents The person called upon bows and excuses himself with a few words before acceding to your request It is of all importance that the language correspond to the different forms which the narration requires that under pretext of adorning our story we do not wander into far fetched comparisons dull details or interminable dialogues that if we relate anything amusing or striking we should observe the utmost seriousness and finally before commencing a recital of this kind we keep in mind these lines of Lafontaine Il ne faut jamais dire aux gens Ecoutez un bon mot oyez une merveille Savez vous si les ecoutans En feront une estime a la votre pareille When for want of observing this as well as many other similar rules narrators fail of the expected effect and think to be able to tell it over again and remarking on the comic part of the story and laboring to repeat it thus Do you not think this excellent wonderful Alas they only add to their own defeat and to the ennui of their poor hearers If one relates an anecdote which you already know permit him to finish it and do not in any way draw off the attention of those who are listening 
7962_110061_000037_000001	train-clean-360	If your opinion is asked give it frankly and without wishing to appear better informed than the narrator himself 
none	none	Still farther if you happen to be in tete a tete with the same narrator observe the same silence and listen with an air of interest and if he happens to impart to you what he related the preceding day which he had from you yourself you should appear to listen with equal interest as if for the first time 
7962_110061_000037_000003	train-clean-360	Frequently in the midst of a recital the narrator through forgetfulness hesitates and thinks that he can recall it 
7962_110061_000037_000004	train-clean-360	Look at him attentively 
7962_110061_000037_000005	train-clean-360	If he is in doubt declare that you are altogether ignorant of the subject in question 
none	none	If his memory returns request him to continue at the same time saying I listen to you always with new pleasure 
7962_110061_000037_000007	train-clean-360	This delicate politeness is particularly to be observed towards old persons 
7962_110061_000038_000000	train-clean-360	When your narrations have had success keep a modest countenance leave others to point out the striking parts which have pleased them 
7962_110061_000038_000001	train-clean-360	The surest means of not having the approbation of others in actions as well as other things is to solicit it whether it be by looks or by words 
none	none	As every hearer is obliged to listen or understand without objecting the consequence is that we should feel our ground before speaking and ask if such or such a thing is known to the company When a story has been published in the newspapers so that it is not entirely new or seems borrowed from a compilation of anas if we attribute it to some person of our acquaintance of course one that is absent an ineffable ridicule very properly stigmatizes the narrator We come now to what seems to me the most difficult part of conversation and if you are not sure of being able to class your ideas with regularity to express them with much clearness and an easy elegance do not have the temerity to wish to analyze a book or a dramatic piece You would be laying up for yourself a rude mortification which would have an unfavorable influence on your entree into society You would be wrong however in concluding that I condemn you to perpetual silence I only wish to inspire you with a salutary diffidence in order to preserve you from such a rude check and to put it in your power some future day to answer in this particular the wishes of a distinguished and brilliant assembly Begin by putting down upon paper a hasty sketch of a short piece as for instance a vaudeville or a little comedy You will do this until being sure of the manner in which you would embrace the ensemble and dispose of the details you can produce it without embarrassment 
7962_110061_000041_000002	train-clean-360	When arrived at this point abstain from these kinds of analysis which though indeed more correct seem labored 
7962_110061_000041_000003	train-clean-360	They have besides less freedom appropriateness and grace 
7962_110061_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Know this and remember it well that every other preparation than thinking what you are about to say will make you acquire two intolerable faults affectation and stiffness 
none	none	To conclude I give this advice only to those persons who by a quick and penetrating perception by a love of the fine arts and by a peculiar readiness find themselves able to speak properly of literary productions 
7962_110061_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Those who are less engaged in these things should content themselves with simply and briefly explaining a subject and of mentioning the emotion they felt with speaking of some brilliant passage and adding that they do not pretend to pronounce judgment 
7962_110061_000045_000000	train-clean-360	The first degree of digression is the parenthesis provided it is short natural and seldom repeated and that you take care to announce it always and finally in order not to abuse it you should make a skilful use of it 
none	none	The second degree of digression becomes more nice for it includes those accessory reflections those common but agreeable and well settled expressions those general or particular allusions which are only to be used with a peculiar emphasis which is to language what the italic character is to printing 
7962_110061_000045_000002	train-clean-360	This method of speaking in italics may be striking and artless but it often becomes obscure and trivial the habit is dangerous and one should use this difficult digression only before intimate friends 
none	none	We now come to the third degree to what is properly called digression most frequently it is involuntary Often in a lively and animated dialogue the impetus of conversation carries you as well as the person with whom you are conversing far from the point from which you started If it is a question of pleasure or interest return to your point by employing a polite turn as Pray let us not lose sight of our business 
7962_110061_000046_000002	train-clean-360	But if it is an affair of nothings succeeding nothings let it flow on 
none	none	Voluntary digression when it is not a mere work of loquacity may be employed in serious discourse as political philosophical or moral discussions but it is important to treat it with infinite reserve and care and never to introduce a personal apology or a domestic incident altogether out of place as those persons do who in narrating any event relative to an individual recount his life their connexion with him or his whole family and make the event of an hour remind us of ages 
7962_110061_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Lawyers literary people military men travellers invalids and aged ladies ought to have a prudent and continual distrust of the abuse of digressions 
none	none	SECTION IV Of Suppositions and Comparisons 
7962_110061_000051_000000	train-clean-360	The two shoals to be avoided in this form of language are directly opposed to each other the one is triviality the other bombast 
none	none	The object of supposition which is already antiquated and sometimes too simple is to increase the force of reasoning and to carry conviction to the mind of the person who listens to you comparison tends to make an image or to place before us the object described When both these qualities are regulated by reason use and taste it is very well but how seldom is this the case 
7962_110061_000053_000000	train-clean-360	They are not so used if in the course of a discussion you suppose a respectable person to supply the place of a madman an ill bred person or a robber or if you suppose him to be in a situation disgraceful or even ridiculous 
none	none	As for example If you had been this bad person or Suppose that you had committed this base act or that you should be laughed at c They are also misplaced whenever being satisfied with avoiding disagreeable comparisons we endeavor to mark out some one as contemptible by comparing his exterior with that of some other person in the company When we say This unfortunate man is of your size sir he has your traits your physiognomy c They are also misplaced if used in the presence of people of a profession upon which the injurious comparisons fall as when we say As quackish as a doctor greedy as an attorney loquacious as a lawyer c Finally politeness and taste cannot at all exist in comparisons if they are common or trivial as when we say black as the chimney back high as one s hand c or if they are in a turgid and pretending style such as learned as the Muses fresh as the meadows c SECTION V Of Discussions and Quotations Whatever be the subject of conversation propose your opinion with modesty defend it with sangfroid and a mild tone if you are opposed yield with a good grace if you are wrong yield also although you are in the right if the subject of discussion is of little importance and especially if the one who opposes you is a lady or an old person Moreover if love of truth or the desire of affording instruction force you to enter into a discussion do it with address and politeness 
7962_110061_000059_000001	train-clean-360	If you do not bring over your opponent to your own opinion you will at least gain his esteem 
7962_110061_000060_000000	train-clean-360	But if you have to do with one of those people who possessed with a mania of discussion commence by contradicting before they hear and who are always ready to sustain the contrary opinion yield to him you will have nothing to gain with him 
7962_110061_000060_000001	train-clean-360	Be assured that the spirit of contradiction can be conquered only by silence 
none	none	The insupportable pedantry of a cloud of quoters without tact or talent has justly for a long time thrown quotations into disrepute but if they are well chosen few and short if they are a propos Qui fuit comme le temps qui plait comme les graces if they are altogether new and wielded by a person possessed of modesty elegance and taste having a perfect knowledge of the world quotations have much success and charm but without these conditions there is little safety and in this matter there can be no mediocrity you will either be a good model or an insupportable pedant Consider if you will rashly run this chance especially on making your debut in society when young persons ought so carefully to avoid making a parade of a vain college erudition and not seek the reputation of a savant by employing words borrowed from foreign languages or scientific terms unknown in good society SECTION VI Of Pleasantry Proverbs Puns and Bon Mots If society is not a school for exercising pedantry neither is it an arena for the use of those perversely clever people who think themselves furnished with a patent to insult with grace Whatever may be the keenness of their sarcasms the piquancy of their observations or the smile which they excite in me I do not the less refuse to allow to those caustic spirits the name of polite persons or of good ton for in politeness there must be good feeling But those who incessantly study to trouble and wound people without taking any precaution except to deprive them of the right or means of complaining who are ready to catch at the least error to exaggerate it to clothe it in the most bitter language to present it in the most ridiculous light who meanly attack those who cannot answer them or expose themselves every day for a sarcasm to sport with their own life and that of another in a duel such people what are they in truth I dare not say One such picture which certainly is not highly colored would render pleasantries always odious but to indulge in pleasantry is not to resemble such mischievous persons thank heaven it is far otherwise for mild kind and harmless pleasantry should be taken in good part even by those who are the subjects of it it is a friendly and sportive contest in which severity jealousy and resentment should never appear whenever you perceive the least trace of them the pleasantry is at an end desist then the moment they appear As to hoaxing that caustic of fools as to that silly gaiety excited by the candor or politeness of people whom you falsely cause to believe the most foolish things because they do not make known to you that they see through this pleasure of stupid fellows I have nothing to say of them except that I have too good an opinion of my reader to suppose that he does not despise them as I do 
7962_110061_000069_000000	train-clean-360	Popular quotations and proverbs as well as other quotations require some care and except in familiar conversation are altogether misplaced 
7962_110061_000069_000001	train-clean-360	If they are frequent conversation becomes a tedious gossipping if introduced without a short previous remark one of two things will take place they will either prevent the speaker from being understood or they will give him the air of Sancho Panza 
none	none	But the previous remark however need be but short as the proverb says as the wisdom of nations has it 
7962_110061_000069_000003	train-clean-360	A proverb well applied and placed at the end of a phrase frequently makes a very happy conclusion 
7962_110061_000070_000000	train-clean-360	I only speak to censure I entreat my readers not to suffer themselves to be the manufacturers of puns and to despise this talent of fools and childish means to excite a passing laugh 
none	none	Not that we cannot repeat in good company one of those rare political bon mots which are happy in every respect nor that we ought to deprecate this kind of pleasantry before people who are fond of them still less to tell them what they hear every day That is poor to have taste does not authorize us to be impolite We must be much more severe upon another kind of equivoques namely those which offend modesty Propriety allows you and it even requires you not to listen to but even to interrupt an ill bred person who importunes you with those indecent witticisms which a man of good society ought always to avoid they are those by aid of which we cover certain pleasantries with a veil so transparent that they are the more observed 
7962_110061_000071_000002	train-clean-360	What pleasure can we find in causing ladies to blush and in meriting the name of a man of bad society 
none	none	There are those who think that they may allow themselves every kind of pleasantry before certain persons but a man of good ton ought to observe it wherever he is We might quote more than one example of persons who have lost politeness of manners and of language by assuming the habits and conversation of all kinds of society into which chance may have carried them 
7962_110061_000072_000002	train-clean-360	It requires but a moment to lose those delicate shades of character which constitute a man of the world and which cost us so much labor to acquire 
none	none	It is a great error to suppose that we must always shine in conversation and that it is better to make ourselves admired by a lively and ready repartee than to content ourselves sometimes with silence or with an answer less brilliant than judicious fifteen We must not imagine that all traits of wit are in the class of politeness a vain and triumphant air spoils a bon mot moreover when you repeat a thing of this kind of which you are the author beware of saying so to your auditors fifteen That a reply may be truly pleasing it is necessary that he who makes it has a right so to do and that we may quote it without doing him any wrong otherwise we should laugh at the reply and despise the author of it There are replies which are pleasing in the mouth of a military man but which would be ridiculous in the mouth of a civil magistrate A young lady may make lively and brilliant repartees which would be insupportable in a woman in the decline of life as the latter might make such as would be unsuitable in a young lady SECTION VII Of Eulogiums Complainings Improprieties in general and Prejudices One of the most improper things is to praise to excess and unseasonably Extravagant and misplaced eulogiums neither honor the one who bestows them nor the persons who receive them An infallible method of giving a meritorious person the air of a fool is to address him to his face and without disguise to load him with exaggerated eulogiums it is indeed not a little embarrassing to reply in such a case 
7962_110061_000078_000001	train-clean-360	If we remain silent we appear to be inhaling the incense with complacency if we repel it we only seem to excite it the more 
7962_110061_000078_000002	train-clean-360	Thus we see in such a case and even among very clever persons too those who reply by silly exclamations and by rude assertions 
none	none	You were laughing at me they say this cannot be tolerated it is to be supposed that the person who praises you is incapable of such an act I think it would be better to say I did not know you were so kind or so good I should indeed think you were joking me Or else we should say your partiality blinds you Persons who are unacquainted with the world commonly think that they cannot address a lady without first assailing her with compliments 
7962_110061_000079_000001	train-clean-360	This is a mistake gentlemen and I can with relation to this point reveal to you what my sex prefers to these vulgar eulogiums 
none	none	It is in bad ton to overwhelm with insipid flattery all women that we meet without distinction of age rank or merit These insipidities may indeed please some of light and frivolous minds but will disgust a woman of good sense Carry on with them a lively piquant and varied conversation and remember that they have a too active imagination a too great versatility of disposition to support conversation for a long time upon the same subject 
7962_110061_000081_000000	train-clean-360	But is it then necessary to proscribe eulogiums entirely 
none	none	Not at all society has not yet arrived at that degree of philosophy eulogiums are and will for a long time be a means of success but they should be in the first place true or at least probable in order not to have the appearance of outrageous insults they should be indirect and delicate that we may listen to them without being obliged to interrupt and they should be tempered with a sort of judgment the skilful use of which is itself even a eulogium 
7962_110061_000082_000000	train-clean-360	I repeat as I have often said let there be moderation in everything 
none	none	Should we not regard as gross and ridiculous language that exaggeration which we frequently hear used in praise as well as in censure It seems that true politeness in language consists principally in a certain moderation of expressions 
7962_110061_000083_000002	train-clean-360	It is much better to cause people to think more than we say and not outrage language and run the risk of going beyond what we ought to say 
7962_110061_000084_000000	train-clean-360	Under any circumstances complaining has always a bad grace 
none	none	Banish from your complaints ill nature and animosity let your anger be only an expression of the wrong you have suffered and not of that which you would cause this is the surest means of gaining to your side persons who would perhaps be doubtful whether to favor your adversary or yourself 
7962_110061_000086_000000	train-clean-360	Politeness is not less opposed to making excessive complaints to the first person you meet than to the frequent and extravagant eulogiums which you bestow improperly upon those from whom you expect a favor in return 
7962_110061_000087_000000	train-clean-360	By the word improprieties we generally understand all violations of politeness 
7962_110061_000087_000001	train-clean-360	We however give to this word a particular and limited sense 
7962_110061_000087_000002	train-clean-360	It signifies a want of due regard to and a forgetfulness of the delicate attentions which seem to identify us with the situation of others 
none	none	We will mention some examples of these particular violations of politeness To accost sad people with a smiling face and sprightly manners which prove to them the little interest which you take in their situation to trouble by a whimsical and cross ill humor and by misanthropic declamations the pleasure of contented persons to exalt the advantages of beauty before aged ladies or those who are naturally unfortunate to speak of the power that wealth bestows in the presence of people hardly arrived at mediocrity of fortune to boast of one s strength or health before a valetudinarian c The sense which we here give to the term prejudices is still more limited than that which we have just given to the expression improprieties We do not mean to speak here of those erroneous judgments acknowledged as such which though undermined and shaken are still respected by that society which they torment We wish only to admonish our fair readers of those unfriendly prejudices of nation against nation city against city and section against section that malevolent disposition which with a Parisian makes the name provincial synonymous with awkwardness and bad ton and which in the saloons of the Chausee d Antin allows no favor to persons lodging in the Marais because the people of the Marais provincials and Englishmen do not consider it any fault to return prejudice for prejudice and contempt for contempt CHAPTER VII Of Epistolary Composition Next to social communications by means of visits and conversation are communications by means of letters and billets It is not only absence but a multiplicity of business and a great number of relations which give a very great extension to this part of our social interests Our readers have too much judgment to think that we wish to give them lessons in style or teach them how they should write letters of friendship of congratulation of condolence of apology of recommendations of invitation of complaint or of censure This enumeration alone shows the impossibility of it Some general reflections upon propriety in epistolary composition and strict details of the forms and ceremonial parts of letters will compose this important chapter SECTION I Of Propriety in Letter Writing If in conversation we ought to attend to propriety of language its choice and graceful euphony how much more is it necessary to endeavor to make our style in writing clear precise elegant and appropriate to all subjects Vivacity of discourse forces us frequently to sacrifice happy though tardy expressions to the necessity of avoiding hesitancy but what is thus an obstacle in speaking does not interfere with the use of the pen We ought therefore to avoid repetitions erasing insertions omissions and confusion of ideas or labored construction If we write a familiar letter to an equal or a friend these blemishes may remain but otherwise we must commence our letter again The most exact observance of the rules of language is strictly necessary a fault of orthography or an incorrect expression are not allowable even in the least careful letter or the most unimportant billet Even correction is not admissible for besides being a blemish to the letter it betrays the ignorance or inattention of him who writes it For these reasons it is well to make a rough draft if we are little accustomed to epistolary style and if being very young we cannot perfectly remember the rules of syntax and the dictionary Some persons it is true censure this precaution which say they marks the style with affectation and stiffness This censure does not seem to me well founded The loss of time which this method requires is a more real inconvenience and for this reason and on account of the embarrassment with which we may be troubled it is well to accustom ourselves to writing a letter extempore with neatness elegance and correctness The choice of materials for writing without being very essential is yet necessary to write on very coarse paper is allowable only to the most indigent to use gilt edged and perfumed paper for letters of business would be ridiculous The selection of paper ought always to be in keeping with the person the age the sex and the circumstances of the correspondents Ornamented paper of which we have just spoken paper bordered with colored vignettes and embossed with ornaments in relief upon the edges and paper slightly colored with delicate shades are designed for young ladies and those whose condition taste and dignity presuppose habits of luxury and elegance Many distinguished people however reasonably prefer simplicity in this thing and make use of very beautiful paper but yet without ornament People of business heads of companies or establishments and persons of distinction with many titles use paper printed at the top that is to say having the name of their residence the three first figures of the date of the year their address and these words Mr here follow the titles to Mr It is extremely impolite to write a letter upon a single leaf of paper even if it is a billet it should be always double even though we write only two or three lines It is still more vulgar to use for an envelope paper on which there are one or two words foreign to the letter itself whether they be written or printed Billets letters folded lengthwise and half envelopes are little used A folded letter especially if written upon vellum paper should be pressed at the folds by means of a paper folder The rules of politeness ought moreover to decide as to the expense of postage They require us to defray the expense of the letter if it is written to distinguished persons or to those of whom we ask any favor but it would be an incivility and sometimes a want of delicacy to do it when we write to a friend an acquaintance or to persons of little fortune whose feelings we should fear to wound We must therefore in order to save them the expense as well as to avoid dissatisfaction endeavor to make some excuse of business Letters for new year s day and other holidays are usually written beforehand in order to arrive on the previous or very same day This is particularly required towards relations for friends and intimate acquaintances the following week will do and for other persons any time within the month It is as indispensable to answer when you are written to as when you are spoken to and the indolence which so many correspondents allow in themselves in this respect is an incivility And if after all they decide to answer they begin by apologies so constantly renewed that they become common place We must use much care that these excuses may not be ridiculous Conciseness and some new terms of expression are in this case indispensable The same observation is applicable in making use of reproving terms Letters supply the place of visits as we have seen in bestowing presents or on occasions of marriages funerals c to neglect to write in a similar case is gross impoliteness Two persons should not write in the same letter by one writing upon the first and another upon the second leaf except we are intimate with the correspondent The same is applicable to postscripts It is not allowable except to familiar friends to use expressions borrowed from foreign languages as for instance the phrase of the Italians I kiss your hands c The language of men who write to ladies ought always to have a polish of respect with which the latter might dispense in answering Except on occasions of great ceremony a lady ought not to address to a man such phrases as I have the honor to be c while the latter should use the most respectful terms as Deign madam to allow me allow me the honor of presenting you my respects c You may use a lofty style towards persons to whom you owe respect on easy trifling or even jesting style towards a friend and a courteous style towards ladies generally You should not write in a trifling style to persons of a higher standing It sometimes happens that a man of superior rank honors with his friendship a man of lower condition and is pleased that the latter writes to him without ceremony In this case we may use the privilege which is given us but we must take care not to abuse it and to make known from time to time that we are ready to confine ourselves within respectful bounds When you write upon any subject consider it fully before putting it upon paper and treat of each topic in order that you may not be obliged to recur to any one again after having spoken of another thing If you have many subjects to treat of in the same letter commence with the most important for if the person to whom you write is interrupted while reading it he will be the more impatient to resume the reading however little interesting he may find it It is useful and convenient to begin a new paragraph at every change of the subject After having written Sir or Madam at the top of the letter we should not commence with one of these phrases Sir madam your sister has written me that We should say I understand by a letter which madam your sister has written me Take care also when writing to a person worthy of respect not to make compliments to any one But write to this third person whatever you wish him to know Titles of respect as Lordship Majesty Highness Excellency Honor Madam c ought never to be abbreviated either in writing to the persons themselves or to any one who has acquaintance with them Figures are used only for sums and dates numbers of men days weeks c are to be written at length SECTION II Of the Interior and Exterior Form of Letters The interior form of a letter comprehends the titles and qualities of persons to whom it is proper to give them the more or less courteous phrases which we use the more or less respectful manner with which the commencement and body of the letter are to be arranged and the more or less humble terms which we are to use for the signature the address or the superscription The exterior form of a letter is what concerns the size of the paper the blank that we should leave between the vedette or line containing only the name and the first line between the last line the appellation and signature the manner of folding the letter and the choice and mode of putting on the seal In addressing the pope we say at the top of the letter Holy Father or Most Holy Father and instead of You we should say Your Holiness to a prince cardinal My Lord and Your Most Eminent Highness To a cardinal My Lord and Your Eminence To an archbishop or bishop My Lord and Your Grace To an emperor or empress we say Sire or Madam and instead of You we say Your Imperial Majesty To a king we also say Sire and Your Majesty To a queen Madam and Your Majesty To the brother of a king Your Royal Highness To an elector of the empire Your Electoral Highness To a sovereign prince Your Most Serene Highness To a prince Your Highness To an ambassador or minister Your Excellency To the chancellor of France My Lord and Your Lordship The title Excellency is not given to ladies Persons who have an exact knowledge of the language and usage of the court know what is the most proper manner of expressing themselves We will give some examples in which the different degrees of respect may be readily perceived I have received the letter with which you have been pleased to honor me I have received the letter which you have done me the favor to write to me which you have done me the honor to write to me which you have taken the trouble to write to me There are some persons who commence their letters with these words I have received yours of the twelfth current this is a fault we should say your letter The first is the style of those people who being pressed with business are obliged to make abbreviations and we must in the common customs of life beware of imitating them in this respect We may say the same in respect to persons who write at the top of their letters I have received your honored letter of such a date or in answer to your honored letter or I write you these few words All these forms are objectionable We should never repeat in the first sentence of a letter the names My Lord Sir or Madam with which we began But if we write to a prince or even to a minister we should after the first line use the words Your Majesty Your Highness or Your Excellency and repeat them from time to time in the course of the letter if it is of some length As to the conclusion of a letter we should not say simply I am without adding some such phrase as these With the most profound respect with profound respect with the highest regard c To persons who have the title of majesty highness eminence c we say I am your majesty s or your highness s c very humble c The words esteem and affection are used only in letters to friends or acquaintance because they are too familiar but when accompanied by any words which relieve them they do not offend one As for example we can say I am with profound respect and the highest esteem c The following forms may be used with elegance Accept Sir the assurances of high consideration be pleased to accept the assurances c Letters of petition or request should be in folio that is to say upon a sheet of paper in its full size the margin should be half the breadth of the page the spaces and blanks which we ought to leave between the upper edge of the paper and the vedette sixteen and between the vedette and the first line are very different according to the degree of inferiority or superiority The greater these spaces are the more respect do they indicate The first line ought always to begin below the middle of the page when we write to a person to whom we owe much respect but the second page should begin one line below the vedette A blank space should always be left between the last words of the signature and the lower edge of the paper If there should not be sufficient room it would be better to carry one or two lines over to the succeeding page than to fail in this respect For a familiar letter it has become fashionable to leave no margin at all It is however in these letters only that margins can be useful namely in receiving a vertical line when all the paper is filled The date of a letter may be put at the beginning when we write to an equal but in writing to a superior it should be at the end in order that the title at the head of the letter may be entirely alone In letters of business on the contrary it is necessary to date at the top and on the first line that persons may know conveniently the chronological order of their communications The date is often necessary to the understanding of many passages of your letter or to explain the sense of one which your correspondent may have received at the same time from another person In a simple billet we put the date of the day Monday c It is well sometimes to add the hour Every letter to a superior ought to be folded in an envelope It shows a want of respect to seal with a wafer we must use sealing wax Men usually select red but young ladies use gilt rose and other colors Both use black wax when they are in mourning Except in this last case the color is immaterial but not the size for very large ones are in bad taste The smaller and more glossy the better ton they are Although sealing wax is preferable still we must sometimes avoid using it it is when we are afraid that the seal may be opened When the letter is closed with or without an envelope we put only a single seal upon it but if the letter is large we use two Moreover if it contains important papers it should have three seals or more according to the nature of the envelope If a person takes charge of a letter as a favor it would be very impolite to put more than one seal upon it If the letter should be folded in such a manner that by partly opening it at the end its contents may be read it would be equally impolite to put a little wax upon the edges We can use this precaution only when the letter is sent by the post or by a domestic When we use no envelope and the third page of the letter is all written upon we should leave a small blank space where the seal is to be put without this precaution many very important words will be covered We should not seal a letter of respect with an antique device It is more polite to use our coat of arms or cipher Persons of taste who have no coat of arms adopt a seal bearing some ingenious device in keeping with their profession sentiments c A letter which is to be shown as a letter of introduction or recommendation ought never to be sealed since the bearer ought necessarily to know the contents But to seal it without having first allowed the bearer to read it would be very impolite You should prove to the person recommended that you have spared no pains to render him a service It is only conscripts and peasants who fold a letter like an apothecary s packet who omit to press the wafer with a seal or secure it by pricking it in every part with the point of a pin We never seal petitions which are to be presented to the king and to the members of the royal family Some distinguished persons are flattered in writing to them by our omitting to designate precisely their address It is an error we should indicate with exactness the town and the province state c if there is more than one town of the same name In a large city it is well to write the name of the street and number and the quarter of the city where the street is People of business abbreviate this by putting N and the number or the number alone this practice is more expeditious than polite We generally address a letter to one person only but in certain cases we may address to two or more collectively It is well to add to the name the title or profession in order to prevent mistake However if circumstances have obliged any one of your acquaintance to act in an inferior situation it would be a want of delicacy to join to his name that of his business When we write to the king we put simply in the address To the King To foreign kings we say To his Catholic Majesty his Britannic Majesty c To persons who have the title of highness we say To his Highness and then their quality or rank To ministers and ambassadors we say To his Excellency the Minister or Ambassador If a person has many titles we select the highest and omit the others In billets we put the date at the top of the paper and begin the letter about two inches below The word Sir is put in the first line We conclude with one of these phrases I am Sir yours I am entirely yours c We do not write a billet to ladies or to superiors as this was introduced only to avoid ceremony The most familiar billets are written in the third person contrary to the common practice They contain very little and begin thus Mr or Madam N present their respects or compliments to mister Such a one and request c After having made the request we end with and he will oblige his humble servant In this kind of billets it is best not to use the pronoun he or she for independently of the incivility it might result in confusion Sometimes it would be difficult to know whether the pronoun referred to the person who received the letter or to the one who wrote it I shall conclude this chapter by an observation relative to friendly and familiar letters not that I have the folly to pretend to regulate by any ceremonial the sentiments of the heart but there is in reality nothing more cold and ridiculous than accumulations of epithets like these Your tender sincere and constant friend c sixteen See page one hundred thirty seven CHAPTER VIII Additional Rules in respect to the Social Relations 
7839-110063-0000	train-other-500	I include under this name everything relating to friendly attentions such as services loans presents advice and also things in relation to discretion such as respect in conversation letters
none	none	 secrets confidential communications c SECTION I Of an Obliging Deportment Polite persons are necessarily obliging A smile is always on their lips an earnestness in their countenance when we ask a favor of them They know that to render a service with a bad grace is in reality not to render it If they are obliged to refuse a favor they do this with mildness and delicacy 
7839-110063-0001	train-other-500	they express such feeling regret that they still inspire us with gratitude in short their conduct appears so perfectly natural that it really seems that the opportunity which is offered them of obliging us
7839-110063-0002	train-other-500	is obliging themselves they refuse all our thanks without affectation or effort This amiable character a necessary attendant of perfect good breeding is not always found with all its charms
7839-110063-0003	train-other-500	in the world There are besides some obliging persons who force us to extort their services who feel of great consequence who like to be supplicated and thanked to excess
7839-110063-0004	train-other-500	Do not imitate them they make us ungrateful in spite of ourselves they make gratitude a pain and a burden When one asks of you any favor reply kindly I am at your service
7839-110063-0005	train-other-500	and shall be very happy to render you any assistance in my power or else with a sad manner
none	none	 lament that there is such an obstacle c Then examine the means of overcoming the obstacle even if you should be assured beforehand that none exists Other persons pretending to be polite make protestations of their services and zeal without taking the trouble to abide by their offers when an occasion is afforded them 
7839-110063-0006	train-other-500	so great is their trifling in this respect that they can be justly compared to those false heroes who are always talking of fighting and who would be put to flight at the sight of a drawn sword These indications of zeal are suspicious
7839-110063-0007	train-other-500	when they are employed every moment and without any reason a knowledge of the world teaches us to discern them and to give them that degree of confidence which they merit Sometimes we can congratulate persons wish them well
none	none	 and have the appearance of taking an interest in the recital which they are making of their affairs without really feeling the least interest for them We cannot always command our indifference in this respect but we are obliged to spare them that constraint and ennui 
7839-110063-0008	train-other-500	which would infallibly be shown if we should manifest to them the coldness which they inspire It belongs to those persons who know the world not to confound this politeness
none	none	 with the pretended zeal of the Don Quixottes of the drawing room 
7839-110063-0009	train-other-500	of whom we have spoken above In order that a service may be completed it is necessary that it should be done quickly nothing being more disobliging than tardiness
7839-110063-0010	train-other-500	and the alternative which you place a person in either of addressing to you new solicitations or of suffering by your delay Your tardy assistance may perhaps be prejudicial
none	none	 for one would suffer a long time before resolving to importune you anew Make use then of despatch If any circumstances prevent you from acting inform the person apologise 
7839-110063-0011	train-other-500	and promise to make reparation for your neglect On his part the person who is under the obligation to you should be careful of using a single term of reproach and of accosting you with an air of dissatisfaction
7839-110063-0012	train-other-500	When any one who is visiting you has need of a shawl a handkerchief a hat offer it with a complaisant zeal resist the refusal which is made and which propriety does not require
none	none	 select the best you have in short urge the persons not to be in haste to return the articles If it is very bad weather and the occasion a proper one offer an umbrella or your carriage 
7839-110063-0013	train-other-500	These things are returned the next day by a domestic who is charged to thank the person for them If the articles are linen they should not be returned before they are washed When a lady has borrowed ornaments of another
none	none	 as for instance jewels the latter should always offer to lend her more than are asked for she ought also to keep a profound silence about the things which she has lent and even abstain from wearing them for some time afterwards in order that they may not be recognised If any one perceiving they were borrowed should speak to the person of it he would pass for an ill bred man If the borrower speaks to you of it it is well to reply that nobody had recognised them 
7839-110063-0014	train-other-500	All this advice is minute but what kind will you have it concerns female self esteem One species of borrowing which is of daily occurrence and happens very often to the loss of the owners is the borrowing of books
7839-110063-0015	train-other-500	Persons are so wanting in delicacy on this subject that those who have a passion for books and who are very obliging in other respects are forced to refuse making these troublesome loans The case however is a very perplexing one
7839-110063-0016	train-other-500	we cannot say I am not willing to lend you this work but if the borrower is a suspicious person we can say we have occasion to use it that we regret it very much but that we will lend it to him in a few days
7839-110063-0017	train-other-500	However we do not lend it at all Well bred persons do not make a bare request for a book they wait until it is offered and then they accept the offer hesitatingly they find out the length of time they can keep it
7839-110063-0018	train-other-500	and return it punctually at the appointed day In order to prevent every accident they cover it with cloth or paper since the favor should render them more careful than the value of the book they also take care not to turn down the leaves
none	none	 or make marks marginal notes c If any accident happens to a borrowed article we must repair the loss immediately I shall not speak of more important loans which are out of the range of politeness SECTION II Of Presents In the eyes of persons of delicacy presents are not of worth except from the manner in which they are bestowed in our advice then let us strive to give them this value Presents are offered first to relations and to friends 
7839-110063-0020	train-other-500	and they occur under different circumstances on our arrival at a place from which we have been absent for a long time when our intimate friends leave the town in which we reside on our return from a journey particularly to the capital
7839-110063-0021	train-other-500	in remarkable and remote countries on birth days or days of baptism or new year s day But this day is not the only occasion of exchanging presents in a family it is also an occasion for recollecting services and civilities
7839-110063-0022	train-other-500	of making our respects to ladies to superiors whom we wish to honor It moreover offers us a delicate means of succoring the unfortunate Secondly at harvest time if one owns land
7839-110063-0023	train-other-500	in the hunting season if one is a hunter it is in good ton to send to our intimate friends fine fruits rare flowers or some choice articles of game The most delicate presents are the productions of our own industry
none	none	 a drawing a piece of needle work ornamental hair work c But such offerings though invaluable among friends 
7839-110063-0024	train-other-500	are not used on occasions of ceremony Next to fitness of time for presents comes fitness in the selection of them generally
none	none	 luxury and elegance ought to reign in the latter 
7839-110063-0025	train-other-500	but this rule has numerous exceptions
none	none	 and although it would be out of place to offer things purely useful 
7839-110063-0026	train-other-500	to which certain incidents would give the appearance of charity still we should be in an error to suppose that a present is suitable which is brilliant alone It must by all means be adapted to the taste age and professions of persons and their connexions with us
none	none	 Thus to superiors you offer fruits game c to a student books seventeen to a friend of the arts music or engravings to young married ladies delicate and graceful articles of the toilet c Presents should excite surprise and pleasure therefore you ought to involve them in a mystery and present them with an air of joyful kindness When you have made your offering and thanks have been elicited do not bring back the conversation to the same subject be careful particularly of making your gift of consequence On the contrary when its merit has been extolled when the persons who have received the present 
7839-110063-0027	train-other-500	have evinced a lively satisfaction say that the gift receives all its value from their opinion of it However slight charm a present may have
none	none	 or if even insignificant we should be ill bred not to manifest much pleasure in receiving it It is besides necessary when an opportunity offers to speak of it not to fail of saying to the donor how useful or agreeable his present is to you In proportion as a long space of time has elapsed this attention is the more amiable it proves that you have preserved the object with care And this reminds me that we should never give away a present which we have received from another person or at least that we should so arrange it that it may never be known It is well to mingle with our manifestations of gratitude some exceptions to the high value of the gift but not to dwell a long time on the subject or to exclaim about it with earnestness Under some circumstances these declamations may seem dictated by avarice and a want of delicacy they are besides in bad taste at all times We often make a present to some one through his children or wife especially on new year s day when it is the custom to present at least confectionary to the young families of one s acquaintance At Paris we make such presents to married ladies in the provincial towns we do not Above all when one has received a present of some value he calls upon the person who gave it or if the distance is great addresses to him a letter of thanks Every one knows that custom requires us to make a remuneration of a proportionate value to the domestic who is the bearer of the present seventeen It is not polite when the presents are pamphlets to offer those of which you have cut the leaves SECTION III Of Advice 
7839-110063-0028	train-other-500	Advice is a very good thing it is true it is however a thing which in society is the most displeasing A giver of advice who is incessantly repeating If I was in your place
7839-110063-0029	train-other-500	I should do so and so repels every one by his pride and indiscretion Such an impertinent person should know that he ought not to give advice without he is asked
7839-110063-0030	train-other-500	and that the number of those who ask it is very limited we are not however speaking here of gratifications of vanity but of that advice the kindness and affection of which gives it a claim to our attention
7839-110063-0031	train-other-500	It is necessary to use much reserve and care because otherwise you would seem to have a tone of superiority which would array the self esteem of your friend against your wisest counsels Of the forms of modesty
7839-110063-0032	train-other-500	no one in this place is superfluous we may say It is possible that I am mistaken I should be far from having the courage to enquire of you
none	none	 c If a person makes any objections 
7839-110063-0033	train-other-500	do not say You do not understand me but I have not expressed myself properly
none	none	 SECTION IV Of Discretion 
7839-110063-0034	train-other-500	The duties of discretion are so sensibly felt by persons of good breeding that they do not violate them except through forgetfulness It will be enough then to make an enumeration of them
7839-110063-0035	train-other-500	without intending to point out their necessity Discretion requires in the first place respect with regard to conversation If when we enter the house of any one we hear persons talking in an earnest manner
7839-110063-0036	train-other-500	we step more heavily in order to give notice to those who are engaged in the conversation If in an assembly two persons retire by themselves to speak of business we should be careful not to approach them
7839-110063-0037	train-other-500	nor speak to them until they have separated People who have lived a little in the world know how essential it is not to mingle with curiosity in the business of persons whom we visit
7839-110063-0038	train-other-500	nor are they ignorant what conduct is to be observed in case we surprise persons by an unexpected call but young persons may not know and I beg them to give their attention to it When we see a person occupied we retire
7839-110063-0039	train-other-500	or at least make signs of it if they should detain us we step aside and appear to be examining a picture or looking out of the window in order to prove that we take no notice of what engages them
7839-110063-0040	train-other-500	But the desire to find for ourselves some such occupation ought not to lead us to turn over the leaves of books placed upon the chimney piece or elsewhere to run over a pamphlet or to handle visiting cards or letters
7839-110063-0041	train-other-500	even though it be only to read the superscription If the person visited should be opening a closet or drawers it would be rude curiosity to approach in order to see what was contained there If among a number of valuable things
7839-110063-0042	train-other-500	they take one to show you be satisfied with looking at that alone without appearing to think of the others If before the person visited comes in we should see another visitor who to pass the time
7839-110063-0043	train-other-500	should take a journal or a book from his pocket it would be extremely impolite to read over his shoulder and equally uncivil to read what a person is writing It is not allowable to take down the books from a library
7839-110063-0044	train-other-500	but we may and we even ought to read the titles in order to praise the good taste which has been shown in the choice of the works
none	none	 If it happens that any one exhibits to a circle some rare and valuable object 
7839-110063-0045	train-other-500	do not be in haste to ask for it or to take it by reaching out your hand wait modestly until it comes to you do not examine it too long when you have it
7839-110063-0046	train-other-500	and if by chance any ill bred person requests it before you have seen it do not detain it it is better to suffer this small privation than to pass for a badly educated virtuoso
7839-110063-0047	train-other-500	However insignificant the boasted object may be never criticise it if your opinion is asked
none	none	 answer a few words of praise 
7839-110063-0048	train-other-500	if the thing is really curious abstain from exaggerated compliments To violate the secresy of letters under any pretext whatever is so base and odious that I dare not say a word about it
7839-110063-0049	train-other-500	I think I ought to say that it is also very reprehensible to endeavor to read any part of a letter folded in such a manner as to be partly open at the ends and when a certain passage in a letter concerning yourself is handed you to read
7839-110063-0050	train-other-500	you should put your finger below it in order not to read anything more and if you are allowed to add anything in a letter have the discretion not to cast your eyes over the rest and be expeditious
none	none	 so as to avoid the suspicion that you take advantage of the circumstance Politeness is also opposed in certain cases to a too great haste to know anything relating to ourselves For example 
7839-110063-0051	train-other-500	if a person brings you a letter you should not be in a hurry to open it but see whether the letter concerns the bearer at all
none	none	 or only yourself In the first case you should open it and read it while he is present in the other case you should lay it aside Politeness does not however impose such restraints upon curiosity in small things and leave us free in important ones Thus we shall not say that we ought religiously to keep a secret and that confidence received is a sacred deposit but we shall say to persons who have curiosity to know any private circumstance that they ought to be filled with shame if they do not desist all importunity as soon as they hear the word it is a secret CHAPTER IX Of Travelling This chapter although only accessory and but remotely connected with the social relations should be added here as we do not wish to make any voluntary omission and besides if in travelling the duties of politeness are less numerous they are not therefore less obligatory Persons about to travel ought to make visits of taking leave among their acquaintances of whom they should ask if they have any commands for them It would be indiscreet unless in case of perfect intimacy to accept this offer or to ask them to take charge of such or such a thing especially if it is a packet if persons are very intimate we may request them to let us hear of their arrival Before their departure the names of passengers are entered in the order of their numbers at the public coach offices After this each one takes the place assigned him Politeness however requires that a man should offer his seat to a lady who is less well accommodated for it would be improper that he should be seated upon the back seat while she should be seated upon the front one Some persons cannot bear the motion of a coach when they ride backwards and this manner of riding incommodes them extremely Polite travellers will take pleasure in relieving them from this trouble Ladies on their part ought not to require too much nor put to too severe a test the complaisance of gentlemen The latter however should at every stopping place attentively help them alight by offering the hand and directing their feet on the step of the coach The same thing is necessary in assisting them to get in again It would appear badly to take advantage of one s superiority of rank to consult his own convenience alone It is necessary on the contrary for him to have great care not to incommode any one and to show every civility to his fellow travellers Politeness in travelling is not so rigorous as in society it only requires that we should not incommode our companions that we should be agreeable to them that we should politely answer their questions but it leaves us free to read sleep look about or observe silence c A traveller would be uncivil if he should open or shut the windows of the coach without consulting the people who are with him or if he should without offering to them take any light and delicate food as fruits cakes or confectionary but which they do not generally accept and he would appear disagreeable if knowing the route he should not point out the beautiful sites and satisfy any questions concerning them finally he would deserve the name of an imprudent prater if he should converse with his fellow travellers as with intimate acquaintances On our return we should carry or send the commissions which we have received Partial acquaintances to whom we have offered only by writing to take their commands should not expect a visit on our return this right belongs only to relations friends or intimate acquaintances Finally all those for whom you have executed any commissions owe you a visit of thanks as soon as it can be done If you travel on horseback in distinguished company give them the right and keep a little behind regulating yourself by the progress of your companions There is one exception to this rule it is when one of the two horses is skittish so that it is absolutely necessary that the other should pass on first that this one may follow If you happen to be on the windward side so that you throw dust upon your companion you should change your position When we pass by trees the branches of which are about the height of the shoulders the one who goes first ought to take care that the branches in going back to their former situation should not strike with violence against the person who follows If you are passing a large stream a small river or a muddy pool by fording it is polite to go first but if we have not taken precautions and fall in the rear we ought to keep at a distance so that the horse s feet may not spatter the water or mud upon the gentleman before us If your companion gallops his horse you should never pass him nor make your horse caper unless he signifies that it is agreeable to him PART III OF PROPRIETY IN RELATION TO PLEASURES CHAPTER I Of Entertainments Politeness ought as we have seen to direct and embellish all the circumstances of life but it is if possible still more necessary in relation to pleasures which without it would have no attraction Without intending to adopt the epigrammatic style I will say that dining is almost an event so many points of propriety have the master of the house and his guests to observe When we intend giving an entertainment we begin by selecting such guests as may enjoy themselves together or at least tolerate one another If it is to be composed of gentlemen there should be no lady present except the lady of the house The dinner being determined upon we give out two or three days beforehand verbal or written invitations During the carnival or other season of gaiety it is necessary to do it at least five days in advance on account of the numerous engagements When we receive a written invitation we must answer immediately whether we accept or not although silence may be considered equivalent to an acceptance In the latter case we should give a plausible reason of our declining and do it with politeness When the invitation is verbal we must avoid being urged for nothing is more foolish and disobliging we ought either to accept or refuse in a frank and friendly manner offering some reasonable motive for declining to which we should not again refer It is not allowable to be urged except when we are requested to dine with someone whom we have seen only at the house of a third person or when we are invited on a visit or other similar occasion In the former case if we accept we should first leave a card in order to open the acquaintance Having once accepted we cannot break our engagement unless for a most urgent cause An invitation ought to specify exactly the hour of meeting and you should arrive precisely at that hour The table should be ready and the mistress of the house in the drawing room to receive the guests When they are all assembled a domestic announces that the dinner is served up at this signal we rise immediately and wait until the master of the house requests us to pass into the dining room whither he conducts us by going before It is quite common for the lady of the house to act as guide while he offers his hand to the lady of most distinction The guests also give their arms to ladies whom they conduct as far as the table and to the place which they are to occupy Take care if you are not the principal guest not to offer your hand to the handsomest or most distinguished lady for it is a great impoliteness Having arrived at the table each guest respectfully salutes the lady whom he conducts and who in turn bows also It is one of the first and most difficult things properly to arrange the guests and to place them in such a manner that the conversation may always be general during the entertainment we should as much as possible avoid putting next one another two persons of the same profession for it would necessarily result in an aside conversation which would injure the general conversation and consequently the gaiety of the occasion The two most distinguished gentlemen are placed next the mistress of the house the two most distinguished ladies next the master of the house the right hand is especially the place of honor If the number of gentlemen is nearly equal to that of the ladies we should take care to intermingle them we should separate husbands from their wives and remove near relations as far from one another as possible because being always together they ought not to converse among themselves in a general party The younger guests or those of less distinction are placed at the lower end of the table In order to be able to watch the course of the dinner and to see that nothing is wanting to their guests the master and mistress of the house usually seat themselves in the centre of the table opposite each other As soon as the guests are seated the lady of the house serves in plates from a pile at her left hand the soup which she sends round beginning with her neighbors at the right and left and continuing in the order of their distinction These first plates usually pass twice for every one endeavors to make his neighbor accept whatever is sent him The master of the house carves or causes to be carved by some expert guests the large pieces in order afterwards to do the honors himself If you have no skill in carving meats you should not attempt it and never discharge this duty except when your good offices are solicited by him neither can we refuse from his hand anything sent us A master of a house ought never to pride himself upon what appears on his table nor confuse himself with apologies for the bad cheer which he offers you it is much better for him to observe silence in this respect and leave it to his guests to pronounce eulogiums on the dinner neither is it in good ton to urge guests to eat nor to load their plate against their will I will now give a few words of advice to guests puerile it may be but which it is well to listen to and observe It is ridiculous to make a display of your napkin to attach it with pins upon your bosom or to pass it through your buttonhole to use a fork in eating soup to ask for meat instead of beef for poultry instead of saying chicken or turkey to turn up your cuffs while carving to take bread even when it is within your reach instead of calling upon the servant to cut with a knife your bread which should be broken by your hand and to pour your coffee into the saucer to cool Guests of the house of a distinguished personage are accompanied each by his own servant who takes his place behind his chair They should not address him during the entertainment still less reprimand him Before placing themselves at the table they ought to direct him to serve the other guests also and to retire as soon as the table is cleared because the domestics of the house ought to eat by themselves During the first course each one helps himself at his pleasure to whatever he drinks but in the second course when the master of the house passes round choice wine it would be uncivil to refuse it We are not obliged however to accept a second glass When at the end of the second course the cloth is removed the guests may assist in turning off that part of it which is before them and contribute to the arrangement of the dessert plates which happen to be near but without attempting to alter the disposition of them From the time that the dessert appears on the table the duties of the master of the house diminish as do also his rights If a gentleman is seated by the side of a lady or elderly person politeness requires him to save them all trouble of pouring out for themselves to drink of procuring anything to eat and of obtaining whatever they are in want of at the table He ought to be eager to offer them what he thinks to be most to their taste It would be impolite to monopolize a conversation which ought to be general If the company is large we should converse with our neighbors raising the voice only enough to make ourselves understood Custom allows ladies at the end of an entertainment to dip their fingers into a glass of water and to wipe them with their napkin it allows them also to rinse the mouth using their plate for this purpose but in my opinion custom sanctions it in vain It is for the mistress of the house to give the signal to leave the table all the guests then rise and offering their arms to the ladies wait upon them to the drawing room where coffee and liqueurs are prepared We do not take coffee at the table except at unceremonious dinners In leaving the table the master of the house ought to go last Politeness requires us to remain at least an hour in the drawing room after dinner and if we can dispose of an entire evening it would be well to devote it to the person who has entertained us We should not leave the table before the end of the entertainment unless from urgent necessity If it is a married lady she requests some one to accompany her if a young lady she goes with her mother The question whether it is proper or not to sing at table depends now upon the ton of the master of the house We do not sing at the houses of people of fashion and the high classes of society but we may do it at the social tables of citizens In this case we may repeat what has been said and proved a thousand times how ridiculous it is to be urged when we know how to sing or to insist upon hearing a person sing who has an invincible timidity After dinner we converse have music or more frequently prepare the tables for games In the course of the soiree the mistress of the house sends round upon a waiter eau sucree or refreshing syrups During the week which follows the entertainment each guest owes a visit to the person who has invited them We usually converse at this time of the dinner of the pleasure we have enjoyed and of the persons whom we met there This visit has received the cant name of the visite de digestion CHAPTER II Of Promenades Parties and Amusements The paragraphs contained in this chapter concern the most common relations of society Complaisance and attentions ought therefore to embellish and adorn these relations with all the delicate shades of politeness SECTION I Of Promenades A young man who walks with an elderly person undoubtedly knows that his companion has not the same strength and agility as himself he ought therefore to regulate his pace by that of the old person The same precaution should be observed when we accompany a person of distinction to whom we owe respect Decorum requires that a gentleman should offer his arm to a lady who walks with him and politeness requires him to ask permission to carry anything which she may have in her hand as a bag a book or a parasol if the sun does not shine in case of a refusal he ought to insist upon it If there are more ladies than gentlemen we should offer our arm to the oldest and to a married lady rather than to an unmarried one If we are accompanied by two ladies we cannot dispense with offering our arm to each of them Place your company upon that side which seems to them most convenient and beware of opposing their tastes or desires When occasion presents itself offer seats to your companions to rest themselves and do not urge them to rise until they manifest a wish to continue their walk If they accept your invitation to sit down and it happens that there are not a sufficient number of seats then the ladies should sit and the gentlemen remain standing In a large public garden chairs are seldom wanting if it is necessary to go for some to the place where they are kept this is the business of the gentlemen who ought to take care not to place them before persons already seated for this would be an incivility When payment for the seats is called for one gentleman of the company pays for the whole It would be impolite to offer to reimburse him There is also a rule of politeness to be observed with regard to those whom we meet in walking We ought to offend neither their eyes nor their ears We must take care not to attract their attention by immoderate laughter nor allow ourselves liberties which we cannot take in a private garden To sing and skip about in walking would expose us to the hootings of the multitude and to unpleasant things for which we could only accuse our own folly If you are in a public promenade converse upon general topics which can offend no one in order that your remarks may not be wrongly interpreted by persons who happen to hear them Beware on the other hand of listening to the conversation of those who are not of your party If you give your arm to a lady in the street she ought to be next the wall And if by chance you are obliged to cross over you should then change the arm This deference is likewise due to all who are entitled to our respect Two gentlemen do not take one another s arms in the street unless they are young persons and intimate friends We never go in advance of the lady whom we accompany and if she stops we do so likewise and remain with her in looking at whatever attracts her attention If a mendicant comes up to ask alms we immediately draw out our purse to satisfy his wants so that the lady with whom we are walking may not be importuned by him If we walk in a private garden and the company is numerous we may separate and form distinct groups If the master of the house or any person of consideration invite you to walk up and down the alleys take care to give them the right it being the most honorable side At the end of each alley and when you must retrace your steps turn inside towards the other person and not outward as you would thus present your back to him If you happen to be with two persons who are your superiors do not place yourself in the middle for that is the place of honor the right is the second and the left the third place Be careful also of the choice of places if you take an airing in a coach and yield the first seats to ladies and distinguished persons The one of most consequence gets in first and places himself at the right of the back seat the left of the same seat is occupied next then the third person seats himself on the front seat facing the one in the first place the fourth person takes the remaining seat facing the one in the second place If there is no servant it is proper for the gentlemen to open the door arrange the packets c In a cabriolet or chaise the right side is for the one who drives when there are only two persons If there are three the driver sits in the middle even although he may be very inferior to his companions I may add that it is not customary for a lady to go alone in a hired cabriolet since she would then be in the company of the driver only SECTION II Of Parties and Amusements We shall have but few things to say upon the manner of conducting one s self in a party for we should only repeat the advice we have already given as respects propriety in the carriage of the person in visits and in conversation If a gentleman enters a drawing room where there are more than ten persons he should salute all generally by a very respectful inclination of the head and present his respects first to the lady of the house but converse at first only with her husband gentlemen usually stand in groups while the ladies sitting answer the salutation by a similar one we should remark that the ladies do not rise except in saluting one of their own sex However distinguished a person may be we do not allow conversation to be disturbed by their coming They listen for a few moments while observing what persons are present then mingle in the conversation without pretending at all to monopolize it When conversation is not general nor the subject sufficiently interesting to occupy the whole company they break up into different groups Each one converses with one or more of his neighbors on his right and left We should if we wish to speak to any one avoid leaning upon the person who happens to be between A gentleman ought not to lean upon the arm of a lady s chair but he may while standing support himself by the back of it in order to converse with the lady half turned towards him It would be extremely impolite to converse in a loud voice with any one upon private subjects to make use of allegories and particular allusions which are understood only by the person with whom you are conversing and yourself It would be equally out of place to converse in a foreign language with any one who might be able to speak it It is not proper to withdraw in the midst of any conversation but to wait until the subject in which you are engaged shall be finished you then salute only the person with whom you have been talking and depart without taking leave of any one not even the gentleman and lady of the house The mind has need of recreations it cannot be always occupied Hence the custom of passing a few moments in those family and social parties where we take part in the various amusements and games which have been invented to relax and divert the mind It is useless to observe here that we do not mean to speak of those scandalous establishments in which are frequently swallowed up the resources of families and where a person led by an unhappy passion may consume in one evening enough to furnish an annual support for fifty orphans we design to speak only of those innocent games in which we are ambitious only of the glory of a triumph To propose to play a deep game would be to expose ourselves to contempt For those who composed the assembly would imagine that he who makes this request has no other object in view but to enrich himself at the expense of others and that he is accustomed to frequent those abominable houses of which we have just spoken We should have a bad opinion of a player who when he gained should show excessive joy and if he lost should betray the least chagrin for he ought to remember that it is only for amusement that he plays Conduct yourself without letting escape the least word of dissatisfaction and be pleasant even if you are unfortunate When you leave off playing converse with your adversary and not seem to avoid him but especially never speak to him of his good luck in playing unless it be with a frank gaiety for otherwise you would seem to be inspired with anger Play with fairness and do not endeavor to see the hand of your adversary in order to profit by it pay attention to your game and not hold conversation with others This inattention would render you necessarily insupportable to those who play with you If any play is contested we should not discuss it with warmth but refer to disinterested persons explaining to them with calmness and politeness the point in dispute In playing we must always preserve an even temper neither should we devote too much time to it for then this amusement would become irksome and would soon be changed to a fatiguing occupation When the mistress of the house has prepared the tables for playing she takes as many cards as each game requires players and presents them to the persons present beginning with the one whom she wishes especially to honor To accept a card is considered an engagement to play The distribution of the players requires all the attention of the mistress of the house for there are some persons not to be desired for partners There are besides bad players persons who being little accustomed to playing stop a long time to think bite their lips strike their feet together under the table drum upon the table with their fingers pretend that such a person being near brings them bad luck and request out of their turn to shuffle the cards in order to change the luck c The mistress of the house experiences besides the embarrassment of arranging these unlucky players sufficient trouble in keeping from the same table those who have any antipathy to one another When we commence playing we salute by an inclination of the head the persons with whom we play as we deal to them the first card Gentlemen should collect the cards at the end of each hand shuffle and present them to the lady who is to deal We may without impropriety ask of any one if he plays such a game even if he plays well and we may ask those invited to play whom they desire as partners The most honorable set namely that in which the mistress of the house plays can never be refused unless we are unacquainted with playing SECTION III Little Sports and Games of Society Those sports called innocent generally please young persons of both sexes because they excite an interest while they require an exercise of the memory and of the mind It is necessary however in this as in everything else to manifest attention delicacy and propriety We ought not to endeavor to be noticed for our too great vivacity or freedom We should be satisfied with showing our talent at playing in our turn and taking part in the common gaiety without pretension or too great zeal We should especially avoid throwing out any vindictive remarks bestowing misplaced compliments or imposing forfeits which would cause mortification A young gentleman ought never to seize a young lady by the body catch hold of her ribband or bouquet nor pay exclusive attention to the same person He should be agreeable and pleasant towards all The selection of different games belongs to the ladies The person who receives the company should be careful to vary them and when she perceives that any game loses its interest she should propose another There are almost always persons in society who wish to take the lead and give the ton it is a caprice or fault which should be avoided We may modestly propose any amusement and ask the opinion of others in regard to it but never pretend to dictate nor even urge having our own proposal accepted If it does not please generally we should be silent and resign ourselves with a good grace to the decisions of the majority In these little sports the penalties which are imposed too often consist in embracing the ladies of the company but as they cannot refuse since you follow the rule of the game take care to do it with such propriety that modesty may not be offended Never prescribe any forfeiture which can wound the feelings of any one of the company CHAPTER III Of Balls Concerts and Public Shows These amusements presuppose a fortune and good ton the practice of society therefore and consequently a forgetfulness of the precepts of politeness in respect to them would be truly preposterous

8071-110067-0001	train-other-500	but an evening party soiree Nevertheless when we wish to give a dance we give the invitations a week beforehand
none	none	 that the ladies may have time to prepare articles for their toilet 
8071-110067-0002	train-other-500	If it is to be a simple evening party
none	none	 in which we may wear a summer walking dress the mistress of the house gives verbal invitations and does not omit to apprise her friends of this circumstance or they might appear in unsuitable dresses If on the contrary 
8071-110067-0003	train-other-500	the soiree is to be in reality a ball the invitations are written or what is better printed and expressed in the third person A room appropriated for dresses and furnished with cloak pins to hang up the shawls and other garments of the ladies
none	none	 is almost indispensable Domestics should be there also to aid them in taking off and putting on their outside garments We are not obliged to go exactly at the appointed hour it is even fashionable to go an hour later 
8071-110067-0004	train-other-500	Married ladies are accompanied by their husbands unmarried ones by their mother or by a chaperon These last ladies place themselves behind the dancers the master of the house goes before one and another
8071-110067-0005	train-other-500	procures seats for them and then mingles again among the gentlemen who are standing and who form groups or walk about the room The toilet of all the assembly should be made with great care
none	none	 A gentleman who should appear in a riding coat and boots 
8071-110067-0006	train-other-500	would pass for a person of bad ton
none	none	 When you are sure of a place in the dance you go up to a lady and ask her if she will do you the honor 
8071-110067-0007	train-other-500	to dance with you If she answers that she is engaged invite her for the next dance
none	none	 and take care not to address yourself afterwards 
8071-110067-0008	train-other-500	to any ladies next to her for these not being able to refuse you would feel hurt at being invited after another Never wait until the signal is given to take a partner for nothing is more impolite than to invite a lady hastily
8071-110067-0009	train-other-500	and when the dancers are already in their places it can be allowed only when the set is incomplete A lady cannot refuse the invitation of a gentleman to dance unless she has already accepted that of another
8071-110067-0010	train-other-500	for she would be guilty of an incivility which might occasion trouble she would besides seem to show contempt for him whom she refused and would expose herself to receive an ill compliment from him
none	none	 Married or young ladies cannot leave a ball room or any other party alone 
8071-110067-0011	train-other-500	The former should be accompanied by one or two other married ladies and the latter by their mother or by a lady to represent her We should avoid talking too much it would occasion remarks and have a bad appearance
8071-110067-0012	train-other-500	to whisper continually in the ear of our partner
none	none	 The master of the house should see that all the ladies dance he should take notice of those who seem to serve as drapery to the walls of the ball room or wall flowers as the familiar expression is 
8071-110067-0013	train-other-500	and should see that they are invited to dance He must do this wholly unperceived in order not to wound the self esteem of the unfortunate ladies Gentlemen whom the master of the house requests to dance with these ladies
none	none	 should be ready to accede to his wish 
8071-110067-0014	train-other-500	and even appear pleased at dancing with a person thus recommended to their notice Ladies who dance much ought to be very careful not to boast before those who dance but little or not at all
none	none	 of the great number of dances for which they are engaged in advance They should also without being perceived recommend to these less fortunate ladies gentlemen of their acquaintance 
8071-110067-0015	train-other-500	In giving the hand for ladies chain or any figures those dancing should wear a smile and accompany it with a polite inclination of the head in the manner of a salutation At the end of the dance
none	none	 the gentleman re conducts the lady to her place bows and thanks her for the honor which she has conferred She also curtsies in silence smiling with a gracious air 
8071-110067-0016	train-other-500	In these assemblies we ought to conduct ourselves with reserve and politeness towards all present although they may be unknown to us Persons who have no ear for music that is to say a false one ought to refrain from dancing
none	none	 Never hazard taking part in a quadrille unless you know how to dance tolerably 
8071-110067-0017	train-other-500	If you are a novice or but little skilled
none	none	 you would bring disorder into the midst of pleasure 
8071-110067-0018	train-other-500	Being once engaged to take part in the dance if the figures are not familiar be careful not to advance first
none	none	 You can in this way govern your steps by those who go before you 
8071-110067-0019	train-other-500	Beware also of taking your place in a set of dancers more skilful than yourself When an unpractised dancer makes a mistake we may apprise him of his error but it would be very impolite
none	none	 to have the air of giving him a lesson Dance with grace and modesty neither affect to make a parade of your knowledge refrain from great leaps and ridiculous jumps which would attract the attention of all towards you 
8071-110067-0020	train-other-500	In a private ball or party it is proper to show still more reserve and not to manifest more preference for one lady than another we should dance with all indiscriminately but we may moreover
8071-110067-0021	train-other-500	invite the same lady more than once In public balls a gentleman offers his partner refreshments which she very seldom accepts unless she is much acquainted with him But in private parties
8071-110067-0022	train-other-500	the persons who receive the company send round cake and other refreshments of which each one helps himself as he pleases Near the end of the evening
none	none	 in a well regulated ball it is customary to have a supper when the gentlemen stand behind the ladies who are seated In a soiree without great preparation we may dispense with a supper but refreshments are necessary and not to have them would be the greatest impoliteness 
8071-110067-0023	train-other-500	The waltz is a dance of quite too loose a character and unmarried ladies should refrain from it in public and private
none	none	 very young married ladies however 
8071-110067-0024	train-other-500	may be allowed to waltz in private balls if it is very seldom and with persons of their acquaintance It is indispensable for them to acquit themselves with dignity and decency
8071-110067-0025	train-other-500	I have spoken of public balls in contradistinction to private ones and I might also have mentioned balls by subscription
none	none	 for in regard to the public balls of Paris and other large cities 
8071-110067-0026	train-other-500	we have nothing to advise our readers but to shun them As to masked balls it is an amusement altogether to be condemned except those of the Opera
none	none	 Neither should we appear there except in a domino We should retire incognito not to disturb the master and mistress of the house we should make them during the week a visit of thanks at which we may converse of the pleasure of the ball and of the good selection of the company SECTION II Of Concerts 
8071-110067-0028	train-other-500	The proprieties in deportment which concerts require are little different from those which are recognized in every other assembly or in public exhibitions for concerts partake of the one and the other
none	none	 according as they are public or private In private concerts 
8071-110067-0029	train-other-500	the ladies occupy the front seats and the gentlemen are generally in groups behind or at the side of them One should observe the most profound silence and refrain from beating time humming the airs applauding
none	none	 or making ridiculous gestures of admiration Very often a dancing soiree succeeds a concert and billets of invitation distributed two or three days beforehand 
8071-110067-0030	train-other-500	should give notice of it to the persons invited When a lady is going to perform
none	none	 it is good ton for a gentleman to stand behind the chair of the performer and turn over the leaves attentively if he knows how to read music We ought also after an invitation to a concert to return a visit of thanks SECTION III Of Public Shows or Spectacles One would be deceived if he imagined that there exist no rules of propriety to be observed in public places 
8071-110067-0031	train-other-500	where persons assemble together and at theatrical exhibitions There are some general attentions which we should manifest to those persons whom we meet there It would be impolite to jostle continually and in an importunate manner
8071-110067-0032	train-other-500	those near whom we are placed to step upon the dress of a lady or run against those who are moving at a moderate pace If you go with a party to a theatrical entertainment
none	none	 one of the gentlemen should carry the tickets to the door keeper 
8071-110067-0033	train-other-500	in older to avoid any embarrassment to ladies on entering and when the box is open they should place them in the front row according to their age or the consideration they deserve Young persons should occupy the seats behind
8071-110067-0034	train-other-500	and avoid leaning over too much
none	none	 to the incommoding of those who are seated in front of them 
8071-110067-0035	train-other-500	Gentlemen should address themselves to the attendants at the boxes make them a compensation and place under their care their hats the cloaks and other articles of dress of the ladies but we must not hang them over the boxes
8071-110067-0036	train-other-500	whether it is a pocket handkerchief a tippet or a shawl
none	none	 c eighteen Nor ought a person to turn his back to the stage for in that case he exposes himself to the derision of the pit and to hear disagreeable remarks Then the eyes of all would be fixed upon you your imprudence would excite a disturbance which would be troublesome to the audience When a spectator of kind feelings is affected at the sight of the misfortunes 
8071-110067-0037	train-other-500	which the heroes of the play suffer or has his sympathy touched by the virtues
none	none	 which are displayed nothing can be more annoying to him than to have constantly at his side a morose critic who without mercy finds fault with the finest parts of the performance who sees nothing to his taste and changes into a place of fatigue and ennui resorts consecrated to amusement and pleasure It is moreover almost as ridiculous to place no bounds to our applause When ladies enter a box where a gentleman is seated in front of them propriety requires that he should offer his seat notwithstanding they are strangers to him and he should insist upon their taking it even after they have once refused If the heat incommodes you do not open the door of the box without the consent of those who occupy it Be very reserved at the theatre in order not to trouble those who are near you and maintain a profound silence when the actors are on the stage so as not to interrupt the attention of persons who take an interest in the spectacle It is improper to pass too positive and severe a judgment on the performance or the playing of the actors whether to make a eulogium or to find fault with them One may meet persons of a contrary opinion and engage himself in a controversy which it is prudent to avoid Between the acts gentlemen should ask the ladies if it is agreeable to them to walk in the entries the saloon or to take refreshments They should also ask them if they wish for a journal of the theatre or play bill or an opera glass and if bouquets are sold at the door of the theatre it would be proper and gallant to present them with one As soon as you have arrived at the outer door of the theatre if in a carriage you must take care to have your party all ready at the very moment the carriage drives up It is necessary to do the same thing if you send a porter to get a hired coach eighteen In some of the theatres in Paris this is however allowed T CHAPTER IV Of the Duties of Hospitality Those of my readers who from habit or instinct fear the least appearance of constraint and perhaps even in this work have found lessons of politeness too strict and have thought that civilization has augmented them beyond measure will without doubt apply the same remark to the present chapter But what in reality are these slight duties of modern hospitality in comparison to the rigorous ones of ancient times When a billet of announcement has informed you as is customary that a preceding invitation on your part will bring guests to your house you must begin and carefully arrange the apartment you intend for them They should have a good bed a bureau a fire in the winter and everything which can contribute to their comfort a wash basin water glass tumblers a bottle of cologne a sugar bowl filled or rather a glass of water prepared several napkins and everything which will contribute to neatness or elegance ought to be placed in the apartment These preliminaries being arranged a little before the appointed hour we must go and wait upon our guests a domestic should go with you to bring their baggage to the house You should embrace your friends and congratulate them express the pleasure you enjoy in receiving them inquire kindly about the incidents of their journey and conduct them in an earnest manner and introduce them by requesting them to make your house their home this finishes the second series of the duties of hospitality The third class of obligations is assiduity to your guests because otherwise it would seem to them that their presence was troublesome To you belongs the care of kindly offering to their view everything in your house in the city or in the country which is interesting of making parties in honor of them as dinner parties of their friends or such as it is presumed will please them these are obligations of hospitality which you cannot omit When visitors show any intention of leaving you you ought affectionately to endeavor to retain them nevertheless if their resolution seems immovable you send to engage their seats at the coach office you offer them delicate refreshment and accompany them thither then taking leave of them renew your invitations for another visit and your regret at not having been able to succeed better in retaining them To do the honors of one s own house it is necessary to have tact address knowledge of the world and a great evenness of temper and much affability It is necessary to forget one s self in order to be occupied with others but without hurry or affectation to encourage timid persons and put them at their ease to enter into conversation directing it with address rather than sustaining it ourselves The mistress of a house ought to be obliging of an equal temper and attentive in accommodating herself to the particular tastes of every one especially to appear delighted that they are with her and make themselves perfectly at home Guests on their part should show themselves contented and grateful for the reception that is given them They should on departing give a generous remuneration to the domestics and immediately after arriving at home write to the persons who have entertained them a letter of cordial thanks The duties of hospitality are of frequent recurrence fatiguing and troublesome but they are an indispensable obligation To omit them is to be willing to pass for a person of no education and no delicacy and in short it is to place people in a most embarrassing and painful situation PART IV OF PROPRIETY AS REGARDS OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES CHAPTER I Of Marriage and Baptism These two subjects have peculiar right to the precepts of politeness for the first is the closest of the social relations and both furnish occasions for the most brilliant fetes SECTION I Of Marriage nineteen We usually make a profound secret of the preliminaries of marriage because in case of its being broken off we are afraid of malicious interpretations but after the first words are exchanged it is necessary to make it known in confidence to a few intimate friends and those to whom we are under obligations Afterwards we give intelligence of it by letter to our relations A young man who solicits a lady in marriage should be extremely devoted and respectful he should appear a stranger to all the details of business which the two families discuss he converses with his intended particularly of their future arrangements her tastes the selection of a residence furniture bridal presents c Avoiding all misplaced familiarity he calls her Miss until returning from church on the day of marriage he accompanies her in all assemblies and shows himself a devoted suitor When the banns of matrimony have been published it is customary at Paris for a bouquet maker to come to adorn the bride presenting her with a bouquet This attention requires a remuneration The marriage is declared in two ways We invite three or four days beforehand persons of our acquaintance to assist in the nuptial benediction and we specify precisely the time and place where the ceremony will be performed As to the legal act which is performed by civil authority we invite only witnesses and near relations If a person is invited to assist at the repast or fete which follows the marriage we make express mention of it at the bottom of the letters of invitation twenty We simply communicate the fact of the marriage to those who have been invited neither to the nuptial ceremony nor to the entertainment Propriety requires that the person invited to the marriage ceremony should come or send an excuse if it is impossible to be present A simple letter of announcement to uninvited persons requires only a visit or two the first of which is made by card Presents are usually the preliminaries of a marriage those which the gentleman makes his intended wife are called wedding presents they consist of different articles of the toilet a set of diamonds c Some persons content themselves with sending a purse containing a sum of money in gold for the purchase of these things the young lady then spends it as she thinks proper The married gentleman is moreover to make a present to each of the brothers and sisters of his intended The young lady on her part gives some present to her bridemaid she often presents her with a dress or some ornament and she receives in her turn from the other a girdle gloves and a bouquet of orange flowers Since we have spoken of marriage presents we will add that at Paris the married lady must receive a gift from her sisters and cousins and that in the provincial towns on the contrary she must offer them some token We will now pass to the ceremony after the celebration of the legal act which may be some days previous the married couple followed by their parents commonly go to the church in the carriages which conducted them to the office where the legal act was performed for at Paris whatever situation in life the parties may be in they never go on foot The married lady goes in one carriage with her relations and the bridemaid the gentleman in another carriage with his father and mother or his nearest relatives The acquaintances of the two married persons repair to the church at the appointed hour the friends of the gentleman place themselves on the right those of the lady on the left hand on seats prepared beforehand The marriage train then advances in the following order the lady gives her hand to her father or to one who represents him then comes the gentleman with his mother or the lady who represents her and afterwards the members of the two families follow in couples When the couple and their relations approach the altar each of the persons present bows to them in silence the relations place themselves in the same order as the acquaintances and before the latter in the front row which should be reserved for them The couple to be married are placed in the middle Although it is polite always to present the right hand to the lady whom we conduct or to give her the right when we are next her yet the bridegroom takes the right of the bride because in this act which is at once religious and civil man ought to preserve the prerogative which the law both human and divine have conferred upon him besides as the bridegroom is to place the nuptial ring on the finger of the bride it is more convenient for him to be upon the right hand than the left When the clergyman puts the questions to them each should consult their relations by a respectful sign of the head before answering the decisive yes The veil is held over the head of the bride by two children whose parents we wish to compliment The business of the bridemaid who has presided at the toilet of the bride is to designate their places at the religious ceremony in church and afterwards at the ball is to supply the place of the bride who can take no active part it is usually one of her sisters or a most intimate friend who is chosen for this purpose The groomsman for there should be one or even more looks well to the list of those invited to the ceremony to see what persons are absent because it is the custom of married persons not to make the marriage visit to any one who has been guilty of this impoliteness The married gentleman must give presents to the attendants at the church the poor c After the nuptial benediction the married couple again salute the assembly and then receive the compliments of each one There are some families in a more humble situation where the married lady is embraced by all at the marriage ceremony in those in a higher station in life she embraces only her father her mother and her new relations The new husband gives his hand to his wife when returning from the church nevertheless at dinner he should be placed between his mother and his mother in law while his wife is to be seated between her father and father in law In case there is a supper the married couple sit next each other The married lady opens the ball with the most distinguished person in the assembly she retires privately accompanied by her mother and one or more near relations whom they wish to compliment The newly married couple make marriage visits in the course of a fortnight in a carriage and in full dress They should make these visits alone They leave their cards for those with whom they do not wish to be intimate Such are the received usages in the capital In the provinces many of the old and common customs are preserved as the gift of a laced shirt bosom to the husband by his wife wedding favors or ribbands for the wife ribbands of two colors with which they decorate the young persons in the marriage suite c nineteen The greater part of the marriage ceremonies here described are according to the usages of Catholic countries but some of them are applicable to our own and it has been thought that it would be interesting to American readers to retain the whole as in the original T twenty These letters are usually duplicates for the invitation should appear to be given by the parents of both the future couple SECTION II Of Baptism twenty one We must invite several months beforehand the godfather and godmother of the child that is to be baptized If the ties of blood have given you a right to this onerous duty you cannot dispense with it If not you can seek a specious excuse When one has consented to hold the infant at the baptismal font he should perform this duty in a becoming manner and according to his own condition and that of the parents of the child A present should be given to the mother and this present usually consists of confectionary We must also give one to the godmother a pair of white gloves and comfits if she is a young person she commonly receives a bouquet of white flowers in addition If the godfather wishes to show her any attention he can add to the presents an elegant and valuable object such as a fan but in that case it is good ton for the godmother to send in return some rich and tasteful present She also has the honor of giving to the child a cap and often a baptismal robe To her also belongs the duty of putting the first dress on the child The attendant and the nurse have also a present The officers of the church and the poor should each receive a gratuity proportionate to their condition We simply put a piece of money into the hands of the humbler persons but we present the clergyman with a box of presents in which is enclosed a piece of gold or silver Persons of a very high class in order to free their friends from these expenses send their domestics to present their children at the baptismal font This is a most unbecoming custom it seems to consider this holy consecration as a slavish ceremony and destroys at its source the sentiment of respect and affection that a godson or daughter should inspire in those who have adopted them before God At whatever hour the ceremony is appointed we go to the church in a carriage at the expense of the godfather He and the godmother pass in first then comes the infant borne by its nurse or a matron then the father who accompanies the other invited persons It is the custom in many houses to give after returning from the baptism an elegant entertainment of which the godfather and godmother receive all the honor Above all they should give their godchild new year s gifts while it is a child and manifest their affection during the whole of its life twenty one Most of the observances which follow as well as those in the section on marriage have more particular reference to the forms of the Catholic and Episcopal churches T CHAPTER II Of Duties toward the Unfortunate Propriety the guide of all our relations cannot remain a stranger to the unfortunate that which takes possession of all our sentiments cannot forget to pity It is in this light that it is peculiarly touching that it is almost religious since it even contributes to bind closer this first this powerful tie of humanity SECTION I Of Duties toward the Sick Infirm and Unfortunate When any one of your acquaintance is ill you should regularly send a domestic to inquire after their health every day or every other day according to the virulence and nature of the disease If there is immediate danger we should send to inquire even twice a day From time to time you should send to know whether the sick person can see any one because in that case you must go and testify in person all your interest You should continue to obtain information about their health until their recovery or death Our visits to the sick should be very short silent and reserved We should address to them words of interest in a low voice and speak softly to the member of the family who takes charge of them We ask him who is his physician what is the treatment we urge every motive of consolation and hope we ought hardly to reply to the questions the person in attendance asks with regard to our own health or business and we retire reiterating the proofs of our interest If the person is convalescent or only indisposed you address a thousand questions concerning their complaints you sympathize with them praise their patience and describe to them the pleasant image of returning health You must be on your guard not to say that you find their features much changed that their recovery may be slow c To speak these truths is very mal apropos and with reason you would pass for having an unfeeling heart or rather a limited understanding When sufferings and troubles assume a virulent aspect and resist all the efforts of medical skill they are infirmities indeed and a silence the most absolute and rigorous with respect to them should be observed Not only ought you never to speak to an infirm person of his misfortune but you should also carefully avoid mentioning any person who is afflicted in the same way and of thus alluding indirectly to his own case The only occasion when this is allowed is where you can make it appear to him that the comforts of which he is deprived are not so permanent but that you have experienced similar inconveniences from the same cause Thus to a lame person you might say that you yourself are fatigued with walking that your own legs are not firm c If the infirmity is not too visible and the poor subject speaks to you of it assure him earnestly that you should not have observed it If he complains to you offer him motives of consolation and take care that you change the subject of conversation before he does for you might make him think that you are importuning him about his malady Finally do all in your power to comfort him If he is afflicted with imperfect sight place objects near him but without affectation and without having the air of making him think that he requires your assistance neither permit him to thank you If he is troubled with deafness you must not speak unreasonably loud bring back the attention of the unfortunate person to the subject of your conversation by skilful and delicate transitions and not abruptly say to him We were speaking of such a thing This is much trouble perhaps you will say Trouble to console people Why you take more to please them Persons who are reduced in circumstances keep up in their misfortune at least in society their habits of opulence and to manage with such persons requires not a little skill If they invite you to their frugal repasts if they offer you any presents let not the fear of occasioning them expense induce you to refuse with warmth and with obstinacy you would wound them deeply Accept them and seek an opportunity of repaying with interest these proofs of their politeness Do not speak to them first of their sad situation but if they introduce the subject themselves receive their confidence with a respectful and affectionate attention Show how much you are affected with that which grieves them and without forgetting discretion endeavor in appearance at least to render them confidence for confidence SECTION II Of Funerals and Mourning When we lose any one of our family we should give intelligence of it to all persons who have had relations of business or friendship with the deceased This letter of announcement usually contains an invitation to assist at the service and burial On receiving this invitation we should go to the house of the deceased and follow the body as far as the church We are excused from accompanying it to the burying ground unless it be a relation a friend or a superior If we go as far as the burying ground we must give the first carriages to the relations or most intimate friends of the deceased We should walk with the head uncovered silently and with a sad and thoughtful mien Relations ought not from considerations of propriety to give themselves up too much to their grief You will owe a visit to persons who have invited you if you have not been able to accept their invitation If you have attended the ceremony then they are the ones that owe the visit At an interment or funeral service the members of the family are entitled to the first places they are nearest to the coffin whether in the procession or in the church The nearest relations go in a full mourning dress It is not customary at Paris for women to follow the procession and nowhere do they go quite to the grave unless they are of a low class A widower or a widow a father or mother are not present at the interment or funeral service of those whom they have lost The first are presumed not to be able to support the afflicting ceremony the second ought not to show this mark of deference There are two kinds of mourning the full and the half mourning The full mourning is worn for a father mother grandfather grandmother husband wife brother and sister It is divided into three periods twenty two For the first six weeks we wear only woollen garments in the six weeks following we wear silk and the three last months we mingle white with the black Half mourning is worn for uncles aunts cousins and second cousins The first fortnight we wear black silk and the last week white mixed with black Custom requires that a woman should wear mourning for her husband a year and six weeks while that of a widower is only six months This difference which may appear singular is founded upon reasons of convenience and social relations In the three first months of mourning for her husband a woman wears only woollen garments the six first weeks her head dress and neck kerchief are black crape or gauze in the six following weeks they are white crape or linen The next six months she dresses in black silk in winter gros de Naples in summer taffetas Head dress white crape The three last months she wears black and white and the six last weeks white only The mourning on the death of a wife is a black cloth coat without buttons twenty three dark shoes woollen hose black buckles and a sword knot of crape if the person carries one At the end of six weeks we may wear a black coat with buttons black silk hose silver buckles and a black ribband upon the sword The half mourning of the three last months is a black coat a sword and silver buckles white silk stockings and a sword knot of black and white It is altogether contrary to propriety to select for yourself at the shops the articles of mourning to have them made in your presence or to make them yourself and for a fortnight at least and sometimes even for the six first weeks ladies ought not to sew even while receiving their relations and intimate friends so much are they supposed to be depressed by their affliction During forty days we do not leave the house except to go to church it would be very improper to visit dine out or go to any assembly during the first mourning When this time has expired we make visits of mourning and go out a little more but we cannot yet appear in public promenades at spectacles or balls we cannot sing even at home It is only at the time of half mourning that we resume by degrees our former habits of life For ten days at least after the death of a very near relation it would be very reprehensible for people whose profession recalls ideas of pleasure as musicians or dancing masters to return to their employment In full mourning we should wear neither curls nor perfumes To be present at a funeral or even to look at one passing are forbidden at this time Attending a funeral service other than that of a relation is equally prohibited Excepting during this period it is impolite not to attend when invited to the funeral service of your acquaintances You should appear there in mourning At the funeral service as well as at the interment the male relatives go first and then those invited the female relatives go next and are followed by other ladies If we marry a person who is in mourning we put on black the day after our marriage the time preceding is reckoned as if the mourning had been worn On the contrary if we ourselves are married again at a time when the death of a relation by our former marriage requires this sombre dress we leave it off immediately since our new union annuls the former alliance Visits which are paid to persons in mourning are called visits of condolence In making them we observe silence and never inquire about their health this would be out of place A gentleman offers them his hand a lady embraces them even though they are but slightly acquainted We refrain from conversing on too gay or personal subjects If we are at a distance we testify by letter our sympathy in the misfortune which afflicts them Their grief cannot excuse them from answering us but it is not immediately necessary With this subject we shall conclude our treatise of politeness hoping that having arrived at this point our readers may say Without any doubt the work is full and methodical we shall not dare to flatter ourselves with more but this is enough for it is being sure that our labor has been useful We trust then that we have rendered an essential service to youth in making them acquainted with these rules which have become so necessary in truth politeness on which at the present day we pride ourselves is a virtue which we ought never to renounce since it gives to the intercourse of life that sweetness pleasure elegance and charm which can be truly felt only by those who possess it As the intellectual Madam Lambert has said Politeness is the desire of pleasing those with whom we are obliged to live and in a manner causing all around us to be satisfied with us superiors with our respect equals with our esteem and inferiors with our kindness twenty two Several of the particulars which follow are not observed in this country T twenty three It is not the custom among us to dispense with
