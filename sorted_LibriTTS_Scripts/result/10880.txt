7704_106965_000007_000000	train-clean-360	An Antagonist
7704_106965_000008_000000	train-clean-360	He stood in the centre of a little crowd of village boys his golden head was bare in the blazing sun but the crop of curls seemed thick enough to protect him from its rays and he was far too engrossed in his occupation to heed any discomfort from the heat 
none	none	A slim delicate little lad with a finely cut face and blue eyes that by turns would sparkle with animation and then settle into a dreamy wistfulness with a deep far away look in them 
7704_106965_000009_000001	train-clean-360	They were dancing and flashing with excitement now and his whole frame was quivering with enthusiasm with head thrown back and tongue hand and foot all in motion he seemed to have his audience completely spell bound and they listened with open eyes and mouths to his oration 
7704_106965_000010_000000	train-clean-360	With one hand he was fingering a large brass button which figured conspicuously in the centre of his small waistcoat and this button was the subject of his theme 
none	none	My father he rushed forward Come on men we ll save the old colours And they shouted Hurrah as they made after him There were guns going and shells flying and swords flashing and hacking away and the enemy poured on with fiery red faces and gnashing teeth 
7704_106965_000011_000002	train-clean-360	My father drew his sword and no one could stand against him no one 
7704_106965_000011_000003	train-clean-360	He cut and he slashed and heads and arms and legs rolled off as quick as lightning one after the other 
7704_106965_000011_000004	train-clean-360	He got up to the colours and with a shout he plunged his sword right through the enemy s body that had stolen them 
7704_106965_000011_000005	train-clean-360	The enemy fell stone dead 
none	none	My father seized the colours and looked round 
7704_106965_000011_000007	train-clean-360	He was alone The other soldiers had been beaten back 
7704_106965_000011_000008	train-clean-360	But was he in a funk 
7704_106965_000011_000009	train-clean-360	No he gave a loud Hurrah picked up his sword and fought his way back the enemy hard after him 
7704_106965_000011_000010	train-clean-360	It was a race for life and he ran backwards the whole way he wasn t going to turn his back to the enemy 
7704_106965_000011_000011	train-clean-360	He pressed on shouting Hurrah till he got to his own side again and then he reached his colonel 
none	none	Captain dead sir I ve got the colours He saluted as he said it and then dropped dead himself at the colonel s feet the blood gushing out of his heart and over his clothes and over this button 
7704_106965_000013_000000	train-clean-360	The little orator paused as he sank his voice to a tragic whisper then raising it again he added triumphantly And thirty bullets and six swords had gone through my father s body 
7704_106965_000013_000001	train-clean-360	That was something like a soldier 
7704_106965_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I say murmured a small sceptic from the crowd it was twenty bullets last time make it fifty Teddy 
7704_106965_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 And that s the story of my button pursued the boy ignoring with scorn this last remark 
7704_106965_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 And did your father have only one button to his coat 
none	none	The voice was a strange one and the boys turned round to meet the curious gaze of a sturdy little damsel who had unnoticed joined the group 
7704_106965_000017_000001	train-clean-360	She was not dressed as an ordinary village child but in a little rough serge sailor suit with a large hat to match set well back on a quantity of loose dark hair 
7704_106965_000017_000002	train-clean-360	A rosy cheeked square set little figure she was and her brown eyes fringed with long black lashes looked straight at Teddy with something of defiance and scorn in their glance 
none	none	Though at first a little taken aback Teddy rose to the occasion One button he said with emphasis the coat was sent to mother with only one button left on and if you here he turned upon his questioner with a little fierceness if you had been through such a bloody battle and killed so many men you would have burst and lost all your buttons and not had one left like father 
7704_106965_000020_000000	train-clean-360	There was a round of applause at this but the small maiden remained undaunted 
7704_106965_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Is that a true story you told she demanded with severity in her tone 
7704_106965_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course it s true was the indignant shout of all 
7704_106965_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Then I tell you boy I don t believe a word of it And with set determined lips she turned on her heel and walked away having sown seeds of anger and resentment in more than one boyish breast 
7704_106965_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Who is she asked Teddy as tired and exhausted by his recital he threw himself on the grass to rest 
7704_106965_000024_000001	train-clean-360	One of the bigger boys answered him 
7704_106965_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 I seed her come yesterday in a cab from the town to old Sol at the turnpike she and her mother I reckon 
7704_106965_000025_000001	train-clean-360	They had two carpet bags and a box and a poll parrot in a cage 
none	none	I counted them myself for I was havin a ride behind and the woman she called Sol Father so the little un must be his grandarter P raps they ve come from Mericky suggested a small urchin capering round on his hands and feet Polls allays comes over the sea you know Illustration TEDDY TELLS THE STORY OF HIS FATHER S HEROIC DEATH
7704_106965_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 She didn t believe me murmured Teddy chewing a wisp of grass meditatively 
7704_106965_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Gals is no good never 
none	none	If she d been a boy you would a fought her but I shouldn t care for naught like her Ted 
7704_106965_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Teddy turned his face upwards to the speaker 
7704_106965_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 No I couldn t have fought her Sam if she d been a boy 
7704_106965_000030_000002	train-clean-360	I ve promised my mother I won t fight again till she gives me leave 
7704_106965_000030_000003	train-clean-360	You see I fought four boys in one week last time and she says she won t have it 
7704_106965_000030_000004	train-clean-360	I don t see if it is right for soldiers to fight why it isn t right for boys 
7704_106965_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t think there s any fellers left for you to fight with so you re pretty safe 
7704_106965_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Besides it was only Tom Larken who set them on to try and get your button from you and he s gone off to another part of the country now 
none	none	I think p raps went on Teddy slowly as he turned over on his back and looked up at the clear blue sky above him that I wasn t quite true about the bullets 
7704_106965_000032_000001	train-clean-360	I think it was six bullets and three sword cuts 
7704_106965_000032_000002	train-clean-360	I forget when I tell it how many it was but she said she didn t believe a word 
7704_106965_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Five o clock struck by the old church clock close by 
7704_106965_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Teddy was upon his feet in an instant and with a wild whoop and shout he was scudding across the green his curls flying in the wind and his little feet hardly seeming to touch the ground 
7704_106965_000033_000002	train-clean-360	There was none in the village so quick footed as Teddy and for daring feats and downright pluck he held the foremost place 
none	none	Perhaps this accounted for his popularity perhaps it was his marvellous aptitude for telling stories many of them wild productions from his fertile brain but certain it was that he was the pet and the darling of the village and none as yet had resisted his sway Over the green up a shady lane across two fields and then breathless and panting Teddy paused before an old fashioned farmhouse He passed his hands lightly through his curls pulled himself up with a jerk and then quietly and sedately opened a latched door and entered the long low roofed kitchen 
7704_106965_000035_000000	train-clean-360	There was something very restful in the scene 
none	none	A square substantial table covered with a white cloth in the centre a large bowl of roses and honeysuckle home made bread and golden butter a glass dish of honey in its comb a plate of fresh watercress and a currant loaf completed the simple fare 
7704_106965_000035_000002	train-clean-360	Presiding at the tea tray was a stern forbidding looking woman of sixty or more opposite her was seated her son the master of the farm a heavy faced sleepy looking man and at his side facing the door sat Teddy s mother 
7704_106965_000035_000003	train-clean-360	A sweet gentle faced young woman she was with the same deep blue eyes as her little son she bore no resemblance to the elder woman and looked as she indeed was superior to her surroundings 
7704_106965_000035_000004	train-clean-360	Two years ago she had come with her child to make her home amongst her husband s people and though at first her mother in law missus Platt was inclined to look upon her contemptuously as a poor delicate useless creature time proved to her that for steady quiet work no one could eclipse her daughter in law 
7704_106965_000035_000005	train-clean-360	Young missus John as she was called was now her right hand and the dairy work of the farm was made over entirely to her 
7704_106965_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Late again you young scamp was the stern greeting of his grandmother as Teddy appeared on the scene 
7704_106965_000037_000000	train-clean-360	The boy looked at her with a twinkle in his eye put his little hand to his forehead and gave her a military salute 
7704_106965_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Sorry was all he said as he slipped into the chair that was waiting for him 
7704_106965_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 What have you been doing sonny asked the young mother whose eyes had brightened at the sight of him 
7704_106965_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Telling father s story replied Teddy with alacrity 
none	none	A shadow came over his mother s face her lips took a distressed curve but she said nothing only occupied herself with attending to the child s wants
7704_106965_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 Your father was never late for his meals the grandmother put in with asperity 
7704_106965_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Never granny 
7704_106965_000042_000001	train-clean-360	Not when he was a boy 
7704_106965_000042_000002	train-clean-360	I shall be always in time when I m a soldier 
7704_106965_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Better begin now then bad habits like weeds grow apace 
none	none	Teddy had no answer for this his mouth was full of bread and butter and he did not speak till the meal was over 
7704_106965_000044_000001	train-clean-360	Then whilst tea was being taken away by the women he turned to his uncle who pulling out a pipe from his pocket sat down by the open door to smoke 
7704_106965_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Uncle Jake 
7704_106965_000046_000000	train-clean-360	A grunt was the only response but that was sufficient 
7704_106965_000046_000001	train-clean-360	The two perfectly understood each other and a minute after Teddy was perched on his knee 
7704_106965_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 I m wondering if I can t get an enemy the boy proceeded folding his small arms and looking up at his uncle steadily all good people had enemies in the Bible and I haven t one I should like to have a good right down enemy 
7704_106965_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 To fight asked his uncle 
7704_106965_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 To carry on with you know he would lay traps for me and I would for him like David and Saul we should have a fine time of it 
none	none	And then perhaps if he did something dreadfully wrong mother would give me leave to fight him just once in a way 
7704_106965_000049_000002	train-clean-360	Don t you think that would be nice 
7704_106965_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Fightin ain t the only grand thing in this world peace is grander was the slow response to this appeal 
7704_106965_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 That s what mother says 
7704_106965_000051_000001	train-clean-360	She made me learn this morning Blessed are the peacemakers but you must have an enemy to make peace with and I haven t got one 
7704_106965_000052_000000	train-clean-360	There was silence the uncle puffed away at his pipe he was a good man and had more brains than his appearance warranted but Teddy s speeches were often a sore puzzle to him 
7704_106965_000052_000001	train-clean-360	The boy continued in a slow thoughtful tone I saw some one to day that I feel might be an enemy but she s a girl men don t fight with women 
7704_106965_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 I d rather tackle a man than a woman any day 
7704_106965_000053_000001	train-clean-360	They be a powerful enemy sometimes lad 
7704_106965_000053_000002	train-clean-360	And what have this young maid done to you 
none	none	She said and Teddy s eyes grew bright whilst the blood rushed into his cheeks she said she didn t believe a word of father s story not a word of it 
7704_106965_000054_000001	train-clean-360	And she laughed and walked away 
7704_106965_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 That was coming it strong and who is she to talk so 
7704_106965_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 She s a stranger Sam said she s come to live with old Sol at the turnpike 
7704_106965_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 That must be Grace s child said old missus Platt coming up and joining in the conversation 
none	none	I heard she was coming to stay with her father this summer and glad I am of it too the old man is very lonely 
7704_106965_000057_000002	train-clean-360	I suppose her husband is at sea again 
7704_106965_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 What is her husband inquired Teddy s mother as with work in hand she came out and took a seat in the old fashioned porch 
7704_106965_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 A sailor 
7704_106965_000059_000001	train-clean-360	Grace was always a roving nature herself 
none	none	She never would settle down quiet and take a husband from these parts 
7704_106965_000059_000003	train-clean-360	She was maid to our squire s lady then and went to foreign parts with her but folks say she s steadied down now wonderful 
none	none	They ve been living at Portsmouth she and her little girl CHAPTER II When Greek Meets Greek Then Comes The Tug Of War Two little determined figures with flushed resolute faces stood opposite one another on a narrow footbridge over a running stream Neither could pass the other but neither intended going back and the sturdy maiden in her sailor dress with her small hands placed on her hips appeared quite a match for Teddy who with his golden head well up looked like a war horse scenting the battle field It was thus they met again both employing their Saturday afternoon in roaming along the edge of a stream they had suddenly come face to face with one another You re to let me come over first she asserted very emphatically because I m a girl Illustration YOU RE TO LET ME COME OVER FIRST SHE ASSERTED Boys never go back A soldier s son never I m not going to turn my back before the enemy I would disgrace my button if I did That old button The tone was that of utmost scorn Teddy s cheeks grew rosy red at once but he said nothing I got to this bridge before you did she continued I began to cross it first And you who are you No one knows anything about you I have been crossing this bridge for years More reason you shouldn t cross it now My name is Nancy Wright that s who I am A princess could not have revealed her name more royally She added after a pause And I mean to come over first so go back Never I never go back Then I shall push you over in the water Come on and try then Then there was silence both the little people eyed each other defiantly yet a little doubtfully as if measuring one another s strength and their faces grew eager at the coming contest Boys always ought to give way to girls always Nancy said using her strongest plea you re not a proper boy at all You re not a proper girl You re wearing a boy s hat and a boy s jacket I m a sailor s daughter and everybody can see I am You say you re a soldier s son why don t you dress like one Teddy felt he was getting the worst of it He fingered his button proudly I m wearing something that has been in the thick of a bloody battle that s more than you can do Sailors don t know much of fighting They know just as much as soldiers and as to your old button I b lieve you just picked up the old brass thing from the gutter If you weren t a girl I d fight you sputtered Teddy now with rising wrath Pooh I expect I could lick you I don t b lieve you have half as big a muscle as I have on my arm A girl have muscle It s just a bit of fat The tone of scorn proved too much for Nancy s self control with a passionate exclamation she made a quick rush across the plank there was a struggle and the result was what might have been expected a great splash a scream from Nancy and both little figures were immersed in the stream Happily the water was not very deep and after a few minutes scrambling they were on dry ground considerably sobered by their immersion Teddy began to laugh a little shamefacedly but Nancy was very near tears I ll tell my mother you nearly drowned me dead If you re a sailor s daughter you oughtn t to be afraid of the water sailors and fish are always in the sea They re never in it never Well they re on it as close as they can be to it Why you re nearly crying But you re only a girl and a sailor s girl can t be very brave not like a soldier s girl would be Sailors are much braver than soldiers said Nancy quickly swallowing down her tears and when they do fight they re in much more danger than the soldiers Father said how would soldiers like the earth to swallow them up just when they ve been fighting hard and got the victory That s what the sea does to the poor sailors Their ship begins to sink and they send up three cheers for queen and country and then stand on deck with folded arms and go down down down to the bottom of the sea and never make a cry Nancy forgot her wet clothes in her eloquence and Teddy stared wonderingly at her Well he said as if considering the matter they may be sometimes brave but they don t fight like the soldiers and they have no banners and red coats and band and they don t know how to march A sailor walks anyhow I saw one once and I thought he was tipsy but he wasn t A sailor walks like a goose he waddles You re the horridest rudest boy I ve ever seen And with the utmost dignity Nancy walked away Teddy calling after her You made a pretty good charge for a girl but you couldn t get past me And then with one of his loud whoops he raced home and hardly drew a breath till he reached the farmhouse door His grandmother confronted him at once You young rascal what have you been doing You re never a day out of mischief If I was your mother I d give you a good whipping but she spoils you And you do too granny Teddy s laughing blue eyes as he raised them to the grim face before him conquered as they generally did There go to your mother she s in the dairy I wash my hands of you But Teddy crept up to his little room to change his wet clothes before he met his mother and then was very silent about his adventure merely saying by way of explanation that he had fallen into the brook but at tea a short time after he suddenly said If you put a sailor and a soldier together which would you choose Uncle Jake Eh my laddie Well they re both good in their way I couldn t say I m sure Mother wouldn t you say the soldier was the bravest Perhaps I might sonny but a sailor can be quite as brave Teddy s face fell I never thought a sailor could fight at all he said in a disappointed tone I thought they just took care of our ships and now and then fired a big gun off Who s been bringing up the sailors to you asked his grandmother That little girl I told you of Nancy her name is Where have you seen her Down by the brook we fell into the water together because we both wanted to cross at once But my boy that was naughty for you not to give place to her and missus John spoke reprovingly I know it was mother but I wasn t going to turn back That would be running away from the enemy You see we met in the middle and she s not at all a nice girl and she s so proud and stuck up about the sailors As proud as you are of the redcoats I guess old missus Platt said Do sailors and soldiers like each other questioned Teddy ignoring the thrust I am sure I don t know his mother answered smiling I have never seen them together that I remember but I should think they did They both fight for their queen and country Well
7704_106969_000077_000001	train-clean-360	 I m a soldier s son 
none	none	and I don t like a sailor s daughter I know that I think she is a kind of enemy Oh hush sonny You must have no enemies It is wrong to talk so That s what he was a sayin to me t other day put in his uncle slowly he says he wants one Yes I do and Teddy gave a fervent nod as he spoke and mother I believe most good people have enemies so it must be right to have one They never make one as you re trying to do Teddy looked puzzled Well he said presently I expect it s because she s a stranger She doesn t belong to our village I don t like strangers She s no more a stranger than you were when you first came here his mother said and the fact of her being a stranger ought to make you kind to her I m thinking of calling on her mother old missus Platt said looking at her little grandson with her keen grey eyes shall I take you with me to see the little girl I ve seen her enough granny Please I think I d rather not The subject was dropped but Teddy s thoughts were busy He ran down to the village green after tea and there met one or two of his special chums to whom he confided the events of the afternoon They highly applauded the scene at the bridge but Teddy shook his curly head a little doubtfully Men ought always to give way to women I ve heard mother say but I couldn t turn back you see it would have disgraced my button Tell you what cried Harry Brown commonly known as Carrots from his fiery hair you could a done what the goats did in the primer at school you ought ter have laid flat down and let her walk across you She would have hurt dreadful Teddy observed thoughtfully Besides she s so proud I don t think I would have liked to do that No put in Sam Waters you did fine I say let s come up to the turnpike and see if she s about there I ll give her a word if she begins to sauce me Teddy agreed to this and the trio trotted off along a flat dusty road Teddy beguiling the way by some of his wonderful stories till they came in sight of the low thatched cottage covered with roses that guarded the turnpike They soon saw the young damsel for she was swinging on the gate her dark hair flying in the wind and her eyes and cheeks bright with the exercise She looked at the boys then laughed Poor little button boy she said you have to be taken care of by two bigger ones We ve come to see you said Sam valiantly because we ain t going to stand any cheek from you so you had better look out Nancy stopped swinging and resting her fat little elbows on the topmost bar asked saucily Did the button boy tell you to come and help him fight me Are you all three going to try We don t fight girls said Teddy You push them into the water I didn t I told mother about it She thought you was a very rude boy not to wait till I crossed over There was silence then Carrots started forward Look here you ll have to learn your manners and we won t have a strange girl like you stick yourself up so We ve come to tell you to look out for yourself if you don t stop it Nancy laughed again and swung herself violently backwards and forwards Yo ho my lads yo ho she sang I m on my ship and I don t care for boys a bit they re all as stupid as they can be Yo ho We go Yo ho lads heave ho Her elevated position certainly seemed to give her an advantage We ll soon shake you off there shouted Sam his wrath rising at her calm indifference to the lords of creation Come on and try I m up the rigging and a storm is beginning Hurray come on Sam and Carrots made a furious onslaught and the gate was roughly handled but the more it shook and swung the more derisive was Nancy s laughter as she clutched a firm hold with her small hands and swayed to and fro calling out excitedly Furl the main sail Stand by lads steady starboard hard Port your helm Rocks to leeward Reef the top sail Breakers ahead Yo ho Teddy looked on awed by these nautical terms which seemed to slip so easily from her lips To him they seemed wonderfully clever but he was not one to stand aside long in a scene of excitement and with one of his wild war whoops he rushed forward On boys Charge Hurrah The gate rocked violently and Nancy began to feel her position was a perilous one All the little people were screaming at the top of their voices when suddenly in the midst of the din appeared old Sol What now Who are these trying to break one of Her Majesty s gates down Be off you young ruffians Teddy Platt you re at the bottom of all the mischief brewing in the parish I ll get my big stick out and give you a thrashing before I ve done with you Old Sol s words were fierce but the boys knew he had the softest heart in the village and they stood their ground It s all the button boy said Nancy eagerly as she descended from her perch and laid her little hand confidingly on the old man s arm He brought these boys up to fight me but I was up the mast and they couldn t shake me off We told you we wouldn t fight a girl protested Teddy indignantly you don t speak the truth Well what did you bring the boys for demanded the small maiden severely We came put in Sam boldly to tell you that if you were so cheeky you would soon get into trouble We ain t going to stand sauce from you What has the little lass been doing you young scoundrels They re only boys grandfather let us come in to mother and leave them They re the rudest boys I ve ever seen and the button boy is the worst and his button isn t worth a farthing There was a yell from all three boys at this That s it cried Carrots excitedly It s the button she s so cheeky about We ain t going to have Teddy s button laughed at We won t stand it Sol we won t It shows she don t know nothing or she wouldn t talk so She s just a baby that s what she is Why she doesn t believe father s story is true Sol You know it is don t you She isn t as old as the button itself Ha ha she wasn t born when it was in battle Much she knows about it Sol had difficulty in quieting the indignant voices Lookee here you boys go home and leave my little lass to me she knows nothing about the button I ll tell her the story and then she won t laugh at it any more Ay I remember seeing your father youngster He was a brave man he was but he would never have made war against little maids like this Shame on you get you home Get you gone I say or I ll bring my stick out She s been told the story She listened and she laughed She ought to say she s sorry Teddy stood with his legs wide apart and his hands in his pockets His tone was severe I ll never never never say I m sorry I m glad of what I said I don t believe a word of it And with this parting shot Nancy ran into the cottage and the boys returned to the village more slowly than they came Mother said Teddy that night as his mother bent down for a good night kiss I haven t been good to day and I don t feel good now I feel when I think it over so angry inside What is it about sonny Father s button The tone was drowsy and seeing his eyelids droop heavily missus John said no more only breathed a prayer that her little son might fight as bravely for Christ s honour as he did for that of his father s button CHAPTER III A Recruiting Sergeant It was Sunday morning Along a sweet scented lane with shady limes overhead and honeysuckle and wild roses growing in profusion on the hedges at each side walked Teddy s mother holding her little son tightly by the hand The bells of the village church were ringing out for the service and groups of two and three were passing in at the old lych gate missus John was talking in her sweet clear voice to her boy and he letting his restless blue eyes rove to and fro noting every bird on the hedges and every flower in the path kept bringing them back to his mother s face with a dreamy upward gaze I will try mother I really will I will keep my hands tight in my pockets and my feet close together I will pretend I m going to be shot by a file of soldiers and then I really think that will help me not to fidget I promise you I ll be good to day And having received this protestation from him missus John passed into church with a relieved mind Teddy s restless little body was a sore trial to any one who sat next him in church and many were the lectures that had been bestowed on him by Sunday school teacher and pastor besides the gentle admonitions of his mother As Teddy quietly perched himself on the seat beside his mother he murmured to himself Twenty soldiers in front of me twenty rifles pointing I shall stand like a rock I ll set my teeth and I shan t even blink my eyes Now I see the officer coming he s going to say Present I m not moving a muscle Five minutes more they ll give me His active brain here received a check There on the opposite side facing him was Nancy seated between her mother and old Sol She was still in her sailor suit and with her dark mischievous brown eyes fixed steadily on him Teddy could not remain unmoved beneath her gaze for long His little hands were working nervously in his coat pockets Why did she stare at him so Well he could stare back and then blue eyes and brown confronted each other for some moments with unblinking defiance in their gaze At last Teddy s patience gave way and twisting up his little features into a most grotesque grimace he mounted a hassock to give her the full benefit of it Instantly out came a little red tongue at him and at this daring piece of audacity he gasped out loud I hate you Then as all eyes in the surrounding pews were turned upon him and his mother s shocked gaze met his Teddy crimsoned to the roots of his hair and taking up a large Prayer book he used it as a shield from his small antagonist during the remainder of the service As the congregation were leaving the church later on the rector made his way to young missus Platt who was lingering talking to a neighbour He was a grey haired gentle faced man with a slow dreamy manner in speaking missus John what has happened to make your little boy so forget himself this morning Indeed sir I cannot say I really thought he was going to be good to day I think he had better come to tea with me this afternoon and we will have a little talk together Teddy looked up with awe in his blue eyes He well knew that this was the rector s usual practice when any delinquent was brought before his notice but it had never yet fallen to his lot to receive the invitation mister Upton had his own way of doing things so people said and he had greater faith in reasoning with any culprits than scolding them whether they were grown men or women or children Teddy s restless ways in church had been a trial to him for a long time and he felt that this morning s action must receive a check Thank you sir responded missus John he shall come to you after school is over this afternoon And Teddy completely sobered walked home beside his mother without uttering a word At half past four he stood on the rectory doorsteps looking into the cool broad hall in front of him which led out of a glass door at the opposite end into a brilliant flower garden Spotless white druggeting covered the floor and stairs and everything indoors denoted a careful housekeeper mister Upton was a widower and was to a great extent ruled by two or three old and faithful servants As the boy stood there the rector appeared and led him into his study We shall have half an hour before tea to have a little conversation my boy Sit down and tell me what you have been learning at Sunday school this afternoon Teacher was telling us about the children of Israel in Egypt I m afraid I don t remember very much what he said for I was busy thinking about coming to see you mister Upton smiled and drew the child on to talk then after he was thoroughly at ease he put a large Bible in front of him I want you to read me a verse in the First Epistle of saint John and the third chapter It is the fifteenth verse can you find it Yes sir and with an eager importance Teddy turned over the leaves Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer he read solemnly That will do Now think it over for five minutes in silence and then tell me what your thoughts are about it The boy hung his head in shame he folded his arms and sat immovable till the five minutes were over then he said timidly I wouldn t hate a brother I d like to have one Do you think it means the same when it s a girl Precisely the same a brother means any person in the world man woman or child Then I ought to be hung There was much self pity in Teddy s tone mister Upton did not smile he was gazing abstractedly out of the window and said slowly The root of murder is anger The same motive that prompts a passionate statement prompts a passionate and perhaps fatal blow There was silence then in a more cheerful tone the rector turned to the little culprit And now tell me the whole story and who it was that you spoke to in church Teddy was perfectly ready with his defence and he poured into his listener s ears such a voluble story that the rector was quite bewildered when it came to an end It s father s button I care about added the boy fingering his beloved object proudly and she didn t believe me a bit and she put out her tongue as long as ever she could Tell me the story of the button I have heard but have forgotten the details Teddy s eyes sparkled and his little head was raised erect again Slipping off his chair he stood in front of the rector and told the oft repeated tale with dramatic force and effect mister Upton listened with interest but before he could offer any comment on it tea was announced and taking the child by the hand he marched him into the dining room Hot tea cakes strawberry jam and plum cake kept our little friend fully occupied for some time He wondered if all the naughty boys interviewed by the rector had been treated to the same fare and he began to think an invitation to Sunday tea at the rectory highly desirable And now said mister Upton towards the end of the meal I want some more talk with you Your father was a brave soldier he died in saving the colours You want to grow up like him do you not Yes sir indeed I do There is a little verse in God s Word that describes our Lord s banner His colours Will you say it after me His banner over me was love Teddy repeated the verse slowly and with interest It is a wonderful banner pursued mister Upton thoughtfully the enemy confronted with it on every side In the thick of the fight we can but hoist our colours Love God s love to man when man is fighting from his infancy against his Maker What host would not march to meet the foe with such a banner dyed red with the life blood of their Captain the Son of God the Saviour of the world Teddy drew a long breath and when the rector paused he cried enthusiastically Please go on sir I like to hear it Will God let me hold up the banner for Him If you have enlisted in His service Are you one of His soldiers I don t know God always wants each of us to present ourselves to Him if we want to enlist in His army Have you done that There must come a time in our lives when we yield ourselves wholly and unreservedly to the one who is our rightful owner Why my boy do you believe that Jesus died upon the cross to save you Did He bear your sins for you there Yes said Teddy fixing his blue eyes earnestly on the rector I really believe He did for mother has often explained it to me Then how dare you stand aloof from His army How is it that you have never enlisted Are you marching along in the enemy s ranks Teddy s small hands were clenched and his eyes lit up with a great resolve I ll enlist at once sir I ll be one of God s soldiers now How are you going to do it I don t know Tell me please There was silence mister Upton met the child s earnest upward gaze with awe as he realised how much hung on his words He had a firm belief in children being able to lead a consistent Christian life He knew the Master would accept a child s heart and guide and keep the frail and helpless steps on the way heavenward And with a swift prayer for guidance he spoke You must tell God about it yourself and don t be in a hurry Kneel down quietly by yourself somewhere and first of all ask that the Holy Spirit may guide you that your sins may be blotted out and your name written in the Book of Life for the sake of Jesus who died for you Then tell God you want Him to enlist you and give yourself right up to Him for now and for all eternity mister Upton spoke slowly and emphatically he knew he often preached above the heads of his little hearers and he strove to speak in simple language now Teddy remained very silent then he said And if I enlist shall I have to be God s soldier for ever and ever till I m an old man of a hundred with white hair and no teeth Would you rather be one of the devil s soldiers No You are quite right to think it over I would rather you did not decide too hastily Go home and think it out And come and tell me when you have decided The boy s white brow was crumpled with anxious creases I should like to be one of God s soldiers but who shall I have to fight Any real enemies or only make believe I will tell you about your enemies after you have enlisted I can show you one very real one that is your worst enemy Can you A real live one A real live one 
7704_106974_000072_000000	train-clean-360	Teddy smiled 
none	none	contentedly Now added mister Upton I am going to send you home If you enlist the first person you will have to hold up your banner to is that little girl whom you said you hated Before you go I want to pray for you Kneel down with me The evening sunshine streamed in through the open window and alighting on the white hair of the minister and the boy s fair curls as they knelt together bathed them in a golden glory With closed eyes and folded hands Teddy listened to mister Upton s prayer Loving Father another lamb I bring to Thee Guide him in his decision and if he enters Thy fold use him and bless him through all eternity Grant that he may fight a good fight and be crowned with glory hereafter For Jesus Christ s sake Amen An hour later and Teddy was seated by his mother s side in the old porch His grandmother and uncle had gone to evening church and missus John was left with her boy alone He had been telling her the substance of his conversation with the rector and now curled up on the low wooden seat his small legs crossed underneath him he was gazing dreamily out into the sweet scented garden The bees were droning and the gnats humming amongst the tall hollyhocks and crimson and white roses close by the birds were already twittering their last good nights to one another and a soft peaceful spell seemed to be falling on all around I feel he said presently as he gazed up into the still blue sky as if God is waiting for me mother missus John did not answer He added quickly When did you enlist mother long long ago Yes darling just before I married your father And when did father enlist When he was a little boy like me Not till he was a grown man sonny He often used to say he wished he had given his heart to God when he was younger I suppose God will take little soldiers Do you think I shall be the youngest He has No darling He has many brave little soldiers younger than you Another long silence then a deep drawn sigh from Teddy I feel I have very big thoughts to night mother and I get so crowded thinking Will you read to me before I go to bed missus John pressed her lips on the curly head so near her My boy I am so glad for you to have these thoughts Mother has often prayed that you may be one of Christ s little soldiers and servants Now what shall I read Read me about the three men and the burning fiery furnace And the young mother took her Bible in hand and drawing her boy close to her till his little head rested against her shoulder read him the story he wished Later on as she tucked him up in bed and was giving him a kiss he clasped his arms round her neck and whispered I think I m going to do it quite by myself to morrow CHAPTER IV Enlisting for Life The village children were swarming out of school the next afternoon The heat and confinement of the crowded schoolroom had not lessened the superabundance of energy and high spirits amongst them and the boys soon congregated on the green bent on a game of cricket Where s Teddy Teddy Platt Young Ted where s he got to Fetch Teddy This was the general cry But Teddy was nowhere to be seen Has he been kept in queried one Likely enough He s up in the clouds to day Oh ain t he just Why I offered him half such a huge apple My it was a beauty And his eyes sort o wandered away from it as if it had been a piece of mud Thanks ses he I ll have a bite to morrer not to day And teacher was down on him sharp too put in another eager voice He answered all the rithmetic wrong and he said forty soldiers made a rood And teacher ses Is your head good for nothing but soldiers And Ted he got as red as fire and says It s full of them to day sir and teacher said Go down to the bottom of the class till you can empty it of them then and tell me when you ve done it And when Ted comes next to me I says Is your button lost old chap that you re in such a stew And he says No the button is all right but I m thinkin how to enlist He ll go for a drummer boy as soon as he s big enough and I ll go with him cried Carrots Oh come on shouted one of the impatient ones if Ted s not here let us begin without him And Teddy s delinquencies at school were soon forgotten in the excitement of the game He had not been kept in but had slipped away the minute school was over and was soon dodging in and out of the thick overhanging trees along the edge of his favourite stream His little feet sped swiftly along and as he ran he talked in a whisper to himself which was his way when anything special was weighing on his mind I ll go right into the wood and get under a thick tree I won t let a squirrel see me nor even a rabbit I must be quite quiet and it must be like church and I shan t come away till I ve done it Into the wood he went but he was hard to satisfy roaming here and there peeping round corners and thrusting his curly head in amongst the bushes it was fully half an hour before he chose his spot It was a secluded little nook under an old oak tree where the moss grew thick and green and bushes of all sorts and sizes formed a natural bower round the gnarled trunk In front of this tree Teddy stood and then half shyly half reverently he took off his cap and laid it on the ground Looking up through the veil of green leaves above him to the sunny blue sky beyond he stood with clasped hands and parted lips for a moment or two in perfect silence The soft wind played gently with his curls and rustled amongst the leafy boughs overhead and in the distance the birds sweet voices were the only sounds that met his ears As the boy s eyes came back to earth they seemed to have reflected in them something of the bright sunshine above and then down on his knees he dropped Placing his little clasped hands against the old trunk in front of him and bending his golden head till it rested likewise against the tree Teddy prayed aloud slowly and with frequent pauses O God here I am Have You been waiting for me I ve come to enlist And please I forget all mister Upton told me to say but will You forgive me my sins and write my name down in Your book in heaven Edward James Platt is my name I ve come to be Your soldier for ever and ever Will You please keep me always I never want to go back from being Your soldier Make me fight a grand fight and help me to hold Your colours up well and please God will You tell father I ve enlisted this afternoon mister Upton said You would take me I thank You for letting Jesus die for me and I m very sorry I haven t belonged to His army before but I didn t quite understand that He wanted me Help me to be a good boy for Jesus Christ s sake Amen A child s prayer but it was prayed with a child s strong faith and as Teddy rose to his feet he had the assurance that God had accepted him That scene in the wood when he dedicated himself to the service of the King of kings would be stamped on his memory as long as he lived And now that the deed was done a great load seemed to be lifted off his mind He came into the midst of the boys on the green a short time afterwards with a radiant face and took his share in fielding bowling and batting with such a vigour and will that he proved himself the hero of the hour Later in the evening he wandered into the dairy where his mother was busy and asked her if he could go and see the rector What for sonny He asked me to come Is it too late do you think I should like to go to night missus John looked down upon the eager little face lifted to hers Run away then but don t stay long And so it was that for the second time that week Teddy was a visitor at the rectory Please sir I ve done it he exclaimed breathlessly as soon as he was ushered into the presence of the rector Eh What have you been doing And mister Upton roused himself from a reverie into which he had fallen as he sat at his study window and watched his favourite beehives Then noting the disappointed look on the child s face and recognising who it was he added briskly Ah it is Teddy Platt is it And so you ve done it have you Thank God Yes I remember all about it You re a fresh recruit Teddy s eyes glistened I enlisted this afternoon sir For life did you No short service system with God mister Upton had at one time been chaplain to troops abroad and it was his knowledge of military matters that so attracted the boy Yes for life sir May God keep you true to Himself my boy in life and in death There was a pause then Teddy said eagerly Please sir you said you would show me one of the enemies I have got to fight Ah did I One of the many which one I wonder A real live one you said Yes I remember Come this way He led the child into his drawing room in front of a large mirror reaching down to the ground and told him to find his enemy there Why it s only myself Teddy said in a disappointed tone though there was wonder in his eyes That s it yourself small Teddy Platt is your worst enemy and the older you live the more you will discover what a very formidable and mighty enemy he is Please sir I don t understand Sit down here by me and let me try to explain it to you If you are going to try to serve the Lord Jesus Christ you will find that you will have two Teddies to deal with a good one and a bad one The bad one is your enemy Now you told me you were angry with that little girl Are you angry still I ve forgotten all about her I I don t love her The bad Teddy in you doesn t like her but the good Teddy will Now you must fight against the bad Teddy and overcome him Jesus will help you you can t fight without Him I think I know said Teddy thoughtfully Last week some fellow said Come and get some apples from the Park orchard I wanted to dreadful That was my bad self but I thought it would be stealing and I didn t go That was my good self wasn t it Quite right Keep close to your Captain Our Officer always leads and remember Forward no quarter to the enemy Then gazing abstractedly out into the garden mister Upton added as if to himself But I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members Who shall deliver me from the body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin The next day when at dinner for it was generally at meal times Teddy chose to make his observations he looked round the table appealingly What s the very ugliest name that could be given a boy Sakes alive ejaculated his grandmother And who may you be wanting to christen It isn t for a baby a boy about as old as me What do you think s an ugly name I don t think any name is very ugly his mother said If you like a person their name always seems to fit I knew two boys named Tobiah and Eli I didn t like the names at first though they are Bible ones but when I got to know and like the boys I liked the names I want a much more hideous name asserted Teddy some name that would describe a very wicked person I hope you are not going to call any one by it observed his grandmother suspiciously Teddy lifted his blue eyes up to her solemnly I expect I ll find one for myself he said and nothing more could be got out of him After dinner a half holiday having been given the school children Teddy stole out to the woods When out of sight he began a brisk conversation with himself as was his wont and it may give us an insight into his busy brain if we listen Blackey might do or Goggles or Grubby or Nigger or Toad I want to have some name else I shan t be able to talk to him so well I wish mother had helped me it s very differcult I can t seem to think of a name quite ugly enough I expect p raps mister Upton could tell me I ll wait and ask him I hope I shan t have to wait long for I want it all settled so that I can begin to fight properly with him Now I ve got to find Nancy mister Upton said I was to be friends with her and I ve got to hold up my banner of love over her I hope she ll like it She s a horrid Aha that s my enemy just going to speak A horrid girl you were going to say were you Now you just get out Nancy is a very nice girl at least she soon will be I ll try and think her nice I will I ve got to fight you enemy if you say such things Why I do clare there she is climbing that tree Teddy s conversation came to an end and he stared with open mouth and eyes at the nimble way Nancy was climbing up an old beech tree He gave a shrill whistle which made the little girl look round Not a bit disconcerted was she Aha it s the stupid little button boy You can t catch me It was a challenge Instantly Teddy stripped off his jacket and darted to the tree She had got a good start and even he caught his breath in wonder at her rapid ascent and the fearless way in which she seemed to plant her small feet on the most fragile looking branches Up they went panting with the exercise but at length she could go no further and seating herself on a comfortable bough she looked mischievously down at him You couldn t catch me you don t know how to climb My father taught me I can go up the rigging as far as any sailor boy and this is my ship but I ll let you sit down by me if you behave yourself Teddy swung himself across a bough opposite her and was silent for a moment Each child was trying to recover breath and Teddy was considering how to make peace He did it in his own quaint fashion I think we re pretty close to heaven he remarked presently lifting his soft blue eyes to the clear sky above I wonder if that s the reason birds in their nests agree The angels can t like to hear quallering so close to them I m not going to quarrel and you didn t say that word right What word Quarrering And Nancy s tone was emphatic though a doubt stole into her own mind as to whether her pronunciation was correct But Teddy was too intent upon pulling something out of his pocket to notice her correction He slowly unrolled a large white pocket handkerchief tied it carefully to a twig which he broke off from an adjoining branch and then held it up in front of her I did it myself this morning he said with pride I asked Uncle Jake for one of his best handkerchiefs He gave it to me last night and I did it with a pen and ink before breakfast Can you read it Nancy looked at the straggling uneven black letters that occupied the whole width across Love she said curiously what does that mean It s my banner of love that I m going to carry for my Captain It means I ve got to love even you Nancy s red lips pouted I don t want you to love me she said I ve got to do it How are you going to do it I m I m not quite sure I m never going to be angry with you And it s very hard Here a deep drawn sigh broke from him It s very hard but I ve got to tell you I m sorry I wouldn t let you cross the bridge first and I m sorry I said I hated you in church Nancy s bright dark eyes peered inquisitively into the dreamy blue ones opposite her Are you really sorry she said I think I am at least part of me is my enemy isn t but I am This was beyond Nancy s comprehension And you ll never get angry or set those horrid boys at me any more No I never will Here a big rosy cheeked apple was produced hastily out of the other pocket and presented as a peace offering It was taken in silence then as Nancy s white little teeth met in it she said with one of her beaming smiles And have I got to love you I think you had better because it will make it easier Well I will then if you ll do one thing What is it Give me that old button of yours Teddy fairly gasped at this audacity Give you father s button he cried never never never I d rather be shot dead or drownded dead or hung dead or chopped into little tiny bits I ll never give it up It s going to be on my coats and waistcoats till I m a hundred and then it will be buried in my grave with me Suppose I lost my button do you know what I would do Nancy gazed at the young orator with a little awe No she said what I would drop down and die my heart would burst and break and if I couldn t die very quick I wouldn t eat or drink nothing but I d go sadly to my grave and lay my head down and the next morning you would find me stiff and cold with my glassy eyes staring up at the sky like an old dog I read about Teddy s tone was so intensely tragic that Nancy was silent At last she said I ll never love you proper till you give it to me Will you like me a little instead I might do that she replied reluctantly And you won t never say you don t believe father s story I aren t going to promise Then as the very last bite was taken of the apple she added I ll hear some more of your stories first I want to hear one now Sally White told me at school you know all about fairies 
7704_106969_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Teddy nodded 
none	none	impressively then said slowly I make believe I do but I don t make believe father s story Tell me a story now Teddy clasped his hands round a bough and with knitted brows considered Then he looked up and the light sparkled in his eyes Shall I tell you about when I went into an oak tree and 
7704_106974_000001_000000	train-clean-360	found
none	none	 a little door leading down some steps that took me to the goblin s cave This sounded enchanting and Nancy eagerly prepared herself to listen Such a story was then poured out that it held her spell bound Goblins elves and fairies underground glories thrilling adventures and escapes Was it any wonder that with such a gift for story telling Teddy was the king of the village It came to an end at last and Nancy drew a long breath of relief and content when she heard the concluding sentence And I quickly opened the little door and there I was outside the oak and safe in the wood again Button boy I do like you she asserted with a quick little nod of her head Will you tell me another story soon P raps I will said Teddy feeling a little elated that he was gaining supremacy over her but I m going home now I only came out to have a think and to make friends with you What made you come and make it up the little maiden asked as after a scramble down they stood at the foot of the tree You said something about your Captain who is He Jesus Christ Teddy replied reverently and His banner is love so I have to love everybody whether I like them or not Why Because He wants me to and I m one of His soldiers now Has Jesus any sailors The question was put suddenly and the answer was given with a slight air of superiority No only soldiers He has Then I don t want to belong to Him I believe He has sailors just as well as soldiers only you re not telling true Her tone was getting wrathful but Teddy shook his head solemnly I m sure there s nothing about Jesus sailors in the Bible but I ll ask mother and then I ll tell you I must go home now Good bye We re going to be friends Yes we re going to be friends she repeated and then away they scampered in different directions Nancy calling out like a true little woman But I shan t really love you till you give me your button CHAPTER V

7704_106969_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 Please sir may I speak to you 
none	none	mister Upton was coming out of church after a choir practice when Teddy accosted him 
7704_106969_000004_000000	train-clean-360	He smiled when he saw the boy 
none	none	You may walk home with me and speak to me as much as you like And so they sauntered up the shady lane the old rector with his head bent and his hands crossed behind him and the boy all eager excitement and motion with suppressed importance in his tone
7704_106969_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 I want you to give me a name for my enemy please sir 
7704_106969_000007_000000	train-clean-360	mister Upton looked amused 
7704_106969_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 Have you had any battles with him yet 
7704_106969_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 I think I had one yesterday

7704_106969_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Granny was very angry with me because I had made Uncle Jake s best handkerchief into a banner of love 
7704_106969_000008_000003	train-clean-360	I didn t really think it was naughty 
7704_106969_000008_000004	train-clean-360	I wrote Love in ink right across it and I took such pains for I wanted to show it to Nancy 
7704_106969_000008_000005	train-clean-360	And when I got home granny was so angry that she took me by the collar and she locked me into the back kitchen and mother was out and I cried I was so miserable 
none	none	Granny said I would come to the workhouse she called me the wickedest mischievousest boy she d ever seen and said she would like to give me a good whipping And at last I got tired of being miserable and I looked about and I saw the window was partly open so I climbed up and then I thought I would jump out and run away across the fields till mother came home 
7704_106969_000008_000008	train-clean-360	And I was very happy then and I jumped right out and then I remembered but I didn t want to go back again 
7704_106969_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 And then the fight began suggested the rector as the boy paused 
none	none	Teddy nodded
7704_106969_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 I asked God to drive my enemy away but I was an awful long time thinking it out

7704_106969_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 And granny let me out soon after and I kissed her and said I was sorry but I told her how nearly I had run away and asked her to see that the window was locked next time so that I shouldn t have to fight so hard 
7704_106969_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 You will have plenty of fighting 
7704_106969_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Don t shirk the hottest part of the field that isn t being brave 
7704_106969_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Will you give me a horrid ugly name please sir 
7704_106969_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought your enemy s name was Teddy 
7704_106969_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 No that s mine I must have a name for him a different one you know 
none	none	How do you like Ego or Ipse
7704_106969_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 What funny names 
none	none	I think I like Ipse best I ll call him Ipse shall I But mister Upton s thoughts were far away by this time and presently he said as if to himself The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death Nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us It is a fight with certain victory ahead then why do we fail Shall I fail questioned a soft voice by his side Without Me ye can do nothing That s our Captain s word if you fight without Him you are done for I think I shall sometimes let Ipse have his way 
7704_106969_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Will that be deserting to the enemy 
7704_106969_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 It will be sure and certain defeat 
none	none	But then of course my Captain won t let me be beaten if I stick close to Him And so they talked a strange couple but the younger of them had a faith which the elder might envy and a grasp of the unseen that the ripest saint could not surpass 
7704_106969_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Not long after this Teddy and his schoolfellows were having a delightful afternoon in the woods 
7704_106969_000028_000001	train-clean-360	It was Saturday afternoon and they were playing their favourite war game Teddy of course being prime instigator of the whole affair 
none	none	A few of the more adventurous girls had joined them Nancy amongst them 
7704_106969_000028_000003	train-clean-360	Her respect for Teddy was gradually increasing though nothing seemed to quench her self assertion and independence of thought and action 
7704_106969_000028_000004	train-clean-360	At length Teddy announced his intention of going off on an expedition as a scout and on Nancy s insisting that she should come too the two children started made their way out of the wood and down to the banks of the stream which soon joined the river 
7704_106969_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 What have we to do asked Nancy 
7704_106969_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 It s great fun 
none	none	You see every one we meet is an enemy and we have to get past them without them seeing us we must crawl through the long grass or we must climb a tree or get through the bushes all kinds of adventures we have
7704_106969_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 And if we don t meet anybody 
7704_106969_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 That s why I came down this way there are always a lot of people fishing in the river 
none	none	Now look out don t you talk loud and step softly Just think that the first person who sees us will shoot us dead
7704_106969_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 But they won t 
7704_106969_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 You must make believe they will Teddy s tone was stern and Nancy was too occupied in holding her hat on her head as they crept through some low bushes to advance any more sceptical opinions 
7704_106969_000035_000000	train-clean-360	And then suddenly a short time after they came upon a fisherman 
7704_106969_000035_000001	train-clean-360	It was only a burly farmer who was evidently making a day of it for he sat under the shade of a tree with the remnants of a substantial lunch around him his fishing rod was in his hand but the line was out of the water and he with head thrown back and mouth wide open was fast asleep 
7704_106969_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Hush said Teddy in an excited whisper 
7704_106969_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 If he wakes all is up with us now let s get past him on tiptoe 
7704_106969_000037_000000	train-clean-360	This was accomplished safely but having passed him Teddy stood still and the spirit of mischief seized hold of him 
7704_106969_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Turning to Nancy he said with sparkling eyes What fun to take him prisoner and tie him up to the tree with his own fishing line 
7704_106969_000037_000002	train-clean-360	He s an enemy I really think it s our duty to do it 
7704_106969_000037_000003	train-clean-360	You stay here and watch me 
none	none	Deftly and quickly Teddy set to work but when he had once passed the line round the farmer s body and the tree he had no difficulty in finishing the work he had begun 
7704_106969_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Dancing like an elf with the line in his hand he spun round and round the tree till the line was wound round to its very last extremity and the farmer looked like some big bluebottle fly entangled in the fine meshes of a spider s web 
none	none	Still he slept on and with a delighted chuckle Teddy sped back to his little companion her eyes were dancing with mirth and she clapped her hands at the successful exploit He ll wake up and won t be able to get away 
7704_106969_000039_000001	train-clean-360	What fun how I should like to see him 
7704_106969_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Come on quick 
7704_106969_000040_000001	train-clean-360	He s Farmer Green and he s an awful angry man he gave Sam such a thrashing for tying an old saucepan to one of his pigs tails He won t know who has done it and I did tie the knots awful tight 
none	none	Away they ran but they had not proceeded far before Teddy came to a standstill and all the saucy sparkle died out of his eyes
7704_106969_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 What s the matter asked Nancy 
7704_106969_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 Have you got a pain 
none	none	I m afraid I am going to have a fight with Ipse 
7704_106969_000044_000000	train-clean-360	The words were uttered almost in a whisper and Nancy looked on with wonder 
7704_106969_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 It isn t right he said after a long pause 
none	none	I do want at least Ipse wants to leave him there awfully but mother would say it was very naughty and I think I think my Captain doesn t like it I shall have to go back and undo him
7704_106969_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh you mustn t cried Nancy 
7704_106969_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 You ll wake him up and then you ll catch it 
7704_106969_000046_000002	train-clean-360	Let him undo himself Teddy shook his head and then stole softly back to the tree Nancy following him at a respectful distance 
7704_106969_000047_000000	train-clean-360	It seemed a harder business to untie the knots than to tie them but at length it was done and the unwinding process began 
none	none	Alas 
7704_106969_000047_000002	train-clean-360	Farmer Green s nap was over and with a hasty start he was roused to the full use of his faculties 
7704_106969_000047_000003	train-clean-360	When he discovered his condition he swore a round oath and turned upon Teddy in great wrath as he vainly tried to extricate himself 
none	none	Please sir said Teddy nothing daunted if you keep still I shall undo you very soon and I won t break your line if I can help it You young scoundrel how dare you show your face after such an audacious piece of impudence 
7704_106969_000049_000001	train-clean-360	You re the plague of the parish and a good thrashing is what you will get sure as my name s Jonathan Green 
none	none	Teddy s face was hot and red and the spectacle of him trying to unwind the line from the struggling and exasperated farmer was so irresistibly comic to Nancy that she burst out laughing Jonathan Green was soon on his feet again and seizing hold of Teddy by the collar shook him like a terrier would shake a rat then without leaving go of him he pulled out a piece of cord from his coat pocket Now I ll teach you a lesson youngster that you won t forget It s lucky I ve got this bit o rope 
7704_106969_000052_000000	train-clean-360	And in another few minutes he had bound the boy securely to the tree tying his hands together with his handkerchief then as Nancy stepped forward indignant at this severe treatment he turned upon her 
7704_106969_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 There are two of you are there 
7704_106969_000053_000001	train-clean-360	Well you shall share the same fate till I think fit to release you 
7704_106969_000053_000002	train-clean-360	I ll teach you to stop playing such impish tricks on decent folk 
none	none	You re the wickedest man that s living I m sure cried Nancy wrathfully
7704_106969_000054_000001	train-clean-360	 Why he was undoing you when you woke up which was very kind of him 
7704_106969_000054_000002	train-clean-360	I wish he d left you tied up I do 
none	none	But Farmer Green with a grim smile of satisfaction soon settled her in the same fashion as he had done the boy and then picking up his fishing basket strode away calling out Ye ll bide there my time ye young limbs of mischief It s only serving like ye serve
7704_106969_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Button boy did he hurt you asked Nancy anxiously for all this time Teddy had not said a word 
7704_106969_000057_000000	train-clean-360	He turned his head and looked at her 
7704_106969_000057_000001	train-clean-360	 I feel shooken up dreadful he s so awful strong but I m not very hurt only I m sorry and I ve been telling my Captain about it and asking Him to forgive me 
7704_106969_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Shall we stay here all the evening and all the night 
7704_106969_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh no he ll come and let us go soon 
7704_106969_000059_000001	train-clean-360	It isn t fair on you for you didn t do anything 
7704_106969_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 I laughed at him and I wanted you to leave him tied up 
7704_106969_000060_000001	train-clean-360	But I don t care it doesn t hurt 
7704_106969_000060_000002	train-clean-360	You haven t told me ever what I asked you about Jesus sailors 
none	none	Tell me now because I want to belong to your Captain and I m not going to be a soldier
7704_106969_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 I did ask mother and she said sailors were soldiers they were sea soldiers 
none	none	You ll have to be a soldier I expect
7704_106969_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Sailors fight I know they do 
7704_106969_000062_000001	train-clean-360	Grandfather read me about Nelson the other evening and showed me a picture of sailors cutting the enemy s arms off as they tried to scramble on board ship 
7704_106969_000062_000002	train-clean-360	I shan t never change to soldiers 
none	none	Sailors are much nicer 
7704_106969_000062_000004	train-clean-360	And if sailors fight I can be a sailor for Jesus 
7704_106969_000063_000000	train-clean-360	Their conversation was interrupted by voices and steps approaching and in another moment two ladies and a gentleman appeared evidently going home after a fishing excursion 
none	none	The path led past the tree and they stopped in astonishment at the sight of the two children 
7704_106969_000064_000000	train-clean-360	Teddy was the first to speak 
7704_106969_000064_000001	train-clean-360	He recognised the newcomers to be the squire Colonel Graham and his wife with a visitor staying with them Please sir will you undo us he asked appealingly 
7704_106969_000065_000000	train-clean-360	The colonel laughed heartily 
none	none	Ah young fellow you re caught are you Lady Helen this is one of the young hopefuls in our village I have been told the ringleader in every bit of mischief set going 
7704_106969_000065_000002	train-clean-360	You wouldn t think it to look at him would you 
none	none	What an angel s face said that lady admiringly
7704_106969_000066_000001	train-clean-360	 And who is the little girl 
7704_106969_000066_000002	train-clean-360	she looks a regular little gipsy 
7704_106969_000067_000000	train-clean-360	Neither of the children appreciated these remarks but the colonel good naturedly put down his fishing basket and cut the piece of rope that bound them 
none	none	Now then youngster he said speak up and tell us who bound you in this fashion and what have you been doing to merit such punishment 
7704_106969_000069_000000	train-clean-360	Having got his hands free Teddy stood up bravely and told the story briefly and clearly to the great amusement of his hearers 
7704_106969_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 And he would never have been caught if he hadn t gone back to undo him put in Nancy so he oughtn t to have been punished at all 
7704_106969_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 What made you go back my boy asked missus Graham gently 
none	none	The colour rose in Teddy s cheeks but he never hesitated to speak the truth
7704_106969_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 I went back when I remembered it was wrong to have done it he said simply 
7704_106969_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 But you are not such a paragon of goodness generally said the colonel 
7704_106969_000074_000001	train-clean-360	 Wasn t it you and some others who scared our dairymaid into fits one night last winter by playing pranks after dark outside the dairy window 
7704_106969_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes sir said Teddy humbly 
7704_106969_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 And why didn t you run away when the old man woke asked Lady Helen 
7704_106969_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 I never run away from anybody said Teddy his head more erect than ever 
none	none	I m a soldier s son Capital my boy and so your father is a soldier 
7704_106969_000078_000001	train-clean-360	What regiment 
7704_106969_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 He s dead sir 
7704_106969_000079_000001	train-clean-360	May I tell you father s story 
none	none	Oh ah 
7704_106969_000080_000001	train-clean-360	I remember now though I m not sure that I recollect the details said the colonel musingly 
7704_106969_000080_000002	train-clean-360	 Your father was John Platt who enlisted in one of the line regiments the twenty fourth wasn t it 
none	none	Tell us the story by all means Teddy obeyed delightedly not seeing in the interest of his tale how keenly he was being watched by the ladies 
7704_106969_000081_000001	train-clean-360	He told it as he always did with enthusiastic effect and when he offered to show the ladies his button they were charmed with him 
none	none	The colonel patted him on his head as he left saying Keep your father s spirit in you my lad and you ll live to do something great yet I should like to have him as a page boy said Lady Helen as they walked away
7704_106969_000081_000003	train-clean-360	 What a sensitive refined little face it is 
7704_106969_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 Too good to be spoilt by house service said Colonel Graham His mother is a superior young woman with a very good education and the Platts are highly respected about here 
7704_106969_000083_000000	train-clean-360	The children ran back to their playfellows considerably sobered by their experience and Teddy very soon made his way home and told his mother all that had befallen him 
7704_106969_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 It s dreadful difficult to remember in time mother 
7704_106969_000084_000001	train-clean-360	I m not a very good soldier am I Do you think I ought to love old Farmer Green 
none	none	If you won t tell any one I ve been having a talk with Ipse he s my enemy mister Upton told me about and he he hates Farmer Green but I tell him the banner is Love and we must try to love him and how can I show him I love him mother
7704_106969_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 I think you must wait a little sonny 
none	none	Don t do anything just yet but try and not have angry thoughts about him 
7704_106969_000085_000002	train-clean-360	You know it was very naughty of you to act so 
none	none	I am not a bit surprised that he lost his temper over it I ll never tie up anybody again mother never CHAPTER VI The Redcoats Mother grandmother some soldiers are coming here Teddy tore into the house one morning after school with this announcement and his face was radiant with delight His mother was laying the cloth for dinner and old missus Platt was busy dishing up some potatoes Who told you asked the latter I saw one a real live soldier a corporal with two gold stripes on his red coat and such white gloves and I went up to him and talked to him Certainly modesty is lacking with you observed missus Platt drily Shyness is said missus John rather quickly but he doesn t show forwardness as a rule Sam and Carrots and lots of the boys were with me mother He told us that he and one or two more had come on to get billets that s the word billets for the regiment that was marching through on their way to Wales and we shall see them come marching through the village in a few days He said most of them were going to put up in the town but twenty were coming to the Hare and Hounds and they re going to sleep there He s such a nice man mother he s only going to sleep here to night and then he s going on to morrow to get some more billets ready in the next town he comes to Couldn t he come to tea this afternoon Do let me ask him granny missus Platt laughed not ill humouredly You would have us take in any scoundrel provided he wore a red coat wouldn t you Soldiers are never scoundrels asserted Teddy with hot indignation Do you know all the soldiers in the British Army then said his grandmother I daresay he wouldn t care to come to tea with strangers sonny put in missus John gently I m sure he would for he doesn t like the Hare and Hounds He said he was a teetotaller Come that sounds good missus Platt remarked Well you can ask him in for your father s sake Not much dinner could Teddy eat that day and his lessons at school had never seemed so irksome to him but they were over at last and he tore off in search of his new friend finding him at length sitting under an old yew tree just outside the churchyard Granny says will you come to tea with us he asked breathlessly as he came up to him The corporal looked up He was a fine looking young man with a frank bright face and he was reading a well worn Bible which he put carefully in his pocket before he rose to his feet That s very kind of your granny he said and I ll come with pleasure I m out of it at the Hare and Hounds Teddy s quick eyes had spied the Bible Do you like the Bible he asked gravely It s my order book the corporal said with a smile and my best friend in the world What s an order book It gives you your daily commands just what you are to do and where you re to go My Captain writes my orders down in His Word for me He s my Captain too said Teddy with glistening eyes You mean Jesus don t you I ve enlisted in His army and I m one of His soldiers Shake hands little brother then we re comrades after all Are all soldiers in Jesus Christ s army asked Teddy as they walked away together The corporal shook his head sadly Hardly any of them in my regiment he said We re nearly seven hundred strong and only six men besides myself as far as I can tell belong to the Lord A year ago I was an awful blackguard myself I drank dreadfully and couldn t give the drink up but that s all a thing of the past Since I have belonged to the Lord He keeps me from it and many other bad habits I ll own I fairly dreaded coming to this bit of duty The sight and smell of the beer is very strong to a man that has been such a slave to it and I must be quartered in public houses the whole way along You ll have to fight like mister Upton told me to won t you said Teddy But if our Captain is with us mister Upton says we shan t be beaten No said the corporal a light coming into his eyes We shall be more than conquerors Then after a pause he said It s very considerate of your granny to ask me to tea I was just wishing that something could be done in this village for the men coming after me like we had last year when we marched through the country for the manoeuvres They gave us a free tea at several of the places we went through and it kept so many from drinking There s a man coming along here who I m terrible anxious about He s been an awful drunkard and is quite an old soldier but last New Year s Day he signed the pledge and he s kept it ever since he s just on the point of being converted I hope We have yarns by the hour together but if he s billeted in the Hare and Hounds or any other public house for that matter I don t know what he ll do There s nothing for them when they come in tired but to sit in the bar or tap room and drink They can t get away from it Teddy s brow was knitted with deep thought I didn t know soldiers drank too much he said I thought they never did anything wrong The corporal smiled It isn t many that is of your opinion he said Most folks put us down as a bad lot That evening remained in his memory for long after the sweet scented garden and the long low kitchen with the happy family party gathered round the table the clumsy efforts of the reticent farmer to make his guest feel at home the short pithy remarks made by missus Platt and the gentle soft voiced young mother with the golden haired boy continually asking quaint questions about a soldier s life all this came back to him with a keen sense of pleasure in after years He was only a young fellow after all and was touched and gratified by the kindness shown to him for it made him think of his own mother in her village home and when he took his leave he could hardly express his thanks Teddy had been allowed to sit up beyond his usual bedtime and as he put his little hand into the big brown one of the young soldier he said Do you mind telling me your name corporal Walter Saxby was the ready response And what s the name of the poor old soldier who signed the pledge on New Year s Day Tim Stokes he s called Bouncer by most of us I shall remember said Teddy then turning to his mother and grandmother after Corporal Saxby had disappeared he said solemnly I may bring Bouncer to tea mayn t I if I find him Corporal told me he hadn t properly enlisted as Jesus soldier but he wants to Do you think mister Upton could get him to enlist while he s here Or could you granny P raps he d do it for you I don t know what that boy will come to said missus Platt later on when Teddy was safe in bed seems to me he has more the making of a minister in him than a soldier I don t hold with children being too religious it s forced and unnatural He ain t too good to live put in Jake slowly no youngster can beat him in play I often wonder missus John said thoughtfully whether he will be a soldier after all he is almost too sensitive to lead the hard rough life so many do I doubt if he could stand it He s not wanting in pluck and manliness missus Platt observed for she always had a good word to say for her little grandson when he was not present I found him this morning careering round the field on that fresh young foal without any saddle or bridle I gave him a sharp scolding for it was kicking up its hind legs like mad but he only looked up in my face and laughed It s my charger granny he says and he smells the battle field that s why he s so excited I m sorry these soldiers are going to fill the place he thinks and talks quite enough of them as it is We shan t have a moment s peace now till they re gone Teddy was up very early the next morning to see his friend go off He had another long conversation with him before wishing him good bye and then with thoughtful face he went to school revolving many plans in his active little brain and making innumerable mistakes in his lessons in consequence At twelve o clock when free at last he made his way to the rectory and asked for mister Upton who greeted him very kindly Any more troubles to tell me No sir but I want to tell you about the soldiers who are coming I have heard about them It will be a grand time for you won t it Please sir could you have a tea party for them mister Upton pushed up his glasses and looked very bewildered A tea party did you say Yes the corporal said a clergyman gave one hundred tea in a schoolroom last year and spoke to them after The corporal said it would keep them from drinking in the public houses He came to tea with us last night but granny won t have a lot of them so I told him I d tell you about it It s rather an undertaking said mister Upton musingly but we might do something for them When are they to be here In two or three days the corporal said I think I might manage it I will go and see Colonel Graham and find out if he will help I knew you would be able to do it said Teddy beaming all over and p raps sir you could tell some of them how to enlist like you did me The corporal said I ought to try to be a recruiting sergeant for my Captain but they wouldn t listen to me I am sure I m going to try to enlist Nancy I haven t tried half hard enough But she says she ll only be a sailor for Jesus not a soldier Can she be that sir mister Upton smiled Yes I think she can Sailors have to keep watch and learn their drill and take orders and fight under their captain just like soldiers And then Teddy went home and electrified his mother by telling her with an air of great importance mister Upton and I are going to give the soldiers a tea party when they come The days passed mister Upton was as good as his word A large tea was provided in the village schoolroom Colonel and missus Graham taking a hearty interest in it and when the soldiers came in one hot dusty afternoon everything was ready for them Teddy and others of the village children crowded round the Hare and Hounds when they arrived and Nancy was foremost of the crowd I don t think much of soldiers she said her nose tilted up in disdain They re very dirty men and covered with dust and they ve no band nor flags flying nor nothing If Teddy was disappointed in the look of his heroes he did not say so but Sam remarked I expect they ve left the band and the flags in the town these are only the lot that they can t put up there Later in the afternoon Teddy made his way to the old elm outside the Hare and Hounds where several of the men were resting on the wooden benches some with pots of beer and round whom some of the admiring villagers had made a little circle He pushed his way in with his accustomed fearlessness Please is mister Tim Stokes here The soldiers laughed and bandied a few jokes on the comrade alluded to What do you want with him youngster I want to speak to him I guess you ll find him under one of the tables in the tap room old Bouncer is pretty dry after a march like we ve had to day There was a roar of laughter at this but Teddy did not understand the joke I mustn t go inside the Hare and Hounds he said I promised mother I never would Will you fetch him out for me And turning to a good natured looking young fellow Teddy put his hand coaxingly on his arm The soldier looked into the boy s fair face with a laugh and then a sigh and rising to his feet said All right little chap I ll fetch him out to you He was gone some time and Teddy improved his opportunity by making friends with those around him it was not long before he had acquainted them with the fact of his being a soldier s son and from that he drifted into telling the story of Father s button There was vociferous applause when he had finished Here youngster said one of the older men holding out his pewter pot to him take a drink like a man you deserve it No thank you the boy said I never drink beer Then as an oldish looking soldier with a heavy moustache already tinged with grey came up to him Teddy turned to him in delight Illustration ARE YOU BOUNCER Are you Bouncer That s what I m called The man s face was an unhappy one and he seemed to be the butt of his comrades for they poured forth such a volley of good natured ridicule on his appearance that Teddy looked from one to the other in complete mystification Will you come and see my home the child asked softly Corporal Saxby told me he thought you would like to come The man s face lightened Ay that I will if it ain t fur off my legs are that stiff and sore I don t want much walking It isn t very far Then as they moved off together Teddy slipped his little hand confidingly into the big one near him and continued Do you know there s going to be a splendid tea for you all in our schoolroom to night have you heard Ay the parson was round an hour ago giving out tickets There s little to be done in a place like this and we re too tired to tramp into the town so I expect there ll be a tidy few The corporal came to tea at our house the other night He s a friend of yours isn t he The best friend I ve got was the hearty answer Ay lad there s few of his sort in the Army for one that tries to help us on a bit there s ten that tries to drag us down I suppose said Teddy dreamily that after all the Queen s army isn t so nice to be in as the army I belong to Does your captain help you when you re in trouble He helps us to pack drill or C B or cells replied Tim Stokes with grim humour This needed to be explained to Teddy who went on after it was made clear to him Ah my Captain always helps me mister Upton says when I do wicked things and get beaten by the enemy I must call out to my Captain and He will come at once and help me I reckon I ve heard tell of your Captain then for that fellow Saxby is always dinning it into me but I can t come to religion nohow I can t make head or tail of it I tell you youngster I ve been having an awful time lately and I can t keep to it I m certain sure the drink will do for me again I can t keep away from it much longer and this march ll see the end of my teetotal ways I m thinking And won t my Captain help you I m not a hand at prayers and psalm singing I wish you d talk to mister Upton he made me enlist a short time ago and I ve been ever so much happier since I did it They were walking across the field leading to the farm and as they came to the stile the soldier leant heavily on it Turning his face full on the child he said determinedly I m not a goin to talk to any mister Upton or no one about it I d as lief hear you as a parson You mind me of a little brother of mine that died ten years ago Tim he said just afore he went Tim will you meet me in heaven He was the only one I ever loved and I ve lived a dog s life since His eyes were moist with feeling and for a minute Teddy looked at him silently in pitying wonder Then he said Look here Bouncer this is what mister Upton said to me He told me Jesus had died for me and how dared I keep from being His soldier when He loved me so You know that don t you Ay so Saxby tells me but it don t make no difference No more it didn t to me continued the boy eagerly until I went to God and enlisted I did it quite by myself in the wood You do it too Bouncer you give yourself to God as His soldier and He ll take you and keep you I ve been too bad it keeps me wakeful at nights the very thinkin of it But won t God forgive you if you ask Him to Saxby says so but I don t know The fact is a soldier can t be a Christian in the Army I don t believe you want to be one of God s soldiers said Teddy in a disappointed tone you keep making scuses There was silence then Tim Stokes heaved a heavy sigh I won t come no further youngster I ain t in a mind to day to see company but I ll be at the tea to night Oh Bouncer do come and Teddy s eyes filled with tears You promised you would I do want you to see mother and granny But Tim wheeled round and strode off with something like a sob in his throat Teddy had little idea of the mighty conflict in his breast The child s words had awakened many memories and Tim was at that stage now when the powers of good and of evil were contending for his soul He don t believe I want it for I keep making excuses muttered the poor man Ay I do but I haven t got over the longing to be different I d cut off my right hand I do believe if I could be as Saxby is I can t bring myself up to the point that s it Meanwhile poor little Teddy crept indoors with a sad face to announce to his mother the failure of his mission He was nearly here mother just the other side of the hedge outside and yet he turned back CHAPTER VII Uplifted and Cast Down It was a bright cheery gathering a few hours later mister Upton had thrown his whole heart into the scheme and had been round with his tickets to a few outlying inns where more of the men were billeted so that there were altogether over forty redcoats assembled missus John and two other neighbours were in charge of the tea and coffee and Teddy and Nancy with one or two other children as a special favour were allowed to help to wait on the guests The tables were decorated with flowers meat pies cold beef and ham sandwiches disappeared in a marvellous manner and the cakes and bread and butter with watercress were equally appreciated Towards the end of the meal several ladies came forward and sang and one or two part songs were also given by some of the guests staying at the Hall Now said Colonel Graham in his brisk hearty tones before we have a few words from mister Upton I should like to tell you how glad I am to see the redcoats about me once more I know your regiment well for my own the tenth Hussars lay with it in Colchester ten years ago I am sure you have all enjoyed your tea but perhaps you do not know who was the instigator of the whole thing We must thank mister Upton for his untiring zeal and energy in making arrangements we must thank the ladies for trying to make the evening pleasant by their songs but we must thank a little man here I am given to understand for the proposal in the first instance And to Teddy s intense surprise the colonel swung him up on the impromptu platform to receive a deafening round of applause He made a pretty picture as the light fell on his golden curls and sparkling blue eyes his cheeks were flushed with excitement but he bore himself bravely and he held his head erect as he faced the crowded room He will speak to you better than I can the colonel added with a smile for I m a poor speaker myself I m the old soldier here to night and my fighting days are past his are all in the future and he looks forward to wear the red coat with the rest of you I hope he ll bear as brave a part in the Service as his father did before him Now my boy have you anything to say It will turn his head murmured missus John to herself but her mother s heart swelled with pride as his clear voice rang out It wasn t I who thought about the tea it was Corporal Saxby cheers I haven t anything to say unless you d like me to tell you father s story I ve told it once to day but you weren t all there May I sir Certainly was the colonel s amused reply Teddy had never had such an audience before in his life but he was quite equal to the occasion Fingering his button he began in his usual impetuous fashion The very eagerness for his father s deed to be honoured prevented him from any feelings of self consciousness and he carried his audience by storm The ladies were delighted and touched by it and missus John quietly wiped some tears from her eyes And then mister Upton got up His dreamy manner in speaking was absent now and he spoke straightly and forcibly to those in the Queen s service of the battle to be waged with sin Touching on their special difficulties and temptations he told them how absolutely impossible it was for them to be in their own strength a match for the devil with all the powers of evil at his back and how the same Saviour who died for them would keep them and lead them on to certain victory if they would but enlist in His service Nothing could exceed the attention with which he was listened to and the evening ended by their rising to their feet and singing God Save the Queen Then a sergeant rose to propose a vote of thanks cheers were given and all departed greatly pleased with their evening Teddy slipped up to Tim Stokes on going out Shall I see you again he asked I shall be busy to morrow we march out at eight in the morning Oh I shall come and see you off Tim lingered then laying his hand heavily on the boy s fair curls he said God bless you little chap I ve done it Teddy s eyes lit up at once Have you really and truly He nodded My heart s full and I can t speak of it but I was away near the woods there by myself before the tea and it s all right with me I only wonder I didn t do it before I wouldn t yield that s the fact Don t forget to pray for me youngster And he dashed out after his comrades as if ashamed to show his emotion Teddy called his mother to him when in bed that night Mother I will be a soldier I m certain sure I will but I m very glad I can be one of God s soldiers without waiting to grow up And I think I shall be a recruiting sergeant for God now I m sure He wants lots more soldiers doesn t He Indeed He does my boy Now go to sleep you have had a very exciting day But the best of all is said Teddy sleepily that Bouncer has enlisted There was quite a crowd of villagers and children the next morning round the Hare and Hounds The soldiers were drawn up outside waiting for the approach of their regiment from the town to fall in and march on with them Teddy and Nancy were of course there the little girl in spite of her alleged disdain of soldiers was delighted to be in their vicinity Teddy could not get near his friend Bouncer but he received a friendly nod from him in the distance and as for Bouncer s face it was like sunshine itself a marked contrast to the day before As the band was heard approaching cheers were given to the men now leaving and a tall corporal who had much enjoyed his tea the night before stooped to ask of Nancy who was standing close to him What s the name of that curly headed youngster who got us the tea Nancy looked up at him mischievously The button boy That s what I call him and I shan t never call him anything else Then the corporal s voice rang out clear and loud Three cheers for the little button boy which was taken up enthusiastically by the soldiers and Teddy hardly knew whether he was on his head or heels from excitement and delight But he had to pay a penalty for his prominent position From that day the title of the button boy stuck to him and it became his nickname in the village by all who knew him On came the regiment with the colours flying and the band playing in the most orthodox style and Teddy was bitterly disappointed when the warning bell of school prevented him from marching along the road with them The schoolmaster was very lenient with the boys that morning or else they would have been in dire disgrace for lessons were imperfectly learned and said and never had he found it so difficult to keep their attention But if Teddy was inattentive and careless at school he was doubly troublesome at home and for the next few days his mother s fears were realised The excitement of all that had taken place seemed to have quite turned his head for the time He jumped on Kate Brown s back the hired girl when she was carrying two pails of milk to the dairy and the contents of both pails were spilt and wasted he shut up a fighting bantam cock and the stable cat into a barn and left them fighting furiously he locked one of the farm labourers in a hayloft and pulled away the ladder so that he was not released for hours and he proved such an imp of mischief in the house that even his mother meditated handing him over to his uncle to be whipped At last it came to a climax in school He brought a lot of young frogs in a handkerchief put some of them in the master s desk and amused himself at intervals by slipping the others down the backs of the boys seated in front of him His corner was the most unruly one in the room and whilst waiting for another class to come down he began one of his stories in a whisper to a most interested audience I went to see a goblin once that I heard of He lived in a tub on the seashore and he lived by gobbling up schoolmasters and governesses He used to cut their hair off scrape them well like a horse radish and then begin at their toes and gobble them up till he got to their heads their heads he boiled in a saucepan for soup The boys and girls used to bring their masters when they didn t Edward Platt Never had the master s voice sounded so stern The frogs were discovered and his wrath was not appeased by seeing the cluster of heads round Teddy and catching a few words of the delicious story going on Teddy started to his feet Who put these frogs here I did sir The answer was boldly given Come here And amidst the sudden hush that fell on all the boys Teddy walked up to the master s desk with hot cheeks and bent head Edward Platt for the last three days you have been incorrigible I have kept you in and given you extra tasks but neither has had any effect Now I shall have to do what I have never yet done to you Hold out your hand Teddy s head was raised instantly and holding himself erect he bore unflinchingly the three or four sharp strokes with the cane that the master thought fit to give him Now said the master you can go home I will dispense with your attendance for the rest of this morning Teddy walked out without a word he felt the disgrace keenly but it was the means of bringing him to himself and rushing away to a secluded corner in a field he flung himself down on the ground and sobbed as if his heart would break Half an hour after his uncle happening to pass through that field came across him Why Ted what be the matter he inquired as he lifted him to his feet Teddy s tear stained face and quivering lips touched him so that he sat down on a log of wood near and drew him between his knees Are you feeling bad are you hurt was the next question and then Teddy looked up and in a solemn voice asked What does the Queen do when her soldiers are beaten instead of getting a victory I I m sure I doan t know I can t remember the time when we was beaten I reckon she s sorry for them Doesn t she turn them out of her army Why noa What does God do when His soldiers leave off fighting and knock under to their enemy I reckon He s sorry too Dimly Jake Platt began to see the drift of the child s questions Teddy shook his curly head mournfully I m sure He ll have to turn soldiers out of His army if they give up fighting and let the banner drag in the dust and just let the enemy do what they like with them Why I ve done worse than that here he clenched his little fists and raised his voice excitedly I ve gone with the enemy I ve joined Ipse and that s being a deserter and now I shan t never never be able to get back again His uncle looked sorely puzzled Why ain t you at school What have you been a doin Teddy told him all in a despairing tone adding I can t meet mother I ve been caned and and I ve disgraced my button Here his tears burst out afresh Look here said his uncle slowly I won t say but what you ve been a bad boy your mother herself has been in sore trouble about you this last day or two but if we gets a fall in the mud it ain t much good stopping there the only thing is to pick ourselves up agen get ourselves cleaned and then start agen and walk more carefully Can t you do that I m a deserter sobbed the boy my Captain won t have me back I ve disgraced Him I ve disgraced my banner I ve disgraced my button Your Captain will pick you up I m thinkin if you ask Him He ll clean you up fust rate and set you on your legs agen Will He And hope once more began to dawn in the dim blue eyes Of course He will I ain t good at verses and such like but I do remember this one Though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow Won t that one fit you Teddy did not answer He stood looking up wistfully into the blue sky as if unconscious of his uncle s presence and then he sighed I think I d rather be alone Uncle Jake Jake left him without a word and went home to prepare missus John for what had happened She was much distressed but like a sensible woman took the right view of the case He wanted to be pulled up sharp my poor boy is he much hurt The caning was such a minor point of Teddy s grief that Jake confessed to knowing nothing about it missus Platt was inclined to be indignant with the schoolmaster Such a tiny little chap as he is so full of feeling and nerves he hadn t ought to have done it Yet only that morning she herself had almost given him a sound whipping for one of his mad pranks Shortly after Teddy crept in and shutting the door behind him put his back against it Mother granny he said I ve been an awful boy at school this morning and I m in disgrace I ve been caned His tone was tragic then he added slowly But I m very sorry and I m sorry I ve been so naughty at home and I m going to start again because my Captain has forgiven me And then missus John did the wisest thing she could do She asked no questions but got some warm water and took him off to wash his face and hands She saw the red marks across the little hand but refrained from making much of it and then after putting his curly head in order she drew it to her shoulder and putting her arms round him she said My sonny mother is so glad her little son feels his naughtiness She has been praying much for him to day And now tell me all about it CHAPTER VIII In the Clover Field Please missus Platt can I see Teddy I think he is out in the clover field Don t you be romping round with him now for he s taken his Sunday book out and is as quiet as can be It was Nancy who was standing at the farmhouse door one lovely Sunday evening Old missus Platt was the only one at home and she motioned with her hand where her little grandson would be found Nancy discovered him a few minutes later lying full length in the sweet scented clover an open book before him When he raised his face to hers it wore his most angelic look Hulloo what have you come here for he asked To talk to you and without more ado Nancy squatted down beside him What are you doing she went on and what s your Sunday book It s the Pilgrim s Progress I love it don t you I haven t been reading it though for a long time I ve been having a beautiful make up Tell me and Nancy s tone was eager Teddy looked away to the purple hills in the distance and beyond and above them to the soft evening sky with its delicate fleecy clouds flitting by and taking every imaginable form and shape as they did so The dreamy far away look came into his eyes as he said slowly It s a Sunday make believe quite one to myself and I ve never told it to any one I can only tell it to myself out of doors when it s still and quiet and then I feel sometimes it s quite real Do tell me pleaded Nancy coaxingly Well it s getting to heaven after I m got there you know Nancy s eyes grew big with awe Shall I tell you how I begin it She nodded and Teddy turning over on his side brought forth another book a New Testament Turning to an open page he began to read with great emphasis And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great city the holy Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God That s the Bible said Nancy Yes now listen I m lying here in this field it s very very still I hear a little rustle behind I don t look round and then flash comes a beautiful white angel Now he s standing in front of me What s he like He s dressed in white shiny stuff and he has very white feathery wings His face is smiling He has eyes like mother s and hair like Sally White s Flaxen mother says it is put in Nancy Yes he stands quite still Hush hear him Teddy I ve come to fetch you to heaven And then I stand up I listen hard but I don t say anything He says You haven t been altogether a good soldier but the Captain says He wants you Come along Then I get up and sit myself between his wings and put my arms round his neck and he begins to go up I see mother and granny and Uncle Jake and I wave my hand to them and mother throws a kiss at me and calls out Give my love to father and away we go over our fields and across the high road and over Farmer Green s fields and then we fly right to the top of that mountain over there Do let me come too said Nancy I want to be on the angel s back with you P raps you can follow behind on another angel I want mine all to myself We get up to the top of the mountain then I stand down on the ground And me too put in Nancy You mustn t keep stopping me I can t feel it if you do I stand there and I think at first I can t see nothing but a lot of little soft clouds one above the other just like those over there but the angel says Put your foot on one of them and then on the next one they re the steps to heaven Oh gasped Nancy following it with keen reality you ll tumble I don t it s like putting your foot in cotton wool I go up I have to go quite by myself but the angel comes behind to see I don t fall And then he says Look up don t you see the gates And then I look and I see them shining gold gates very big and covered with jewels like missus Graham wears on her fingers I go up and up and then I m there Is that all Why that s just the beginning I m only outside The gates are shut but when they see me coming two more angels come and swing them wide open and I m feeling rather frightened but I walk in There s a long wide street made like the gates and I walk very carefully for fear of slipping down then I see a lot of angels coming along with trumpets and then they go first and begin to play like the soldiers band I march on to a very very very big door and there on the steps leading up stands my Captain Teddy paused I can t tell you what He s like but I feel what He s like myself Such a loving kind face and He puts His hand on my head and says Well done Teddy And then I take hold of His hand and I think I cry Matter of fact Nancy sees with surprise that Teddy s eyes are filling with tears at the thought He went on softly I think He takes me up in His arms then because I m very tired and He carries me into the most beautiful garden you ever saw in your life and He takes me to father who is waiting there Tell me what the garden s like Teddy does not speak he is full of the meeting with his father and Nancy waits a little impatiently The garden is lovely he said at last drawing in a breath of delight at the thought It s always sunny and warm the grass is very soft and green and there s every flower in the world all bunched up together The seats are made of roses and if you want to go to sleep the pillows are made up of violets there s a beautiful river and trees full of apples and oranges and plums and pears the banks are red they re made of strawberries Oh gasped Nancy how lovely There are summer houses and little white boats to row on the river and gold harps hanging up on the trees and then I think I hope there are lots of dogs running about and then you can ride all day on lions and tigers and bears and they won t bite you but lick your hands Go on What else Then we stand up and sing hymns when my Captain comes by and we play on the harps and blow the trumpets as much as ever we like I think my Captain sometimes comes and sits down and talks to us and tells us stories There was silence then Nancy said Is that all That s enough for you said Teddy a little condescendingly I think and make believe a lot more I want to go to heaven Nancy said thoughtfully Then Teddy came back to earth Have you enlisted yet he asked I m not going to be a soldier said Nancy quickly Well you ll never get to heaven if you don t fight for our Captain now He won t let you inside the gates unless you belong to Him Girls can fight just as much as boys Of course they can I can fight as well as you button boy Why don t you fight your enemy then What enemy My enemy is called Ipse He s a dreadful trouble to me You ve got yours the thing inside you that makes you want to do naughty things you ve got to fight it and do the good things instead I ve had two fights with Ipse to day Have you Do tell me You mustn t tell any one then It was in church this morning There was an old woman in front of me and she d untied her bonnet and the ribbons fell over in our pew She went fast asleep in the sermon and nodded her head back till it almost tumbled off her head and Ipse thought if I would put out my hand and just give a tiny weeny pull at the ribbon it would come right off Nancy clapped her hands Why didn t you What fun I wanted to let Ipse have his way dreadful but I remembered I must fight him and I did I asked my Captain to help me and then I put both my hands in my pockets and screwed up my eyes tight But I was glad when she woke up and tied her bonnet on again That was much gooder than I could have been What s the other fight you had Uncle Jake brought some fresh honey from the hives and he put it on a plate in the window in the kitchen He said when he went out of the room Don t touch that Teddy as I was waiting for mother to come to church with me and I went up and looked at it Ipse said to me Just put one finger in it And I had to fight him very hard over that but I ran away out of the room And do you always fight him hard No I often forget till it s too late Mother said I must ask my Captain to make me remember I do ask Him a lot to help me I don t think I like that sort of fighting Nancy I wish you d give yourself to God as His soldier Teddy turned round earnestly as he spoke I think said Nancy slowly I like to be naughty best Then she added with quick change of tone My father is coming home soon and he ll come to see us here Then you ll see what a grand sailor he is He is much grander than your father was My father was an officer said Teddy proudly So s my father he is a first class petty officer and Nancy brought out the words slowly and with much emphasis My father was a non commissioned officer said Teddy determining not to be beaten he was a full sergeant My father gives orders to all the sailors and they have to do what he tells them So did my father and he led the soldiers through a battle My father will fight in twenty battles before he dies and yours only fought in one My father is in heaven and that s the grandest place to be in Coming to this climax was too much for Nancy and the thoughts of that place of which they had been having so much talk subdued their rising ire Teddy said reproachfully after a minute s silence Ipse was nearly getting angry with you then You re such a dreadful girl for making me quarrel with you You won t let me say my father is as good as yours protested Nancy He isn t better Yes don t get angry Nancy let s say they re just the same And with this admission Nancy was for the time pacified Before they parted she looked at her little companion with solemn eyes I won t promise but I ll think about belonging to the Captain I should like to go to heaven It was one day soon after this that Teddy was straying over the fields in his happy careless fashion fond as he was of games with the village boys often there were times when he liked his own society best and he wandered on talking to himself and gathering grass and wild flowers as he went His quick eyes soon noted some sheep making their way through a gap in the hedge and from thence they were going through an open gate into the high road Those are Farmer Green s sheep quoth he to himself I m glad of it horrid old man he is No Ipse be quiet that isn t the way to think of him I ll go and drive them back again And he trotted off with this intention but it is much more difficult to get sheep into their rightful place than out of it and this Teddy found to his cost His face was hot and red his voice hoarse with shouting and then to his consternation Farmer Green appeared on the scene You young vagabond he shouted springing towards him a thick stick in hand leave my sheep alone How dare you come on my premises You re always after some fresh trick or other Teddy stood still till he came up to him then looked up frankly at him Indeed sir I was trying to drive them back through their hole again Look that s where they broke through A likely story Much more probable you made the hole yourself Teddy s blood rushed into his face I never tell a lie he cried and you re a He stopped and hung his head in shame at the word that almost slipped from him Jonathan Green looked curiously at him Now may I ask what the end of that speech was going to be he said grimly Teddy looked up Ipse was going to say you was a liar yourself but I just stopped him in time I shall believe you have a bee in your bonnet as some folks say said the farmer pray if the sheep came out of their proper field what business was that of yours I wanted to be good to you I m sorry I tied you up that day dreadful sorry And I ve got to love you so I thought it would be a good plan to send your sheep back again You ve got to love me repeated the farmer opening his eyes in mock surprise and when did I ask for any of your love young fellow I don t suppose you want me to observed Teddy cheerfully as he saw that the stick instead of being brandished over his head was now safely resting on the ground but I ve got to do it you see because my banner I m holding for my Captain is Love and I must love everybody The farmer did not answer Teddy continued earnestly Do you think you could manage to forgive me and let us shake hands It would make it easier for me to love you if you could There was such honesty of purpose in the blue eyes raised to his such wistful curves to the sensitive little lips that Jonathan Green for the first time felt the thrall of the child s power Come into the house with me he said and I ll see what the missus has to say to you Teddy followed him without the slightest misgiving and he was led into the farmhouse kitchen where missus Green sat knitting over the fire and one of her daughters was laying the cloth for tea Mary Ann here s the scamp of the village come to see you keep him here till I come back I m after some stray sheep and shutting the door with a bang the farmer disappeared Teddy shook hands with the old lady and the young one and then seated himself in the big chair opposite missus Green What have you been doing the latter inquired how is it your mother can t keep you out of mischief I haven t been in mischief really I haven t and poor Teddy felt the truth of the saying Give a dog a bad name and hang him He tried to tell his story and then when that did not seem to be understood he deftly changed the subject What does Farmer Green like best in the world he asked This astonishing question struck missus Green dumb but her daughter Natty laughed Gooseberry pudding she said Now then what s the next question But Teddy was silent and not another word did he say till the farmer came in again This youngster is on the tack of reforming himself Mary Ann said Jonathan sitting down in the chair that Teddy immediately vacated upon his entrance do you believe it I have no faith in boys said missus Green with a shake of her head they re all alike and are always taking you unawares You hear what the missus says you won t get no help from that quarter But I ll give you a chance would you like to stop to tea with us Teddy smiled Thank you sir but mother will expect me home to tea may I go now And do you forgive me for what I did the other day Farmer Green stretched out a hard horny hand and took the boy s small one Here s my hand on t he said with his grim smile I may be a fool for believing you but if you re sorry for the past I won t be the one to rake it up Teddy s upward look was so full of innocence that he received a clap on the shoulder Run along you ve made your peace with me And speeding away Teddy whispered to himself I shall ask mother to make it and I shall pick the gooseberries myself and then he ll know I love him Farmer Green was much bewildered a few days after at receiving a parcel which was left at his house by some boys on their way back from school he was still more puzzled when upon opening it it proved to be a gooseberry pudding in a basin with a piece of paper attached to it and these words in very shaky writing I send you my love Teddy But his daughter was able to enlighten him and they had a hearty laugh over Teddy s mode of confirming the treaty of friendship CHAPTER IX Lost Our little soldier had his ups and downs but on the whole he was making steady progress and his mother was thankful to see his increased thoughtfulness and gentleness He was not less merry and joyous he was still the leader of the village sports but he was learning how to control his mischievous propensities and to restrain his hasty words and actions Nancy was a great trial to him sometimes and yet though the two were ceaselessly involved in arguments and differences they could not keep apart for long Nancy s father arrived and Teddy had the privilege of being invited to tea and of hearing the most wonderful yarns from the big brown bearded man who though outwardly rough in voice and manner had a very soft corner in his heart for his little daughter Teddy listened and admired and satisfied Nancy by his evident appreciation of the sea stories but when he reached home and was asked about his visit he said emphatically Nancy s father is very nice but he s nothing like the picture I ve got of father with his red coat and sash and sword and his voice is so gruff and hoarse and he shouts so loud and I shall never never think sailors are better than soldiers It was after Nancy s father had left her and when the bright summer days were beginning to close that one afternoon Teddy and Nancy were fishing together At least that was their intention but any one seeing them sitting on the low stone bridge over the river with their lines dangling carelessly in the water and their merry laughter and voices ringing out continually would not be surprised if their fishing did not meet with success At last they clambered down and wandered along the tow path and then suddenly Nancy drew Teddy s attention to his button Why it s nearly coming off you ll lose it she cried I told mother it was getting loose yesterday She says she is always sewing it on I think I ll take it right off and put it in my pocket Whatever should I do if I was to lose it He was jerking at it as he spoke and it slipped from his grasp and rolled away on the path It was too great a temptation for Nancy Like lightning she was after it and a moment after stood upright and exultant with the button clenched tightly in her little hand Give it to me at once demanded Teddy quivering all over with excitement Nancy s brown eyes sparkled with mischief Aha little button boy I ve got it at last and I shall take it home and have it sewed on my jacket I shall fight you cried Teddy if you don t give it up at once It isn t yours You would be a thief if you kept it Give it to me this minute Shall I throw it into the river questioned the saucy little maiden Teddy darted forward and then began a tussle He tried to wrench her hands apart and she exerted all her strength to keep them closed Suddenly with a triumphant cry from Teddy as Nancy s fingers were beginning to yield the button was liberated with such force that it flew violently out and splash into the river it went Nancy gave a cry but without a word or sound Teddy plunged in head foremost after it It was done without a thought He was a good swimmer and for a minute Nancy watched him in breathless silence But when his little head rose out of the water he seemed half stupefied and cried out in a weak voice Help I m drowning then sank again Nancy set up a shout then of frantic agony and a carter coming over the bridge fortunately heard her and came to the rescue not a moment too soon He threw off his coat and heavy boots and plunged in just as Teddy s curly head rose for the third and last time It did not take long to bring him to shore but he lay in the carter s arms limp and lifeless and Nancy burst into an agony of tears He s dead he s dead and I ve killed him she cried The carter wasted no time in trying to restore animation to the little frame but all his efforts were unavailing and at last he said I ll put him in my cart and drive as fast as I can to the doctor s It isn t more than a mile off if so be that he s at home You go home and fetch his mother as fast as you can Nancy raced off sobbing as she went and she was in such a state of excitement that when at length she burst open the farmhouse door she seemed to have lost her speech missus John saw her face and started forwards It s Teddy she cried what has happened He s at he s going to the doctor s dead she gasped then fell breathless to the floor Without a word missus John snatched up a shawl and with white set face and lips moving in agonised prayer she flew along the road to the doctor s She was shown into the room where the doctor was hard at work but Teddy lay like a waxen image with the sweetest smile on his lips his fair curls clustering round his brow and only an ugly bump amongst the curls told the reason of his sinking under the water again so suddenly In breathless silence the mother stood and watched Don t give him up doctor she cried as at last the doctor straightened himself and paused looking at the mother sorrowfully He shook his head but set to work again trying artificial respiration and leaving no effort untried to bring back the life that had apparently departed And then there came the moment when his efforts met with success for placing his hand against the little heart he felt a feeble throb He redoubled his efforts the breath began to appear a faint colour tinged the blue lips and at last the heavy eyelids raised and a faint voice said Mother missus John sank on her knees Thank God was all she said and then she fainted Much later in the evening Teddy was placed in his own little bed at home but though alive his condition was most critical and he lay in a heavy stupor from which it seemed impossible to rouse him The doctor said he must have struck his head against a stone when first he dived into the river and this had produced concussion of the brain Nancy had been taken home before he came but the news was brought to her that he was still alive though in great danger and that was a great comfort to her poor little sorrowful soul For many days he lay between life and death The inquiries after him from every one of his schoolfellows the Hall and the different farms and places round told his mother how much her little son had been beloved And when on the following Sunday mister Upton gave out in a faltering voice The prayers of this congregation are desired for Edward Platt who is very dangerously ill there was not a dry eye in the church and one or two audible sobs came from the boys seats in the gallery missus John never left her boy s bedside night and day she was by him and many wondered at her calm peacefulness After the first great shock she had been able to hand over her child into her Father s loving hands and rest content with the result and so she was able in perhaps the most anxious time of her life to look up and say Father not my will but Thine be done The days slowly passed and still no change for the better The doctor came and went with his grave impenetrable face and Teddy was still unconscious Then doubts began to rise in his mother s heart as to whether his reason would ever come back and she stopped the doctor as he was leaving one morning to ask him the question If he lives doctor will he be an idiot my brave bonny boy Oh I would rather have death for him than that And the doctor could only give her the meagre consolation He may recover yet I have seen worse cases than this pull through and be as bright as ever they were And then one afternoon when the setting sun was flooding the room with a golden glory the little head turned on the pillow Mother The sound of that word not uttered since she had seen him in the doctor s house that first terrible day was like the sweetest music in her ear Stooping over him she met the clear conscious gaze of the blue eyes So tired mother Put your hand under my cheek Good night The eyelids closed and the limbs relaxed in healthy sleep The mother sat down and though her arm became stiff and weary not a muscle of it moved The doctor came in just before he woke He has spoken he knew me she said and the doctor nodded and smiled And then a minute after the boy raised his head Where am I mother he asked feebly In bed darling You ve been ill Where s my button He ll do said the doctor contentedly keep him quiet and feed him up And the glad news went round the village that Teddy was getting better It was a bright day for the farm when Teddy was brought down in a blanket and put in the big easy chair by the fire His little face and hands looked very fragile with the blue veins standing out clearly under the transparent white skin but his large eyes shone with light and gladness His mother made him comfortable then left him in his grandmother s charge for a short time Old missus Platt had had her share of suffering during those sad days her heart was wrapped up in the boy and perhaps the greatest trial of all was to stand aloof and perform her daily work downstairs whilst her daughter in law had the sole charge of him She came across to the chair now and kneeling down in front of it said with tears in her eyes as she took his two little hands into hers Granny has sadly missed her pickle all this while And then Teddy put his little arms round her neck and hugged her close crushing her cap in the most reckless fashion as he did so I m getting better every day granny and I love you ever so When missus Platt released herself he went on more soberly I feel very tipsy on my legs I asked mother to let me walk just now but I couldn t manage very well I don t think I shall be able to run fast for a year shall I Oh we ll see you about long before that please God And granny you know about my sorrow The blue eyes looked wistful at the thought Yes laddie but don t think of that now I told mother I didn t want ever to get well when I first talked about it I felt I couldn t live without my button but she told me that was wrong she said it wasn t being a good soldier to wish to die directly trouble came and that if I bore my sorrow well God would be pleased Do you think I m bearing it well granny Yes yes missus Platt said soothingly Look at those lovely flowers and grapes that missus Graham sent to you this morning Wasn t that kind of her I don t never forget it pursued Teddy refusing to have the subject changed but I thought this morning that God could give it to me again and so I m going to ask Him every day till it comes and do you know granny I think He ll give it to me only mother says I must be patient Presently he asked Could I see Nancy one day soon She comes on her way to school every day to ask how you are Poor little maid she s taken on dreadful about your illness and wouldn t eat her food when you were so ill Her mother got quite anxious about her We ll send for her in a day or two if you keep well And two days after Nancy appeared She came up to the big chair very shyly and looked with awe upon Teddy s white wasted face then she cried impulsively Oh button boy will you ever ever forgive me If you had died I should have killed you No you wouldn t said Teddy putting up his face and kissing her I was just as naughty I shouldn t have tried to fight with you I go to the river every day Nancy went on sorrowfully and Farmer Green brought a big net one day and dragged up a lot of stones and old tin pans but the button wasn t there I hope it will be washed ashore one day and so I look along the banks but I haven t seen a sign of it yet I m asking God to give it back to me every day said Teddy with a little decided nod and I think He ll do it You ask Him too Nancy and perhaps He ll do it quicker I ve asked God every day to make you better and I promised Him if He would do it I would be the Captain s soldier Yes I did and I said I would give up being a sailor and be just a soldier like you are Nancy made this statement with great solemnity and Teddy beamed with delight And are you really enlisted I don t quite know but I m trying to be good and I ask Jesus to help me every day Then there was silence Nancy sat down on the rug and took the large tabby cat on her lap Did you think you was going to die she asked presently I didn t think nothing at all till I woke up and saw mother crying over me and then I felt dreadful tired and ill I asked her one day where she would bury me for I was sure I was much too ill to get better and she well she smiled and said God was making me stronger every day I didn t feel I was better a bit Would you like to have died and gone to heaven Yes Teddy answered promptly of course I should Wouldn t you Nancy shook her head I might if I was quite sure the angel would carry me safely all the way without dropping me or leaving me in the clouds before we got there but I think I like to live here best Besides I don t think I m good enough to go to heaven yet I don t think it s being good gets us to heaven Jesus died to let us you know like the hymn says Jesus loves me He who died Heaven s gate to open wide He will wash away my sin Let His little child come in Have you asked Him to forgive you Nancy Nancy nodded Yes when you was so ill I felt I had been so wicked that God was punishing me Here reverting to more earthly topics Nancy held up the cat arrayed in her sailor hat and jacket Look this is Jack Tar Doesn t she make a jolly sailor A gleeful hearty peal of laughter came from Teddy and was heard in the adjoining room by his grandmother with comfort She called missus John Hear that now Why he s getting quite himself again it does him good to have a child to talk to She must come again And this Nancy did and the roses began to come back to Teddy s cheeks and then others of his playfellows were allowed to come and see him Certainly no little invalid could have received greater attention than he did during that time of convalescence Every day small offerings were presented at the door by the village children and very diverse were the gifts Sometimes a bunch of wild flowers sometimes birds eggs marbles boxes of chalk a packet of toffee or barley sugar a currant bun a tin trumpet a whistle a jam tart a penny pistol and so on till his mother declared she would have to stop taking them in as they were getting such an accumulation of them And how is my little fellow soldier asked mister Upton as he came in one day for his first visit to the little invalid after being downstairs He ll soon be out of hospital responded Teddy brightly And is he still fighting for his Captain I think sir Ipse has been very good while I ve been ill He has been lying low has he If I mistake not you will have a brush with him yet before long so be on the look out And Teddy found the good rector s words come true Days came when he tried his mother s patience much by his fractiousness and restlessness and he was more often the vanquished than the conqueror Even Nancy one day remonstrated with him You re nasty and cross to day No one pleases you I want to get out I m tired of this old kitchen If you can t get out you can t Being cross won t take you out This logic convinced but did not comfort I expect your Captain won t come near you when you re cross And then Teddy burst out crying I m not a soldier at all I don t know how to stand fire and it s all Ipse and I m too tired to fight him Poor little soldier One above took note of the physical weakness and weariness and in His tenderness pitied and forgave CHAPTER X Found 
7704_106974_000002_000000	train-clean-360	It was winter time and Teddy was back at school full of health and spirits yet through all his boyish mirth the loss of his button was never forgotten 
7704_106974_000002_000001	train-clean-360	Daily he prayed for it to be found and his hope and faith in God never failed him 
7704_106974_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps God will send it to me for a Christmas surprise 
7704_106974_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Perhaps I shall find it in my stocking on Christmas morning he used to say to his mother and she told him to pray on 
none	none	He had come in from school one cold day in the beginning of December and was watching with keen interest the roasting of an apple suspended from a string in front of the fire when there was a sharp knock at the door and the footman from the Hall appeared
7704_106974_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 The master wants you to let the youngster come up with me now and speak to him 
7704_106974_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 What about questioned missus John rather alarmed at this summons and wondering if Teddy had been up to mischief 
7704_106974_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 He won t keep him long Then as excited Teddy began pulling on his great coat he whispered something into his mother s ear which had the effect of completely reassuring her and bringing a pleased smile about her lips 
none	none	Teddy was delighted to go up to the Hall and he trotted along by the side of the tall young footman keeping up a brisk conversation as he went
7704_106974_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall never be a footman he was asserting I couldn t keep my legs so stiff 
7704_106974_000008_000001	train-clean-360	You re always like the soldiers when they stand at Attention 
7704_106974_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Don t you never kick your legs out in the kitchen or have you got stiff knees 
none	none	I can kick out as much as I like responded the young man in rather an offended tone
7704_106974_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t you think it s nicer to be a soldier 
7704_106974_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Wouldn t you like to be one 
7704_106974_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 No their grub is something shocking and they live like cattle 
none	none	Teddy would not allow this and the discussion began to get somewhat heated when their arrival at the house put an end to it
7704_106974_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I say just tell me is the colonel angry asked Teddy as looking into the large brightly lighted hall he suddenly felt his diminutive size 
7704_106974_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Not he 
7704_106974_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Wipe your feet and take your cap off 
7704_106974_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Teddy stepped in upon the soft rugs almost on tiptoe and the colonel himself came out into the hall to meet him 
7704_106974_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 Come in my little man and don t be frightened 
7704_106974_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Teddy held his head erect as he followed the colonel into a bright cheery room where a group of ladies and gentlemen were round the fire enjoying their cup of five o clock tea 
7704_106974_000017_000000	train-clean-360	missus Graham came forward and gave him a kindly greeting 
7704_106974_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 This is our would be soldier said Colonel Graham the button boy as I hear he is called 
7704_106974_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Some of you remember his story told in our schoolroom to the regiment passing through in the summer and we weren t surprised to hear of his narrow escape from death from trying to regain his button 
none	none	But perhaps you ve forgotten all about it youngster 
7704_106974_000018_000003	train-clean-360	A button isn t worth much sorrow after the first pang of its loss is over 
none	none	Teddy s face was a picture the blood rushed up to his forehead his eyes flashed and with clenched hands he said boldly Do you think I could ever forget my father s button sir 
7704_106974_000019_000001	train-clean-360	I d rather have it back than anything else in the world 
none	none	And I m going to get it back too
7704_106974_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 But it s at the bottom of the river isn t it 
7704_106974_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know where it is but God does and I ask Him every day to send it back to me 
7704_106974_000021_000001	train-clean-360	I m quite sure He will and I think it will be this Christmas 
none	none	The ladies exchanged glances
7704_106974_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Fact is stranger than fiction certainly said the colonel 
7704_106974_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 Now my boy come here 
7704_106974_000024_000000	train-clean-360	He was standing on the hearthrug with his back to the fire and putting his hand into his pocket he drew out a small box and placed it in the child s hand 
7704_106974_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Open it and tell me if you recognise the contents 
none	none	Teddy lifted the lid and then a gasp and a cry of ecstasy broke from him
7704_106974_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh my button my own button 
7704_106974_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Oh sir 
7704_106974_000028_000000	train-clean-360	And here the tears welled up in the blue eyes and utterly regardless of the place he was in he flung himself down on the hearthrug and buried his head face foremost in his arms 
7704_106974_000028_000001	train-clean-360	He lay there so still for a moment that missus Graham bent forward to touch him fearing that the excitement might be too much for him but he was only trying to hide his emotion from those looking on 
7704_106974_000028_000002	train-clean-360	In another minute he rose to his feet and with a face perfectly radiant he turned to the colonel It s lovely sir it s lovely 
none	none	The colonel had had it set in a little gold framework with blue ribbon attached making it look as much like a medal as possible and missus Graham now came forward and pinned it to his coat
7704_106974_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Now my boy I don t think you will ever guess how it came into our possession 
7704_106974_000030_000001	train-clean-360	The other day I brought home a few fish and in preparing one of these for table our cook discovered your button inside it I wonder the fish had not come to an untimely end before from such an indigestible meal 
7704_106974_000030_000002	train-clean-360	She told us of it not recognising what a valuable treasure she had brought to light and directly we saw it we knew it was the redoubtable button that has been the means of causing such interest in our neighbourhood 
7704_106974_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Teddy listened eagerly 
7704_106974_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 No wonder no one couldn t find it he said fingering his adornment proudly 
7704_106974_000031_000002	train-clean-360	 It s like the fish that brought Peter some money once 
none	none	Then the colonel turned to one of his friends
7704_106974_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Now major what do you think of this youngster 
7704_106974_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Would you like to take him as a drummer boy into your regiment 
7704_106974_000034_000000	train-clean-360	The major scanned the boy from head to foot then answered emphatically I wouldn t take a boy with a face like that for a good deal 
7704_106974_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Why not asked missus Graham 
7704_106974_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Because it s the ruination of them 
7704_106974_000036_000001	train-clean-360	I shall never forget a pretty boy we had once he was called the cherub and had been a chorister sang divinely 
7704_106974_000036_000002	train-clean-360	He was only four years in the regiment and his case was brought to me before he was discharged 
none	none	He came to us an angel and departed a finished young blackguard He drank stole and lied to any extent and was as well versed in vicious sins as any old toper in the regiment 
7704_106974_000036_000005	train-clean-360	When I see a fresh drummer brought in I wonder how long he will keep his innocence and sometimes wish his friends could see the life he is subjected to 
7704_106974_000036_000006	train-clean-360	I give them a month generally and then away flies their bloom and all their home training 
7704_106974_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 But Major Tracy you are giving us a shocking idea of the morals in the Service said one lady 
7704_106974_000038_000000	train-clean-360	He shrugged his shoulders 
7704_106974_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 I grant you on the whole they are better than they were but the Service is no place for highly strung boys like this one 
7704_106974_000038_000002	train-clean-360	The rougher harder natures get on best 
7704_106974_000038_000003	train-clean-360	When they get older and have sense and strength enough to stick to their principles then let them enlist 
7704_106974_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 But I have always heard said missus Graham that the drummer boys are well looked after now 
7704_106974_000039_000001	train-clean-360	They have a room to themselves and the chaplains have classes for them 
7704_106974_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 That may be 
7704_106974_000040_000001	train-clean-360	I would only ask you to watch a boy as I have from the start and see what kind of a man he grows into after having spent most of his early youth in the Service 
7704_106974_000040_000002	train-clean-360	There are exceptions I know but precious few as far as my experience goes 
7704_106974_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Teddy did not understand this conversation but he gathered from the major s tone that he did not approve of him 
7704_106974_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you think I m too small to be a soldier he asked 
7704_106974_000043_000000	train-clean-360	The major laughed 
7704_106974_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 Don t bother your head about your size he said you ll grow and there s plenty of time before you 
7704_106974_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t want to be a drummer said Teddy earnestly I d rather wait and be a proper soldier a soldier that fights 
7704_106974_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 A capital decision stick to it little chap and you have my hearty approval 
7704_106974_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 You have your father s blood in your veins said the colonel laughing meanwhile I suppose you try your hand on the village boys to content your fighting propensities 
7704_106974_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 No said Teddy a grave look coming into his sunny blue eyes 
none	none	I don t fight with anybody but Ipse now he keeps me always busy Who is Ipse asked missus Graham
7704_106974_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 He s my own enemy mister Upton told me about him 
7704_106974_000049_000001	train-clean-360	You see I belong to God s army 
7704_106974_000049_000002	train-clean-360	He takes very little soldiers 
none	none	I ve been enlisted for months and months and Ipse is just another part of me the bad part 
7704_106974_000050_000000	train-clean-360	There was silence on the little company for a minute then Major Tracy said with a laugh What an original little oddity it is quite a character 
7704_106974_000051_000000	train-clean-360	And then Teddy was dismissed 
7704_106974_000051_000001	train-clean-360	He flew down the avenue home as fast as he could go 
7704_106974_000051_000002	train-clean-360	Snow was falling but he heeded it not and burst into the kitchen a little later in a breathless state of excitement 
7704_106974_000052_000000	train-clean-360	His mother knew already so was prepared for his news but she was not prepared for the handsome adornment now on her boy s coat and his grandmother and uncle were equally pleased and gratified at the colonel s kindness 
none	none	Teddy s prayer of thanksgiving that night touched his mother greatly
7704_106974_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 O God I do thank You 
7704_106974_000054_000001	train-clean-360	I knew You would answer me for You knew how dreadful it was to live without my button and You knew how unhappy my heart was about it though I tried to be brave and not talk about it 
none	none	Please do help me to take great care of it and never let me lose it again 
7704_106974_000055_000000	train-clean-360	The next morning before breakfast Teddy ran off to tell Nancy and to show her the long lost treasure 
7704_106974_000055_000001	train-clean-360	She was quite as delighted as he was but said a few minutes after Button boy do you remember telling me you couldn t live without your button 
none	none	You said you d pine away and die
7704_106974_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I thought I should but as soon as I began to pray about it I knew it was coming back and so I got better 
none	none	Well said Nancy with a sigh I won t ever try to get your button again but if you were to die before me I wonder if you would let me have it then 
7704_106974_000057_000001	train-clean-360	I would take great care of it 
7704_106974_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 I meant it to be buried with me said Teddy considering but I don t mind altering my mind about it and if you promise not to give it to any one else I will let you have it 
none	none	I promise truly vowed Nancy and I told you I wouldn t love you till you gave it to me but I will now because I m trying to be good
7704_106974_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 And we ll always remember that soldiers and sailors are just as good as each other they re quite even 
7704_106974_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes nodded Nancy sailors and soldiers are quite even and my father is just as good as your father was 
none	none	Teddy looked a little bit doubtful at this but wisely refrained from making any objection to the assertion and then they parted Nancy calling out after him
7704_106974_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 And when you die and I get the button I shall wear it as a brooch 
none	none	Mother said Teddy a few days after this as she was paying him her usual good night visit it s a very funny thing but do you know I used to wish for an enemy so much to fight and carry on with and now I ve got one and have Ipse to fight with I m getting rather tired of him 
7704_106974_000064_000001	train-clean-360	Is that wicked 
none	none	I asked mister Upton to day if I couldn t ever get rid of Ipse I mean when I am grown up but he said I never should altogether but that I could keep him well under so that he wouldn t trouble me so 
7704_106974_000064_000003	train-clean-360	He does trouble me a lot now 
7704_106974_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Soldiers must never get tired of fighting sonny and you have your Captain to help you 
7704_106974_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes and I suppose when I get bigger and stronger it will be much easier won t it 
7704_106974_000066_000001	train-clean-360	Mother do you have any fighting 
7704_106974_000066_000002	train-clean-360	Have you got an enemy like me 
7704_106974_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes indeed I have my boy 
7704_106974_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 But you re never beaten are you 
7704_106974_000068_000001	train-clean-360	You never do anything wrong 
none	none	I don t get into mischief and disobey orders perhaps missus John said smiling but I have lots of difficulties and temptations that you know little about sonny and I am afraid I very often get beaten by the enemy 
7704_106974_000070_000000	train-clean-360	Teddy pondered over this 
none	none	When I get to heaven I shan t have to fight with Ipse shall I
7704_106974_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 No darling there will be no fighting with sin there 
none	none	Teddy smiled Perhaps my Captain will think I ve been nearly as brave as father if I fight Ipse hard till I die
7704_106974_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 There is a verse in the Bible that says He that ruleth his spirit is better than he that taketh a city Mother would rather have her little son fight God s battles than be the bravest soldier in the Queen s army 
7704_106974_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 But said Teddy I mean to do both and now mother just before I go to sleep give me father s button to kiss

electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg net This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks EBooks posted prior to November two thousand three with eBook numbers BELOW ten thousand are filed in directories based on their release date If you want to download any of these eBooks directly rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year http www gutenberg net etextsix Or etext five four three two one zero ninety nine ninety eight ninety seven ninety six ninety five ninety four ninety three ninety two ninety two ninety one or ninety EBooks posted since November two thousand three with etext numbers OVER
