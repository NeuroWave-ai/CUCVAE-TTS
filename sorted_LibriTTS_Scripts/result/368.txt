have been spread all over the United States time and care have made them more valuable and now that they have been reset in black and white by their discoverer they are to be laid in the hands of a multitude for their enrichment In the same case with these gems there is a fascinating story of the Master Jeweler s life work which splendidly illustrates the ultimate unit of power by showing what one man can do in one day and what one life is worth to the world As his neighbor and intimate friend in Philadelphia for thirty years I am free to say that Russell H Conwell s tall manly figure stands out in the state of Pennsylvania as its first citizen and The Big Brother of its seven millions of people From the beginning of his career he has been a credible witness in the Court of Public Works to the truth of the strong language of the New Testament Parable where it says If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain Remove hence to yonder place AND IT SHALL REMOVE AND NOTHING SHALL BE IMPOSSIBLE UNTO YOU As a student schoolmaster lawyer preacher organizer thinker and writer lecturer educator diplomat and leader of men he has made his mark on his city and state and the times in which he has lived A man dies but his good work lives His ideas ideals and enthusiasms have inspired tens of thousands of lives A book full of the energetics of a master workman is just what every young man cares for nineteen fifteen ACRES OF DIAMONDS Friends This lecture has been delivered under these circumstances I visit a town or city and try to arrive there early enough to see the postmaster the barber the keeper of the hotel the principal of the schools and the ministers of some of the churches and then go into some of the factories and stores and talk with the people and get into sympathy with the local conditions of that town or city and see what has been their history what opportunities they had and what they had failed to do and every town fails to do something and then go to the lecture and talk to those people about the subjects which applied to their locality Acres of Diamonds the idea has continuously been precisely the same The idea is that in this country of ours every man has the opportunity to make more of himself than he does in his own environment with his own skill with his own energy and with his own friends RUSSELL H CONWELL ACRES OF DIAMONDS one WHEN going down the Tigris and Euphrates rivers many years ago with a party of English travelers I found myself under the direction of an old Arab guide whom we hired up at Bagdad and I have often thought how that guide resembled our barbers in certain mental characteristics He thought that it was not only his duty to guide us down those rivers and do what he was paid for doing but also to entertain us with stories curious and weird ancient and modern strange and familiar Many of them I have forgotten and I am glad I have but there is one I shall never forget The old guide was leading my camel by its halter along the banks of those ancient rivers and he told me story after story until I grew weary of his story telling and ceased to listen I have never been irritated with that guide when he lost his temper as I ceased listening But I remember that he took off his Turkish cap and swung it in a circle to get my attention I could see it through the corner of my eye but I determined not to look straight at him for fear he would tell another story But although I am not a woman I did finally look and as soon as I did he went right into another story Said he I will tell you a story now which I reserve for my particular friends When he emphasized the words particular friends I listened and I have ever been glad I did I really feel devoutly thankful that there are sixteen seventy four young men who have been carried through college by this lecture who are also glad that I did listen The old guide told me that there once lived not far from the River Indus an ancient Persian by the name of Ali Hafed He said that Ali Hafed owned a very large farm that he had orchards grain fields and gardens that he had money at interest and was a wealthy and contented man He was contented because he was wealthy and wealthy because he was contented One day there visited that old Persian farmer one of these ancient Buddhist priests one of the wise men of the East He sat down by the fire and told the old farmer how this world of ours was made He said that this world was once a mere bank of fog and that the Almighty thrust His finger into this bank of fog and began slowly to move His finger around increasing the speed until at last He whirled this bank of fog into a solid ball of fire Then it went rolling through the universe burning its way through other banks of fog and condensed the moisture without until it fell in floods of rain upon its hot surface and cooled the outward crust Then the internal fires bursting outward through the crust threw up the mountains and hills the valleys the plains and prairies of this wonderful world of ours If this internal molten mass came bursting out and cooled very quickly it became granite less quickly copper less quickly silver less quickly gold and after gold diamonds were made Said the old priest A diamond is a congealed drop of sunlight Now that is literally scientifically true that a diamond is an actual deposit of carbon from the sun The old priest told Ali Hafed that if he had one diamond the size of his thumb he could purchase the county and if he had a mine of diamonds he could place his children upon thrones through the influence of their great wealth Ali Hafed heard all about diamonds how much they were worth and went to his bed that night a poor man He had not lost anything but he was poor because he was discontented and discontented because he feared he was poor He said I want a mine of diamonds and he lay awake all night Early in the morning he sought out the priest I know by experience that a priest is very cross when awakened early in the morning and when he shook that old priest out of his dreams Ali Hafed said to him Will you tell me where I can find diamonds Diamonds What do you want with diamonds Why I wish to be immensely rich Well then go along and find them That is all you have to do go and find them and then you have them But I don t know where to go Well if you will find a river that runs through white sands between high mountains in those white sands you will always find diamonds I don t believe there is any such river Oh yes there are plenty of them All you have to do is to go and find them and then you have them Said Ali Hafed I will go So he sold his farm collected his money left his family in charge of a neighbor and away he went in search of diamonds He began his search very properly to my mind at the Mountains of the Moon Afterward he came around into Palestine then wandered on into Europe and at last when his money was all spent and he was in rags wretchedness and poverty he stood on the shore of that bay at Barcelona in Spain when a great tidal wave came rolling in between the pillars of Hercules and the poor afflicted suffering dying man could not resist the awful temptation to cast himself into that incoming tide and he sank beneath its foaming crest never to rise in this life again When that old guide had told me that awfully sad story he stopped the camel I was riding on and went back to fix the baggage that was coming off another camel and I had an opportunity to muse over his story while he was gone I remember saying to myself Why did he reserve that story for his particular friends There seemed to be no beginning no middle no end nothing to it That was the first story I had ever heard told in my life and would be the first one I ever read in which the hero was killed in the first chapter I had but one chapter of that story and the hero was dead When the guide came back and took up the halter of my camel he went right ahead with the story into the second chapter just as though there had been no break The man who purchased Ali Hafed s farm one day led his camel into the garden to drink and as that camel put its nose into the shallow water of that garden brook Ali Hafed s successor noticed a curious flash of light from the white sands of the stream He pulled out a black stone having an eye of light reflecting all the hues of the rainbow He took the pebble into the house and put it on the mantel which covers the central fires and forgot all about it A few days later this same old priest came in to visit Ali Hafed s successor and the moment he opened that drawing room door he saw that flash of light on the mantel and he rushed up to it and shouted Here is a diamond Has Ali Hafed returned Oh no Ali Hafed has not returned and that is not a diamond That is nothing but a stone we found right out here in our own garden But said the priest I tell you I know a diamond when I see it I know positively that is a diamond Then together they rushed out into that old garden and stirred up the white sands with their fingers and lo there came up other more beautiful and valuable gems than the first Thus said the guide to me and friends it is historically true was discovered the diamond mine of Golconda the most magnificent diamond mine in all the history of mankind excelling the Kimberly itself The Kohinoor and the Orloff of the crown jewels of England and Russia the largest on earth came from that mine When that old Arab guide told me the second chapter of his story he then took off his Turkish cap and swung it around in the air again to get my attention to the moral Those Arab guides have morals to their stories although they are not always moral As he swung his hat he said to me Had Ali Hafed remained at home and dug in his own cellar or underneath his own wheat fields or in his own garden instead of wretchedness starvation and death by suicide in a strange land he would have had acres of diamonds For every acre of that old farm yes every shovelful afterward revealed gems which since have decorated the crowns of monarchs When he had added the moral to his story I saw why he reserved it for his particular friends But I did not tell him I could see it It was that mean old Arab s way of going around a thing like a lawyer to say indirectly what he did not dare say directly that in his private opinion there was a certain young man then traveling down the Tigris River that might better be at home in America I did not tell him I could see that but I told him his story reminded me of one and I told it to him quick and I think I will tell it to you I told him of a man out in California in eighteen forty seven who owned a ranch He heard they had discovered gold in southern California and so with a passion for gold he sold his ranch to Colonel Sutter and away he went never to come back Colonel Sutter put a mill upon a stream that ran through that ranch and one day his little girl brought some wet sand from the raceway into their home and sifted it through her fingers before the fire and in that falling sand a visitor saw the first shining scales of real gold that were ever discovered in California The man who had owned that ranch wanted gold and he could have secured it for the mere taking Indeed thirty eight millions of dollars has been taken out of a very few acres since then About eight years ago I delivered this lecture in a city that stands on that farm and they told me that a one third owner for years and years had been getting one hundred and twenty dollars in gold every fifteen minutes sleeping or waking without taxation You and I would enjoy an income like that if we didn t have to pay an income tax But a better illustration really than that occurred here in our own Pennsylvania If there is anything I enjoy above another on the platform it is to get one of these German audiences in Pennsylvania before me and fire that at them and I enjoy it to night There was a man living in Pennsylvania not unlike some Pennsylvanians you have seen who owned a farm and he did with that farm just what I should do with a farm if I owned one in Pennsylvania he sold it But before he sold it he decided to secure employment collecting coal oil for his cousin who was in the business in Canada where they first discovered oil on this continent They dipped it from the running streams at that early time So this Pennsylvania farmer wrote to his cousin asking for employment You see friends this farmer was not altogether a foolish man No he was not He did not leave his farm until he had something else to do Of all the simpletons the stars shine on I don t know of a worse one than the man who leaves one job before he has gotten another That has especial reference to my profession and has no reference whatever to a man seeking a divorce When he wrote to his cousin for employment his cousin replied I cannot engage you because you know nothing about the oil business Well then the old farmer said I will know and with most commendable zeal characteristic of the students of Temple University he set himself at the study of the whole subject He began away back at the second day of God s creation when this world was covered thick and deep with that rich vegetation which since has turned to the primitive beds of coal He studied the subject until he found that the drainings really of those rich beds of coal furnished the coal oil that was worth pumping and then he found how it came up with the living springs He studied until he knew what it looked like smelled like tasted like and how to refine it Now said he in his letter to his cousin I understand the oil business His cousin answered All right come on So he sold his farm according to the county record for eight hundred thirty three dollars even money no cents He had scarcely gone from that place before the man who purchased the spot went out to arrange for the watering of the cattle He found the previous owner had gone out years before and put a plank across the brook back of the barn edgewise into the surface of the water just a few inches The purpose of that plank at that sharp angle across the brook was to throw over to the other bank a dreadful looking scum through which the cattle would not put their noses But with that plank there to throw it all over to one side the cattle would drink below and thus that man who had gone to Canada had been himself damming back for twenty three years a flood of coal oil which the state geologists of Pennsylvania declared to us ten years later was even then worth a hundred millions of dollars to our state and four years ago our geologist declared the discovery to be worth to our state a thousand millions of dollars The man who owned that territory on which the city of Titusville now stands and those Pleasantville valleys had studied the subject from the second day of God s creation clear down to the present time He studied it until he knew all about it and yet he is said to have sold the whole of it for eight hundred thirty three dollars and again I say no sense But I need another illustration I found it in Massachusetts and I am sorry I did because that is the state I came from This young man in Massachusetts furnishes just another phase of my thought He went to Yale College and studied mines and mining and became such an adept as a mining engineer that he was employed by the authorities of the university to train students who were behind their classes During his senior year he earned fifteen dollars a week for doing that work When he graduated they raised his pay from fifteen dollars to forty five dollars a week and offered him a professorship and as soon as they did he went right home to his mother If they had raised that boy s pay from fifteen dollars to fifteen dollars sixty cents he would have stayed and been proud of the place but when they put it up to forty five dollars at one leap he said Mother I won t work for forty five dollars a week The idea of a man with a brain like mine working for forty five dollars a week Let s go out in California and stake out gold mines and silver mines and be immensely rich Said his mother Now Charlie it is just as well to be happy as it is to be rich Yes said Charlie but it is just as well to be rich and happy too And they were both right about it As he was an only son and she a widow of course he had his way They always do They sold out in Massachusetts and instead of going to California they went to Wisconsin where he went into the employ of the Superior Copper Mining Company at fifteen dollars a week again but with the proviso in his contract that he should have an interest in any mines he should discover for the company I don t believe he ever discovered a mine and if I am looking in the face of any stockholder of that copper company you wish he had discovered something or other I have friends who are not here because they could not afford a ticket who did have stock in that company at the time this young man was employed there This young man went out there and I have not heard a word from him I don t know what became of him and I don t know whether he found any mines or not but I don t believe he ever did But I do know the other end of the line He had scarcely gotten out of the old homestead before the succeeding owner went out to dig potatoes The potatoes were already growing in the ground when he bought the farm and as the old farmer was bringing in a basket of potatoes it hugged very tight between the ends of the stone fence You know in Massachusetts our farms are nearly all stone wall There you are obliged to be very economical of front gateways in order to have some place to put the stone When that basket hugged so tight he set it down on the ground and then dragged on one side and pulled on the other side and as he was dragging that basket through this farmer noticed in the upper and outer corner of that stone wall right next the gate a block of native silver eight inches square That professor of mines mining and mineralogy who knew so much about the subject that he would not work for forty five dollars a week when he sold that homestead in Massachusetts sat right on that silver to make the bargain He was born on that homestead was brought up there and had gone back and forth rubbing the stone with his sleeve until it reflected his countenance and seemed to say Here is a hundred thousand dollars right down here just for the taking But he would not take it It was in a home in Newburyport Massachusetts and there was no silver there all away off well I don t know where and he did not but somewhere else and he was a professor of mineralogy My friends that mistake is very universally made and why should we even smile at him I often wonder what has become of him I do not know at all but I will tell you what I guess as a Yankee I guess that he sits out there by his fireside to night with his friends gathered around him and he is saying to them something like this Do you know that man Conwell who lives in Philadelphia Oh yes I have heard of him Do you know that man Jones that lives in Philadelphia Yes I have heard of him too Then he begins to laugh and shakes his sides and says to his friends Well they have done just the same thing I did precisely and that spoils the whole joke for you and I have done the same thing he did and while we sit here and laugh at him he has a better right to sit out there and laugh at us I know I have made the same mistakes but of course that does not make any difference because we don t expect the same man to preach and practise too As I come here to night and look around this audience I am seeing again what through these fifty years I have continually seen men that are making precisely that same mistake I often wish I could see the younger people and would that the Academy had been filled to night with our high school scholars and our grammar school scholars that I could have them to talk to While I would have preferred such an audience as that because they are most susceptible as they have not grown up into their prejudices as we have they have not gotten into any custom that they cannot break they have not met with any failures as we have and while I could perhaps do such an audience as that more good than I can do grown up people yet I will do the best I can with the material I have I say to you that you have acres of diamonds in Philadelphia right where you now live Oh but you will say you cannot know much about your city if you think there are any acres of diamonds here I was greatly interested in that account in the newspaper of the young man who found that diamond in North Carolina It was one of the purest diamonds that has ever been discovered and it has several predecessors near the same locality I went to a distinguished professor in mineralogy and asked him where he thought those diamonds came from The professor secured the map of the geologic formations of our continent and traced it He said it went either through the underlying carboniferous strata adapted for such production westward through Ohio and the Mississippi or in more probability came eastward through Virginia and up the shore of the Atlantic Ocean It is a fact that the diamonds were there for they have been discovered and sold and that they were carried down there during the drift period from some northern locality Now who can say but some person going down with his drill in Philadelphia will find some trace of a diamond mine yet down here Oh friends you cannot say that you are not over one of the greatest diamond mines in the world for such a diamond as that only comes from the most profitable mines that are found on earth But it serves simply to illustrate my thought which I emphasize by saying if you do not have the actual diamond mines literally you have all that they would be good for to you Because now that the Queen of England has given the greatest compliment ever conferred upon American woman for her attire because she did not appear with any jewels at all at the late reception in England it has almost done away with the use of diamonds anyhow All you would care for would be the few you would wear if you wish to be modest and the rest you would sell for money Now then I say again that the opportunity to get rich to attain unto great wealth is here in Philadelphia now within the reach of almost every man and woman who hears me speak to night and I mean just what I say I have not come to this platform even under these circumstances to recite something to you I have come to tell you what in God s sight I believe to be the truth and if the years of life have been of any value to me in the attainment of common sense I know I am right that the men and women sitting here who found it difficult perhaps to buy a ticket to this lecture or gathering to night have within their reach acres of diamonds opportunities to get largely wealthy There never was a place on earth more adapted than the city of Philadelphia to day and never in the history of the world did a poor man without capital have such an opportunity to get rich quickly and honestly as he has now in our city I say it is the truth and I want you to accept it as such for if you think I have come to simply recite something then I would better not be here I have no time to waste in any such talk but to say the things I believe and unless some of you get richer for what I am saying to night my time is wasted I say that you ought to get rich and it is your duty to get rich How many of my pious brethren say to me Do you a Christian minister spend your time going up and down the country advising young people to get rich to get money Yes of course I do They say Isn t that awful Why don t you preach the gospel instead of preaching about man s making money Because to make money honestly is to preach the gospel That is the reason The men who get rich may be the most honest men you find in the community Oh but says some young man here to night I have been told all my life that if a person has money he is very dishonest and dishonorable and mean and contemptible My friend that is the reason why you have none because you have that idea of people The foundation of your faith is altogether false Let me say here clearly and say it briefly though subject to discussion which I have not time for here ninety eight out of one hundred of the rich men of America are honest That is why they are rich That is why they are trusted with money That is why they carry on great enterprises and find plenty of people to work with them It is because they are honest men Says another young man I hear sometimes of men that get millions of dollars dishonestly Yes of course you do and so do I But they are so rare a thing in fact that the newspapers talk about them all the time as a matter of news until you get the idea that all the other rich men got rich dishonestly My friend you take and drive me if you furnish the auto out into the suburbs of Philadelphia and introduce me to the people who own their homes around this great city those beautiful homes with gardens and flowers those magnificent homes so lovely in their art and I will introduce you to the very best people in character as well as in enterprise in our city and you know I will A man is not really a true man until he owns his own home and they that own their homes are made more honorable and honest and pure and true and economical and careful by owning the home For a man to have money even in large sums is not an inconsistent thing We preach against covetousness and you know we do in the pulpit and oftentimes preach against it so long and use the terms about filthy lucre so extremely that Christians get the idea that when we stand in the pulpit we believe it is wicked for any man to have money until the collection basket goes around and then we almost swear at the people because they don t give more money Oh the inconsistency of such doctrines as that Money is power and you ought to be reasonably ambitious to have it You ought because you can do more good with it than you could without it Money printed your Bible money builds your churches money sends your missionaries and money pays your preachers and you would not have many of them either if you did not pay them I am always willing that my church should raise my salary because the church that pays the largest salary always raises it the easiest You never knew an exception to it in your life The man who gets the largest salary can do the most good with the power that is furnished to him Of course he can if his spirit be right to use it for what it is given to him I say then you ought to have money If you can honestly attain unto riches in Philadelphia it is your Christian and godly duty to do so It is an awful mistake of these pious people to think you must be awfully poor in order to be pious Some men say Don t you sympathize with the poor people Of course I do or else I would not have been lecturing these years I won t give in but what I sympathize with the poor but the number of poor who are to be sympathized with is very small To sympathize with a man whom God has punished for his sins thus to help him when God would still continue a just punishment is to do wrong no doubt about it and we do that more than we help those who are deserving While we should sympathize with God s poor that is those who cannot help themselves let us remember there is not a poor person in the United States who was not made poor by his own shortcomings or by the shortcomings of some one else It is all wrong to be poor anyhow Let us give in to that argument and pass that to one side A gentleman gets up back there and says Don t you think there are some things in this world that are better than money Of course I do but I am talking about money now Of course there are some things higher than money Oh yes I know by the grave that has left me standing alone that there are some things in this world that are higher and sweeter and purer than money Well do I know there are some things higher and grander than gold Love is the grandest thing on God s earth but fortunate the lover who has plenty of money Money is power money is force money will do good as well as harm In the hands of good men and women it could accomplish and it has accomplished good I hate to leave that behind me I heard a man get up in a prayer meeting in our city and thank the Lord he was one of God s poor Well I wonder what his wife thinks about that She earns all the money that comes into that house and he smokes a part of that on the veranda I don t want to see any more of the Lord s poor of that kind and I don t believe the Lord does And yet there are some people who think in order to be pious you must be awfully poor and awfully dirty That does not follow at all While we sympathize with the poor let us not teach a doctrine like that Yet the age is prejudiced against advising a Christian man or as a Jew would say a godly man from attaining unto wealth The prejudice is so universal and the years are far enough back I think for me to safely mention that years ago up at Temple University there was a young man in our theological school who thought he was the only pious student in that department He came into my office one evening and sat down by my desk and said to me mister President I think it is my duty sir to come in and labor with you What has happened now Said he I heard you say at the Academy at the Peirce School commencement that you thought it was an honorable ambition for a young man to desire to have wealth and that you thought it made him temperate made him anxious to have a good name and made him industrious You spoke about man s ambition to have money helping to make him a good man Sir I have come to tell you the Holy Bible says that money is the root of all evil I told him I had never seen it in the Bible and advised him to go out into the chapel and get the Bible and show me the place So out he went for the Bible and soon he stalked into my office with the Bible open with all the bigoted pride of the narrow sectarian or of one who founds his Christianity on some misinterpretation of Scripture He flung the Bible down on my desk and fairly squealed into my ear There it is mister President you can read it for yourself I said to him Well young man you will learn when you get a little older that you cannot trust another denomination to read the Bible for you You belong to another denomination You are taught in the theological school however that emphasis is exegesis Now will you take that Bible and read it yourself and give the proper emphasis to it He took the Bible and proudly read The love of money is the root of all evil Then he had it right and when one does quote aright from that same old Book he quotes the absolute truth I have lived through fifty years of the mightiest battle that old Book has ever fought and I have lived to see its banners flying free for never in the history of this world did the great minds of earth so universally agree that the Bible is true all true as they do at this very hour So I say that when he quoted right of course he quoted the absolute truth The love of money is the root of all evil He who tries to attain unto it too quickly or dishonestly will fall into many snares no doubt about that The love of money What is that It is making an idol of money and idolatry pure and simple everywhere is condemned by the Holy Scriptures and by man s common sense The man that worships the dollar instead of thinking of the purposes for which it ought to be used the man who idolizes simply money the miser that hordes his money in the cellar or hides it in his stocking or refuses to invest it where it will do the world good that man who hugs the dollar until the eagle squeals has in him the root of all evil I think I will leave that behind me now and answer the question of nearly all of you who are asking Is there opportunity to get rich in Philadelphia Well now how simple a thing it is to see where it is and the instant you see where it is it is yours Some old gentleman gets up back there and says mister Conwell have you lived in Philadelphia for thirty one years and don t know that the time has gone by when you can make anything in this city No I don t think it is Yes it is I have tried it What business are you in I kept a store here for twenty years and never made over a thousand dollars in the whole twenty years Well then you can measure the good you have been to this city by what this city has paid you because a man can judge very well what he is worth by what he receives that is in what he is to the world at this time If you have not made over a thousand dollars in twenty years in Philadelphia it would have been better for Philadelphia if they had kicked you out of the city nineteen years and nine months ago A man has no right to keep a store in Philadelphia twenty years and not make at least five hundred thousand dollars even though it be a corner grocery up town You say You cannot make five thousand dollars in a store now Oh my friends if you will just take only four blocks around you and find out what the people want and what you ought to supply and set them down with your pencil and figure up the profits you would make if you did supply them you would very soon see it There is wealth right within the sound of your voice Some one says You don t know anything about business A preacher never knows a thing about business Well then I will have to prove that I am an expert I don t like to do this but I have to do it because my testimony will not be taken if I am not an expert My father kept a country store and if there is any place under the stars where a man gets all sorts of experience in every kind of mercantile transactions it is in the country store I am not proud of my experience but sometimes when my father was away he would leave me in charge of the store though fortunately for him that was not very often But this did occur many times friends A man would come in the store and say to me Do you keep jack knives No we don t keep jack knives and I went off whistling a tune What did I care about that man anyhow Then another farmer would come in and say Do you keep jack knives No we don t keep jack knives Then I went away and whistled another tune Then a third man came right in the same door and said Do you keep jack knives No Why is every one around here asking for jack knives Do you suppose 
5460-18031-0082	train-other-500	we are
none	none	 keeping this store to supply the whole neighborhood with jack knives Do you carry on your store like that in Philadelphia The difficulty was I had not then learned that the foundation of godliness and the foundation principle of success in business are both the same precisely The man who says I cannot carry my religion into business advertises himself either as being an imbecile in business or on the road to bankruptcy or a thief one of the three sure He will fail within a very few years He certainly will if he doesn t carry his religion into business If I had been carrying on my father s store on a Christian plan godly plan I would have had a jack knife for the third man when he called for it Then I would have actually done him a kindness and I would have received a reward myself which it would have been my duty to take There are some over pious Christian people who think if you take any profit on anything you sell that you are an unrighteous man On the contrary you would be a criminal to sell goods for less than they cost You have no right to do that You cannot trust a man with your money who cannot take care of his own You cannot trust a man in your family that is not true to his own wife You cannot trust a man in the world that does not begin with his own heart his own character and his own life It would have been my duty to have furnished a jack knife to the third man or the second and to have sold it to him and actually profited myself I have no more right to sell goods without making a profit on them than I have to overcharge him dishonestly beyond what they are worth But I should so sell each bill of goods that the person to whom I sell shall make as much as I make To live and let live is the principle of the gospel and the principle of every day common sense Oh young man hear me live as you go along Do not wait until you have reached my years before you begin to enjoy anything of this life If I had the millions back or fifty cents of it which I have tried to earn in these years it would not do me anything like the good that it does me now in this almost sacred presence to night Oh yes I am paid over and over a hundredfold to night for dividing as I have tried to do in some measure as I went along through the years I ought not speak that way it sounds egotistic but I am old enough now to be excused for that I should have helped my fellow men which I have tried to do and every one should try to do and get the happiness of it The man who goes home with the sense that he has stolen a dollar that day that he has robbed a man of what was his honest due is not going to sweet rest He arises tired in the morning and goes with an unclean conscience to his work the next day He is not a successful man at all although he may have laid up millions But the man who has gone through life dividing always with his fellow men making and demanding his own rights and his own profits and giving to every other man his rights and profits lives every day and not only that but it is the royal road to great wealth The history of the thousands of millionaires shows that to be the case The man over there who said he could not make anything in a store in Philadelphia has been carrying on his store on the wrong principle Suppose I go into your store to morrow morning and ask Do you know neighbor A who lives one square away at house No twelve forty Oh yes I have met him He deals here at the corner store Where did he come from I don t know How many does he have in his family I don t know What ticket does he vote I don t know What church does he go to I don t know and don t care What are you asking all these questions for If you had a store in Philadelphia would you answer me like that If so then you are conducting your business just as I carried on my father s business in Worthington Massachusetts You don t know where your neighbor came from when he moved to Philadelphia and you don t care If you had cared you would be a rich man now If you had cared enough about him to take an interest in his affairs to find out what he needed you would have been rich But you go through the world saying No opportunity to get rich and there is the fault right at your own door But another young man gets up over there and says I cannot take up the mercantile business While I am talking of trade it applies to every occupation Why can t you go into the mercantile business Because I haven t any capital Oh the weak and dudish creature that can t see over its collar It makes a person weak to see these little dudes standing around the corners and saying Oh if I had plenty of capital how rich I would get Young man do you think you are going to get rich on capital Certainly Well I say Certainly not If your mother has plenty of money and she will set you up in business you will set her up in business supplying you with capital The moment a young man or woman gets more money than he or she has grown to by practical experience that moment he has gotten a curse It is no help to a young man or woman to inherit money It is no help to your children to leave them money but if you leave them education if you leave them Christian and noble character if you leave them a wide circle of friends if you leave them an honorable name it is far better than that they should have money It would be worse for them worse for the nation that they should have any money at all Oh young man if you have inherited money don t regard it as a help It will curse you through your years and deprive you of the very best things of human life There is no class of people to be pitied so much as the inexperienced sons and daughters of the rich of our generation I pity the rich man s son He can never know the best things in life One of the best things in our life is when a young man has earned his own living and when he becomes engaged to some lovely young woman and makes up his mind to have a home of his own Then with that same love comes also that divine inspiration toward better things and he begins to save his money He begins to leave off his bad habits and put money in the bank When he has a few hundred dollars he goes out in the suburbs to look for a home He goes to the savings bank perhaps for half of the value and then goes for his wife and when he takes his bride over the threshold of that door for the first time he says in words of eloquence my voice can never touch I have earned this home myself It is all mine and I divide with thee That is the grandest moment a human heart may ever know But a rich man s son can never know that He takes his bride into a finer mansion it may be but he is obliged to go all the way through it and say to his wife My mother gave me that my mother gave me that and my mother gave me this until his wife wishes she had married his mother I pity the rich man s son The statistics of Massachusetts showed that not one rich man s son out of seventeen ever dies rich I pity the rich man s sons unless they have the good sense of the elder Vanderbilt which sometimes happens He went to his father and said Did you earn all your money I did my son I began to work on a ferry boat for twenty five cents a day Then said his son I will have none of your money and he too tried to get employment on a ferry boat that Saturday night He could not get one there but he did get a place for three dollars a week Of course if a rich man s son will do that he will get the discipline of a poor boy that is worth more than a university education to any man He would then be able to take care of the millions of his father But as a rule the rich men will not let their sons do the very thing that made them great As a rule the rich man will not allow his son to work and his mother Why she would think it was a social disgrace if her poor weak little lily fingered sissy sort of a boy had to earn his living with honest toil I have no pity for such rich men s sons I remember one at Niagara Falls I think I remember one a great deal nearer I think there are gentlemen present who were at a great banquet and I beg pardon of his friends At a banquet here in Philadelphia there sat beside me a kind hearted young man and he said mister Conwell you have been sick for two or three years When you go out take my limousine and it will take you up to your house on Broad Street I thanked him very much and perhaps I ought not to mention the incident in this way but I follow the facts I got on to the seat with the driver of that limousine outside and when we were going up I asked the driver How much did this limousine cost Six thousand eight hundred and he had to pay the duty on it Well I said does the owner of this machine ever drive it himself At that the chauffeur laughed so heartily that he lost control of his machine He was so surprised at the question that he ran up on the sidewalk and around a corner lamp post out into the street again And when he got out into the street he laughed till the whole machine trembled He said He drive this machine Oh he would be lucky if he knew enough to get out when we get there I must tell you about a rich man s son at Niagara Falls I came in from the lecture to the hotel and as I approached the desk of the clerk there stood a millionaire s son from New York He was an indescribable specimen of anthropologic potency He had a skull cap on one side of his head with a gold tassel in the top of it and a gold headed cane under his arm with more in it than in his head It is a very difficult thing to describe that young man He wore an eye glass that he could not see through patent leather boots that he could not walk in and pants that he could not sit down in dressed like a grasshopper This human cricket came up to the clerk s desk just as I entered adjusted his unseeing eye glass and spake in this wise to the clerk You see he thought it was Hinglish you know to lisp Thir will you have the kindness to supply me with thome papah and enwelophs The hotel clerk measured that man quick and he pulled the envelopes and paper out of a drawer threw them across the counter toward the young man and then turned away to his books You should have seen that young man when those envelopes came across that counter He swelled up like a gobbler turkey adjusted his unseeing eye glass and yelled Come right back here Now thir will you order a thervant to take that papah and enwelophs to yondah dethk Oh the poor miserable contemptible American monkey He could not carry paper and envelopes twenty feet I suppose he could not get his arms down to do it I have no pity for such travesties upon human nature If you have not capital young man I am glad of it What you need is common sense not copper cents The best thing I can do is to illustrate by actual facts well known to you all A T Stewart a poor boy in New York had one dollar fifty cents to begin life on He lost eighty seven one two cents of that on the very first venture How fortunate that young man who loses the first time he gambles That boy said I will never gamble again in business and he never did How came he to lose eighty seven one two cents You probably all know the story how he lost it because he bought some needles threads and buttons to sell which people did not want and had them left on his hands a dead loss Said the boy I will not lose any more money in that way Then he went around first to the doors and asked the people what they did want Then when he had found out what they wanted he invested his sixty two one two cents to supply a known demand Study it wherever you choose in business in your profession in your housekeeping whatever your life that one thing is the secret of success You must first know the demand You must first know what people need and then invest yourself where you are most needed A T Stewart went on that principle until he was worth what amounted afterward to forty millions of dollars owning the very store in which mister Wanamaker carries on his great work in New York His fortune was made by his losing something which taught him the great lesson that he must only invest himself or his money in something that people need When will you salesmen learn it When will you manufacturers learn that you must know the changing needs of humanity if you would succeed in life Apply yourselves all you Christian people as manufacturers or merchants or workmen to supply that human need It is a great principle as broad as humanity and as deep as the Scripture itself The best illustration I ever heard was of John Jacob Astor You know that he made the money of the Astor family when he lived in New York He came across the sea in debt for his fare But that poor boy with nothing in his pocket made the fortune of the Astor family on one principle Some young man here to night will say Well they could make those fortunes over in New York but they could not do it in Philadelphia My friends did you ever read that wonderful book of Riis his memory is sweet to us because of his recent death wherein is given his statistical account of the records taken in eighteen eighty nine of one hundred seven millionaires of New York If you read the account you will see that out of the one hundred seven millionaires only seven made their money in New York Out of the one hundred seven millionaires worth ten million dollars in real estate then sixty seven of them made their money in towns of less than three thousand five hundred inhabitants The richest man in this country to day if you read the real estate values has never moved away from a town of three thousand five hundred inhabitants It makes not so much difference where you are as who you are But if you cannot get rich in Philadelphia you certainly cannot do it in New York Now John Jacob Astor illustrated what can be done anywhere He had a mortgage once on a millinery store and they could not sell bonnets enough to pay the interest on his money So he foreclosed that mortgage took possession of the store and went into partnership with the very same people in the same store with the same capital He did not give them a dollar of capital They had to sell goods to get any money Then he left them alone in the store just as they had been before and he went out and sat down on a bench in the park in the shade What was John Jacob Astor doing out there and in partnership with people who had failed on his own hands He had the most important and to my mind the most pleasant part of that partnership on his hands For as John Jacob Astor sat on that bench he was watching the ladies as they went by and where is the man who would not get rich at that business As he sat on the bench if a lady passed him with her shoulders back and head up and looked straight to the front as if she did not care if all the world did gaze on her then he studied her bonnet and by the time it was out of sight he knew the shape of the frame the color of the trimmings and the crinklings in the feather I sometimes try to describe a bonnet but not always I would not try to describe a modern bonnet Where is the man that could describe one This aggregation of all sorts of driftwood stuck on the back of the head or the side of the neck like a rooster with only one tail feather left But in John Jacob Astor s day there was some art about the millinery business and he went to the millinery store and said to them Now put into the show window just such a bonnet as I describe to you because I have already seen a lady who likes such a bonnet Don t make up any more until I come back Then he went out and sat down again and another lady passed him of a different form of different complexion with a different shape and color of bonnet Now said he put such a bonnet as that in the show window He did not fill his show window up town with a lot of hats and bonnets to drive people away and then sit on the back stairs and bawl because people went to Wanamaker s to trade He did not have a hat or a bonnet in that show window but what some lady liked before it was made up The tide of custom began immediately to turn in and that has been the foundation of the greatest store in New York in that line and still exists as one of three stores Its fortune was made by John Jacob Astor after they had failed in business not by giving them any more money but by finding out what the ladies liked for bonnets before they wasted any material in making them up I tell you if a man could foresee the millinery business he could foresee anything under heaven Suppose I were to go through this audience to night and ask you in this great manufacturing city if there are not opportunities to get rich in manufacturing Oh yes some young man says there are opportunities here still if you build with some trust and if you have two or three millions of dollars to begin with as capital Young man the history of the breaking up of the trusts by that attack upon big business is only illustrating what is now the opportunity of the smaller man The time never came in the history of the world when you could get rich so quickly manufacturing without capital as you can now But you will say You cannot do anything of the kind You cannot start without capital Young man let me illustrate for a moment I must do it It is my duty to every young man and woman because we are all going into business very soon on the same plan Young man remember if you know what people need you have gotten more knowledge of a fortune than any amount of capital can give you There was a poor man out of work living in Hingham Massachusetts He lounged around the house until one day his wife told him to get out and work and as he lived in Massachusetts he obeyed his wife He went out and sat down on the shore of the bay and whittled a soaked shingle into a wooden chain His children that evening quarreled over it and he whittled a second one to keep peace While he was whittling the second one a neighbor came in and said Why don t you whittle toys and sell them You could make money at that Oh he said I would not know what to make Why don t you ask your own children right here in your own house what to make What is the use of trying that said the carpenter My children are different from other people s children I used to see people like that when I taught school But he acted upon the hint and the next morning when Mary came down the stairway he asked What do you want for a toy She began to tell him she would like a doll s bed a doll s washstand a doll s carriage a little doll s umbrella and went on with a list of things that would take him a lifetime to supply So consulting his own children in his own house he took the firewood for he had no money to buy lumber and whittled those strong unpainted Hingham toys that were for so many years known all over the world That man began to make those toys for his own children and then made copies and sold them through the boot and shoe store next door He began to make a little money and then a little more and mister Lawson in his Frenzied Finance says that man is the richest man in old Massachusetts and I think it is the truth And that man is worth a hundred millions of dollars to day and has been only thirty four years making it on that one principle that one must judge that what his own children like at home other people s children would like in their homes too to judge the human heart by oneself by one s wife or by one s children It is the royal road to success in manufacturing Oh but you say didn t he have any capital Yes a penknife but I don t know that he had paid for that I spoke thus to an audience in New Britain Connecticut and a lady four seats back went home and tried to take off her collar and the collar button stuck in the buttonhole She threw it out and said I am going to get up something better than that to put on collars Her husband said After what Conwell said to night you see there is a need of an improved collar fastener that is easier to handle There is a human need there is a great fortune Now then get up a collar button and get rich He made fun of her and consequently made fun of me and that is one of the saddest things which comes over me like a deep cloud of midnight sometimes although I have worked so hard for more than half a century yet how little I have ever really done Notwithstanding the greatness and the handsomeness of your compliment to night I do not believe there is one in ten of you that is going to make a million of dollars because you are here to night but it is not my fault it is yours I say that sincerely What is the use of my talking if people never do what I advise them to do When her husband ridiculed her she made up her mind she would make a better collar button and when a woman makes up her mind she will and does not say anything about it she does it It was that New England woman who invented the snap button which you can find anywhere now It was first a collar button with a spring cap attached to the outer side Any of you who wear modern waterproofs know the button that simply pushes together and when you unbutton it you simply pull it apart That is the button to which I refer and which she invented She afterward invented several other buttons and then invested in more and then was taken into partnership with great factories Now that woman goes over the sea every summer in her private steamship yes and takes her husband with her If her husband were to die she would have money enough left now to buy a foreign duke or count or some such title as that at the latest quotations Now what is my lesson in that incident It is this I told her then though I did not know her what I now say to you Your wealth is too near to you You are looking right over it and she had to look over it because it was right under her chin I have read in the newspaper that a woman never invented anything Well that newspaper ought to begin again Of course I do not refer to gossip I refer to machines and if I did I might better include the men That newspaper could never appear if women had not invented something Friends think Ye women think You say you cannot make a fortune because you are in some laundry or running a sewing machine it may be or walking before some loom and yet you can be a millionaire if you will but follow this almost infallible direction When you say a woman doesn t invent anything I ask Who invented the Jacquard loom that wove every stitch you wear missus Jacquard The printer s roller the printing press were invented by farmers wives Who invented the cotton gin of the South that enriched our country so amazingly missus General Greene invented the cotton gin and showed the idea to mister Whitney and he like a man seized it Who was it that invented the sewing machine If I would go to school to morrow and ask your children they would say Elias Howe He was in the Civil War with me and often in my tent and I often heard him say that he worked fourteen years to get up that sewing machine But his wife made up her mind one day that they would starve to death if there wasn t something or other invented pretty soon and so in two hours she invented the sewing machine Of course he took out the patent in his name Men always do that Who was it that invented the mower and the reaper According to mister McCormick s confidential communication so recently published it was a West Virginia woman who after his father and he had failed altogether in making a reaper and gave it up took a lot of shears and nailed them together on the edge of a board with one shaft of each pair loose and then wired them so that when she pulled the wire one way it closed them and when she pulled the wire the other way it opened them and there she had the principle of the mowing machine If you look at a mowing machine you will see it is nothing but a lot of shears If a woman can invent a mowing machine if a woman can invent a Jacquard loom if a woman can invent a cotton gin if a woman can invent a trolley switch as she did and made the trolleys possible if a woman can invent as mister Carnegie said the great iron squeezers that laid the foundation of all the steel millions of the United States we men can invent anything under the stars I say that for the encouragement of the men Who are the great inventors of the world Again this lesson comes before us The great inventor sits next to you or you are the person yourself Oh but you will say I have never invented anything in my life Neither did the great inventors until they discovered one great secret Do you think it is a man with a head like a bushel measure or a man like a stroke of lightning It is neither The really great man is a plain straightforward every day common sense man You would not dream that he was a great inventor if you did not see something he had actually done His neighbors do not regard him so great You never see anything great over your back fence You say there is no greatness among your neighbors It is all away off somewhere else Their greatness is ever so simple so plain so earnest so practical that the neighbors and friends never recognize it 
5460-18031-0000	train-other-500	True greatness is often unrecognized That is sure
none	none	 You do not know anything about the greatest men and women 
5460-18031-0001	train-other-500	I went out to write the life of General Garfield and a neighbor
none	none	 knowing I was in a hurry 
5460-18031-0002	train-other-500	and as there was a great crowd around the front door took me around to General Garfield s back door and shouted Jim Jim And very soon Jim came to the door and let me in and
5460-18031-0003	train-other-500	I wrote the biography of one of the grandest men of the nation and yet he was just the same old Jim to his neighbor If you know a great man in Philadelphia and you should meet him to morrow you would say
5460-18031-0004	train-other-500	How are you Sam or Good morning Jim Of course you would That is just what you would do
none	none	 One of my soldiers in the Civil War had been sentenced to death and I went up to the White House in Washington sent there for the first time in my life to see the President 
5460-18031-0005	train-other-500	I went into the waiting room and sat down with a lot of others on the benches and the secretary asked one after another to tell him what they wanted After the secretary had been through the line he went in and
5460-18031-0006	train-other-500	then came back to the door and motioned for me I went up to that anteroom and the secretary said
none	none	 That is the President s door right over there Just rap on it and go right in 
5460-18031-0007	train-other-500	I never was so taken aback friends in all my life never
none	none	 The secretary himself made it worse for me because he had told me how to go in and then went out another door to the left and shut that 
5460-18031-0008	train-other-500	There I was in the hallway
none	none	 by myself before the President of the United States of America s door I had been on fields of battle where the shells did sometimes shriek and the bullets did sometimes hit me but I always wanted to run I have no sympathy with the old man who says I would just as soon march up to the cannon s mouth as eat my dinner I have no faith in a man who doesn t know enough to be afraid when he is being shot at I never was so afraid when the shells came around us at Antietam as I was when I went into that room that day but I finally mustered the courage I don t know how I ever did and at arm s length tapped on the door The man inside did not help me at all but yelled out Come in and sit down Well I went in and sat down on the edge of a chair and wished I were in Europe and the man at the table did not look up He was one of the world s greatest men and was made great by one single rule Oh that all the young people of Philadelphia were before me now and I could say just this one thing and that they would remember it I would give a lifetime for the effect it would have on our city and on civilization Abraham Lincoln s principle for greatness can be adopted by nearly all This was his rule 
5460-18031-0009	train-other-500	Whatsoever he had to do at all he put his whole mind into it and held it all there until that was all done That makes men great almost anywhere
none	none	 He stuck to those papers at that table 
5460-18031-0010	train-other-500	and did not look up at me and I sat there trembling Finally when he had put the string around his papers he pushed them over to one side
none	none	 and looked over to me and a smile came over his worn face He said I am a very busy man and have only a few minutes to spare Now tell me in the fewest words what it is you want I began to tell him and mentioned the case and he said I have heard all about it and you do not need to say any more mister Stanton was talking to me only a few days ago about that You can go to the hotel and rest assured that the President never did sign an order to shoot a boy under twenty years of age and never will You can say that to his mother anyhow Then he said to me How is it going in the field I said We sometimes get discouraged And he said It is all right We are going to win out now We are getting very near the light No man ought to wish to be President of the United States and I will be glad when I get through 
5460-18031-0011	train-other-500	then Tad and I are going out to Springfield Illinois I have bought a farm out there and
none	none	 I don t care if I again earn only twenty five cents a day Tad has a mule team and we are going to plant onions 
5460-18031-0012	train-other-500	Then he asked me Were you brought up on a farm I said Yes in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts He then threw his leg over the corner of the big chair and said I have heard
5460-18031-0013	train-other-500	many a time ever since I was young that up there in those hills you have to sharpen the noses of
none	none	 the sheep in order to get down to the grass between the rocks 
5460-18031-0014	train-other-500	He was so familiar so
none	none	 everyday 
5460-18031-0015	train-other-500	so farmer like that I felt right at home with him at once He then took hold of another roll of paper and looked up at me and said Good morning I took the hint then and got up and went out
5460-18031-0016	train-other-500	After I had gotten out I could not realize I had seen the President of the United States at all
none	none	 But a few days later when still in the city I saw the crowd pass through the East Room 
5460-18031-0017	train-other-500	by the coffin of Abraham Lincoln and when I looked at the upturned face of the murdered President I felt then
none	none	 that the man I had seen such a short time before who so simple a man so plain a man was one of 
5460-18031-0018	train-other-500	the greatest men that God ever raised up to lead a nation on to ultimate liberty Yet he was only Old Abe to his neighbors
5460-18031-0019	train-other-500	When they had the second funeral I was invited among others and went out to see that same coffin put back in the tomb at Springfield Around the tomb stood Lincoln s old neighbors to whom he was just Old Abe
none	none	 Of course that is all they would say Did you ever see a man who struts around altogether too large to notice an ordinary working mechanic Do you think he is great 
5460-18031-0020	train-other-500	He is nothing but a puffed up balloon held down by his big feet There is no greatness there Who are the great men and women
none	none	 My attention was called the other day to the history of a very little thing that made the fortune of a very poor man It was an awful thing and yet because of that experience he 
5460-18031-0021	train-other-500	not a great inventor or genius
none	none	 invented the pin that now is called 
5460-18031-0022	train-other-500	the safety pin and out of that safety pin made the fortune of one of the great aristocratic families of this nation
5460-18031-0023	train-other-500	A poor man in Massachusetts who had worked in the nail works was injured at thirty eight and he could earn but little money He was employed in the office to rub out the marks on the bills made by pencil memorandums
none	none	 and he used a rubber until his hand grew tired 
5460-18031-0024	train-other-500	He then tied a piece of rubber on the end of a stick and worked it like a plane His little girl came and said Why you have a patent haven t you The father said afterward
5460-18031-0025	train-other-500	My daughter told me when I took that stick and put the rubber on the end that there was a patent and that was the first thought of that
5460-18031-0026	train-other-500	He went to Boston and applied for his patent and every one of you that has a rubber tipped pencil in your pocket is now paying tribute to the millionaire No capital not a penny did he invest in it
5460-18031-0027	train-other-500	All was income all the way up into the millions But let me hasten to one other greater thought Show me the great men and women who live in Philadelphia A gentleman over there will get up and say
5460-18031-0028	train-other-500	We don t have any great men in Philadelphia They don t live here They live away off in Rome or saint Petersburg or London or Manayunk or anywhere else but here in our town
5460-18031-0029	train-other-500	I have come now to the apex of my thought I have come now to the heart of the whole matter and to the center of my struggle Why isn t Philadelphia a greater city in its greater wealth
5460-18031-0030	train-other-500	Why does New York excel Philadelphia People say Because of her harbor Why do many other cities of the United States get ahead of Philadelphia now
5460-18031-0031	train-other-500	There is only one answer and that is because our own people talk down their own city If there ever was a community on earth that has to be forced ahead it is the city of Philadelphia
5460-18031-0032	train-other-500	If we are to have a boulevard talk it down if we are going to have better schools talk them down if you wish to have wise legislation talk it down talk all the proposed improvements down
5460-18031-0033	train-other-500	That is the only great wrong that I can lay at the feet of the magnificent Philadelphia that has been so universally kind to me
none	none	 I say it is time we turn around in our city and begin to talk up the things that are in our city and begin to set them before the world as the people of Chicago 
5460-18031-0034	train-other-500	New York saint Louis and San Francisco do
none	none	 Oh if we only could get that spirit out among our people that we can do things in Philadelphia and do them well Arise ye millions of Philadelphians 
5460-18031-0035	train-other-500	trust in God and man and believe in the great opportunities that are right here not over in New York or Boston but
none	none	 here for business for everything that is worth living for on earth There was never an opportunity 
5460-18031-0036	train-other-500	greater Let us talk up our own city But there are two other young men here to night
none	none	 and that is all I will venture to say because it is too late One over there gets up and says There is going to be a great man in Philadelphia but never was one Oh is that so 
5460-18031-0037	train-other-500	When are you going to be great
none	none	 When I am elected to some political office Young man won t you learn a lesson in the primer of politics that it is a prima facie evidence of littleness to hold office under our form of government Great men get into office sometimes but what this country needs is men that will do what we tell them to do 
5460-18031-0038	train-other-500	This nation where the people rule is governed by the people for the people and so long as it is then the office holder is but
5460-18031-0039	train-other-500	the servant of the people and the Bible says the servant cannot be greater than the master The Bible says He that is sent
none	none	 cannot be greater than Him who sent Him 
5460-18031-0040	train-other-500	The people rule or should rule and if they do we do not need the greater men in office If the great men in America took our offices we would change to an empire in the next ten years
none	none	 I know of a great many young women now that woman s suffrage is coming who say I am going to be President of the United States some day I believe in woman s suffrage and there is no doubt but what it is coming 
5460-18031-0041	train-other-500	and I am getting out of the way anyhow I may want an office by and by myself but
none	none	 if the ambition for an office influences the women in their desire to vote 
5460-18031-0042	train-other-500	I want to say right here what I say to the young men
5460-18031-0043	train-other-500	that if you only get the privilege of casting one vote you don t get anything that is worth while Unless you can control more than one vote you will be unknown and your influence so dissipated as practically not to be felt
none	none	 This country is not run by votes Do you think it is 
5460-18031-0044	train-other-500	It is governed by influence It is governed by the ambitions and the enterprises which control votes
none	none	 The young woman that thinks she is going to vote for the sake of holding an office is making an awful blunder That other young man gets up and says 
5460-18031-0045	train-other-500	There are going to be great men in this country and in Philadelphia
none	none	 Is that so 
5460-18031-0046	train-other-500	When When there comes a great war when we get into difficulty through watchful waiting in Mexico when we
none	none	 get into war with England over some frivolous deed or with 
5460-18031-0047	train-other-500	Japan or China or New Jersey or some distant country Then I will march up to the cannon s mouth I will sweep up among the glistening bayonets
none	none	 I will leap into the arena and tear down the flag and bear it away in triumph 
5460-18031-0048	train-other-500	I will come home with stars on my shoulder and hold every office in the gift of the nation and I will be great No you won t You think you are going to be made great
none	none	 by an office but remember that if you are not great before you get the office you won t be great when you secure it It will only be a burlesque in that shape We had a Peace Jubilee here after the Spanish War Out West they don t believe this because they said Philadelphia would not have heard of any Spanish War until fifty years hence 
5460-18031-0049	train-other-500	Some of you saw the procession go up Broad Street I was away but the family wrote to me that the tally ho coach with Lieutenant Hobson upon it
none	none	 stopped right at the front door and the people shouted 
5460-18031-0050	train-other-500	Hurrah for Hobson and if I had been there I would have yelled too
none	none	 because he deserves much more of his country than he has ever received 
5460-18031-0051	train-other-500	But suppose I go into school and say Who sunk the Merrimac at Santiago and if the boys answer me Hobson they will tell me seven eighths of a lie
5460-18031-0052	train-other-500	There were seven other heroes on that steamer and they by virtue of their position
none	none	 were continually exposed to the Spanish fire 
5460-18031-0053	train-other-500	while Hobson as an officer might reasonably be behind the smoke stack You have gathered in this house your most intelligent people and yet perhaps not one here
5460-18031-0054	train-other-500	can name the other seven men We ought not to so teach history We ought to teach that however humble a man s station may be
none	none	 if he does his full duty in that place he is just as much entitled to the American people s honor as is the king upon his throne 
5460-18031-0055	train-other-500	But we do not so teach We are now teaching everywhere that the generals do all the fighting I remember that after the war I went down to see General Robert E Lee that
5460-18031-0056	train-other-500	magnificent Christian gentleman of whom both North and South are now proud as one of our great Americans The general told me about his servant Rastus who was an enlisted colored soldier
5460-18031-0057	train-other-500	He called him in one day to make fun of him and said Rastus I hear that all the rest of your company are killed and why are you not killed Rastus winked at him and said
none	none	 Cause when there is any fightin goin on I stay back with the generals 
5460-18031-0058	train-other-500	I remember another illustration
none	none	 I would leave it out but for the fact that when you go to the library to read this lecture you will find this has been printed in it 
5460-18031-0059	train-other-500	for twenty five years I shut my eyes shut them close and lo I see the faces of my youth
none	none	 Yes they sometimes say to me 
5460-18031-0060	train-other-500	Your hair is not white you are working night and day without seeming ever to stop you can t be old But when I shut my eyes like any other man of my years
5460-18031-0061	train-other-500	oh then come trooping back the faces of the loved and lost of long ago and I know whatever men may say it is evening time
5460-18031-0062	train-other-500	I shut my eyes now and look back to my native town in Massachusetts and I see the cattle show ground on the mountain top I can see the horse sheds there
none	none	 I can see the Congregational church see the town hall and mountaineers cottages 
5460-18031-0063	train-other-500	see a great assembly of people turning out dressed resplendently and I can see flags flying and handkerchiefs waving and hear bands playing I can see that company of soldiers that had re enlisted marching up on that cattle show ground
5460-18031-0064	train-other-500	I was but a boy but I was captain of that company and puffed out with pride A cambric needle would have burst me all to pieces Then I thought it was the greatest event that ever came to man on earth
5460-18031-0065	train-other-500	If you have ever thought you would like to be a king or queen you go and be received by the mayor
none	none	 The bands played and all the people turned out to receive us I marched up that Common so proud at the head of my troops and we 
5460-18031-0066	train-other-500	turned down into the town hall Then they seated my soldiers down the center aisle and I sat down on the front seat A great assembly of people a hundred or two came in to fill the town hall so that they stood up all around
5460-18031-0067	train-other-500	Then the town officers came in and formed a half circle
none	none	 The mayor of the town sat in the middle of the platform 
5460-18031-0068	train-other-500	He was a man who had never held office before but he was a good man and his friends have told me that I might use this without giving them offense He was a good man but he thought an office made a man great
none	none	 He came up and took his seat 
5460-18031-0069	train-other-500	adjusted his powerful spectacles and looked around when he suddenly spied me sitting there on the front seat He came right forward on the platform and invited me up to sit with the town officers
5460-18031-0070	train-other-500	No town officer ever took any notice of me before I went to war except to advise the teacher to thrash me and now I was invited up on the stand with the town officers Oh my
5460-18031-0071	train-other-500	the town mayor was then the emperor the king of our day and our time
none	none	 As I came up on the platform they gave me a chair about this far I would say from the front 
5460-18031-0072	train-other-500	When I had got seated the chairman of the Selectmen arose and came forward to the table and we all supposed he would introduce the Congregational minister who was the only orator in town and that he would give the oration to the returning soldiers
none	none	 But friends you should have seen the surprise which ran over the audience when they discovered that the old fellow was going to deliver that speech himself 
5460-18031-0073	train-other-500	He had never made a speech in his life but he fell into the same error that hundreds of other men have fallen into It seems so strange that a man won t learn he must speak his piece as a boy
5460-18031-0074	train-other-500	if he in tends to be an orator when he is grown
none	none	 but he seems to think all he has to do is to hold an office to be a great orator So he came up to the front and brought with him a speech which he had learned by heart 
5460-18031-0075	train-other-500	walking up and down the pasture where he had frightened the cattle
none	none	 He brought the manuscript with him and spread it out on the table so as to be sure he might see it 
5460-18031-0076	train-other-500	He adjusted his spectacles and leaned over it for a moment and marched back on that platform and then came forward like this tramp tramp tramp
5460-18031-0077	train-other-500	He must have studied the subject a great deal when you come to think of it because he assumed an elocutionary attitude He rested heavily upon his left heel
none	none	 threw back his shoulders 
5460-18031-0078	train-other-500	slightly advanced the right foot opened the organs of speech and advanced his right foot at an angle of forty five As he stood in that elocutionary attitude friends
none	none	 this is just the way that speech went Some people say to me 
5460-18031-0079	train-other-500	Don t you exaggerate That would be impossible But I am here for the lesson and not for the story and this is the way it went Fellow citizens
none	none	 As soon as he heard his voice his fingers began to go like that his knees began to shake 
5460-18031-0080	train-other-500	and then he trembled all over
none	none	 He choked and swallowed and came around to the table to look at the manuscript 
5460-18031-0081	train-other-500	Then he gathered himself up with clenched fists and came back
none	none	 Fellow citizens we are Fellow citizens we are we are we are we are 
5460-18031-0083	train-other-500	we are we are very happy we are very happy we are very happy
none	none	 We are very happy to welcome back to their native town these soldiers who have fought and bled 
5460-18031-0084	train-other-500	and come back again to their native town We are especially we are especially
none	none	 we are especially 
5460-18031-0085	train-other-500	We are especially pleased to see with us to day this young hero that meant me this young hero who in imagination friends remember he said that if he had not said in imagination
none	none	 I would not be egotistic enough to refer to it at all 
5460-18031-0086	train-other-500	this young hero who in imagination we have seen leading we have seen leading leading We have seen leading his troops on to the deadly breach We have seen his shining
none	none	 we have seen his shining 
5460-18031-0087	train-other-500	his shining his shining sword flashing Flashing in the sunlight as he shouted to his troops Come on Oh dear dear dear how little that good man knew about war
5460-18031-0088	train-other-500	If he had known anything about war at all he ought to have known what any of my
none	none	 G A R comrades here to night will tell you is true that it is next to a crime for an officer of infantry 
5460-18031-0089	train-other-500	ever in time of danger to go ahead of his men
none	none	 I with my shining sword flashing in the sunlight 
5460-18031-0090	train-other-500	shouting to my troops Come on I never did it Do you suppose I would get in front of my men to be shot in front by the enemy and in the back by my own men That is no place for an officer
5460-18031-0091	train-other-500	The place for the officer in actual battle is behind the line
none	none	 How often as a staff officer I rode down the line when our men were suddenly called to the line of battle 
5460-18031-0092	train-other-500	and the Rebel yells were coming out of the woods and shouted Officers to the rear Officers to the rear Then every officer gets behind the line of private soldiers and the higher the officer s rank the farther behind he goes
5460-18031-0093	train-other-500	Not because he is any the less brave but because the laws of war require that And yet he shouted I with my shining sword
5460-18031-0094	train-other-500	In that house there sat the company of my soldiers who had carried that boy across the Carolina rivers that he might not wet his feet Some of them had gone far out to get a pig or a chicken
5460-18031-0095	train-other-500	Some of them had gone to death
none	none	 under the shell swept pines in the mountains of Tennessee 
5460-18031-0096	train-other-500	yet in the good man s speech they were scarcely known He did refer to them but only incidentally The hero of the hour was this boy Did the nation owe him anything No
none	none	 nothing then and nothing now 
5460-18031-0097	train-other-500	Why was he the hero Simply because that man fell into that same human error that this boy was great because he was an officer and these were only private soldiers
5460-18031-0098	train-other-500	Oh I learned the lesson then that I will never forget so long as the tongue of the bell of time continues to swing for me Greatness consists not in the holding of some future office
none	none	 but really consists in doing great deeds with little means and the accomplishment of vast purposes from the private ranks of life 
5460-18031-0099	train-other-500	To be great at all one must be great here now in Philadelphia He who can give to this city better streets and better sidewalks better schools and more colleges
5460-18031-0100	train-other-500	more happiness and more civilization more of God he will be great anywhere
none	none	 Let every man or woman here if you never hear me again remember this that if you wish to be great at all you must begin where you are and what you are in Philadelphia now He that can give to his city any blessing he who can be a good citizen while he lives here he that can make better homes he that can be a blessing whether he works in the shop or sits behind the counter or keeps house whatever be his life he who would be great anywhere must first be great in his own Philadelphia HIS LIFE AND ACHIEVEMENTS By Robert Shackleton I THE STORY OF THE SWORD two I SHALL write of a remarkable man an interesting man a man of power of initiative of will of persistence a man who plans vastly and who realizes his plans a man who not only does things himself but who even more important than that is the constant inspiration of others I shall write of Russell H Conwell As a farmer s boy he was the leader of the boys of the rocky region that was his home as a school teacher he won devotion as a newspaper correspondent he gained fame as a soldier in the Civil War he rose to important rank as a lawyer he developed a large practice as an author he wrote books that reached a mighty total of sales He left the law for the ministry and is the active head of a great church that he raised from nothingness He is the most popular lecturer in the world and yearly speaks to many thousands He is so to speak the discoverer of Acres of Diamonds through which thousands of men and women have achieved success out of failure He is the head of two hospitals one of them founded by himself that have cared for a host of patients both the poor and the rich irrespective of race or creed He is the founder and head of a university that has already had tens of thousands of students His home is in Philadelphia but he is known in every corner of every state in the Union and everywhere he has hosts of friends All of his life he has helped and inspired others Quite by chance and only yesterday literally yesterday and by chance and with no thought at the moment of Conwell although he had been much in my mind for some time past I picked up a thin little book of description by William Dean Howells and turning the pages of a chapter on Lexington old Lexington of the Revolution written so Howells had set down in eighteen eighty two I noticed after he had written of the town itself and of the long past fight there and of the present day aspect that he mentioned the church life of the place and remarked on the striking advances made by the Baptists who had lately as he expressed it been reconstituted out of very perishing fragments and made strong and flourishing under the ministrations of a lay preacher formerly a colonel in the Union army And it was only a few days before I chanced upon this description that doctor Conwell the former colonel and former lay preacher had told me of his experiences in that little old Revolutionary town Howells went on to say that so he was told the colonel s success was principally due to his making the church attractive to young people Howells says no more of him apparently he did not go to hear him and one wonders if he has ever associated that lay preacher of Lexington with the famous Russell H Conwell of these recent years Attractive to young people Yes one can recognize that to day just as it was recognized in Lexington And it may be added that he at the same time attracts older people too In this indeed lies his power He makes his church interesting his sermons interesting his lectures interesting He is himself interesting Because of his being interesting he gains attention The attention gained he inspires Biography is more than dates Dates after all are but mile stones along the road of life And the most important fact of Conwell s life is that he lived to be eighty two working sixteen hours every day for the good of his fellow men He was born on February fifteen eighteen forty three born of poor parents in a low roofed cottage in the eastern Berkshires in Massachusetts I was born in this room he said to me simply as we sat together recently three in front of the old fireplace in the principal room of the little cottage for he has bought back the rocky farm of his father and has retained and restored the little old home I was born in this room It was bedroom and kitchen It was poverty And his voice sank with a kind of grimness into silence Then he spoke a little of the struggles of those long past years and we went out on the porch as the evening shadows fell and looked out over the valley and stream and hills of his youth and he told of his grandmother and of a young Marylander who had come to the region on a visit it was a tale of the impetuous love of those two of rash marriage of the interference of parents of the fierce rivalry of another suitor of an attack on the Marylander s life of passionate hastiness of unforgivable words of separation of lifelong sorrow Why does grandmother cry so often he remembers asking when he was a little boy And he was told that it was for the husband of her youth We went back into the little house and he showed me the room in which he first saw John Brown I came down early one morning and saw a huge hairy man sprawled upon the bed there and I was frightened he says But John Brown did not long frighten him For he was much at their house after that and was so friendly with Russell and his brother that there was no chance for awe and it gives a curious side light on the character of the stern abolitionist that he actually with infinite patience taught the old horse of the Conwells to go home alone with the wagon after leaving the boys at school a mile or more away and at school closing time to trot gently off for them without a driver when merely faced in that direction and told to go Conwell remembers how John Brown in training it used patiently to walk beside the horse and control its going and its turnings until it was quite ready to go and turn entirely by itself The Conwell house was a station on the Underground Railway and Russell Conwell remembers when a lad seeing the escaping slaves that his father had driven across country and temporarily hidden Those were heroic days he says quietly And once in a while my father let me go with him They were wonderful night drives the cowering slaves the darkness of the road the caution and the silence and dread of it all This underground route he remembers was from Philadelphia to New Haven thence to Springfield where Conwell s father would take his charge and onward to Bellows Falls and Canada Conwell tells too of meeting Frederick Douglass the colored orator in that little cottage in the hills I never saw my father Douglass said one day his father was a white man and I remember little of my mother except that once she tried to keep an overseer from whipping me and the lash cut across her own face and her blood fell over me When John Brown was captured Conwell went on my father tried to sell this place to get a little money to send to help his defense But he couldn t sell it and on the day of the execution we knelt solemnly here from eleven to twelve just praying praying in silence for the passing soul of John Brown And as we prayed we knew that others were also praying for a church bell tolled during that entire hour and its awesome boom went sadly sounding over these hills Conwell believes that his real life dates from a happening of the time of the Civil War a happening that still looms vivid and intense before him and which undoubtedly did deepen and strengthen his strong and deep nature Yet the real Conwell was always essentially the same Neighborhood tradition still tells of his bravery as a boy and a youth of his reckless coasting his skill as a swimmer and his saving of lives his strength and endurance his plunging out into the darkness of a wild winter night to save a neighbor s cattle His soldiers came home with tales of his devotion to them and of how he shared his rations and his blankets and bravely risked his life of how he crept off into a swamp at imminent peril to rescue one of his men lost or mired there The present Conwell was always Conwell in fact he may be traced through his ancestry too for in him are the sturdy virtues the bravery the grim determination the practicality of his father and romanticism that comes from his grandmother and the dreamy qualities of his mother who practical and hardworking New England woman that she was was at the same time influenced by an almost startling mysticism And Conwell himself is a dreamer first of all he is a dreamer it is the most important fact in regard to him It is because he is a dreamer and visualizes his dreams that he can plan the great things that to other men would seem impossibilities and then his intensely practical side his intense efficiency his power his skill his patience his fine earnestness his mastery over others develop his dreams into realities He dreams dreams and sees visions but his visions are never visionary and his dreams become facts The rocky hills which meant a dogged struggle for very existence the fugitive slaves John Brown what a school for youth And the literal school was a tiny one room school house where young Conwell came under the care of a teacher who realized the boy s unusual capabilities and was able to give him broad and unusual help Then a wise country preacher also recognized the unusual and urged the parents to give still more education whereupon supreme effort was made and young Russell was sent to Wilbraham Academy He likes to tell of his life there and of the hardships of which he makes light and of the joy with which week end pies and cakes were received from home He tells of how he went out on the roads selling books from house to house and of how eagerly he devoured the contents of the sample books that he carried They were a foundation of learning for me he says soberly And they gave me a broad idea of the world He went to Yale in eighteen sixty but the outbreak of the war interfered with college and he enlisted in eighteen sixty one But he was only eighteen and his father objected and he went back to Yale But next year he again enlisted and men of his Berkshire neighborhood likewise enlisting insisted that he be their captain and Governor Andrews appealed to consented to commission the nineteen year old youth who was so evidently a natural leader and the men gave freely of their scant money to get for him a sword all gay and splendid with gilt and upon the sword was the declaration in stately Latin that True friendship is eternal And with that sword is associated the most vivid the most momentous experience of Russell Conwell s life That sword hangs at the head of Conwell s bed in his home in Philadelphia Man of peace that he is and minister of peace that symbol of war has for over half a century been of infinite importance to him He told me the story as we stood together before that sword And as he told the story speaking with quiet repression but seeing it all and living it all just as vividly as if it had occurred but yesterday That sword has meant so much to me he murmured and then he began the tale A boy up there in the Berkshires a neighbor s son was John Ring I call him a boy for we all called him a boy and we looked upon him as a boy for he was under sized and under developed so much so that he could not enlist But for some reason he was devoted to me and he not only wanted to enlist but he also wanted to be in the artillery company of which I was captain and I could only take him along as my servant I didn t want a servant but it was the only way to take poor little Johnnie Ring Johnnie was deeply religious and would read the Bible every evening before turning in In those days I was an atheist or at least thought I was and I used to laugh at Ring and after a while he took to reading the Bible outside the tent on account of my laughing at him But he did not stop reading it and his faithfulness to me remained unchanged The scabbard of the sword was too glittering for the regulations the ghost of a smile hovered on Conwell s lips and I could not wear it and could only wear a plain one for service and keep this hanging in my tent on the tent pole John Ring used to handle it adoringly and kept it polished to brilliancy It s dull enough these many years he added somberly To Ring it represented not only his captain but the very glory and pomp of war One day the Confederates suddenly stormed our position near New Berne and swept through the camp driving our entire force before them and all including my company retreated hurriedly across the river setting fire to a long wooden bridge as we went over It soon blazed up furiously making a barrier that the Confederates could not pass But unknown to everybody and unnoticed John Ring had dashed back to my tent I think he was able to make his way back because he just looked like a mere boy but however that was he got past the Confederates into my tent and took down from where it was hanging on the tent pole my bright gold scabbarded sword John Ring seized the sword that had long been so precious to him He dodged here and there and actually managed to gain the bridge just as it was beginning to blaze He started across The flames were every moment getting fiercer the smoke denser and now and then as he crawled and staggered on he leaned for a few seconds far over the edge of the bridge in an effort to get air Both sides saw him both sides watched his terrible progress even while firing was fiercely kept up from each side of the river And then a Confederate officer he was one of General Pickett s officers ran to the water s edge and waved a white handkerchief and the firing ceased Tell that boy to come back here he cried Tell him to come back here and we will let him go free He called this out just as Ring was about to enter upon the worst part of the bridge the covered part where there were top and bottom and sides of blazing wood The roar of the flames was so close to Ring that he could not hear the calls from either side of the river and he pushed desperately on and disappeared in the covered part There was dead silence except for the crackling of the fire Not a man cried out All waited in hopeless expectancy And then came a mighty yell from Northerner and Southerner alike for Johnnie came crawling out of the end of the covered way he had actually passed through that frightful place and his clothes were ablaze and he toppled over and fell into shallow water and in a few moments he was dragged out unconscious and hurried to a hospital He lingered for a day or so still unconscious and then came to himself and smiled a little as he found that the sword for which he had given his life had been left beside him He took it in his arms He hugged it to his breast He gave a few words of final message for me And that was all Conwell s voice had gone thrillingly low as he neared the end for it was all so very very vivid to him and his eyes had grown tender and his lips more strong and firm And he fell silent thinking of that long ago happening and though he looked down upon the thronging traffic of Broad Street it was clear that he did not see it and that if the rumbling hubbub of sound meant anything to him it was the rumbling of the guns of the distant past When he spoke again it was with a still tenser tone of feeling When I stood beside the body of John Ring and realized that he had died for love of me I made a vow that has formed my life I vowed that from that moment I would live not only my own life but that I would also live the life of John Ring And from that moment I have worked sixteen hours every day eight for John Ring s work and eight hours for my own A curious note had come into his voice as of one who had run the race and neared the goal fought the good fight and neared the end Every morning when I rise I look at this sword or if I am away from home I think of the sword and vow anew that another day shall see sixteen hours of work from me And when one comes to know Russell Conwell one realizes that never did a man work more hard and constantly It was through John Ring and his giving his life through devotion to me that I became a Christian he went on This did not come about immediately but it came before the war was over and it came through faithful Johnnie Ring There is a little lonely cemetery in the Berkshires a tiny burying ground on a wind swept hill a few miles from Conwell s old home In this isolated burying ground bushes and vines and grass grow in profusion and a few trees cast a gentle shade and tree clad hills go billowing off for miles and miles in wild and lonely beauty And in that lonely little graveyard I found the plain stone that marks the resting place of John Ring II THE BEGINNING AT OLD LEXINGTON IT is not because he is a minister that Russell Conwell is such a force in the world He went into the ministry because he was sincerely and profoundly a Christian and because he felt that as a minister he could do more good in the world than in any other capacity But being a minister is but an incident so to speak The important thing is not that he is a minister but that he is himself Recently I heard a New Yorker the head of a great corporation say I believe that Russell Conwell is doing more good in the world than any man who has lived since Jesus Christ And he said this in serious and unexaggerated earnest Yet Conwell did not get readily into his life work He might have seemed almost a failure until he was well on toward forty for although he kept making successes they were not permanent successes and he did not settle himself into a definite line He restlessly went westward to make his home and then restlessly returned to the East After the war was over he was a lawyer he was a lecturer he was an editor he went around the world as a correspondent he wrote books He kept making money and kept losing it he lost it through fire through investments through aiding his friends It is probable that the unsettledness of the years following the war was due to the unsettling effect of the war itself which thus in its influence broke into his mature life after breaking into his years at Yale But however that may be those seething changing stirring years were years of vital importance to him for in the myriad experiences of that time he was building the foundation of the Conwell that was to come Abroad he met the notables of the earth At home he made hosts of friends and loyal admirers It is worth while noting that as a lawyer he would never take a case either civil or criminal that he considered wrong It was basic with him that he could not and would not fight on what he thought was the wrong side Only when his client was right would he go ahead Yet he laughs his quiet infectious characteristic laugh as he tells of how once he was deceived for he defended a man charged with stealing a watch who was so obviously innocent that he took the case in a blaze of indignation and had the young fellow proudly exonerated The next day the wrongly accused one came to his office and shamefacedly took out the watch that he had been charged with stealing I want you to send it to the man I took it from he said And he told with a sort of shamefaced pride of how he had got a good old deacon to give in all sincerity the evidence that exculpated him And say mister Conwell I want to thank you for getting me off and I hope you ll excuse my deceiving you and I won t be any worse for not going to jail And Conwell likes to remember that thereafter the young man lived up to the pride of exoneration and though Conwell does not say it or think it one knows that it was the Conwell influence that inspired to honesty for always he is an inspirer Conwell even kept certain hours for consultation with those too poor to pay any fee and at one time while still an active lawyer he was guardian for over sixty children The man has always been a marvel and always one is coming upon such romantic facts as these That is a curious thing about him how much there is of romance in his life Worshiped to the end by John Ring left for dead all night at Kenesaw Mountain calmly singing Nearer my God to Thee to quiet the passengers on a supposedly sinking ship saving lives even when a boy never disappointing a single audience of the thousands of audiences he has arranged to address during all his years of lecturing He himself takes a little pride in this last point and it is characteristic of him that he has actually forgotten that just once he did fail to appear he has quite forgotten that one evening on his way to a lecture he stopped a runaway horse to save two women s lives and went in consequence to a hospital instead of to the platform And it is typical of him to forget that sort of thing The emotional temperament of Conwell has always made him responsive to the great the striking the patriotic He was deeply influenced by knowing John Brown and his brief memories of Lincoln are intense though he saw him but three times in all The first time he saw Lincoln was on the night when the future President delivered the address which afterward became so famous in Cooper Union New York The name of Lincoln was then scarcely known and it was by mere chance that young Conwell happened to be in New York on that day But being there and learning that Abraham Lincoln from the West was going to make an address he went to hear him He tells how uncouthly Lincoln was dressed even with one trousers leg higher than the other and of how awkward he was and of how poorly at first he spoke and with what apparent embarrassment The chairman of the meeting got Lincoln a glass of water and Conwell thought that it was from a personal desire to help him and keep him from breaking down But he loves to tell how Lincoln became a changed man as he spoke how he seemed to feel ashamed of his brief embarrassment and pulling himself together and putting aside the written speech which he had prepared spoke freely and powerfully with splendid conviction as only a born orator speaks To Conwell it was a tremendous experience The second time he saw Lincoln was when he went to Washington to plead for the life of one of his men who had been condemned to death for sleeping on post He was still but a captain his promotion to a colonelcy was still to come a youth and was awed by going into the presence of the man he worshiped And his voice trembles a little even now as he tells of how pleasantly Lincoln looked up from his desk and how cheerfully he asked his business with him and of how absorbedly Lincoln then listened to his tale although so it appeared he already knew of the main outline It will be all right said Lincoln when Conwell finished But Conwell was still frightened He feared that in the multiplicity of public matters this mere matter of the life of a mountain boy a private soldier might be forgotten till too late It is almost the time set he faltered And Conwell s voice almost breaks man of emotion that he is as he tells of how Lincoln said with stern gravity Go and telegraph that soldier s mother that Abraham Lincoln never signed a warrant to shoot a boy under twenty and never will That was the one and only time that he spoke with Lincoln and it remains an indelible impression The third time he saw Lincoln was when as officer of the day he stood for hours beside the dead body of the President as it lay in state in Washington In those hours as he stood rigidly as the throng went shuffling sorrowfully through an immense impression came to Colonel Conwell of the work and worth of the man who there lay dead and that impression has never departed John Brown Abraham Lincoln old Revolutionary Lexington how Conwell s life is associated with famous men and places and it was actually at Lexington that he made the crucial decision as to the course of his life And it seems to me that it was although quite unconsciously because of the very fact that it was Lexington that Conwell was influenced to decide and to act as he did Had it been in some other kind of place some merely ordinary place some quite usual place he might not have taken the important step But it was Lexington it was brave old Lexington inspiring Lexington and he was inspired by it for the man who himself inspires nobly is always the one who is himself open to noble inspiration Lexington inspired him When I was a lawyer in Boston and almost thirty seven years old he told me thinking slowly back into the years I was consulted by a woman who asked my advice in regard to disposing of a little church in Lexington whose congregation had become unable to support it I went out and looked at the place and I told her how the property could be sold But it seemed a pity to me that the little church should be given up However I advised a meeting of the church members and I attended the meeting I put the case to them it was only a handful of men and women and there was silence for a little Then an old man rose and in a quavering voice said the matter was quite clear that there evidently was nothing to do but to sell and that he would agree with the others in the necessity but as the church had been his church home from boyhood so he quavered and quivered on he begged that they would excuse him from actually taking part in disposing of it and in a deep silence he went haltingly from the room The men and the women looked at one another still silent sadly impressed but not knowing what to do And I said to them Why not start over again and go on with the church after all Typical Conwellism that First the impulse to help those who need helping then the inspiration and leadership But the building is entirely too tumble down to use said one of the men sadly and I knew he was right for I had examined it but I said Let us meet there to morrow morning and get to work on that building ourselves and put it in shape for a service next Sunday It made them seem so pleased and encouraged and so confident that a new possibility was opening that I never doubted that each one of those present and many friends besides would be at the building in the morning I was there early with a hammer and ax and crowbar that I had secured ready to go to work but no one else showed up He has a rueful appreciation of the humor of it as he pictured the scene and one knows also that in that little town of Lexington where Americans had so bravely faced the impossible Russell Conwell also braced himself to face the impossible A pettier man would instantly have given up the entire matter when those who were most interested failed to respond but one of the strongest features in Conwell s character is his ability to draw even doubters and weaklings into line his ability to stir even those who have given up I looked over that building he goes on whimsically and I saw that repair really seemed out of the question Nothing but a new church would do So I took the ax that I had brought with me and began chopping the place down In a little while a man not one of the church members came along and he watched me for a time and said What are you going to do there And I instantly replied Tear down this old building and build a new church here He looked at me But the people won t do that he said Yes they will I said cheerfully keeping at my work Whereupon he watched me a few minutes longer and said Well you can put me down for one hundred dollars for the new building Come up to my livery stable and get it this evening All right I ll surely be there I replied In a little while another man came along and stopped and looked and he rather gibed at the idea of a new church and when I told him of the livery stable man contributing one hundred dollars he said But you haven t got the money yet No I said but I am going to get it to night You ll never get it he said He s not that sort of a man He s not even a church man But I just went quietly on with the work without answering and after quite a while he left but he called back as he went off Well if he does give you that hundred dollars come to me and I ll give you another hundred Conwell smiles in genial reminiscence and without any apparent sense that he is telling of a great personal triumph and goes on Those two men both paid the money and of course the church people themselves who at first had not quite understood that I could be in earnest joined in and helped with work and money and as while the new church was building it was peculiarly important to get and keep the congregation together and as they had ceased to have a minister of their own I used to run out from Boston and preach for them in a room we hired And it was there in Lexington in eighteen seventy nine that I determined to become a minister I had a good law practice but I determined to give it up For many years I had felt more or less of a call to the ministry and here at length was the definite time to begin Week by week I preached there how strange now to think of William Dean Howells and the colonel preacher and after a while the church was completed and in that very church there in Lexington I was ordained a minister A marvelous thing all this even without considering the marvelous heights that Conwell has since attained a marvelous thing an achievement of positive romance That little church stood for American bravery and initiative and self sacrifice and romanticism in a way that well befitted good old Lexington To leave a large and overflowing law practice and take up the ministry at a salary of six hundred dollars a year seemed to the relatives of Conwell s wife the extreme of foolishness and they did not hesitate so to express themselves Naturally enough they did not have Conwell s vision Yet he himself was fair enough to realize and to admit that there was a good deal of fairness in their objections and so he said to the congregation that although he was quite ready to come for the six hundred dollars a year he expected them to double his salary as soon as he doubled the church membership This seemed to them a good deal like a joke but they answered in perfect earnestness that they would be quite willing to do the doubling as soon as he did the doubling and in less than a year the salary was doubled accordingly I asked him if he had found it hard to give up the lucrative law for a poor ministry and his reply gave a delightful impression of his capacity for humorous insight into human nature for he said with a genial twinkle Oh yes it was a wrench but there is a sort of romance of self sacrifice you know I rather suppose the old time martyrs rather enjoyed themselves in being martyrs Conwell did not stay very long in Lexington A struggling little church in Philadelphia heard of what he was doing and so an old deacon went up to see and hear him and an invitation was given and as the Lexington church seemed to be prosperously on its feet and the needs of the Philadelphia body keenly appealed to Conwell s imagination a change was made and at a salary of eight hundred dollars a year he went in eighteen eighty two to the little struggling Philadelphia congregation and of that congregation he is still pastor only it ceased to be a struggling congregation a great many years ago And long ago it began paying him more thousands every year than at first it gave him hundreds Dreamer as Conwell always is in connection with his immense practicality and moved as he is by the spiritual influences of life it is more than likely that not only did Philadelphia s need appeal but also the fact that Philadelphia as a city meant much to him for coming North wounded from a battle field of the Civil War it was in Philadelphia that he was cared for until his health and strength were recovered Thus it came that Philadelphia had early become dear to him And here is an excellent example of how dreaming great dreams may go hand in hand with winning superb results For that little struggling congregation now owns and occupies a great new church building that seats more people than any other Protestant church in America and doctor Conwell fills it III STORY OF THE FIFTY SEVEN CENTS AT every point in Conwell s life one sees that he wins through his wonderful personal influence on old and young Every step forward every triumph achieved comes not alone from his own enthusiasm but because of his putting that enthusiasm into others And when I learned how it came about that the present church buildings were begun it was another of those marvelous tales of fact that are stranger than any imagination could make them And yet the tale was so simple and sweet and sad and unpretending When doctor Conwell first assumed charge of the little congregation that led him to Philadelphia it was really a little church both in its numbers and in the size of the building that it occupied but it quickly became so popular under his leadership that the church services and Sunday school services were alike so crowded that there was no room for all who came and always there were people turned from the doors One afternoon a little girl who had eagerly wished to go turned back from the Sunday school door crying bitterly because they had told her that there was no more room But a tall black haired man met her and noticed her tears and stopping asked why it was that she was crying and she sobbingly replied that it was because they could not let her into the Sunday school I lifted her to my shoulder says doctor Conwell in telling of this for after hearing the story elsewhere I asked him to tell it to me himself for it seemed almost too strange to be true I lifted her to my shoulder and one realizes the pretty scene it must have made for the little girl to go through the crowd of people drying her tears and riding proudly on the shoulders of the kindly tall dark man I said to her that I would take her in and I did so and I said to her that we should some day have a room big enough for all who should come And when she went home she told her parents I only learned this afterward that she was going to save money to help build the larger church and Sunday school that doctor Conwell wanted Her parents pleasantly humored her in the idea and let her run errands and do little tasks to earn pennies and she began dropping the pennies into her bank She was a lovable little thing but in only a few weeks after that she was taken suddenly ill and died and at the funeral her father told me quietly of how his little girl had been saving money for a building fund And there at the funeral he handed me what she had saved just fifty seven cents in pennies doctor Conwell does not say how deeply he was moved he is after all a man of very few words as to his own emotions But a deep tenderness had crept into his voice At a meeting of the church trustees I told of this gift of fifty seven cents the first gift toward the proposed building fund of the new church that was some time to exist For until then the matter had barely been spoken of as a new church building had been simply a possibility for the future The trustees seemed much impressed and it turned out that they were far more impressed than I could possibly have hoped for in a few days one of them came to me and said that he thought it would be an excellent idea to buy a lot on Broad Street the very lot on which the building now stands It was characteristic of doctor Conwell that he did not point out what every one who knows him would understand that it was his own inspiration put into the trustees which resulted in this quick and definite move on the part of one of them I talked the matter over with the owner of the property and told him of the beginning of the fund the story of the little girl The man was not one of our church nor in fact was he a church goer at all but he listened attentively to the tale of the fifty seven cents and simply said he was quite ready to go ahead and sell us that piece of land for ten thousand dollars taking and the unexpectedness of this deeply touched me taking a first payment of just fifty seven cents and letting the entire balance stand on a five per cent mortgage And it seemed to me that it would be the right thing to accept this unexpectedly liberal proposition and I went over the entire matter on that basis with the trustees and some of the other members and all the people were soon talking of having a new church But it was not done in that way after all for fine though that way would have been there was to be one still finer Not long after my talk with the man who owned the land and his surprisingly good hearted proposition an exchange was arranged for me one evening with a Mount Holly church and my wife went with me We came back late and it was cold and wet and miserable but as we approached our home we saw that it was all lighted from top to bottom and it was clear that it was full of people I said to my wife that they seemed to be having a better time than we had had and we went in curious to know what it was all about And it turned out that our absence had been intentionally arranged and that the church people had gathered at our home to meet us on our return And I was utterly amazed for the spokesman told me that the entire ten thousand dollars had been raised and that the land for the church that I wanted was free of debt And all had come so quickly and directly from that dear little girl s fifty seven cents Doesn t it seem like a fairy tale But then this man has all his life been making fairy tales into realities He inspired the child He inspired the trustees He inspired the owner of the land He inspired the people The building of the great church the Temple Baptist Church as it is termed was a great undertaking for the congregation even though it had been swiftly growing from the day of doctor Conwell s taking charge of it it was something far ahead of what except in the eyes of an enthusiast they could possibly complete and pay for and support Nor was it an easy task Ground was broken for the building in eighteen eighty nine in eighteen ninety one it was opened for worship and then came years of raising money to clear it But it was long ago placed completely out of debt and with only a single large subscription one of ten thousand dollars for the church is not in a wealthy neighborhood nor is the congregation made up of the great and rich The church is built of stone and its interior is a great amphitheater Special attention has been given to fresh air and light there is nothing of the dim religious light that goes with medieval churchliness Behind the pulpit are tiers of seats for the great chorus choir There is a large organ The building is peculiarly adapted for hearing and seeing and if it is not strictly speaking beautiful in itself it is beautiful when it is filled with encircling rows of men and women Man of feeling that he is and one who appreciates the importance of symbols doctor Conwell had a heart of olive wood built into the front of the pulpit for the wood was from an olive tree in the Garden of Gethsemane And the amber colored tiles in the inner walls of the church bear under the glaze the names of thousands of his people for every one young or old who helped in the building even to the giving of a single dollar has his name inscribed there For doctor Conwell wished to show that it is not only the house of the Lord but also in a keenly personal sense the house of those who built it The church has a possible seating capacity of four thousand two hundred although only three thousand one hundred thirty five chairs have been put in it for it has been the desire not to crowd the space needlessly There is also a great room for the Sunday school and extensive rooms for the young men s association the young women s association and for a kitchen for executive offices for meeting places for church officers and boards and committees It is a spacious and practical and complete church home and the people feel at home there You see again said doctor Conwell musingly the advantage of aiming at big things That building represents one hundred nine thousand dollars above ground It is free from debt Had we built a small church it would now be heavily mortgaged IV HIS POWER AS ORATOR AND PREACHER EVEN as a young man Conwell won local fame as an orator At the outbreak of the Civil War he began making patriotic speeches that gained enlistments After going to the front he was sent back home for a time on furlough to make more speeches to draw more recruits 
4379-18034-0000	train-other-500	for his speeches were so persuasive so powerful so full of homely and patriotic feeling that the men who heard them thronged into the ranks And as a preacher he uses persuasion power simple and homely eloquence
4379-18034-0001	train-other-500	to draw men to the ranks of Christianity He is an orator born and has developed this inborn power by the hardest of study and thought and practice He is one of those rare men who always seize and hold the attention
4379-18034-0002	train-other-500	When he speaks men listen It is quality temperament control the word is immaterial but the fact is very material indeed
4379-18034-0003	train-other-500	Some quarter of a century ago Conwell published a little book for students on the study and practice of oratory That clear cut articulation is the charm of eloquence is one of his insisted upon statements
none	none	 and it well illustrates the lifelong practice of the man himself for every word as he talks can be heard in every part of a large building yet always he speaks without apparent effort 
4379-18034-0004	train-other-500	He avoids elocution His voice is soft pitched and never breaks even now when he is over seventy
none	none	 because so he explains it he always speaks in his natural voice 
4379-18034-0005	train-other-500	There is never a straining after effect A speaker must possess a large hearted regard for the welfare of his audience he writes and here again we see Conwell explaining Conwellism
none	none	 Enthusiasm invites enthusiasm is another of his points of importance and one understands that it is by deliberate purpose and not by chance that he tries with such tremendous effort to put enthusiasm into his hearers 
4379-18034-0006	train-other-500	with every sermon and every lecture that he delivers It is easy to raise a laugh but dangerous for it is the greatest test of an orator s control of his audience to be able to land them
none	none	 again on the solid earth of sober thinking 
4379-18034-0007	train-other-500	I have known him at the very end of a sermon
none	none	 have a ripple of laughter sweep freely over the entire congregation and then in a moment 
4379-18034-0008	train-other-500	he has every individual under his control listening soberly to his words He never fears to use humor and it is always very simple and obvious and effective With him even a very simple pun may be used
4379-18034-0009	train-other-500	not only with out taking away from the strength of what he is saying but with a vivid increase of impressiveness
none	none	 And when he says something funny it is in such a delightful and confidential way with such a genial quiet infectious humorousness that his audience is captivated And they never think that he is telling something funny of his own it seems such is the skill of the man that he is just letting them know of something humorous that they are to enjoy with him Be absolutely truthful and scrupulously clear he writes and with delightfully terse common sense he says Use illustrations that illustrate and never did an orator live up to this injunction more than does Conwell himself Nothing is more surprising nothing is more interesting than the way in which he makes use as illustrations of the impressions and incidents of his long and varied life and whatever it is it has direct and instant bearing on the progress of his discourse He will refer to something that he heard a child say in a train yesterday in a few minutes he will speak of something that he saw or some one whom 
4379-18034-0010	train-other-500	he met last month or last year or ten years ago in Ohio in California in London in Paris in New York in Bombay and each memory each illustration is a hammer with which he drives home a truth
4379-18034-0011	train-other-500	The vast number of places he has visited and people he has met the infinite variety of things his observant eyes have seen give him his ceaseless flow of illustrations and his memory and his skill make admirable use of them
none	none	 It is seldom that he uses an illustration from what he has read everything is characteristically his own Henry M Stanley who knew him well referred to him as that double sighted Yankee who could see at a glance all there is and all there ever was And never was there a man who so supplements with personal reminiscence the place or the person 
4379-18034-0012	train-other-500	that has figured in the illustration When he illustrates with the story of the discovery of California gold at Sutter s he almost parenthetically remarks I delivered this lecture on that very spot a few years ago
4379-18034-0013	train-other-500	that is in the town that arose on that very spot And when he illustrates by the story of the invention of the sewing machine he adds I suppose that if any of you were asked who was the inventor of the sewing machine you would say that it was Elias Howe
4379-18034-0014	train-other-500	But that would be a mistake I was with Elias Howe in the Civil War and he often used to tell me
none	none	 how he had tried for fourteen years to invent the sewing machine and that then his wife feeling that something really had to be done invented it in a couple of hours 
4379-18034-0015	train-other-500	Listening to him you begin to feel in touch with everybody and everything and in a friendly and intimate way Always whether in the pulpit or on the platform as in private conversation there is an absolute simplicity about the man and his words
4379-18034-0016	train-other-500	a simplicity an earnestness a complete honesty And when he sets down in his book on oratory A man has no right to use words carelessly he stands for that respect for word craftsmanship that every successful
4379-18034-0017	train-other-500	speaker or writer must feel Be intensely in earnest he writes and in writing this he sets down a prime principle not only of his oratory but of his life A young minister told me that doctor Conwell once said to him with deep feeling
none	none	 Always remember as you preach that you are striving to save at least one soul with every sermon And to one of his close friends doctor Conwell said in one of his self revealing conversations 
4379-18034-0018	train-other-500	I feel whenever I preach that there is always one person in the congregation to whom in all probability I shall never preach again and therefore I feel that I must exert my utmost power in that last chance
4379-18034-0019	train-other-500	And in this even if this were all one sees
none	none	 why each of his sermons is so impressive and why his energy never lags Always with him is the feeling that he is in the world to do all the good he can possibly do 
4379-18034-0020	train-other-500	not a moment not an opportunity must be lost
none	none	 The moment he rises and steps to the front of his pulpit 
4379-18034-0021	train-other-500	he has the attention of every one in the building and this attention he closely holds till he is through Yet it is never by a striking effort that attention is gained except in so far
none	none	 that his utter simplicity is striking I want to preach so simply that you will not think it preaching but just that you are listening to a friend I remember his saying one Sunday morning as he began his sermon and then he went on just as simply as such 
4379-18034-0022	train-other-500	homely kindly friendly words promised And how effectively
none	none	 He believes that everything should be so put as to be understood by all and this belief he applies not only to his preaching 
4379-18034-0023	train-other-500	but to the reading of the Bible whose descriptions he not only visualizes to himself but makes vividly clear to his hearers
none	none	 and this often makes for fascination in result For example he is reading the tenth chapter of I Samuel and begins Thou shalt meet a company of prophets Singers it should be translated he puts in lifting his eyes from the page and looking out over his people Then he goes on taking this change as a matter of course 
4379-18034-0024	train-other-500	Thou shalt meet a company of singers coming down from the high place Whereupon he again interrupts himself
none	none	 and in an irresistible explanatory aside which instantly raises 
4379-18034-0025	train-other-500	the desired picture in the mind of every one he says That means from the little old church on the hill you know And how plain and clear and real and interesting most of all interesting it is from this moment
none	none	 Another man would have left it that prophets were coming down from a high place which would not have seemed at all alive or natural and here suddenly Conwell has flashed his picture of the singers coming down from the little old church on the hill There is magic in doing that sort of thing And he goes on now reading Thou shalt meet a company of singers coming down from the little old church on the hill with a psaltery and a tabret and a pipe and a harp and they shall sing Music is one of Conwell s strongest aids He sings himself sings as if he likes to sing and often finds himself leading the singing 
4379-18034-0026	train-other-500	usually so indeed at the prayer meetings and often in effect at the church services I remember at one church service that the choir leader was standing in front of the massed choir
none	none	 ostensibly leading the singing but that Conwell himself standing at the rear of the pulpit platform with his eyes on his hymn book silently swaying a little with the music and unconsciously beating time as he swayed 
4379-18034-0027	train-other-500	was just as unconsciously the real leader for it was he
none	none	 whom the congregation were watching and with him that they were keeping time He never suspected it he was merely thinking along with the music and there was such a look of contagious happiness on his face as made every one in the building similarly happy 
4379-18034-0028	train-other-500	For he possesses a mysterious faculty
none	none	 of imbuing others with his own happiness 
4379-18034-0029	train-other-500	Not only singers but the modern equivalent of psaltery and tabret and cymbals
none	none	 all have their place in doctor Conwell s scheme of church service 
4379-18034-0030	train-other-500	for there may be a piano and there may even be a trombone
none	none	 and there is a great organ to help the voices 
4379-18034-0031	train-other-500	and at times there are chiming bells His musical taste seems to tend toward the thunderous or perhaps
none	none	 it is only that he knows there are times when people like to hear the thunderous and are moved by it 
4379-18034-0032	train-other-500	And how the choir themselves like it They occupy a great curving space behind the pulpit
none	none	 and put their hearts into song And as the congregation disperse and the choir filter down 
4379-18034-0033	train-other-500	sometimes they are still singing and some of them continue to sing as they go slowly out toward the doors
none	none	 They are happy Conwell himself is happy all the congregation are happy He makes everybody feel happy in coming to church he makes the church attractive 
4379-18034-0034	train-other-500	just as Howells was so long ago told that he did in Lexington And there is something more than happiness there is a sense of ease of comfort of general joy that is quite unmistakable There is nothing of stiffness or constraint
4379-18034-0035	train-other-500	And with it all there is full reverence It is no wonder that he is accustomed to fill every seat of the great building His gestures are usually very simple Now and then when he works up to emphasis he strikes one fist in the palm of the other hand
4379-18034-0036	train-other-500	When he is through you do not remember that he has made any gestures at all but the sound of his voice remains with you and the look of his wonderful eyes And though he is past the threescore years and ten
4379-18034-0037	train-other-500	he looks out over his people with eyes that still have the veritable look of youth Like all great men he not only does big things but keeps in touch with myriad details
none	none	 When his assistant announcing the funeral of an old member hesitates about the street and number and says that they can be found in the telephone directory doctor Conwell s deep voice 
4379-18034-0038	train-other-500	breaks quietly in with Such a number giving it Dauphin Street quietly and in a low tone yet every one in the church hears distinctly every syllable of that low voice
4379-18034-0039	train-other-500	His fund of personal anecdote or personal reminiscence is constant and illustrative
none	none	 in his preaching 
4379-18034-0040	train-other-500	just as it is when he lectures and the reminiscences sweep through many years and at times are really startling in the vivid and homelike pictures they present of the famous folk of the past that he knew One Sunday evening
none	none	 he made an almost casual reference to the time when he first met Garfield then a candidate for the Presidency I asked Major McKinley whom I had met in Washington and whose home was in northern Ohio as was that of mister Garfield to go with me to mister Garfield s home and introduce me When we got there a neighbor had to find him Jim Jim he called You see Garfield was just plain Jim to his old neighbors It s hard to recognize a hero over your back fence He paused a moment for the appreciative ripple to subside and went on We three talked there together what a rare talking that must have been McKinley Garfield and Conwell we talked together and after a while we got to the subject of hymns 
4379-18034-0042	train-other-500	and those two great men
none	none	 both told me how deeply they loved the old hymn 
4379-18034-0043	train-other-500	The Old Time Religion Garfield especially loved it so he told us because the good old man who brought him up as a boy and to whom he owed such gratitude used to sing it
4379-18034-0044	train-other-500	at the pasture bars outside of the boy s window every morning and young Jim knew
none	none	 whenever he heard that old tune that it meant it was time for him to get up 
4379-18034-0045	train-other-500	He said that he had heard
none	none	 the best concerts and the finest operas in the world but had never heard anything he loved as he still loved The Old Time Religion I forget what reason there was for McKinley s especially liking it but he as did Garfield liked it immensely What followed was a striking example of Conwell s intentness on losing no chance to fix an impression on his hearers minds and at the same time it was a really astonishing proof of his power to move and sway For a new expression came over his face and he said as if the idea had only at that moment occurred to him as it most probably had I think it s in our hymnal And in a moment he announced the number and the great organ struck up and every person in the great church every man woman and child joined in the swinging rhythm of verse after verse as if they could never tire of The Old Time Religion It is a simple melody barely more than a single line of almost

none	none	 That it was good for the Hebrew children that it was good for Paul and Silas that it will help you when you re dying that it will show the way to heaven all these and still other lines were sung with a sort of wailing softness a curious monotone a depth of earnestness And the man who had worked this miracle of control by evoking out of the past his memory of a meeting 
4379-18034-0050	train-other-500	with two of the vanished great ones of the earth stood before his people leading them singing with them his eyes aglow with an inward light His magic had suddenly

none	none	 who thus heard it and sung it as long as they live V GIFT FOR INSPIRING OTHERS THE constant earnestness of Conwell his desire to let no chance slip by of helping a fellowman puts often into his voice when he preaches a note of eagerness of anxiety But when he prays when he turns to God his manner undergoes a subtle and unconscious change A load has slipped off his shoulders and has been assumed by a higher power Into his bearing dignified though it was there comes an unconscious increase of the dignity Into his voice firm as it was before there comes a deeper note of firmness He is apt to fling his arms widespread as he prays in a fine gesture that he never uses at other times and he looks upward with the dignity of a man who talking to a higher being is proud of being a friend and confidant One does not need to be a Christian to appreciate the beauty and fineness of Conwell s prayers He is likely at any time to do the unexpected and he is so great a man and has such control that whatever he does seems to everybody a perfectly natural thing His sincerity is so evident and whatever he does is done so simply and naturally that it is just a matter of course I remember during one church service while the singing was going on that he suddenly rose from his chair and kneeling beside it on the open pulpit with his back to the congregation remained in that posture for several minutes No one thought it strange I was likely enough the only one who noticed it His people are used to his sincerities And this time it was merely that he had a few words to say quietly to God and turned aside for a few moments to say them His earnestness of belief in prayer makes him a firm believer in answers to prayer and in fact to what may be termed the direct interposition of Providence Doubtless the mystic strain inherited from his mother has also much to do with this He has a typically homely way of expressing it by one of his favorite maxims one that he loves to repeat encouragingly to friends who are in difficulties themselves or who know of the difficulties that are his and this heartening maxim is Trust in God and do the next thing At one time in the early days of his church work in Philadelphia a payment of a thousand dollars was absolutely needed to prevent a law suit in regard to a debt for the church organ In fact it was worse than a debt it was a note signed by himself personally that had become due he was always ready to assume personal liability for debts of his church and failure to meet the note would mean a measure of disgrace as well as marked church discouragement He had tried all the sources that seemed open to him but in vain He could not openly appeal to the church members in this case for it was in the early days of his pastorate and his zeal for the organ his desire and determination to have it as a necessary part of church equipment had outrun the judgment of some of his best friends including that of the deacon who had gone to Massachusetts for him They had urged a delay till other expenses were met and he had acted against their advice He had tried such friends as he could and he had tried prayer But there was no sign of aid whether supernatural or natural And then literally on the very day on which the holder of the note was to begin proceedings against him a check for precisely the needed one thousand dollars came to him by mail from a man in the West a man who was a total stranger to him It turned out that the man s sister who was one of the Temple membership had written to her brother of doctor Conwell s work She knew nothing of any special need for money knew nothing whatever of any note or of the demand for a thousand dollars she merely outlined to her brother what doctor Conwell was accomplishing and with such enthusiasm that the brother at once sent the opportune check At a later time the sum of ten thousand dollars was importunately needed It was due payment had been promised It was for some of the construction work of the Temple University buildings The last day had come and Conwell and the very few who knew of the emergency were in the depths of gloom It was too large a sum to ask the church people to make up for they were not rich and they had already been giving splendidly of their slender means for the church and then for the university There was no rich man to turn to the men famous for enormous charitable gifts have never let themselves be interested in any of the work of Russell Conwell It would be unkind and gratuitous to suggest that it has been because their names could not be personally attached or because the work is of an unpretentious kind among unpretentious people it need merely be said that neither they nor their agents have cared to aid except that one of the very richest whose name is the most distinguished in the entire world as a giver did once in response to a strong personal application give thirty five hundred dollars this being the extent of the association of the wealthy with any of the varied Conwell work So when it was absolutely necessary to have ten thousand dollars the possibilities of money had been exhausted whether from congregation or individuals Russell Conwell in spite of his superb optimism is also a man of deep depressions and this is because of the very fire and fervor of his nature for always in such a nature there is a balancing He believes in success success must come success is in itself almost a religion with him success for himself and for all the world who will try for it But there are times when he is sad and doubtful over some particular possibility And he intensely believes in prayer faith can move mountains but always he believes that it is better not to wait for the mountains thus to be moved but to go right out and get to work at moving them And once in a while there comes a time when the mountain looms too threatening even after the bravest efforts and the deepest trust Such a time had come the ten thousand dollar debt was a looming mountain that he had tried in vain to move He could still pray and he did but it was one of the times when he could only think that something had gone wrong The dean of the university who has been closely in touch with all his work for many years told me of how in a discouragement which was the more notable through contrast with his usual unfailing courage he left the executive offices for his home a couple of blocks away He went away with everything looking dark before him It was Christmas time but the very fact of its being Christmas only added to his depression Christmas was such an unnatural time for unhappiness But in a few minutes he came flying back radiant overjoyed sparkling with happiness waving a slip of paper in his hand which was a check for precisely ten thousand dollars For he had just drawn it out of an envelope handed to him as he reached home by the mail carrier And it had come so strangely and so naturally For the check was from a woman who was profoundly interested in his work and who had sent the check knowing that in a general way it was needed but without the least idea that there was any immediate need That was eight or nine years ago but although the donor was told at the time that doctor Conwell and all of us were most grateful for the gift it was not until very recently that she was told how opportune it was And the change it made in doctor Conwell He is a great man for maxims and all of us who are associated with him know that one of his favorites is that It will all come out right some time And of course we had a rare opportunity to tell him that he ought never to be discouraged And it is so seldom that he is When the big new church was building the members of the church were vaguely disturbed by noticing when the structure reached the second story that at that height on the side toward the vacant and unbought land adjoining there were several doors built that opened literally into nothing but space When asked about these doors and their purpose doctor Conwell would make some casual reply generally to the effect that they might be excellent as fire escapes To no one for quite a while did he broach even a hint of the great plan that was seething in his mind which was that the buildings of a university were some day to stand on that land immediately adjoining the church At that time the university the Temple University as it is now called was not even a college although it was probably called a college Conwell had organized it and it consisted of a number of classes and teachers meeting in highly inadequate quarters in two little houses But the imagination of Conwell early pictured great new buildings with accommodations for thousands In time the dream was realized the imagination became a fact and now those second floor doors actually open from the Temple Church into the Temple University You see he always thinks big He dreams big dreams and wins big success All his life he has talked and preached success and it is a real and very practical belief with him that it is just as easy to do a large thing as a small one and in fact a little easier And so he naturally does not see why one should be satisfied with the small things of life If your rooms are big the people will come and fill them he likes to say The same effort that wins a small success would rightly directed have won a great success Think big things and then do them Most favorite of all maxims with this man of maxims is Let Patience have her perfect work Over and over he loves to say it and his friends laugh about his love for it and he knows that they do and laughs about it himself I tire them all he says for they hear me say it every day But he says it every day because it means so much to him It stands in his mind as a constant warning against anger or impatience or over haste faults to which his impetuous temperament is prone though few have ever seen him either angry or impatient or hasty so well does he exercise self control Those who have long known him well have said to me that they have never heard him censure any one that his forbearance and kindness are wonderful He is a sensitive man beneath his composure he has suffered and keenly when he has been unjustly attacked he feels pain of that sort for a long time too for even the passing of years does not entirely deaden it When I have been hurt or when I have talked with annoying cranks I have tried to let Patience have her perfect work for those very people if you have patience with them may afterward be of help And he went on to talk a little of his early years in Philadelphia and he said with sadness that it had pained him to meet with opposition and that it had even come from ministers of his own denomination for he had been so misunderstood and misjudged but he added the momentary somberness lifting even his bitter enemies had been won over with patience I could understand a good deal of what he meant for one of the Baptist ministers of Philadelphia had said to me with some shame that at first it used actually to be the case that when doctor Conwell would enter one of the regular ministers meetings all would hold aloof not a single one stepping forward to meet or greet him And it was all through our jealousy of his success said the minister vehemently He came to this city a stranger and he won instant popularity and we couldn t stand it and so we pounced upon things that he did that were altogether unimportant The rest of us were so jealous of his winning throngs that we couldn t see the good in him And it hurt doctor Conwell so much that for ten years he did not come to our conferences But all this was changed long ago Now no minister is so welcomed as he is and I don t believe that there ever has been a single time since he started coming again that he hasn t been asked to say something to us We got over our jealousy long ago and we all love him Nor is it only that the clergymen of his own denomination admire him for not long ago such having been doctor Conwell s triumph in the city of his adoption the rector of the most powerful and aristocratic church in Philadelphia voluntarily paid lofty tribute to his aims and ability his work and his personal worth He is an inspiration to his brothers in the ministry of Jesus Christ so this Episcopalian rector wrote He is a friend to all that is good a foe to all that is evil a strength to the weak a comforter to the sorrowing a man of God These words come from the heart of one who loves honors and reverences him for his character and his deeds doctor Conwell did some beautiful and unusual things in his church instituted some beautiful and unusual customs and one can see how narrow and hasty criticisms charged him long ago with sensationalism charges long since forgotten except through the hurt still felt by doctor Conwell himself They used to charge me with making a circus of the church as if it were possible for me to make a circus of the church And his tone was one of grieved amazement after all these years But he was original and he was popular and therefore there were misunderstanding and jealousy His Easter services for example years ago became widely talked of and eagerly anticipated because each sermon would be wrought around some fine symbol and he would hold in his hand in the pulpit the blue robin s egg or the white dove or the stem of lilies or whatever he had chosen as the particular symbol for the particular sermon and that symbol would give him the central thought for his discourse accented as it would be by the actual symbol itself in view of the congregation The cross lighted by electricity to shine down over the baptismal pool the little stream of water cascading gently down the steps of the pool during the baptismal rite the roses floating in the pool and his gift of one of them to each of the baptized as he or she left the water all such things did seem long ago so unconventional Yet his own people recognized the beauty and poetry of them and thousands of Bibles in Philadelphia have a baptismal rose from doctor Conwell pressed within the pages His constant individuality of mind his constant freshness alertness brilliancy warmth sympathy endear him to his congregation and when he returns from an absence they bubble and effervesce over him as if he were some brilliant new preacher just come to them He is always new to them Were it not that he possesses some remarkable quality of charm he would long ago have become so to speak an old story but instead of that he is to them an always new story an always entertaining and delightful story after all these years It is not only that they still throng to hear him either preach or lecture though that itself would be noticeable but it is the delightful and delighted spirit with which they do it Just the other evening I heard him lecture in his own church just after his return from an absence and every face beamed happily up at him to welcome him back and every one listened as intently to his every word as if he had never been heard there before and when the lecture was over a huge bouquet of flowers was handed up to him and some one embarrassedly said a few words about its being because he was home again It was all as if he had just returned from an absence of months and he had been away just five and a half days VI MILLIONS OF HEARERS THAT Conwell is not primarily a minister that he is a minister because he is a sincere Christian but that he is first of all an Abou Ben Adhem a man who loves his fellow men becomes more and more apparent as the scope of his life work is recognized One almost comes to think that his pastorate of a great church is even a minor matter beside the combined importance of his educational work his lecture work his hospital work his work in general as a helper to those who need help For my own part I should say that he is like some of the old time prophets the strong ones who found a great deal to attend to in addition to matters of religion The power the ruggedness the physical and mental strength the positive grandeur of the man all these are like the general conceptions of the big Old Testament prophets The suggestion is given only because it has often recurred and therefore with the feeling that there is something more than fanciful in the com parison and yet after all the comparison fails in one important particular for none of the prophets seems to have had a sense of humor It is perhaps better and more accurate to describe him as the last of the old school of American philosophers the last of those sturdy bodied high thinking achieving men who in the old days did their best to set American humanity in the right path such men as Emerson Alcott Gough Wendell Phillips Garrison Bayard Taylor Beecher men whom Conwell knew and admired in the long ago and all of whom have long since passed away And Conwell in his going up and down the country inspiring his thousands and thousands is the survivor of that old time group who used to travel about dispensing wit and wisdom and philosophy and courage to the crowded benches of country lyceums and the chairs of school houses and town halls or the larger and more pretentious gathering places of the cities Conwell himself is amused to remember that he wanted to talk in public from his boyhood and that very early he began to yield to the inborn impulse He laughs as he remembers the variety of country fairs and school commencements and anniversaries and even sewing circles where he tried his youthful powers and all for experience alone in the first few years except possibly for such a thing as a ham or a jack knife The first money that he ever received for speaking was so he remembers with glee seventy five cents and even that was not for his talk but for horse hire But at the same time there is more than amusement in recalling these experiences for he knows that they were invaluable to him as training And for over half a century he has affectionately remembered John B Gough who in the height of his own power and success saw resolution and possibilities in the ardent young hill man and actually did him the kindness and the honor of introducing him to an audience in one of the Massachusetts towns and it was really a great kindness and a great honor from a man who had won his fame to a young man just beginning an oratorical career Conwell s lecturing has been considering everything the most important work of his life for by it he has come into close touch with so many millions literally millions of people I asked him once if he had any idea how many he had talked to in the course of his career and he tried to estimate how many thousands of times he had lectured and the average attendance for each but desisted when he saw that it ran into millions of hearers What a marvel is such a fact as that Millions of hearers I asked the same question of his private secretary and found that no one had ever kept any sort of record but as careful an estimate as could be made gave a conservative result of fully eight million hearers for his lectures and adding the number to whom he has preached who have been over five million there is a total of well over thirteen million who have listened to Russell Conwell s voice And this staggering total is if anything an underestimate The figuring was done cautiously and was based upon such facts as that he now addresses an average of over forty five hundred at his Sunday services an average that would be higher were it not that his sermons in vacation time are usually delivered in little churches when at home at the Temple he addresses three meetings every Sunday and that he lectures throughout the entire course of each year including six nights a week of lecturing during vacation time What a power is wielded by a man who has held over thirteen million people under the spell of his voice Probably no other man who ever lived had such a total of hearers And the total is steadily mounting for he is a man who has never known the meaning of rest I think it almost certain that doctor Conwell has never spoken to any one of what to me is the finest point of his lecture work and that is that he still goes gladly and for small fees to the small towns that are never visited by other men of great reputation He knows that it is the little places the out of the way places the submerged places that most need a pleasure and a stimulus and he still goes out man of well over seventy that he is to tiny towns in distant states heedless of the discomforts of traveling of the poor little hotels that seldom have visitors of the oftentimes hopeless cooking and the uncleanliness of the hardships and the discomforts of the unventilated and overheated or underheated halls He does not think of claiming the relaxation earned by a lifetime of labor or if he ever does the thought of the sword of John Ring restores instantly his fervid earnestness How he does it how he can possibly keep it up is the greatest marvel of all I have before me a list of his engagements for the summer weeks of this year nineteen fifteen and I shall set it down because it will specifically show far more clearly than general statements the kind of work he does The list is the itinerary of his vacation Vacation Lecturing every evening but Sunday and on Sundays preaching in the town where he happens to be June twenty four Ackley Ia July eleven Brookings S D twenty five

seventy assumes without receiving a particle of personal gain for every dollar that he makes by it is given away in helping those who need helping That doctor Conwell is intensely modest is one of the curious features of his character He sincerely believes that to write his life would be in the main just to tell what people have done for him He knows and admits that he works unweariedly but in profound sincerity he ascribes the success of his plans to those who have seconded and assisted him It is in just this way that he looks upon every phase of his life When he is reminded of the devotion of his old soldiers he remembers it only with a sort of pleased wonder that they gave the devotion to him and he quite forgets that they loved him because he was always ready to sacrifice ease or risk his own life for them He deprecates praise if any one likes him the liking need not be shown in words but in helping along a good work That his church has succeeded has been because of the devotion of the people that the university has succeeded is because of the splendid work of the teachers and pupils that the hospitals have done so much has been because of the noble services of physicians and nurses To him as he himself expresses it realizing that success has come to his plans it seems as if the realities are but dreams He is astonished by his own success He thinks mainly of his own shortcomings God and man have ever been very patient with me His depression is at times profound when he compares the actual results with what he would like them to be for always his hopes have gone soaring far in advance of achievement It is the Hitch your chariot to a star idea His modesty goes hand in hand with kindliness and I have seen him let himself be introduced in his own church to his congregation when he is going to deliver a lecture there just because a former pupil of the university was present who Conwell knew was ambitious to say something inside of the Temple walls and this seemed to be the only opportunity I have noticed when he travels that the face of the newsboy brightens as he buys a paper from him that the porter is all happiness that conductor and brakeman are devotedly anxious to be of aid Everywhere the man wins love He loves humanity and humanity responds to the love He has always won the affection of those who knew him and Bayard Taylor was one of the many he and Bayard Taylor loved each other for long acquaintance and fellow experiences as world wide travelers back in the years when comparatively few Americans visited the Nile and the Orient or even Europe When Taylor died there was a memorial service in Boston at which Conwell was asked to preside and as he wished for something more than addresses he went to Longfellow and asked him to write and read a poem for the occasion Longfellow had not thought of writing anything and he was too ill to be present at the services but there always being something contagiously inspiring about Russell Conwell when he wishes something to be done the poet promised to do what he could And he wrote and sent the beautiful lines beginning Dead he lay among his books The peace of God was in his looks Many men of letters including Ralph Waldo Emerson were present at the services and doctor Conwell induced Oliver Wendell Holmes to read the lines and they were listened to amid profound silence to their fine ending Conwell in spite of his widespread hold on millions of people has never won fame recognition general renown compared with many men of minor achievements This seems like an impossibility Yet it is not an impossibility but a fact Great numbers of men of education and culture are entirely ignorant of him and his work in the world men these who deem themselves in touch with world affairs and with the ones who make and move the world It is inexplicable this except that never was there a man more devoid of the faculty of self exploitation self advertising than Russell Conwell Nor in the mere reading of them do his words appeal with anything like the force of the same words uttered by himself for always with his spoken words is his personality Those who have heard Russell Conwell or have known him personally recognize the charm of the man and his immense forcefulness but there are many and among them those who control publicity through books and newspapers who though they ought to be the warmest in their enthusiasm have never felt drawn to hear him and if they know of him at all think of him as one who pleases in a simple way the commoner folk forgetting in their pride that every really great man pleases the common ones and that simplicity and directness are attributes of real greatness But Russell Conwell has always won the admiration of the really great as well as of the humbler millions It is only a supposedly cultured class in between that is not thoroughly acquainted with what he has done Perhaps too this is owing to his having cast in his lot with the city of all cities which consciously or unconsciously looks most closely to family and place of residence as criterions of merit a city with which it is almost impossible for a stranger to become affiliated or aphiladelphiated as it might be expressed and Philadelphia in spite of all that doctor Conwell has done has been under the thrall of the fact that he went north of Market Street that fatal fact understood by all who know Philadelphia and that he made no effort to make friends in Rittenhouse Square Such considerations seem absurd in this twentieth century but in Philadelphia they are still potent Tens of thousands of Philadelphians love him and he is honored by its greatest men but there is a class of the pseudo cultured who do not know him or appreciate him And it needs also to be understood that outside of his own beloved Temple he would prefer to go to a little church or a little hall and to speak to the forgotten people in the hope of encouraging and inspiring them and filling them with hopeful glow rather than to speak to the rich and comfortable His dearest hope so one of the few who are close to him told me is that no one shall come into his life without being benefited He does not say this publicly nor does he for a moment believe that such a hope could be fully realized but it is very dear to his heart and no man spurred by such a hope and thus bending all his thoughts toward the poor the hard working the unsuccessful is in a way to win honor from the Scribes for we have Scribes now quite as much as when they were classed with Pharisees It is not the first time in the world s history that Scribes have failed to give their recognition to one whose work was not among the great and wealthy That Conwell himself has seldom taken any part whatever in politics except as a good citizen standing for good government that as he expresses it he never held any political office except that he was once on a school committee and also that he does not identify himself with the so called movements that from time to time catch public attention but aims only and constantly at the quiet betterment of mankind may be mentioned as additional reasons why his name and fame have not been steadily blazoned He knows and will admit that he works hard and has all his life worked hard Things keep turning my way because I m on the job as he whimsically expressed it one day but that is about all so it seems to him And he sincerely believes that his life has in itself been without interest that it has been an essentially commonplace life with nothing of the interesting or the eventful to tell He is frankly surprised that there has ever been the desire to write about him He really has no idea of how fascinating are the things he has done His entire life has been of positive interest from the variety of things accomplished and the unexpectedness with which he has accomplished them Never for example was there such an organizer In fact organization and leadership have always been as the breath of life to him As a youth he organized debating societies and before the war a local military company While on garrison duty in the Civil War he organized what is believed to have been the first free school for colored children in the South One day Minneapolis happened to be spoken of and Conwell happened to remember that he organized when he was a lawyer in that city what became the first Y M C A branch there Once he even started a newspaper And it was natural that the organizing instinct as years advanced should lead him to greater and greater things such as his church with the numerous associations formed within itself through his influence and the university the organizing of the university being in itself an achievement of positive romance A life without interest Why when I happened to ask one day how many Presidents he had known since Lincoln he replied quite casually that he had written the lives of most of them in their own homes and by this he meant either personally or in collaboration with the American biographer Abbott The many sidedness of Conwell is one of the things that is always fascinating After you have quite got the feeling that he is peculiarly a man of to day lecturing on to day s possibilities to the people of to day you happen upon some such fact as that he attracted the attention of the London Times through a lecture on Italian history at Cambridge in England or that on the evening of the day on which he was admitted to practice in the Supreme Court of the United States he gave a lecture in Washington on The Curriculum of the Prophets in Ancient Israel The man s life is a succession of delightful surprises An odd trait of his character is his love for fire He could easily have been a veritable fire worshiper instead of an orthodox Christian He has always loved a blaze and he says reminiscently that for no single thing was he punished so much when he was a child as for building bonfires And after securing possession as he did in middle age of the house where he was born and of a great acreage around about he had one of the most enjoyable times of his life in tearing down old buildings that needed to be destroyed and in heaping up fallen trees and rubbish and in piling great heaps of wood and setting the great piles ablaze You see there is one of the secrets of his strength he has never lost the capacity for fiery enthusiasm Always too in these later years he is showing his strength and enthusiasm in a positively noble way He has for years been a keen sufferer from rheumatism and neuritis but he has never permitted this to interfere with his work or plans He makes little of his sufferings and when he slowly makes his way bent and twisted downstairs he does not want to be noticed I m all right he will say if any one offers to help and at such a time comes his nearest approach to impatience He wants his suffering ignored Strength has always been to him so precious a belonging that he will not relinquish it while he lives I m all right And he makes himself believe that he is all right even though the pain becomes so severe as to demand massage And he will still even when suffering talk calmly or write his letters or attend to whatever matters come before him It is the Spartan boy hiding the pain of the gnawing fox And he never has let pain interfere with his presence on the pulpit or the platform He has once in a while gone to a meeting on crutches and then by the force of will and inspired by what he is to do has stood before his audience or congregation a man full of strength and fire and life VII HOW A UNIVERSITY WAS FOUNDED THE story of the foundation and rise of Temple University is an extraordinary story it is not only extraordinary but inspiring it is not only inspiring but full of romance For the university came out of nothing nothing but the need of a young man and the fact that he told the need to one who throughout his life has felt the impulse to help any one in need and has always obeyed the impulse I asked doctor Conwell up at his home in the Berkshires to tell me himself just how the university began and he said that it began because it was needed and succeeded because of the loyal work of the teachers And when I asked for details he was silent for a while looking off into the brooding twilight as it lay over the waters and the trees and the hills and then he said It was all so simple it all came about so naturally One evening after a service a young man of the congregation came to me and I saw that he was disturbed about something I had him sit down by me and I knew that in a few moments he would tell me what was troubling him doctor Conwell he said abruptly I earn but little money and I see no immediate chance of earning more I have to support not only myself but my mother It leaves nothing at all Yet my longing is to be a minister It is the one ambition of my life Is there anything that I can do Any man I said to him with the proper determination and ambition can study sufficiently at night to win his desire I have tried to think so said he but I have not been able to see anything clearly I want to study and am ready to give every spare minute to it but I don t know how to get at it I thought a few minutes as I looked at him He was strong in his desire and in his ambition to fulfil it strong enough physically and mentally for work of the body and of the mind and he needed something more than generalizations of sympathy Come to me one evening a week and I will begin teaching you myself I said and at least you will in that way make a beginning and I named the evening His face brightened and he eagerly said that he would come and left me but in a little while he came hurrying back again May I bring a friend with me he said I told him to bring as many as he wanted to for more than one would be an advantage and when the evening came there were six friends with him And that first evening I began to teach them the foundations of Latin He stopped as if the story was over He was looking out thoughtfully into the waning light and I knew that his mind was busy with those days of the beginning of the institution he so loves and whose continued success means so much to him In a little while he went on That was the beginning of it and there is little more to tell By the third evening the number of pupils had increased to forty others joined in helping me and a room was hired then a little house then a second house From a few students and teachers we became a college After a while our buildings went up on Broad Street alongside the Temple Church and after another while we became a university From the first our aim I noticed how quickly it had become our instead of my our aim was to give education to those who were unable to get it through the usual channels And so that was really all there was to it That was typical of Russell Conwell to tell with brevity of what he has done to point out the beginnings of something and quite omit to elaborate as to the results And that when you come to know him is precisely what he means you to understand that it is the beginning of anything that is important and that if a thing is but earnestly begun and set going in the right way it may just as easily develop big results as little results But his story was very far indeed from being all there was to it for he had quite omitted to state the extraordinary fact that beginning with those seven pupils coming to his library on an evening in eighteen eighty four the Temple University has numbered up to Commencement time in nineteen fifteen eighty eight thousand eight hundred twenty one students Nearly one hundred thousand students and in the lifetime of the founder Really the magnitude of such a work cannot be exaggerated nor the vast importance of it when it is considered that most of these eighty eight thousand students would not have received their education had it not been for Temple University And it all came from the instant response of Russell Conwell to the immediate need presented by a young man without money And there is something else I want to say said doctor Conwell unexpectedly I want to say more fully than a mere casual word how nobly the work was taken up by volunteer helpers professors from the University of Pennsylvania and teachers from the public schools and other local institutions gave freely of what time they could until the new venture was firmly on its way I honor those who came so devotedly to help And it should be remembered that in those early days the need was even greater than it would now appear for there were then no night schools or manual training schools Since then the city of Philadelphia has gone into such work and as fast as it has taken up certain branches the Temple University has put its energy into the branches just higher And there seems no lessening of the need of it he added ponderingly No there is certainly no lessening of the need of it The figures of the annual catalogue would alone show that As early as eighteen eighty seven just three years after the beginning the Temple College as it was by that time called issued its first catalogue which set forth with stirring words that the intent of its founding was to Provide such instruction as shall be best adapted to the higher education of those who are compelled to labor at their trade while engaged in study Cultivate a taste for the higher and most useful branches of learning Awaken in the character of young laboring men and women a determined ambition to be useful to their fellow men The college the university as it in time came to be early broadened its scope but it has from the first continued to aim at the needs of those unable to secure education without such help as through its methods it affords It was chartered in eighteen eighty eight at which time its numbers had reached almost six hundred and it has ever since had a constant flood of applicants It has demonstrated as doctor Conwell puts it that those who work for a living have time for study And he though he does not himself add this has given the opportunity He feels especial pride in the features by which lectures and recitations are held at practically any hour which best suits the convenience of the students If any ten students join in a request for any hour from nine in the morning to ten at night a class is arranged for them to meet that request This involves the necessity for a much larger number of professors and teachers than would otherwise be necessary but that is deemed a slight consideration in comparison with the immense good done by meeting the needs of workers Also President Conwell for of course he is the president of the university is proud of the fact that the privilege of graduation depends entirely upon knowledge gained that graduation does not depend upon having listened to any set number of lectures or upon having attended for so many terms or years If a student can do four years work in two years or in three he is encouraged to do it and if he cannot even do it in four he can have no diploma Obviously there is no place at Temple University for students who care only for a few years of leisured ease It is a place for workers and not at all for those who merely wish to be able to boast that they attended a university The students have come largely from among railroad clerks bank clerks bookkeepers teachers preachers mechanics salesmen drug clerks city and United States government employees widows nurses housekeepers brakemen firemen engineers motormen conductors and shop hands It was when the college became strong enough and sufficiently advanced in scholarship and standing and broad enough in scope to win the name of university that this title was officially granted to it by the State of Pennsylvania in nineteen oh seven and now its educational plan includes three distinct school systems First it offers a high school education to the student who has to quit school after leaving the grammar school Second it offers a full college education with the branches taught in long established high grade colleges to the student who has to quit on leaving the high school Third it offers further scientific or professional education to the college graduate who must go to work immediately on quitting college but who wishes to take up some such course as law or medicine or engineering Out of last year s enrolment of three thousand six hundred fifty four it is interesting to notice that the law claimed one hundred forty one theology one hundred eighty two medicine and pharmacy and dentistry combined three hundred fifty seven civil engineering thirty seven also that the teachers college with normal courses on such subjects as household arts and science kindergarten work and physical education took one hundred seventy four and still more interesting in a way to see that two hundred sixty nine students were enrolled for the technical and vocational courses such as cooking and dress making millinery manual crafts school gardening and story telling There were five hundred eleven in high school work and two hundred forty three in elementary education There were seventy nine studying music and sixty eight studying to be trained nurses There were six hundred six in the college of liberal arts and sciences and in the department of commercial education there were nine hundred eighty seven for it is a university that offers both scholarship and practicality Temple University is not in the least a charitable institution Its fees are low and its hours are for the convenience of the students themselves but it is a place of absolute independence It is indeed a place of far greater independence so one of the professors pointed out than are the great universities which receive millions and millions of money in private gifts and endowments Temple University in its early years was sorely in need of money and often there were thrills of expectancy when some man of mighty wealth seemed on the point of giving But not a single one ever did and now the Temple likes to feel that it is glad of it The Temple to quote its own words is An institution for strong men and women who can labor with both mind and body And the management is proud to be able to say that although great numbers have come from distant places not one of the many thousands ever failed to find an opportunity to support himself Even in the early days when money was needed for the necessary buildings the buildings of which Conwell dreamed when he left second story doors in his church the university college it was then called had won devotion from those who knew that it was a place where neither time nor money was wasted and where idleness was a crime and in the donations for the work were many such items as four hundred dollars from factory workers who gave fifty cents each and two thousand dollars from policemen who gave a dollar each Within two or three years past the State of Pennsylvania has begun giving it a large sum annually and this state aid is public recognition of Temple University as an institution of high public value The state money is invested in the brains and hearts of the ambitious So eager is doctor Conwell to place the opportunity of education before every one that even his servants must go to school He is not one of those who can see needs that are far away but not those that are right at home His belief in education and in the highest attainable education is profound and it is not only on account of the abstract pleasure and value of education but its power of increasing actual earning power and thus making a worker of more value to both himself and the community Many a man and many a woman while continuing to work for some firm or factory has taken Temple technical courses and thus fitted himself or herself for an advanced position with the same employer The Temple knows of many such who have thus won prominent advancement And it knows of teachers who while continuing to teach have fitted themselves through the Temple courses for professorships And it knows of many a case of the rise of a Temple student that reads like an Arabian Nights fancy of advance from bookkeeper to editor from office boy to bank president from kitchen maid to school principal from street cleaner to mayor The Temple University helps them that help themselves President Conwell told me personally of one case that especially interested him because it seemed to exhibit in especial degree the Temple possibilities and it particularly interested me because it also showed in high degree the methods and personality of doctor Conwell himself One day a young woman came to him and said she earned only three dollars a week and that she desired very much to make more Can you tell me how to do it she said He liked her ambition and her directness but there was something that he felt doubtful about and that was that her hat looked too expensive for three dollars a week Now doctor Conwell is a man whom you would never suspect of giving a thought to the hat of man or woman But as a matter of fact there is very little that he does not see But though the hat seemed too expensive for three dollars a week doctor Conwell is not a man who makes snap judgments harshly and in particular he would be the last man to turn away hastily one who had sought him out for help He never felt nor could possibly urge upon any one contentment with a humble lot he stands for advancement he has no sympathy with that dictum of the smug that has come to us from a nation tight bound for centuries by its gentry and aristocracy about being contented with the position in which God has placed you for he points out that the Bible itself holds up advancement and success as things desirable And as to the young woman before him it developed through discreet inquiry veiled by frank discussion of her case that she had made the expensive looking hat herself Whereupon not only did all doubtfulness and hesitation vanish but he saw at once how she could better herself He knew that a woman who could make a hat like that for herself could make hats for other people and so Go into millinery as a business he advised Oh if I only could she exclaimed But I know that I don t know enough Take the millinery course in Temple University he responded She had not even heard of such a course and when he went on to explain how she could take it and at the same time continue at her present work until the course was concluded she was positively ecstatic it was all so unexpected this opening of the view of a new and broader life She was an unusual woman concluded doctor Conwell and she worked with enthusiasm and tirelessness She graduated went to an up state city that seemed to offer a good field opened a millinery establishment there with her own name above the door and became prosperous That was only a few years ago And recently I had a letter from her telling me that last year she netted a clear profit of three thousand six hundred dollars I remember a man himself of distinguished position saying of doctor Conwell It is difficult to speak in tempered language of what he has achieved And that just expresses it the temptation is constantly to use superlatives for superlatives fit Of course he has succeeded for himself and succeeded marvelously in his rise from the rocky hill farm but he has done so vastly more than that in inspiring such hosts of others to succeed A dreamer of dreams and a seer of visions and what realizations have come And it interested me profoundly not long ago when doctor Conwell talking of the university unexpectedly remarked that he would like to see such institutions scattered throughout every state in the Union All carried on at slight expense to the students and at hours to suit all sorts of working men and women he added after a pause and then abruptly I should like to see the possibility of higher education offered to every one in the United States who works for a living There was something superb in the very imagining of such a nation wide system But I did not ask whether or not he had planned any details for such an effort I knew that thus far it might only be one of his dreams but I also knew that his dreams had a way of becoming realities I had a fleeting glimpse of his soaring vision It was amazing to find a man of more than three score and ten thus dreaming of more worlds to conquer And I thought what could the world have accomplished if Methuselah had been a Conwell or far better what wonders could be accomplished if Conwell could but be a Methuselah He has all his life been a great traveler He is a man who sees vividly and who can describe vividly Yet often his letters even from places of the most profound interest are mostly concerned with affairs back home It is not that he does not feel and feel intensely the interest of what he is visiting but that his tremendous earnestness keeps him always concerned about his work at home There could be no stronger example than what I noticed in a letter he wrote from Jerusalem I am in Jerusalem And here at Gethsemane and at the Tomb of Christ reading thus far one expects that any man and especially a minister is sure to say something regarding the associations of the place and the effect of these associations on his mind but Conwell is always the man who is different And here at Gethsemane and at the Tomb of Christ I pray especially for the Temple University That is Conwellism That he founded a hospital a work in itself great enough for even a great life is but one among the striking incidents of his career And it came about through perfect naturalness For he came to know through his pastoral work and through his growing acquaintance with the needs of the city that there was a vast amount of suffering and wretchedness and anguish because of the inability of the existing hospitals to care for all who needed care There was so much sickness and suffering to be alleviated there were so many deaths that could be prevented and so he decided to start another hospital And like everything with him the beginning was small That cannot too strongly be set down as the way of this phenomenally successful organizer Most men would have to wait until a big beginning could be made and so would most likely never make a beginning at all But Conwell s way is to dream of future bigness but be ready to begin at once no matter how small or insignificant the beginning may appear to others Two rented rooms one nurse one patient this was the humble beginning in eighteen ninety one of what has developed into the great Samaritan Hospital In a year there was an entire house fitted up with wards and operating room Now it occupies several buildings including and adjoining that first one and a great new structure is planned But even as it is it has a hundred and seventy beds is fitted with all modern hospital appliances and has a large staff of physicians and the number of surgical operations performed there is very large It is open to sufferers of any race or creed and the poor are never refused admission the rule being that treatment is free for those who cannot pay but that such as can afford it shall pay according to their means And the hospital has a kindly feature that endears it to patients and their relatives alike and that is that by doctor Conwell s personal order there are not only the usual week day hours for visiting but also one evening a week and every Sunday afternoon For otherwise as he says many would be unable to come because they could not get away from their work A little over eight years ago another hospital was taken in charge the Garretson not founded by Conwell this one but acquired and promptly expanded in its usefulness Both the Samaritan and the Garretson are part of Temple University The Samaritan Hospital has treated since its foundation up to the middle of nineteen fifteen twenty nine thousand three hundred one patients the Garretson in its shorter life five thousand nine hundred twenty three Including dispensary cases as well as house patients the two hospitals together under the headship of President Conwell have handled over four hundred thousand cases How Conwell can possibly meet the multifarious demands upon his time is in itself a miracle He is the head of the great church he is the head of the university he is the head of the hospitals he is the head of everything with which he is associated And he is not only nominally but very actively the head VIII HIS SPLENDID EFFICIENCY CONWELL has a few strong and efficient executive helpers who have long been associated with him men and women who know his ideas and ideals who are devoted to him and who do their utmost to relieve him and of course there is very much that is thus done for him but even as it is he is so overshadowing a man there is really no other word that all who work with him look to him for advice and guidance the professors and the students the doctors and the nurses the church officers the Sunday school teachers the members of his congregation And he is never too busy to see any one who really wishes to see him He can attend to a vast intricacy of detail and answer myriad personal questions and doubts and keep the great institutions splendidly going by thorough systematization of time and by watching every minute He has several secretaries for special work besides his private secretary His correspondence is very great Often he dictates to a secretary as he travels on the train Even in the few days for which he can run back to the Berkshires work is awaiting him Work follows him And after knowing of this one is positively amazed that he is able to give to his country wide lectures the time and the traveling that they inexorably demand Only a man of immense strength of the greatest stamina a veritable superman could possibly do it And at times one quite forgets noticing the multiplicity of his occupations that he prepares two sermons and two talks on Sunday Here is his usual Sunday schedule when at home He rises at seven and studies until breakfast which is at eight thirty Then he studies until nine forty five when he leads a men s meeting at which he is likely also to play the organ and lead the singing At ten thirty is the principal church service at which he preaches and at the close of which he shakes hands with hundreds He dines at one after which he takes fifteen minutes rest and then reads and at three o clock he addresses in a talk that is like another sermon a large class of men not the same men as in the morning He is also sure to look in at the regular session of the Sunday school Home again where he studies and reads until supper time At seven thirty is the evening service at which he again preaches and after which he shakes hands with several hundred more and talks personally in his study with any who have need of talk with him He is usually home by ten thirty I spoke of it one evening as having been a strenuous day and he responded with a cheerfully whimsical smile Three sermons and shook hands with nine hundred That evening as the service closed he had said to the congregation I shall be here for an hour We always have a pleasant time together after service If you are acquainted with me come up and shake hands If you are strangers just the slightest of pauses come up and let us make an acquaintance that will last for eternity I remember how simply and easily this was said in his clear deep voice and how impressive and important it seemed and with what unexpectedness it came Come and make an acquaintance that will last for eternity And there was a serenity about his way of saying this which would make strangers think just as he meant them to think that he had nothing whatever to do but to talk with them Even his own congregation have most of them little conception of how busy a man he is and how precious is his time One evening last June to take an evening of which I happened to know he got home from a journey of two hundred miles at six o clock and after dinner and a slight rest went to the church prayer meeting which he led in his usual vigorous way at such meetings playing the organ and leading the singing as well as praying and talk ing After the prayer meeting he went to two dinners in succession both of them important dinners in connection with the close of the university year and at both dinners he spoke At the second dinner he was notified of the sudden illness of a member of his congregation and instantly hurried to the man s home and thence to the hospital to which he had been removed and there he remained at the man s bedside or in consultation with the physicians until one in the morning Next morning he was up at seven and again at work This one thing I do is his private maxim of efficiency and a literalist might point out that he does not one thing only but a thousand things not getting Conwell s meaning which is that whatever the thing may be which he is doing he lets himself think of nothing else until it is done doctor Conwell has a profound love for the country and particularly for the country of his own youth He loves the wind that comes sweeping over the hills he loves the wide stretching views from the heights and the forest intimacies of the nestled nooks He loves the rippling streams he loves the wild flowers that nestle in seclusion or that unexpectedly paint some mountain meadow with delight He loves the very touch of the earth and he loves the great bare rocks He writes verses at times at least he has written lines for a few old tunes and it interested me greatly to chance upon some lines of his that picture heaven in terms of the Berkshires The wide stretching valleys in colors so fadeless Where trees are all deathless and flowers e er bloom That is heaven in the eyes of a New England hill man Not golden pavement and ivory palaces but valleys and trees and flowers and the wide sweep of the open Few things please him more than to go for example blackberrying and he has a knack of never scratching his face or his fingers when doing so And he finds blackberrying whether he goes alone or with friends an extraordinarily good time for planning something he wishes to do or working out the thought of a sermon And fishing is even better for in fishing he finds immense recreation and restfulness and at the same time a further opportunity to think and plan As a small boy he wished that he could throw a dam across the trout brook that runs near the little Conwell home and as he never gives up he finally realized the ambition although it was after half a century And now he has a big pond three quarters of a mile long by half a mile wide lying in front of the house down a slope from it a pond stocked with splendid pickerel He likes to float about restfully on this pond thinking or fishing or both And on that pond he showed me how to catch pickerel even under a blaze of sunlight He is a trout fisher too for it is a trout stream that feeds this pond and goes dashing away from it through the wilderness and for miles adjoining his place a fishing club of wealthy men bought up the rights in this trout stream and they approached him with a liberal offer But he declined it I remembered what good times I had when I was a boy fishing up and down that stream and I couldn t think of keeping the boys of the present day from such a pleasure So they may still come and fish for trout here As we walked one day beside this brook he suddenly said Did you ever notice that every brook has its own song I should know the song of this brook anywhere It would seem as if he loved his rugged native country because it is rugged even more than because it is native Himself so rugged so hardy so enduring the strength of the hills is his also Always in his very appearance you see something of this ruggedness of the hills a ruggedness a sincerity a plainness that mark alike his character and his looks And always one realizes the strength of the man even when his voice as it usually is is low And one increasingly realizes the strength when on the lecture platform or in the pulpit or in conversation he flashes vividly into fire A big boned man he is sturdy framed a tall man with broad shoulders and strong hands His hair is a deep chestnut brown that at first sight seems black In his early manhood he was superb in looks as his pictures show but anxiety and work and the constant flight of years with physical pain have settled his face into lines of sadness and almost of severity which instantly vanish when he speaks And his face is illumined by marvelous eyes He is a lonely man The wife of his early years died long long ago before success had come and she was deeply mourned for she had loyally helped him through a time that held much of struggle and hardship He married again and this wife was his loyal helpmate for many years In a time of special stress when a defalcation of sixty five thousand dollars threatened to crush Temple College just when it was getting on its feet for both Temple Church and Temple College had in those early days buoyantly assumed heavy indebtedness he raised every dollar he could by selling or mortgaging his own possessions and in this his wife as he lovingly remembers most cordially stood beside him although she knew that if anything should happen to him the financial sacrifice would leave her penniless She died after years of companionship his children married and made homes of their own he is a lonely man Yet he is not unhappy for the tremendous demands of his tremendous work leave him little time for sadness or retrospect At times the realization comes that he is getting old that friends and comrades have been passing away leaving him an old man with younger friends and helpers But such realization only makes him work with an earnestness still more intense knowing that the night cometh when no man shall work Deeply religious though he is he does not force religion into conversation on ordinary subjects or upon people who may not be interested in it With him it is action and good works with faith and belief that count except when talk is the natural the fitting the necessary thing when addressing either one individual or thousands he talks with superb effectiveness His sermons are it may almost literally be said parable after parable although he himself would be the last man to say this for it would sound as if he claimed to model after the greatest of all examples His own way of putting it is that he uses stories frequently because people are more impressed by illustrations than by argument Always whether in the pulpit or out of it he is simple and homelike human and unaffected If he happens to see some one in the congregation to whom he wishes to speak he may just leave his pulpit and walk down the aisle while the choir is singing and quietly say a few words and return In the early days of his ministry if he heard of a poor family in immediate need of food he would be quite likely to gather a basket of provisions and go personally and offer this assistance and such other as he might find necessary when he reached the place As he became known he ceased from this direct and open method of charity for he knew that impulsiveness would be taken for intentional display But he has never ceased to be ready to help on the instant that he knows help is needed Delay and lengthy investigation are avoided by him when he can be certain that something immediate is required And the extent of his quiet charity is amazing With no family for which to save money and with no care to put away money for himself he thinks only of money as an instrument for helpfulness I never heard a friend criticize him except for too great open handedness I was strongly impressed after coming to know him that he possessed many of the qualities that made for the success of the old time district leaders of New York City and I mentioned this to him and he at once responded that he had himself met Big Tim the long time leader of the Sullivans and had had him at his house Big Tim having gone to Philadelphia to aid some henchman in trouble and having promptly sought the aid of doctor Conwell And it was characteristic of Conwell that he saw what so many never saw the most striking characteristic of that Tammany leader For Big Tim Sullivan was so kind hearted Conwell appreciated the man s political unscrupulousness as well as did his enemies but he saw also what made his underlying power his kind heartedness Except that Sullivan could be supremely unscrupulous and that Conwell is supremely scrupulous there were marked similarities in these masters over men and Conwell possesses as Sullivan possessed a wonderful memory for faces and names Naturally Russell Conwell stands steadily and strongly for good citizenship But he never talks boastful Americanism He seldom speaks in so many words of either Americanism or good citizenship but he constantly and silently keeps the American flag as the symbol of good citizenship before his people An American flag is prominent in his church an American flag is seen in his home a beautiful American flag is up at his Berkshire place and surmounts a lofty tower where when he was a boy there stood a mighty tree at the top of which was an eagle s nest which has given him a name for his home for he terms it The Eagle s Nest Remembering a long story that I had read of his climbing to the top of that tree though it was a well nigh impossible feat and securing the nest by great perseverance and daring I asked him if the story were a true one Oh I ve heard something about it somebody said that somebody watched me or something of the kind But I don t remember anything about it myself Any friend of his is sure to say something after a while about his determination his insistence on going ahead with anything on which he has really set his heart One of the very important things on which he insisted in spite of very great opposition and especially an opposition from the other churches of his denomination for this was a good many years ago when there was much more narrowness in churches and sects than there is at present was with regard to doing away with close communion He determined on an open communion and his way of putting it once decided upon was My friends it is not for me to invite you to the table of the Lord The table of the Lord is open If you feel that you can come to the table it is open to you And this is the form which he still uses He not only never gives up but so his friends say he never forgets a thing upon which he has once decided and at times long after they supposed the matter has been entirely forgotten they suddenly find doctor Conwell bringing his original purpose to pass When I was told of this I remembered that pickerel pond in the Berkshires If he is really set upon doing anything little or big adverse criticism does not disturb his serenity Some years ago he began wearing a huge diamond whose size attracted much criticism and caustic comment He never said a word in defense he just kept on wearing the diamond One day however after some years he took it off and people said He has listened to the criticism at last He smiled reminiscently as he told me about this and said A dear old deacon of my congregation gave me that diamond and I did not like to hurt his feelings by refusing it It really bothered me to wear such a glaring big thing but because I didn t want to hurt the old deacon s feelings I kept on wearing it until he was dead Then I stopped wearing it The ambition of Russell Conwell is to continue working and working until the very last moment of his life In work he forgets his sadness his loneliness his age And he said to me one day I will die in harness IX THE STORY OF ACRES OF DIAMONDS 
4379-18039-0000	train-other-500	CONSIDERING everything the most remarkable thing in Russell Conwell s remarkable life is his lecture Acres of Diamonds That is the lecture itself the number of times he has delivered it what a source of inspiration it has been to myriads
none	none	 the money that he has made and is making and still more the purpose to which he directs the money 
4379-18039-0001	train-other-500	In the circumstances surrounding Acres of Diamonds in its tremendous success in the attitude of mind revealed by the lecture itself and by what doctor Conwell does with it it is illuminative of his character his aims his ability
4379-18039-0002	train-other-500	The lecture is vibrant with his energy It flashes with his hopefulness
none	none	 It is full of his enthusiasm 
4379-18039-0003	train-other-500	It is packed full of his intensity It stands for the possibilities of success in every one He has delivered it over five thousand times The demand for it never diminishes The success grows never less
4379-18039-0004	train-other-500	There is a time in Russell Conwell s youth of which
none	none	 it is pain for him to think 
4379-18039-0005	train-other-500	He told me of it one evening and his voice sank lower and lower as he went far back into the past It was of his days at Yale that he spoke for they were days of suffering For he had not money for Yale and in working
4379-18039-0006	train-other-500	for more he endured bitter humiliation It was not that the work was hard for Russell Conwell has always been ready for hard work It was not that there were privations and difficulties for he has always found difficulties only things to overcome
4379-18039-0007	train-other-500	and endured privations with cheerful fortitude But it was the humiliations that he met the personal humiliations that after more than half a century make him suffer in remembering them
4379-18039-0008	train-other-500	yet out of those humiliations came a marvelous result I determined he says that whatever I could do to make the way easier at college for other young men working their way I would do And so many years ago he began to
none	none	 devote every dollar that he made from Acres of Diamonds 
4379-18039-0009	train-other-500	to this definite purpose He has what may be termed a waiting list On that list are very few cases he has looked into personally Infinitely busy man that he is he cannot do extensive personal investigation
4379-18039-0010	train-other-500	A large proportion of his names come to him from college presidents who know of students in their own colleges in need of such a helping hand Every night he said when I asked him to tell me about it when my lecture is over
4379-18039-0011	train-other-500	and the check is in my hand I sit down in my room in the hotel what a lonely picture tool I sit down in my room in the hotel and subtract from the total sum received my actual expenses for that place
4379-18039-0012	train-other-500	and make out a check for the difference and send it to some young man on my list And I always send with the check a letter of advice and helpfulness expressing my hope
none	none	 that it will be of some service to him and telling him that he is to feel under no obligation except to his Lord I feel strongly and I try to make every young man feel that there must be no sense of obligation to me personally 
4379-18039-0013	train-other-500	And I tell them that I am hoping to leave behind me men who will do more work than I have done Don t think that I put in too much advice he added with a smile for I only try to let them know that a friend is trying to help them
4379-18039-0014	train-other-500	His face lighted as he spoke There is such a fascination in it he exclaimed
none	none	 It is just like a gamble And as soon as I have sent the letter and crossed a name off my list I am aiming for the next one And after a pause he added I do not attempt to send any young man enough for all his expenses 
4379-18039-0015	train-other-500	But I want to save him from bitterness and each check will help And too
none	none	 he concluded naively in the vernacular I don t want them to lay down on me 
4379-18039-0016	train-other-500	He told me that he made it clear that he did not wish to get returns or reports from this branch of his life work for it would take a great deal of time in watching and thinking
none	none	 and in the reading and writing of letters But it is mainly he went on that I do not wish to hold over their heads the sense of obligation When I suggested that this was surely an example of bread cast upon the waters that could not return he was silent for a little and then said thoughtfully 
4379-18039-0017	train-other-500	As one gets on in years there is satisfaction in doing a thing for the sake of doing it The bread returns in the sense of effort made On a recent trip through Minnesota he was positively upset so his secretary told me
none	none	 through being recognized on a train by a young man who had been helped through Acres of Diamonds 
4379-18039-0018	train-other-500	and who finding that this was really doctor Conwell eagerly brought his wife to join him in most fervent thanks for his assistance
none	none	 Both the husband and his wife were so emotionally overcome that it quite overcame doctor Conwell himself 
4379-18039-0019	train-other-500	The lecture to quote the noble words of doctor Conwell himself is designed to help every person of either sex who cherishes the high resolve of sustaining a career of usefulness and honor It is a lecture of helpfulness
none	none	 And it is a lecture when given with Conwell s voice and face and manner that is full of fascination And yet it is all so simple 
4379-18039-0020	train-other-500	It is packed full of inspiration of suggestion of aid He alters it to meet the local circumstances of the thousands of different places in which he delivers it But the base remains the same
none	none	 And even those to whom it is an old story will go to hear him time after time 
4379-18039-0021	train-other-500	It amuses him to say that he knows individuals who have listened to it twenty times It begins with a story told to Conwell by an old Arab
none	none	 as the two journeyed together toward Nineveh and as you listen you hear the actual voices and you see the sands of the desert and the waving palms 
4379-18039-0022	train-other-500	The lecturer s voice is so easy so effortless it seems so ordinary and matter of fact yet the entire scene is instantly vital and alive
none	none	 Instantly the man has his audience under a sort of spell eager to listen ready to be merry or grave 
4379-18039-0023	train-other-500	He has the faculty of control
none	none	 the vital quality that makes the orator The same people will go to hear this lecture over and over 
4379-18039-0024	train-other-500	and that is the kind of tribute that Conwell likes I recently heard him deliver it in his own church where it would naturally be thought to be an old story and where presumably only a few of the faithful would go but it was quite clear that all of his church are the faithful
4379-18039-0025	train-other-500	for it was a large audience that came to listen to him hardly a seat in the great auditorium was vacant And it should be added that although it was in his own church it was not a free lecture where a throng might be expected
none	none	 but that each one paid a liberal sum for a seat and the paying of admission is always a practical test of the sincerity of desire to hear And the people were swept along by the current as if lecturer and lecture were of novel interest The lecture in itself is good to read but it is only when it is illumined by Conwell s vivid personality that one understands how it influences in the actual delivery On that particular evening he had decided to give the lecture in the same form as when he first delivered it many years ago 
4379-18039-0026	train-other-500	without any of the alterations that have come with time and changing localities and as he went on with the audience rippling and bubbling with laughter as usual he never doubted
none	none	 that he was giving it as he had given it years before 
4379-18039-0027	train-other-500	and yet so up to date and alive must he necessarily be in spite of a definitive effort to set himself back
none	none	 every once in a while he was coming out with illustrations 
4379-18039-0028	train-other-500	from such distinctly recent things as the automobile
none	none	 The last time I heard him was the five thousand one hundred and twenty fourth time 
4379-18039-0029	train-other-500	for the lecture Doesn t it seem incredible five thousand one hundred twenty four times I noticed that he was to deliver it at a little out of the way place difficult for any considerable number to get to
none	none	 and I wondered just how much of an audience would gather and how they would be impressed So I went over from there I was a few miles away The road was dark and I pictured a small audience but when I got there I found the church building in which he was to deliver the lecture had a seating capacity of eight hundred thirty and that precisely eight hundred thirty people were already seated there and that a fringe of others were standing behind Many had come from miles away Yet the lecture had scarcely if at all been advertised But people had said to one another Aren t you going to hear doctor Conwell And the word had thus been passed along I remember how fascinating it was to watch that audience for they responded so keenly and with such heartfelt pleasure throughout the entire lecture And not only were they immensely pleased and amused and interested and to achieve that at a crossroads church was in itself a triumph to be proud of but I knew that every listener was given an impulse toward doing something for himself and for others and that with at least some of them the impulse would materialize in acts 
4379-18039-0030	train-other-500	Over and over one realizes what a power such a man wields And what an unselfishness
none	none	 For far on in years as he is and suffering pain he does not chop down his lecture to a definite length he does not talk for just an hour or go on grudgingly for an hour and a half 
4379-18039-0031	train-other-500	He sees that the people are fascinated and inspired and he forgets pain ignores time forgets that the night is late and that he has a long journey to go to get home
none	none	 and keeps on generously for two hours And every one wishes it were four 
4379-18039-0032	train-other-500	Always he talks with ease and sympathy
none	none	 There are geniality composure humor 
4379-18039-0033	train-other-500	simple and homely jests yet never does the audience forget that he is every moment in tremendous earnest They bubble with responsive laughter or are silent in riveted attention
none	none	 A stir can be seen to sweep over an audience of earnestness or surprise or amusement or resolve When he is grave and sober or fervid 
4379-18039-0034	train-other-500	the people feel that he is himself a fervidly earnest man
none	none	 and when he is telling something humorous there is on his part almost a repressed chuckle 
4379-18039-0035	train-other-500	a genial appreciation of the fun of it
none	none	 not in the least as if he were laughing at his own humor but as if he and his hearers were laughing together at something of which they were all humorously cognizant 
4379-18039-0036	train-other-500	Myriad successes in life have come through the direct inspiration of this single lecture One hears of so many that there must be vastly more that are never told A few of the most recent were told me by doctor Conwell himself
none	none	 one being of a farmer boy who walked a long distance to hear him On his way home 
4379-18039-0037	train-other-500	so the boy now a man has written him he thought over and over of what he could do to advance himself and before he reached home he learned that a teacher was wanted at a certain country school
none	none	 He knew he did not know enough to teach but was sure he could learn so he bravely asked for the place 
4379-18039-0038	train-other-500	And something in his earnestness made him win a temporary appointment Thereupon he worked and studied so hard and so devotedly while he daily taught that within a few months he was regularly employed there And now says Conwell abruptly
4379-18039-0039	train-other-500	with his characteristic skim ming over of the intermediate details between the important beginning of a thing and the satisfactory end and now that young man is one of our college presidents
4379-18039-0040	train-other-500	And very recently a lady came to doctor Conwell the wife of an exceptionally prominent man who was earning a large salary and she told him that her husband was so unselfishly generous with money
none	none	 that often they were almost in straits And she said they had bought a little farm as a country place paying only a few hundred dollars for it and that she had said to herself laughingly after hearing the lecture There are no acres of diamonds on this place But she also went on to tell that she had found a spring of exceptionally fine water there although in buying they had scarcely known of the spring at all and she had been so inspired by Conwell that she had had the water analyzed and finding that it was remarkably pure had begun to have it bottled and sold under a trade name as special spring water And she is making money 
4379-18039-0041	train-other-500	And she also sells pure ice from the pool
none	none	 cut in winter time and all because of Acres of Diamonds Several millions of dollars in all have been received by Russell Conwell as the proceeds from this single lecture Such a fact is almost staggering and it is more staggering to realize what good is done in the world by this man who does not earn for himself but uses his money in immediate helpfulness 
4379-18039-0042	train-other-500	And one can neither think nor write with moderation when it is further realized that far more good than can be done directly with money he does by uplifting and inspiring with this lecture Always his heart is with the weary and the heavy laden
4379-18039-0043	train-other-500	Always he stands for self betterment Last year nineteen fourteen he and his work were given unique recognition For it was known by his friends that this particular lecture was approaching its five thousandth delivery
4379-18039-0044	train-other-500	and they planned a celebration of such an event in the history of the most popular lecture in the world doctor Conwell agreed to deliver it in the Academy of Music in Philadelphia and the building was packed and the streets outside were thronged
none	none	 The proceeds from all sources for that five thousandth lecture were over nine thousand dollars The hold which Russell Conwell has gained on the affections 
4379-18039-0045	train-other-500	and respect of his home city was seen not only in the thousands who strove to hear him but in the prominent men who served on the local committee in charge of the celebration There was a national committee too
4379-18039-0046	train-other-500	and the nation wide love that he has won the nation wide appreciation of what he has done and is still doing
none	none	 was shown by the fact that among the names of the notables on this committee were those of nine governors of states The Governor of Pennsylvania was himself present to do Russell Conwell honor and he gave to him a key emblematic of the Freedom of the State The Freedom of the State yes this man well over seventy has won it The Freedom of the State the Freedom of the Nation for this man of helpfulness this marvelous exponent of the gospel of success has worked marvelously for the freedom the betterment the liberation the advancement of the individual FIFTY YEARS ON THE LECTURE PLATFORM By Russell H Conwell 
4379-18040-0000	train-other-500	AN Autobiography What an absurd request If all the conditions were favorable the story of my public Life could not be made interesting It does not seem possible that any will care to read so plain and uneventful a tale
none	none	 I see nothing in it for boasting nor much that could be helpful Then I never saved a scrap of paper intentionally concerning my work to which I could refer not a book not a sermon not a lecture 
4379-18040-0001	train-other-500	not a newspaper notice or account not a magazine article
none	none	 not one of the kind biographies written from time to time by noble friends have I ever kept even as a souvenir although some of them may be in my library I have ever felt that the writers concerning my life were too generous and that my own work was too hastily done Hence I have nothing upon which to base an autobiographical account except the recollections which come to an overburdened mind My general view of half a century on the lecture platform brings to me precious and beautiful memories and fills my soul with devout gratitude for the blessings and kindnesses which have been given to me so far beyond my deserts So much more success has come to my hands than I ever expected so much more of good have I found than even youth s wildest dream included so much more effective have been my weakest endeavors 
4379-18040-0002	train-other-500	than I ever planned or hoped that a biography written truthfully would be mostly an account of what men and women have done for me I have lived to see accomplished far more than my highest ambition included
none	none	 and have seen the enterprises I have undertaken rush by me pushed on by a thousand strong hands until they have left me far behind them 
4379-18040-0003	train-other-500	The realities are like dreams to me Blessings on the loving hearts and noble minds who have been so willing to sacrifice for others good and to think only of what they could do and never of what they should get
none	none	 Many of them have ascended into the Shining Land and here I am in mine age gazing up alone Only waiting till the shadows Are a little longer grown Fifty years I was a young man not yet of age when I delivered my first platform lecture The Civil War of eighteen sixty one sixty five drew on with all its passions patriotism horrors and fears and I was studying law at Yale University 
4379-18040-0004	train-other-500	I had from childhood felt that I was called to the ministry The earliest event of memory is the prayer of my father at family prayers in the little old cottage in the Hampshire highlands of the Berkshire Hills
4379-18040-0005	train-other-500	calling on God with a sobbing voice to lead me into some special service for the Saviour It filled me with awe dread and fear and I recoiled from the thought until I determined to fight against it with all my power
none	none	 So I sought for other professions and for decent excuses for being anything but a preacher Yet while I was nervous and timid before the class in declamation and dreaded to face any kind of an audience I felt in my soul a strange impulsion toward public speaking which for years made me miserable The war and the public meetings for recruiting soldiers furnished an outlet 
4379-18040-0006	train-other-500	for my suppressed sense of duty and my first lecture was on the Lessons of History as applied to the campaigns against the Confederacy That matchless temperance orator and loving friend John B Gough introduced me
4379-18040-0007	train-other-500	to the little audience in Westfield Massachusetts in eighteen sixty two
none	none	 What a foolish little school boy speech it must have been But mister Gough s kind words of praise the bouquets and the applause made me feel that somehow 
4379-18040-0008	train-other-500	the way to public oratory would not be so hard as I had feared From that time I acted on mister Gough s advice and sought practice by accepting almost every invitation I received to speak
none	none	 on any kind of a subject 
4379-18040-0009	train-other-500	There were many sad failures and tears but it was a restful compromise with my conscience concerning the ministry and it pleased my friends I addressed picnics Sunday schools patriotic meetings funerals anniversaries
4379-18040-0010	train-other-500	commencements debates cattle shows and sewing circles without partiality and without price For the first five years the income was all experience Then voluntary gifts
4379-18040-0011	train-other-500	began to come occasionally in the shape of a jack knife a ham a book and the first cash remuneration was from a farmers club of seventy five cents toward the horse hire
4379-18040-0012	train-other-500	It was a curious fact that one member of that club afterward moved to Salt Lake City and was a member
none	none	 of the committee at the Mormon Tabernacle in eighteen seventy two 
4379-18040-0013	train-other-500	which when I was a correspondent on a journey around the world employed me to lecture on Men of the Mountains in the Mormon Tabernacle at a fee of five hundred dollars While I was gaining practice in the first years of platform work
4379-18040-0014	train-other-500	I had the good fortune to have profitable employment as a soldier or as a correspondent or lawyer or as an editor or as a preacher which enabled me to pay my own expenses
none	none	 and it has been seldom 
4379-18040-0015	train-other-500	in the fifty years that I have ever taken a fee for my personal use In the last thirty six years
none	none	 I have dedicated solemnly all the lecture income to benevolent enterprises If I am antiquated enough for an autobiography perhaps I may be aged enough to avoid the criticism of being an egotist when I state that some years I delivered one lecture Acres of Diamonds over two hundred times each year 
4379-18040-0016	train-other-500	at an average income of about one hundred and fifty dollars for each lecture It was a remarkable good fortune which came to me as a lecturer when mister James Redpath organized the first lecture bureau ever established
none	none	 mister Redpath was the biographer of John Brown of Harper s Ferry renown and as mister Brown had been long a friend of my father s I found employment 
4379-18040-0017	train-other-500	while a student on vacation in selling that life of John Brown That acquaintance with mister Redpath was maintained until mister Redpath s death
4379-18040-0018	train-other-500	To General Charles H Taylor with whom I was employed for a time as reporter for the Boston Daily Traveler I was indebted
4379-18040-0019	train-other-500	for many acts of self sacrificing friendship which soften my soul as I recall them He did me the greatest kindness when he suggested my name to mister Redpath as one who could fill in the vacancies in the smaller towns
none	none	 where the great lights could not always be secured What a glorious galaxy of great names that original list of Redpath lecturers contained Henry Ward Beecher John B Gough Senator Charles Sumner 
4379-18040-0020	train-other-500	Theodore Tilton Wendell Phillips missus Mary A Livermore Bayard Taylor Ralph Waldo Emerson
none	none	 with many of the great preachers musicians and writers of that remarkable 
4379-18040-0021	train-other-500	era Even doctor Holmes John Whittier Henry W Longfellow John Lothrop Motley George William Curtis and General Burnside were persuaded to appear one or more times
none	none	 although they refused to receive pay 
4379-18040-0022	train-other-500	I cannot forget how ashamed I felt when my name ap peared in the shadow of such names
none	none	 and how sure I was that every acquaintance was ridiculing me behind my back mister Bayard Taylor however wrote me from the Tribune office a kind note saying that he was glad to see me on the road to great usefulness Governor Clafflin of Massachusetts took the time to send me a note of congratulation 
4379-18040-0023	train-other-500	General Benjamin F Butler however advised me to stick to the last and be a good lawyer The work of lecturing was always a task and a duty I do not feel now that I ever sought to be an entertainer
none	none	 I am sure I would have been an utter failure 
4379-18040-0024	train-other-500	but for the feeling that I must preach some gospel truth in my lectures
none	none	 and do at least that much toward that ever persistent call of God When I entered the ministry eighteen seventy nine I had become so associated with the lecture platform in America and England that I could not feel justified in abandoning so great a field of usefulness The experiences of all our successful lecturers are probably nearly alike 
4379-18040-0025	train-other-500	The way is not always smooth But the hard roads the poor hotels the late trains the cold halls
none	none	 the hot church auditoriums the overkindness of hospitable committees and the broken hours of sleep are annoyances one soon forgets and the hosts of intelligent faces the messages of thanks and the effects of the earnings on the lives of young college men can never cease to be a daily joy God bless them all Often have I been asked 
4379-18040-0026	train-other-500	if I did not in fifty years of travel in all sorts of conveyances meet with accidents
none	none	 It is a marvel to me that no such event ever brought me harm In a continuous period of over twenty seven years I delivered about two lectures in every three days 
4379-18040-0027	train-other-500	yet I did not miss a single engagement Sometimes I had to hire a special train but I reached the town on time with only a rare exception and then I was but a few minutes late Accidents have preceded
4379-18040-0028	train-other-500	and followed me on trains and boats and were sometimes in sight but I was preserved without injury through all the years In the Johnstown flood region I saw a bridge go out behind our train I was once on a derelict steamer
none	none	 on the Atlantic 
4379-18040-0029	train-other-500	for twenty six days At another time a man was killed in the berth of a sleeper
none	none	 I had left half an hour before Often have I felt the train leave the track but no one was killed 
4379-18040-0030	train-other-500	Robbers have several times threatened my life
none	none	 but all came out without loss to me God and man have ever been patient with me Yet this period of lecturing 
4379-18040-0031	train-other-500	has been after all a side issue The Temple and its church in Philadelphia which when its membership was less than three thousand members for so many years contributed through its membership over sixty thousand dollars a year
4379-18040-0032	train-other-500	for the uplift of humanity has made life a continual surprise while the Samaritan Hospital s amazing growth
none	none	 and the Garretson Hospital s 
4379-18040-0033	train-other-500	dispensaries have been so continually ministering to the sick and poor and have done such skilful work for the tens of thousands who ask for their help each year that I have been made happy
4379-18040-0034	train-other-500	while away lecturing by the feeling that each hour and minute
none	none	 they were faithfully doing good Temple University which was founded only twenty seven years ago has already sent out into a higher income and nobler life 
4379-18040-0035	train-other-500	nearly a hundred thousand young men and women
none	none	 who could not probably have obtained an education in any other institution 
4379-18040-0036	train-other-500	The faithful self sacrificing faculty now numbering
none	none	 two hundred and fifty three professors have done the real work For that I can claim but little credit 
4379-18040-0037	train-other-500	and I mention the University here only to show that my fifty years on the lecture platform has necessarily been a side line of work My best known lecture Acres of Diamonds
none	none	 was a mere accidental address at first given before a reunion of my old 
4379-18040-0038	train-other-500	comrades of the Forty sixth Massachusetts Regiment which served in the Civil War
none	none	 and in which I was captain 
4379-18040-0039	train-other-500	I had no thought of giving the address again and even after it began to be called for
none	none	 by lecture committees I did not dream that I should live to deliver it as I now have done almost five thousand times What is the secret of its popularity I could never explain to myself or others I simply know that I always attempt to enthuse myself on each occasion with the idea that it is a special opportunity to do good and I interest myself in each community and apply the general principles with local illustrations The hand which now holds this pen must in the natural course of events soon cease to gesture on the platform and it is a sincere prayerful hope that this book will go on into the years doing increasing good for the aid of my brothers and sisters in the human family RUSSELL H CONWELL South Worthington Mass September one nineteen thirteen 
4379-18040-0040	train-other-500	Footnote one This is the most recent and complete form of the lecture It happened to be delivered in Philadelphia doctor Conwell s home city
none	none	 When he says right here in Philadelphia he means the home city town or village 
4379-18040-0041	train-other-500	of every reader of this book just as he would use the name of it
