EBOOK THE EVIL GUEST Produced by Suzanne Shell Beginners Projects Mary Meehan and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team The Evil Guest By J Sheridan LeFanu eighteen ninety five When Lust hath conceived it bringeth forth Sin and Sin when it is finished bringeth forth Death About sixty years ago and somewhat more than twenty miles from the ancient town of Chester in a southward direction there stood a large and even then an old fashioned mansion house It lay in the midst of a demesne of considerable extent and richly wooded with venerable timber but apart from the somber majesty of these giant groups and the varieties of the undulating ground on which they stood there was little that could be deemed attractive in the place A certain air of neglect and decay and an indescribable gloom and melancholy hung over it In darkness it seemed darker than any other tract when the moonlight fell upon its glades and hollows they looked spectral and awful with a sort of churchyard loneliness and even when the blush of the morning kissed its broad woodlands there was a melancholy in the salute that saddened rather than cheered the heart of the beholder This antique melancholy and neglected place we shall call for distinctness sake Gray Forest It was then the property of the younger son of a nobleman once celebrated for his ability and his daring but who had long since passed to that land where human wisdom and courage avail naught The representative of this noble house resided at the family mansion in Sussex and the cadet whose fortunes we mean to sketch in these pages lived upon the narrow margin of an encumbered income in a reserved and unsocial discontent deep among the solemn shadows of the old woods of Gray Forest The honorable Richard Marston was now somewhere between forty and fifty years of age perhaps nearer the latter he still however retained in an eminent degree the traits of manly beauty not the less remarkable for its unquestionably haughty and passionate character He had married a beautiful girl of good family but without much money somewhere about eighteen years before and two children a son and a daughter had been the fruit of this union The boy Harry Marston was at this time at Cambridge and his sister scarcely fifteen was at home with her parents and under the training of an accomplished governess who had been recommended to them by a noble relative of missus Marston She was a native of France but thoroughly mistress of the English language and except for a foreign accent which gave a certain prettiness to all she said she spoke it as perfectly as any native Englishwoman This young Frenchwoman was eminently handsome and attractive Expressive dark eyes a clear olive complexion small even teeth and a beautifully dimpling smile more perhaps than a strictly classic regularity of features were the secrets of her unquestionable influence at first sight upon the fancy of every man of taste who beheld her mister Marston s fortune never very large had been shattered by early dissipation Naturally of a proud and somewhat exacting temper he actively felt the mortifying consequences of his poverty The want of what he felt ought to have been his position and influence in the county in which he resided fretted and galled him and he cherished a resentful and bitter sense of every slight imaginary or real to which the same fruitful source of annoyance and humiliation had exposed him He held therefore but little intercourse with the surrounding gentry and that little not of the pleasantest possible kind for not being himself in a condition to entertain in that style which accorded with his own ideas of his station he declined as far as was compatible with good breeding all the proffered hospitalities of the neighborhood and from his wild and neglected park looked out upon the surrounding world in a spirit of moroseness and defiance very unlike indeed to that of neighborly good will In the midst however of many of the annoyances attendant upon crippled means he enjoyed a few of those shadowy indications of hereditary importance which are all the more dearly prized as the substantial accessories of wealth have disappeared The mansion in which he dwelt was though old fashioned imposing in its aspect and upon a scale unequivocally aristocratic its walls were hung with ancestral portraits and he managed to maintain about him a large and tolerably respectable staff of servants In addition to these he had his extensive demesne his deer park and his unrivalled timber wherewith to console himself and in the consciousness of these possessions he found some imperfect assuagement of those bitter feelings of suppressed scorn and resentment which a sense of lost station and slighted importance engendered mister Marston s early habits had unhappily been of a kind to aggravate rather than alleviate the annoyances incidental to reduced means He had been a gay man a voluptuary and a gambler His vicious tastes had survived the means of their gratification His love for his wife had been nothing more than one of those vehement and headstrong fancies which in self indulgent men sometimes result in marriage and which seldom outlive the first few months of that life long connection missus Marston was a gentle noble minded woman After agonies or disappointment which none ever suspected she had at length learned to submit in sad and gentle acquiescence to her fate Those feelings which had been the charm of her young days were gone and as she bitterly felt forever For them there was no recall they could not return and without complaint or reproach she yielded to what she felt was inevitable It was impossible to look at missus Marston and not to discern at a glance the ruin of a surpassingly beautiful woman a good deal wasted pale and chastened with a deep untold sorrow but still possessing the outlines both in face and form of that noble beauty and matchless grace which had made her in happier days the admired of all observers But equally impossible was it to converse with her for even a minute without hearing in the gentle and melancholy music of her voice the sad echoes of those griefs to which her early beauty had been sacrificed an undying sense of lost love and happiness departed never to come again One morning mister Marston had walked as was his custom when he expected the messenger who brought from the neighboring post office his letters some way down the broad straight avenue with its double rows of lofty trees at each side when he encountered the nimble emissary on his return He took the letter bag in silence It contained but two letters one addressed to Mademoiselle de Barras chez M Marston and the other to himself He took them both dismissed the messenger and opening that addressed to himself read as follows while he slowly retraced his steps towards the house Dear Richard I am a whimsical fellow as you doubtless remember and have lately grown they tell me rather hippish besides I do not know to which infirmity I am to attribute a sudden fancy that urges me to pay you a visit if you will admit me To say truth my dear Dick I wish to see a little of your part of the world and I will confess it en passant to see a little of you too I really wish to make acquaintance with your family and though they tell me my health is very much shaken I must say in self defense I am not a troublesome inmate I can perfectly take care of myself and need no nursing or caudling whatever Will you present this my petition to missus Marston and report her decision thereon to me Seriously I know that your house may be full or some other contretemps may make it impracticable for me just now to invade you If it be so tell me my dear Richard frankly as my movements are perfectly free and my time all my own so that I can arrange my visit to suit your convenience Yours c WYNSTON E BERKLEY P S Direct to me at Hotel in Chester as I shall probably be there by the time this reaches you Ill bred and pushing as ever quoth mister Marston angrily as he thrust the unwelcome letter into his pocket This fellow wallowing in wealth without one nearer relative on earth than I and associated more nearly still with me the pshaw not affection the recollections of early and intimate companionship leaves me unaided for years of desertion and suffering to the buffetings of the world and the troubles of all but overwhelming pecuniary difficulties and now with the cool confidence of one entitled to respect and welcome invites himself to my house Coming here he continued after a gloomy pause and still pacing slowly towards the house to collect amusing materials for next season s gossip stories about the married Benedick the bankrupt beau the outcast tenant of a Cheshire wilderness and as he said this he looked at the neglected prospect before him with an eye almost of hatred Aye to see the nakedness of the land is he coming but he shall be disappointed His money may buy him a cordial welcome at an inn but curse me if it shall purchase him a reception here He again opened and glanced through the letter Aye purposely put in such a way that I can t decline it without affronting him he continued doggedly Well then he has no one to blame but himself affronted he shall be I shall effectually put an end to this humorous excursion Egad it is rather hard if a man cannot keep his poverty to himself Sir Wynston Berkley was a baronet of large fortune a selfish fashionable man and an inveterate bachelor He and Marston had been schoolfellows and the violent and implacable temper of the latter had as little impressed his companion with feelings of regard as the frivolity and selfishness of the baronet had won the esteem of his relative As boys they had little in common upon which to rest the basis of a friendship or even a mutual liking Berkley was gay cold and satirical his cousin for cousins they were was jealous haughty and relentless Their negative disinclination to one another s society not unnaturally engendered by uncongenial and unamiable dispositions had for a time given place to actual hostility while the two young men were at Oxford In some intrigue Marston discovered in his cousin a too successful rival the consequence was a bitter and furious quarrel which but for the prompt and peremptory interference of friends Marston would undoubtedly have pushed to a bloody issue Time had however healed this rupture and the young men came to regard one another with the same feelings and eventually to re establish the same sort of cold and indifferent intimacy which had subsisted between them before their angry collision Under these circumstances whatever suspicion Marston might have felt on the receipt of the unexpected and indeed unaccountable proposal which had just reached him he certainly had little reason to complain of any violation of early friendship in the neglect with which Sir Wynston had hitherto treated him In deciding to decline his proposed visit however Marston had not consulted the impulses of spite or anger He knew the baronet well he knew that he cherished no good will towards him and that in the project which he had thus unexpectedly broached whatever indirect or selfish schemes might possibly be at the bottom of it no friendly feeling had ever mingled He was therefore resolved to avoid the trouble and the expense of a visit in all respects distasteful to him and in a gentlemanlike way but at the same time as the reader may suppose with very little anxiety as to whether or not his gay correspondent should take offence at his reply to decline once for all the proposed distinction With this resolution he entered the spacious and somewhat dilapidated mansion which called him master and entering a sitting room appropriated to his daughter s use he found her there in company with her beautiful French governess He kissed his child and saluted her young preceptress with formal courtesy Mademoiselle said he I have got a letter for you and Rhoda he continued addressing his pretty daughter bring this to your mother and say I request her to read it He gave her the letter he himself had just received and the girl tripped lightly away upon her mission Had he narrowly scrutinised the countenance of the fair Frenchwoman as she glanced at the direction of that which he had just placed in her hand he might have seen certain transient but very unmistakable evidences of excitement and agitation She quickly concealed the letter however and with a sigh the momentary flush which it had called to her cheek subsided and she was tranquil as usual mister Marston remained for some minutes five eight or ten we cannot say precisely pretty much where he had stood on first entering the chamber doubtless awaiting the return of his messenger or the appearance of his wife At length however he left the room himself to seek her but during his brief stay his previous resolution had been removed By what influence we cannot say but removed completely it unquestionably was and a final determination that Sir Wynston Berkley should become his guest had fixedly taken its place As Marston walked along the passages which led from this room he encountered missus Marston and his daughter Well said he you have read Wynston s letter Yes she replied returning it to him and what answer Richard do you purpose giving him She was about to hazard a conjecture but checked herself remembering that even so faint an evidence of a disposition to advise might possibly be resented by her cold and imperious lord I have considered it and decided to receive him he replied Ah I am afraid that is I hope he may find our housekeeping such as he can enjoy she said with an involuntary expression of surprise for she had scarcely had a doubt that her husband would have preferred evading the visit of his fine friend under his gloomy circumstances If our modest fare does not suit him said Marston with sullen bitterness he can depart as easily as he came We poor gentlemen can but do our best I have thought it over and made up my mind And how soon my dear Richard do you intend fixing his arrival she inquired with the natural uneasiness of one upon whom in an establishment whose pretensions considerably exceeded its resources the perplexing cares of housekeeping devolved Why as soon as he pleases replied he I suppose you can easily have his room prepared by tomorrow or next day I shall write by this mail and tell him to come down at once Having said this in a cold decisive way he turned and left her as it seemed not caring to be teased with further questions He took his solitary way to a distant part of his wild park where far from the likelihood of disturbance or intrusion he was often wont to amuse himself for the live long day in the sedentary sport of shooting rabbits And there we leave him for the present signifying to the distant inmates of his house the industrious pursuit of his unsocial occupation by the dropping fire that sullenly from hour to hour echoed from the remote woods missus Marston issued her orders and having set on foot all the necessary preparations for so unwonted an event as a stranger s visit of some duration she betook herself to her little boudoir the scene of many an hour of patient but bitter suffering unseen by human eye and unknown except to the just Searcher of hearts to whom belongs mercy and vengeance missus Marston had but two friends to whom she had ever spoken upon the subject nearest her heart the estrangement of her husband a sorrow to which even time had failed to reconcile her From her children this grief was carefully concealed To them she never uttered the semblance of a complaint Anything that could by possibility have reflected blame or dishonor upon their father she would have perished rather than have allowed them so much as to suspect The two friends who did understand her feelings though in different degrees were one a good and venerable clergyman the reverend Doctor Danvers a frequent visitor and occasional guest at Gray Forest where his simple manners and unaffected benignity and tenderness of heart had won the love of all with the exception of its master and commanded even his respect The second was no other than the young French governess Mademoiselle de Barras in whose ready sympathy and consolatory counsels she found no small happiness The society of this young lady had indeed become next to that of her daughter her greatest comfort and pleasure Mademoiselle de Barras was of a noble though ruined French family and a certain nameless elegance and dignity attested spite of her fallen condition the purity of her descent She was accomplished possessed of that fine perception and sensitiveness and that ready power of self adaptation to the peculiarities and moods of others which we term tact and was moreover gifted with a certain natural grace and manners the most winning imaginable In short she was a fascinating companion and when the melancholy circumstances of her own situation and the sad history of her once rich and noble family were taken into account with her striking attractions of person and air the combination of all these associations and impressions rendered her one of the most interesting persons that could well be imagined The circumstances of Mademoiselle de Barras s history and descent seemed to warrant on missus Marston s part a closer intimacy and confidence than usually subsists between parties mutually occupying such a relation missus Marston had hardly established herself in this little apartment when a light foot approached a gentle tap was given at the door and Mademoiselle de Barras entered Ah mademoiselle so kind such pretty flowers Pray sit down said the lady with a sweet and grateful smile as she took from the tapered fingers of the foreigner the little bouquet which she had been at the pains to gather Mademoiselle sat down and gently took the lady s hand and kissed it A small matter will overflow a heart charged with sorrow a chance word a look some little office of kindness and so it was with mademoiselle s bouquet and gentle kiss missus Marston s heart was touched her eyes filled with bright tears she smiled gratefully upon her fair and humble companion and as she smiled her tears overflowed and she wept in silence for some minutes My poor mademoiselle she said at last you are so very very kind Mademoiselle said nothing she lowered her eyes and pressed the poor lady s hand Apparently to interrupt an embarrassing silence and to give a more cheerful tone to their little interview the governess in a gay tone on a sudden said And so madame we are to have a visitor Miss Rhoda tells me a baronet is he not Yes indeed mademoiselle Sir Wynston Berkley a gay London gentleman and a cousin of mister Marston s she replied Ha a cousin exclaimed the young lady with a little more surprise in her tone than seemed altogether called for a cousin oh then that is the reason of his visit Do pray madame tell me all about him I am so much afraid of strangers and what you call men of the world Oh dear missus Marston I am not worthy to be here and he will see all that in a moment indeed indeed I am afraid Pray tell me all about him She said this with a simplicity which made the elder lady smile and while mademoiselle re adjusted the tiny flowers which formed the bouquet she had just presented to her missus Marston good naturedly recounted to her all she knew of Sir Wynston Berkley which in substance amounted to no more than we have already stated When she concluded the young Frenchwoman continued for some time silent still busy with her flowers But suddenly she heaved a deep sigh and shook her head You seem disquieted mademoiselle said missus Marston in a tone of kindness I am thinking madame she said still looking upon the flowers which she was adjusting and again sighing profoundly I am thinking of what you said to me a week ago alas I do not remember what it was my good mademoiselle nothing I am sure that ought to grieve you at least nothing that was intended to have that effect replied the lady in a tone of gentle encouragement No not intended madame said the young Frenchwoman sorrowfully Well what was it Perhaps you misunderstood perhaps I can explain what I said replied missus Marston affectionately Ah madame you think you think I am unlucky answered the young lady slowly and faintly Unlucky Dear mademoiselle you surprise me rejoined her companion I mean what I mean is this madame you date unhappiness if not its beginning at least its great aggravation and increase she answered dejectedly from the time of my coming here madame and though I know you are too good to dislike me on that account yet I must in your eyes be ever connected with calamity and look like an ominous thing Dear mademoiselle allow no such thought to enter your mind You do me great wrong indeed you do said missus Marston laying her hand upon the young lady s kindly There was a silence for a little time and the elder lady resumed I remember now what you allude to dear mademoiselle the increased estrangement the widening separation which severs me from one unutterably dear to me the first and bitter disappointment of my life which seems to grow more hopelessly incurable day by day missus

none	none	and after a brief silence the governess said I am very superstitious myself dear madame and I thought I must have seemed to you an inauspicious inmate in short unlucky as I have said and the thought made me very unhappy so unhappy that I was going to leave you madame I may now tell you frankly going away but you have set my doubts at rest and I am quite happy again Dear mademoiselle cried the lady tenderly and rising as she spake to kiss the cheek of her humble friend never never speak of this again God knows I have too few friends on earth to spare the kindest and tenderest among them all No no You little think what comfort I have found in your warm hearted and ready sympathy and how dearly I prize your affection my poor mademoiselle The young Frenchwoman rose with downcast eyes and a dimpling happy smile and as missus Marston drew her affectionately toward her and kissed her she timidly returned the embrace of her kind patroness For a moment her graceful arms encircled her and she whispered to her Dear madame how happy how very happy you make me Had Ithuriel touched with his spear the beautiful young woman thus for a moment as it seemed lost in a trance of gratitude and love would that angelic form have stood the test unscathed A spectator marking the scene might have observed a strange gleam in her eyes a strange expression in her face an influence for a moment not angelic like a shadow of some passing spirit cross her visibly as she leaned over the gentle lady s neck and murmured Dear madame how happy how very happy you make me Such a spectator as he looked at that gentle lady might have seen for one dreamy moment a lithe and painted serpent coiled round and round and hissing in her ear A few minutes more and mademoiselle was in the solitude of her own apartment She shut and bolted the door and taking from her desk the letter which she had that morning received threw herself into an armchair and studied the document profoundly Her actual revision and scrutiny of the letter itself was interrupted by long intervals of profound abstraction and after a full hour thus spent she locked it carefully up again and with a clear brow and a gay smile rejoined her pretty pupil for a walk We must now pass over an interval of a few days and come at once to the arrival of Sir Wynston Berkley which duly occurred upon the evening of the day appointed The baronet descended from his chaise but a short time before the hour at which the little party which formed the family at Gray Forest were wont to assemble for the social meal of supper A few minutes devoted to the mysteries of the toilet with the aid of an accomplished valet enabled him to appear as he conceived without disadvantage at this domestic reunion Sir Wynston Berkley was a particularly gentleman like person He was rather tall and elegantly made with gay easy manners and something indefinably aristocratic in his face which however was a little more worn than his years would have strictly accounted for But Sir Wynston had been a roue and spite of the cleverest possible making up the ravages of excess were very traceable in the lively beau of fifty Perfectly well dressed and with a manner that was ease and gaiety itself he was at home from the moment he entered the room Of course anything like genuine cordiality was out of the question but mister Marston embraced his relative with perfect good breeding and the baronet appeared determined to like everybody and be pleased with everything He had not been five minutes in the parlor chatting gaily with mister and missus Marston and their pretty daughter when Mademoiselle de Barras entered the room As she moved towards missus Marston Sir Wynston rose and observing her with evident admiration said in an undertone inquiringly to Marston who was beside him And this That is Mademoiselle de Barras my daughter s governess and missus Marston s companion said Marston drily Ha said Sir Wynston I thought you were but three at home just now and I was right Your son is at Cambridge I heard so from our old friend Jack Manbury Jack has his boy there too Egad Dick it seems but last week that you and I were there together Yes said Marston looking gloomily into the fire as if he saw in its smoke and flicker the phantoms of murdered time and opportunity but I hate looking back Wynston The past is to me but a medley of ill luck and worse management Why what an ungrateful dog you are returned Sir Wynston gaily turning his back upon the fire and glancing round the spacious and handsome though somewhat faded apartment I was on the point of congratulating you on the possession of the finest park and noblest demesne in Cheshire when you begin to grumble Egad Dick all I can say to your complaint is that I don t pity you and there are dozens who may honestly envy you that is all In spite of this cheering assurance Marston remained sullenly silent Supper however had now been served and the little party assumed their places at the table I am sorry Wynston I have no sport of any kind to offer you here said Marston except indeed some good trout fishing if you like it I have three miles of excellent fishing at your command My dear fellow I am a mere cockney rejoined Sir Wynston I am not a sportsman I never tried it and should not like to begin now No Dick what I much prefer is abundance of your fresh air and the enjoyment of your scenery When I was at Rouen three years ago Ha Rouen Mademoiselle will feel an interest in that it is her birth place interrupted Marston glancing at the Frenchwoman Yes Rouen ah yes said mademoiselle with very evident embarrassment Sir Wynston appeared for a moment a little disconcerted too but rallied speedily and pursued his detail of his doings at that fair town of Normandy Marston knew Sir Wynston well and he rightly calculated that whatever effect his experience of the world might have had in intensifying his selfishness or hardening his heart it certainly could have had none in improving a character originally worthless and unfeeling He knew moreover that his wealthy cousin was gifted with a great deal of that small cunning which is available for masking the little scheming of frivolous and worldly men and that Sir Wynston never took trouble of any kind without a sufficient purpose having its center in his own personal gratification This visit greatly puzzled Marston it gave him even a vague sense of uneasiness Could there exist any flaw in his own title to the estate of Gray Forest He had an unpleasant doubtful sort of remembrance of some apprehensions of this kind when he was but a child having been whispered in the family Could this really be so and could the baronet have been led to make this unexpected visit merely for the purpose of personally examining into the condition or a property of which he was about to become the legal invader The nature of this suspicion affords at all events a fair gauge of Marston s estimate of his cousin s character And as he revolved these doubts from time to time and as he thought of Mademoiselle de Barras s transient but unaccountable embarrassment at the mention of Rouen by Sir Wynston an embarrassment which the baronet himself appeared for a moment to reciprocate undefined glimmering suspicions of another kind flickered through the darkness of his mind He was effectually puzzled his surmises and conjectures baffled and he more than half repented that he had acceded to his cousin s proposal and admitted him as an inmate of his house Although Sir Wynston comported himself as if he were conscious of being the very most welcome visitor who could possibly have established himself at Gray Forest he was doubtless fully aware of the real feelings with which he was regarded by his host If he had in reality an object in prolonging his stay and wished to make the postponement of his departure the direct interest of his entertainer he unquestionably took effectual measures for that purpose The little party broke up every evening at about ten o clock and Sir Wynston retired to his chamber at the same hour He found little difficulty in inducing Marston to amuse him there with a quiet game of piquet In his own room therefore in the luxurious ease of dressing gown and slippers he sat at cards with his host often until an hour or two past midnight Sir Wynston was exorbitantly wealthy and very reckless in expenditure The stakes for which they played although they gradually became in reality pretty heavy were in his eyes a very unimportant consideration Marston on the other hand was poor and played with the eye of a lynx and the appetite of a shark The ease and perfect good humor with which Sir Wynston lost were not unimproved by his entertainer who as may readily be supposed was not sorry to reap this golden harvest provided without the slightest sacrifice on his part of pride or independence If indeed he sometimes suspected that his guest was a little more anxious to lose than to win he was also quite resolved not to perceive it but calmly persisted in night after night giving Sir Wynston as he termed it his revenge or in other words treating him to a repetition of his losses All this was very agreeable to Marston who began to treat his visitor with at all events more external cordiality and distinction than at first An incident however occurred which disturbed these amicable relations in an unexpected way It becomes necessary here to mention that Mademoiselle de Barras s sleeping apartment opened from a long corridor It was en suite with two dressing rooms each opening also upon the corridor but wholly unused and unfurnished Some five or six other apartments also opened at either side upon the same passage These little local details being premised it so happened that one day Marston who had gone out with the intention of angling in the trout stream which flowed through his park though at a considerable distance from the house having unexpectedly returned to procure some tackle which he had forgotten was walking briskly through the corridor in question to his own apartment when to his surprise the door of one of the deserted dressing rooms of which we have spoken was cautiously pushed open and Sir Wynston Berkley issued from it Marston was almost beside him as he did so and Sir Wynston made a motion as if about instinctively to draw back again and at the same time the keen ear of his host distinctly caught the sound of rustling silks and a tiptoe tread hastily withdrawing from the deserted chamber Sir Wynston looked nearly as much confused as a man of the world can look Marston stopped short and scanned his visitor for a moment with a very peculiar expression You have caught me peeping Dick I am an inveterate explorer said the baronet with an effectual effort to shake off his embarrassment An open door in a fine old house is a temptation which That door is usually closed and ought to be kept so interrupted Marston drily there is nothing whatever to be seen in the room but dust and cobwebs Pardon me said Sir Wynston more easily you forget the view from the window Aye the view to be sure there is a good view from it said Marston with as much of his usual manner as he could resume so soon and at the same time carelessly opening the door again he walked in accompanied by Sir Wynston and both stood at the window together looking out in silence upon a prospect which neither of them saw Yes I do think it is a good view said Marston and as he turned carelessly away he darted a swift glance round the chamber The door opening toward the French lady s apartment was closed but not actually shut This was enough and as they left the room Marston repeated his invitation to his guest to accompany him but in a tone which showed that he scarcely followed the meaning of what he himself was saying He walked undecidedly toward his own room then turned and went down stairs In the hall he met his pretty child Ha Rhoda said he you have not been out today No papa but it is so very fine I think I shall go now Yes go and mademoiselle can accompany you Do you hear Rhoda mademoiselle goes with you and you had better go at once A few minutes more and Marston from the parlor window beheld Rhoda and the elegant French girl walking together towards the woodlands He watched them gloomily himself unseen until the crowding underwood concealed their receding figures Then with a sigh he turned and reascended the great staircase I shall sift this mystery to the bottom thought he I shall foil the conspirators if so they be with their own weapons art with art chicane with chicane duplicity with duplicity He was now in the long passage which we have just spoken of and glancing back and before him to ascertain that no chance eye discerned him he boldly entered mademoiselle s chamber Her writing desk lay upon the table It was locked and coolly taking it in his hands Marston carried it into his own room bolted his chamber door and taking two or three bunches of keys he carefully tried nearly a dozen in succession and when almost despairing of success at last found one which fitted the lock turned and opened the desk Sustained throughout his dishonorable task by some strong and angry passion the sight of the open escritoire checked and startled him for a moment Violated privilege invaded secrecy base perfidious espionage upbraided and stigmatized him as the intricacies of the outraged sanctuary opened upon his intrusive gaze He felt for a moment shocked and humbled He was impelled to lock and replace the desk where he had originally found it without having effected his meditated treason but this hesitation was transient the fiery and reckless impulse which had urged him to the act returned to enforce its consummation With a guilty eye and eager hands he searched the contents of this tiny repository of the fair Norman s written secrets Ha the very thing he muttered as he detected the identical letter which he himself had handed to Mademoiselle de Barras but a few days before The handwriting struck me ill disguised I thought I knew it we shall see He had opened the letter it contained but a few lines he held his breath while he read it First he grew pale then a shadow came over his face and then another and another darker and darker shade upon shade as if an exhalation from the pit was momentarily blackening the air about him He said nothing there was but one long gentle sigh and in his face a mortal sternness as he folded the letter again replaced it and locked the desk Of course when Mademoiselle de Barras returned from her accustomed walk she found everything in her room to all appearances undisturbed and just as when she left it While this young lady was making her toilet for the evening and while Sir Wynston Berkley was worrying himself with conjectures as to whether Marston s evil looks when he encountered him that morning in the passage existed only in his own fancy or were in good truth very grim and significant realities Marston himself was striding alone through the wildest and darkest solitudes of his park haunted by his own unholy thoughts and it may be by those other evil and unearthly influences which wander as we know in desert places Darkness overtook him and the chill of night in these lonely tracts In his solitary walk what fearful company had he been keeping As the shades of night deepened round him the sense of the neighborhood of ill the consciousness of the foul fancies or which where he was now treading he had been for hours the sport oppressed him with a vague and unknown terror a certain horror of the thoughts which had been his comrades through the day which he could not now shake off and which haunted him with a ghastly and defiant pertinacity scared while they half enraged him He stalked swiftly homewards like a guilty man pursued Marston was not perfectly satisfied though very nearly with the evidence now in his possession The letter the stolen perusal of which had so agitated him that day bore no signature but independently of the handwriting which seemed spite of the constraint of an attempted disguise to be familiar to his eye there existed in the matter of the letter short as it was certain internal evidences which although not actually conclusive raised in conjunction with all the other circumstances a powerful presumption in aid of his suspicions He resolved however to sift the matter further and to bide his time Meanwhile his manner must indicate no trace of his dark surmises and bitter thoughts Deception in its two great branches simulation and dissimulation was easy to him His habitual reserve and gloom would divest any accidental and momentary disclosure of his inward trouble of everything suspicious or unaccountable which would have characterized such displays and eccentricities in another man His rapid and reckless ramble a kind of physical vent for the paroxysm which had so agitated him throughout the greater part of the day had soiled and disordered his dress and thus had helped to give to his whole appearance a certain air of haggard wildness which in the privacy of his chamber he hastened carefully and entirely to remove At supper Marston was apparently in unusually good spirits Sir Wynston and he chatted gaily and fluently upon many subjects grave and gay Among them the inexhaustible topic of popular superstition happened to turn up and especially the subject of strange prophecies of the fates and fortunes of individuals singularly fulfilled in the events of their afterlife By the by Dick this is rather a nervous topic for me to discuss said Sir Wynston How so asked his host Why don t you remember urged the baronet No I don t recollect what you allude to replied Marston in all sincerity Why don t you remember Eton pursued Sir Wynston Yes to be sure said Marston Well continued his visitor Well I really don t recollect the prophecy replied Marston What do you forget the gypsy who predicted that you were to murder me Dick eh Ah ha ha laughed Marston with a start Don t you remember it now urged his companion Ah why yes I believe I do said Marston but another prophecy was running in my mind a gypsy prediction too At Ascot do you recollect the girl told me I was to be Lord Chancellor of England and a duke besides Well Dick rejoined Sir Wynston merrily if both are to be fulfilled or neither I trust you may never sit upon the woolsack of England The party soon after broke up Sir Wynston and his host as usual to pass some hours at piquet and missus Marston as was her wont to spend some time in her own boudoir over notes and accounts and the worrying details of housekeeping While thus engaged she was disturbed by a respectful tap at her door and an elderly servant who had been for many years in the employment of mister Marston presented himself Well Merton do you want anything asked the lady Yes ma am please I want to give warning I wish to leave the service ma am replied he respectfully but doggedly To leave us Merton echoed his mistress both surprised and sorry for the man had been long her servant and had been much liked and trusted Yes ma am he repeated And why do you wish to do so Merton Has anything occurred to make the place unpleasant to you urged the lady No ma am no indeed said he earnestly I have nothing to complain of nothing indeed ma am Perhaps you think you can do better if you leave us suggested his mistress No indeed ma am I have no such thought he said and seemed on the point of bursting into tears but but somehow ma am there is something come over me lately and I can t help but think if I stay here ma am some some misfortune will happen to us all and that is the truth ma am This is very foolish Merton a mere childish fancy replied missus Marston you like your place and have no better prospect before you and now for a mere superstitious fancy you propose giving it up and leaving us No no Merton you had better think the matter over and if you still upon reflection prefer going away you can then speak to your master Thank you ma am God bless you said the man withdrawing missus Marston rang the bell for her maid and retired to her room Has anything occurred lately she asked to annoy Merton No ma am I don t know of anything but he is very changed indeed of late replied the maid He has not been quarreling inquired she Oh no ma am he never quarrels he is very quiet and keeps to himself always he thinks a wonderful deal of himself replied the servant But you said that he is much changed did you not continued the lady for there was something strangely excited and unpleasant in the man s manner in this little interview which struck missus Marston and alarmed her curiosity He had seemed like one charged with some horrible secret intolerable and which he yet dared not reveal What proceeded missus Marston is the nature of the change of which you speak Why ma am he is like one frightened and in sorrow she replied he will sit silent and now and then shaking his head as if he wanted to get rid of something that is teasing him for an hour together Poor man said she And then when we are at meals he will all on a sudden get up and leave the table and Jem Boulter that sleeps in the next room to him says that almost as often as he looks through the little window between the two rooms no matter what hour in the night he sees mister Merton on his knees by the bedside praying or crying he don t know which but any way he is not happy poor man and that is plain enough It is very strange said the lady after a pause but I think and hope after all it will prove to have been no more than a little nervousness Well ma am I do hope it is not his conscience that is coming against him now said the maid We have no reason to suspect anything of the kind said missus Marston gravely quite the reverse he has been always a particularly proper man Oh indeed responded the attendant goodness forbid I should say or think anything against him but I could not help telling you my mind ma am meaning no harm And how long is it since you observed this sad change in poor Merton persisted the lady Not indeed to say very long ma am replied the girl somewhere about a week or very little more at least as we remarked ma am missus Marston pursued her inquiries no further that night But although she affected to treat the matter thus lightly it had somehow taken a painful hold upon her imagination and left in her mind those undefinable and ominous sensations which in certain mental temperaments seem to foreshadow the approach of unknown misfortune For two or three days everything went on smoothly and pretty much as usual At the end of this brief interval however the attention of missus Marston was recalled to the subject of her servant s mysterious anxiety to leave and give up his situation Merton again stood before her and repeated the intimation he had already given Really Merton this is very odd said the lady You like your situation and yet you persist in desiring to leave it What am I to think Oh ma am said he I am unhappy I am tormented ma am I can t tell you ma am I can t indeed ma am If anything weighs upon your mind Merton I would advise you to consult our good clergyman doctor Danvers urged the lady The servant hung his head and mused for a time gloomily and then said decisively No ma am no use And pray Merton how long is it since you first entertained this desire asked missus Marston Since Sir Wynston Berkley came ma am answered he Has Sir Wynston annoyed you in any way continued she Far from it ma am he replied he is a very kind gentleman Well his man then is he a respectable inoffensive person she inquired I never met one more so said the man promptly and raising his head What I wish to know is whether your desire to go is connected with Sir Wynston and his servant said missus Marston The man hesitated and shifted his position uneasily You need not answer Merton if you don t wish it she said kindly Why ma am yes it has something to say to them both he replied with some agitation I really cannot understand this said she Merton hesitated for some time and appeared much troubled It was something ma am something that Sir Wynston s man said to me and there it is out he said at last with an effort Well Merton said she I won t press you further but I must say that as this communication whatever it may be has caused you unquestionably very great uneasiness it seems to me but probable that it affects the safety or the interests of some person I cannot say of whom and if so there can be no doubt that it is your duty to acquaint those who are so involved in the disclosure with its purport No ma am there is nothing in what I heard that could touch anybody but myself It was nothing but what others heard without remarking it or thinking about it I can t tell you anymore ma am but I am very unhappy and uneasy in my mind As the man said this he began to weep bitterly The idea that his mind was affected now seriously occurred to missus Marston and she resolved to convey her suspicions to her husband and to leave him to deal with the case as to him should seem good Don t agitate yourself so Merton I shall speak to your master upon what you have said and you may rely upon it that no surmise to the prejudice of your character has entered my mind said missus Marston very kindly Oh ma am you are too good sobbed the poor man vehemently You don t know me ma am I never knew myself till lately I am a miserable man I am frightened at myself ma am frightened terribly Christ knows it would be well for me I was dead this minute I am very sorry for your unhappiness Merton said missus Marston and especially that I can do nothing to alleviate it I can but speak as I have said to your master and he will give you your discharge and arrange whatever else remains to be done God bless you ma am said the servant still much agitated and left her mister Marston usually passed the early part of the day in active exercise and she supposing that he was in all probability at that moment far from home went to mademoiselle s chamber which was at the other end of the spacious house to confer with her in the interval upon the strange application thus urged by poor Merton Just as she reached the door of Mademoiselle de Barras s chamber she heard voices within exerted in evident excitement She stopped in amazement They were those of her husband and mademoiselle Startled confounded and amazed she pushed open the door and entered Her husband was sitting one hand clutched upon the arm of the chair he occupied and the other extended and clenched as it seemed with the emphasis of rage upon the desk that stood upon the table His face was darkened with the stormiest passions and his gaze was fixed upon the Frenchwoman who was standing with a look half guilty half imploring at a little distance There was something to missus Marston so utterly unexpected and even so shocking in this tableau that she stood for some seconds pale and breathless and gazing with a vacant stare of fear and horror from her husband to the French girl and from her to her husband again The three figures in this strange group remained fixed silent and aghast for several seconds missus Marston endeavored to speak but though her lips moved no sound escaped her and from very weakness she sank half fainting into a chair Marston rose throwing as he did so a guilty and furious glance at the young Frenchwoman and walked a step or two toward the door he hesitated however and turned just as mademoiselle bursting into tears threw her arms round missus Marston s neck and passionately exclaimed Protect me madame I implore from the insults and suspicions of your husband Marston stood a little behind his wife and he and the governess exchanged a glance of keen significance as the latter sank sobbing like an injured child into its mother s embrace upon the poor lady s tortured bosom Madame madame he says mister Marston says I have presumed to give you advice and to meddle and to interfere that I am endeavoring to make you despise his authority Madame speak for me Say madame have I ever done so say madame am I the cause of bitterness and contumacy Ah mon Dieu c est trop it is too much madame I shall go I must go madame Why ah why did I stay for this As she thus spoke mademoiselle again burst into a paroxysm of weeping and again the same significant glance was interchanged Go yes you shall go said Marston striding toward the window I will have no whispering or conspiring in my house I have heard of your confidences and consultations missus Marston I meant to have done this quietly he continued addressing his wife I meant to have given Mademoiselle de Barras my opinion and her dismissal without your assistance but it seems you wish to interpose You are sworn friends and never fail one another of course at a pinch I take it for granted that I owe your presence at our interview which I am resolved shall be as respects mademoiselle a final one to a message from that intriguing young lady eh I have had no message Richard said missus Marston I don t know do tell me for God s sake what is all this about And as the poor lady thus spoke her overwrought feelings found vent in a violent flood of tears Yes madame that is the question I have asked him frequently what is all this anger all these reproaches about what have I done interposed mademoiselle with indignant vehemence standing erect and viewing Marston with a flashing eye and a flushed cheek Yes I am called conspirator meddler intrigant Ah madame it is intolerable But what have I done Richard urged the poor lady stunned and bewildered how have I offended you Yes yes continued the Frenchwoman with angry volubility what has she done that you call contumacy and disrespect Yes dear madame there is the question and if he cannot answer is it not most cruel to call me conspirator and spy and intrigant because I talk to my dear madame who is my only friend in this place Mademoiselle de Barras I need no declamation from you and pardon me missus Marston nor from you either retorted he I have my information from one on whom I can rely let that suffice Of course you are both agreed in a story I dare say you are ready to swear you never so much as canvassed my conduct and my coldness and estrangement eh These are the words are not they I have done you no wrong sir madame can tell you I am no mischief maker no I never was such a thing Was I madame persisted the governess bear witness for me I have told you my mind Mademoiselle de Barras interrupted Marston I will have no altercation if you please I think missus Marston we have had enough of this may I accompany you hence So saying he took the poor lady s passive hand and led her from the room Mademoiselle stood in the center of the apartment alone erect with heaving breast and burning cheek beautiful thoughtful guilty the very type of the fallen angelic There for a time her heart all confusion her mind darkened we must leave her various courses before her and as yet without resolution to choose among them a lost spirit borne on the eddies of the storm fearless and self reliant but with no star to guide her on her dark malign and forlorn way missus Marston in her own room reviewed the agitating scene through which she had just been so unexpectedly carried The tremendous suspicion which at the first disclosure of the tableau we have described smote the heart and brain of the poor lady with the stun of a thunderbolt had been indeed subsequently disturbed and afterwards contradicted but the shock of her first impression remained still upon her mind and heart She felt still through every nerve the vibrations of that maddening terror and despair which had overcome her senses for a moment The surprise the shock the horror outlived the obliterating influence of what followed She was in this agitation when Mademoiselle de Barras entered her chamber resolved with all her art to second and support the success of her prompt measures in the recent critical emergency She had come she said to bid her dear madame farewell for she was resolved to go Her own room had been invaded that insult and reproach might be heaped upon her how utterly unmerited missus Marston knew She had been called by every foul name which applied to the spy and the maligner she could not bear it Some one had evidently been endeavoring to procure her removal and had but too effectually succeeded Mademoiselle was determined to go early the next morning nothing should prevent or retard her departure her resolution was taken In this strain did mademoiselle run on but in a subdued and melancholy tone and weeping profusely The wild and ghastly suspicions which had for a moment flashed terribly upon the mind of missus Marston had faded away under the influences of reason and reflection although indeed much painful excitement still remained before Mademoiselle de Barras had visited her room Marston s temper she knew but too well it was violent bitter and impetuous and though he cared little if at all for her she had ever perceived that he was angrily jealous of the slightest intimacy or confidence by which any other than himself might establish an influence over her mind That he had learned the subject of some of her most interesting conversations with mademoiselle she could not doubt for he had violently upbraided that young lady in her presence with having discussed it and here now was mademoiselle herself taking refuge with her from galling affront and unjust reproach incensed wounded and weeping The whole thing was consistent all the circumstances bore plainly in the same direction the evidence was conclusive and missus Marston s thoughts and feelings respecting her fair young confidante quickly found their old level and flowed on tranquilly and sadly in their accustomed channel While Mademoiselle de Barras was thus with the persevering industry of the spider repairing the meshes which a chance breath had shattered she would perhaps have been in her turn shocked and startled could she have glanced into Marston s mind and seen in what was passing there the real extent of her danger Marston was walking as usual alone and in the most solitary region of his lonely park One hand grasped his walking stick not to lean upon it but as if it were the handle of a battle axe the other was buried in his bosom his dark face looked upon the ground and he strode onward with a slow but energetic step which had the air of deep resolution He found himself at last in a little churchyard lying far among the wild forest of his demesne and in the midst of which covered with ivy and tufted plants now ruddy with autumnal tints stood the ruined walls of a little chapel In the dilapidated vault close by lay buried many of his ancestors and under the little wavy hillocks of fern and nettles slept many an humble villager He sat down upon a worn tombstone in this lowly ruin and with his eyes fixed upon the ground he surrendered his spirit to the stormy and evil thoughts which he had invited Long and motionless he sat there while his foul fancies and schemes began to assume shape and order The wind rushing through the ivy roused him for a moment and as he raised his gloomy eye it alighted accidentally upon a skull which some wanton hand had fixed in a crevice of the wall He averted his glance quickly but almost as quickly refixed his gaze upon the impassive symbol of death with an expression glowering and contemptuous and with an angry gesture struck it down among the weeds with his stick He left the place and wandered on through the woods Men can t control the thoughts that flit across their minds he muttered as he went along anymore than they can direct the shadows of the clouds that sail above them They come and pass and leave no stain behind What then of omens and that wretched effigy of death Stuff pshaw Murder indeed I m incapable of murder I have drawn my sword upon a man in fair duel but murder Out upon the thought out upon it He stamped upon the ground with a pang at once of fury and horror He walked on a little stopped again and folding his arms leaned against an ancient tree Mademoiselle de Barras vous etes une traitresse and you shall go Yes go you shall you have deceived me and we must part He said this with melancholy bitterness and after a pause continued I will have no other revenge No though I dare say she will care but little for this very little if at all And then as to the other person he resumed after a pause it is not the first time he has acted like a trickster He has crossed me before and I will choose an opportunity to tell him my mind I won t mince matters with him either and will not spare him one insulting syllable that he deserves He wears a sword and so do I if he pleases he may draw it he shall have the opportunity but at all events I will make it impossible for him to prolong his disgraceful visit at my house On reaching home and his own study the servant Merton presented himself and his master too deeply excited to hear him then appointed the next day for the purpose There was no contending against Marston s peremptory will and the man reluctantly withdrew Here was apparently a matter of no imaginable moment whether this menial should be discharged on that day or on the morrow and yet mighty things were involved in the alternative There was a deeper gloom than usual over the house The servants seemed to know that something had gone wrong and looked grave and mysterious Marston was more than ever dark and moody missus Marston s dimmed and swollen eyes showed that she had been weeping Mademoiselle absented herself from supper on the plea of a bad headache Rhoda saw that something she knew not what had occurred to agitate her elders and was depressed and anxious The old clergyman whom we have already mentioned had called and stayed to supper doctor Danvers was a man of considerable learning strong sense and remarkable simplicity of character His thoughtful blue eye and well marked countenance were full of gentleness and benevolence and elevated by a certain natural dignity of which purity and goodness without one debasing shade of self esteem and arrogance were the animating spirit missus Marston loved and respected this good minister of God and many a time had sought and found in his gentle and earnest counsels and in the overflowing tenderness of his sympathy much comfort and support in the progress of her sore and protracted earthly trial Most especially at one critical period in her history had he endeared himself to her by interposing and successfully to prevent a formal separation which as ending forever the one hope that cheered her on even in the front of despair she would probably not long have survived With mister Marston however he was far from being a favorite There was that in his lofty and simple purity which abashed and silently reproached the sensual bitter disappointed man of the world The angry pride of the scornful man felt its own meanness in the grand presence of a simple and humble Christian minister And the very fact that all his habits had led him to hold such a character in contempt made him but the more unreasonably resent the involuntary homage which its exhibition in doctor Danvers s person invariably extorted from him He felt in this good man s presence under a kind of irritating restraint that he was in the presence of one with whom he had and could have no sympathy whatever and yet one whom he could not help both admiring and respecting and in these conflicting feelings were involved certain gloomy and humbling inferences about himself which he hated and almost feared to contemplate It was well however for the indulgence of Sir Wynston s conversational propensities that doctor Danvers had happened to drop in for Marston was doggedly silent and sullen and missus Marston was herself scarcely more disposed than he to maintain her part in a conversation so that had it not been for the opportune arrival of the good clergyman the supper must have been dispatched with a very awkward and unsocial taciturnity Marston thought and perhaps not erroneously that Sir Wynston suspected something of the real state of affairs and he was therefore incensed to perceive as he thought in his manner very evident indications of his being in unusually good spirits Thus disposed the party sat down to supper One of our number is missing said Sir Wynston affecting a slight surprise which perhaps he did not feel Mademoiselle de Barras I trust she is well said Doctor Danvers looking towards Marston I suppose she is I don t know said Marston drily Why how should he know said the baronet gaily but with something almost imperceptibly sarcastic in his tone Our friend Marston is privileged to be as ungallant as he pleases except where he has the happy privilege to owe allegiance but I a gay young bachelor of fifty am naturally curious I really do trust that our charming French friend is not unwell He addressed his inquiry to missus Marston who with some slight confusion replied No nothing at least serious merely a slight headache I am sure she will be quite well enough to come down to breakfast She is indeed a very charming and interesting young person said Doctor Danvers There is a certain simplicity about her which argues a good and kind heart and an open nature Very true indeed doctor observed Berkley with the same faint but to Marston exquisitely provoking approximation to sarcasm There is as you say a very charming simplicity Don t you think so Marston Marston looked at him for a moment but continued silent Poor mademoiselle she is indeed a most affectionate creature said missus Marston who felt called upon to say something Come Marston will you contribute nothing to the general fund of approbation said Sir Wynston who was gifted by nature with an amiable talent for teasing which he was fond of exercising in a quiet way We have all but you said something handsome of our absent young friend I never praise anybody Wynston not even you said Marston with an obvious sneer Well well I must comfort myself with the belief that your silence covers a great deal of good will and perhaps a little admiration too answered his cousin significantly Comfort yourself in any honest way you will my dear Wynston retorted Marston with a degree of asperity which to all but the baronet himself was unaccountable You may be right you may be wrong on a subject so unimportant it matters very little which you are at perfect liberty to practice delusions if you will upon yourself By the bye mister Marston is not your son about to come down here asked Doctor Danvers who perceived that the altercation was becoming on Marston s part somewhat testy if not positively rude Yes I expect him in a few days replied he with a sudden gloom You have not seen him Sir Wynston asked the clergyman I have that pleasure yet to come said the baronet A pleasure it is I do assure you said Doctor Danvers heartily He is a handsome lad with the heart of a hero a fine frank generous lad and as merry as a lark Yes yes interrupted Marston he is well enough and has done pretty well at Cambridge Doctor Danvers take some wine It was strange but yet mournfully true that the praises which the good Doctor Danvers thus bestowed upon his son were bitter to the soul of the unhappy Marston They jarred upon his ear and stung his heart for his conscience converted them into so many latent insults and humiliations to himself Your wine is very good Marston I think your clarets are many degrees better than any I can get said Sir Wynston sipping a glass of his favorite wine You country gentlemen are sad selfish dogs and with all your grumbling manage to collect the best of whatever is worth having about you We sometimes succeed in collecting a pleasant party retorted Marston with ironical courtesy though we do not always command the means of entertaining them quite as we would wish It was the habit of Doctor Danvers without respect of persons or places to propose before taking his departure from whatever domestic party he chanced to be thrown among for the evening to read some verses from that holy Book on which his own hopes and peace were founded and to offer up a prayer for all to the throne of grace Marston although he usually absented himself from such exercises did not otherwise discourage them but upon the present occasion starting from his gloomy reverie he himself was the first to remind the clergyman of his customary observance Evil thoughts loomed upon the mind of Marston like measureless black mists upon a cold smooth sea They rested grew and darkened there and no heaven sent breath came silently to steal them away Under this dread shadow his mind lay waiting like the deep before the Spirit of God moved upon its waters passive and awful Why for the first time now did religion interest him The unseen intangible was even now at work within him A dreadful power shook his very heart and soul There was some strange ghastly wrestling going on in his own immortal spirit a struggle that made him faint which he had no power to determine He looked upon the holy influence of the good man s prayer a prayer in which he could not join with a dull superstitious hope that the words inviting better influence though uttered by another and with other objects would like a spell chase away the foul fiend that was busy with his soul Marston sate looking into the fire with a countenance of stern gloom upon which the wayward lights of the flickering hearth sported fitfully while at a distant table Doctor Danvers sate down and taking his well worn Bible from his pocket turned over its leaves and began in gentle but impressive tones to read Sir Wynston was much too well bred to evince the slightest disposition to aught but the most proper and profound attention The faintest imaginable gleam of ridicule might perhaps have been discerned in his features as he leaned back in his chair and closing his eyes composed himself to at least an attitude of attention No man could submit with more cheerfulness to an inevitable bore In these things then thou hast no concern the judgment troubles thee not thou hast no fear of death Sir Wynston Berkley yet there is a heart beating near thee the mysteries of which could they glide out and stand before thy face would perchance appal thee cold easy man of the world Aye couldst thou but see with those cunning eyes of thine but twelve brief hours into futurity each syllable that falls from that good man s lips unheeded would peal through thy heart and brain like maddening thunder Hearken hearken Sir Wynston Berkley perchance these are the farewell words of thy better angel the last pleadings of despised mercy The party broke up Doctor Danvers took his leave and rode homeward down the broad avenue between the gigantic ranks of elm that closed it in The full moon was rising above the distant hills the mists lay like sleeping lakes in the laps of the hollows and the broad demesne looked tranquil and sad under this chastened and silvery glory The good old clergyman thought as he pursued his way that here at least in a spot so beautiful and sequestered the stormy passions and fell contentions of the outer world could scarcely penetrate Yet in that calm secluded spot and under the cold pure light which fell so holily what a hell was weltering and glaring what a spectacle was that moon to go down upon As Sir Wynston was leaving the parlor for his own room Marston accompanied him to the hall and said I shan t play tonight Sir Wynston Ah ha very particularly engaged suggested the baronet with a faint mocking smile Well my dear fellow we must endeavor to make up for it tomorrow eh I don t know that said Marston and in a word there is no use sir in our masquerading with one another Each knows the other each understands the other I wish to have a word or two with you in your room tonight when we shan t be interrupted Marston spoke in a fierce and grating whisper and his countenance more even than his accents betrayed the intensity of his bridled fury Sir Wynston however smiled upon his cousin as if his voice had been melody and his looks all sunshine Very good Marston just as you please he said only don t be later than one as I shall be getting into bed about that hour Perhaps upon second thoughts it is as well to defer what I have to say said Marston musingly Tomorrow will do as well so perhaps Sir Wynston I may not trouble you tonight Just as suits you best my dear Marston replied the baronet with a tranquil smile only don t come after the hour I have stipulated So saying the baronet mounted the stairs and made his way to his chamber He was in excellent spirits and in high good humor with himself the object of his visit to Gray Forest had been as he now flattered himself attained He had conducted an affair requiring the profoundest mystery in its prosecution and the nicest tactic in its management almost to a triumphant issue He had perfectly masked his design and completely outwitted Marston and to a person who piqued himself upon his clever diplomacy and vaunted that he had never yet sustained a defeat in any object which he had seriously proposed to himself such a combination of successes was for the moment quite intoxicating Sir Wynston not only enjoyed his own superiority with all the vanity of a selfish nature but he no less enjoyed with a keen and malicious relish the intense mortification which he was well assured Marston must experience and all the more acutely because of the utter impossibility circumstanced as he was of his taking any steps to manifest his vexation without compromising himself in a most unpleasant way Animated by these amiable feelings Sir Wynston Berkley sate down and wrote the following short letter addressed to missus Gray Wynston Hall missus Gray On receipt of this have the sitting rooms and several bedrooms put in order and thoroughly aired Prepare for my use the suite of three rooms over the library and drawing room and have the two great wardrobes and the cabinet in the state bedroom removed into the large dressing room which opens upon the bedroom I have named Make everything as comfortable as possible If anything is wanted in the way of furniture drapery ornament c you need only write to John Skelton esquire Spring garden London stating what is required and he will order and send them down You must be expeditious as I shall probably go down to Wynston with two or three friends at the beginning of next month WYNSTON BERKLEY P S I have written to direct Arkins and two or three of the other servants to go down at once Set them all to work immediately He then applied himself to another letter of considerably greater length and from which therefore we shall only offer a few extracts It was addressed to John Skelton esquire and began as follows My Dear Skelton You are doubtless surprised at my long silence but I have had nothing very particular to say My visit to this dull and uncomfortable place was as you rightly surmise not without its object a little bit of wicked romance the pretty demoiselle of Rouen whom I mentioned to you more than once la belle de Barras was in truth the attraction that drew me hither and I think for as yet she affects hesitation I shall have no further trouble with her She is a fine creature and you will admit when you have seen her well worth taking some trouble about She is however a very knowing little minx and evidently suspects me of being a sad fickle dog and as I surmise has some plans moreover respecting my morose cousin Marston a kind of wicked Penruddock who has carried all his London tastes into his savage retreat a paradise of bogs and bushes There is I am very confident a liaison in that quarter The young lady is evidently a good deal afraid of him and insists upon such precautions in our interviews that they have been very few and far between indeed Today there has been a fracas of some kind I have no doubt that Marston poor devil is jealous His situation is really pitiably comic with an intriguing mistress a saintly wife and a devil of a jealous temper of his own I shall meet Mary on reaching town Has Clavering shabby dog paid his I O U yet Tell the little opera woman she had better be quiet She ought to know me by this time I shall do what is right but won t submit to be bullied If she is troublesome snap your fingers at her on my behalf and leave her to her remedy I have written to Gray to get things at Wynston in order She will draw upon you for what money she requires Send down two or three of the servants if they have not already gone The place is very dusty and dingy and needs a great deal of brushing and scouring I shall see you in town very soon By the way has the claret I ordered from the Dublin house arrived yet It is consigned to you and goes by the Lizard pay the freightage and get Edwards to pack it ten dozen or so may as well go down to Wynston and send other wines in proportion I leave details to you Some further directions upon other subjects followed and having subscribed the dispatch and addressed it to the gentlemanlike scoundrel who filled the onerous office of factotum to this profligate and exacting man of the world Sir Wynston Berkley rang his bell and gave the two letters into the hand of his man with special directions to carry them himself in person to the post office in the neighboring village early next morning These little matters completed Sir Wynston stirred his fire leaned back in his easy chair and smiled blandly over the sunny prospect of his imaginary triumphs It here becomes necessary to describe in a few words some of the local relations of Sir Wynston s apartments The bedchamber which he occupied opened from the long passage of which we have already spoken and there were two other smaller apartments opening from it in train In the further of these which was entered from a lobby communicating by a back stair with the kitchen and servants apartments lay Sir Wynston s valet and the intermediate chamber was fitted up as a dressing room for the baronet himself These circumstances it is necessary to mention that what follows may be clearly intelligible While the baronet was penning these records of vicious schemes dire waste of wealth and time irrevocable time Marston paced his study in a very different frame of mind There were a gloom and disorder in the room accordant with those of his own mind Shelves of ancient tomes darkened by time and upon which the dust of years lay sleeping dark oaken cabinets filled with piles of deeds and papers among which the nimble spiders were crawling and from the dusky walls several stark pale ancestors looking down coldly from their tarnished frames An hour and another hour passed and still Marston paced this melancholy chamber a prey to his own fell passions and dark thoughts He was not a superstitious man but in the visions which haunted him perhaps was something which made him unusually excitable for he experienced a chill of absolute horror as standing at the farther end of the room with his face turned towards the entrance he beheld the door noiselessly and slowly pushed open by a pale thin hand and a figure dressed in a loose white robe glide softly in He stood for some seconds gazing upon this apparition as it moved hesitatingly towards him from the dusky extremity of the large apartment before he perceived that the form was that of missus Marston Hey ha missus Marston what on earth has called you hither he asked sternly You ought to have been at rest an hour ago get to your chamber and leave me I have business to attend to Now dear Richard you must forgive me she said drawing near and looking up into his haggard face with a sweet and touching look of timidity and love I could not rest until I saw you again your looks have been all this night so unlike yourself so strange and terrible that I am afraid some great misfortune threatens you which you fear to tell me of My looks Why curse it must I give an account of my looks replied Marston at once disconcerted and wrathful Misfortune What misfortune can befall us more No there is nothing nothing I say but your own foolish fancy go to your room go to sleep my looks indeed pshaw I came to tell you dear Richard that I will do in all respects just as you desire If you continue to wish it I will part with poor mademoiselle though indeed Richard I shall miss her more than you can imagine and all your suspicions have wronged her deeply said missus Marston Her husband darted a sudden flashing glance of suspicious scrutiny upon her face but its expression was frank earnest noble He was disarmed he hung his head gloomily upon his breast and was silent for a time She came nearer and laid her hand upon his arm He looked darkly into her upturned eyes and a feeling which had not touched his heart for many a day an emotion of pity transient indeed but vivid revisited him He took her hand in his and said in gentler terms than she had heard him use for a long time No indeed Gertrude you have deceived yourself no misfortune has happened and if I am gloomy the source of all my troubles is within Leave me Gertrude for the present As to the other matter the departure of Mademoiselle de Barras we can talk of that tomorrow now I cannot so let us part Go to your room good night She was withdrawing and he added in a subdued tone Gertrude I am very glad you came very glad Pray for me tonight He had followed her a few steps toward the door and now stopped short turned about and walked dejectedly back again I am right glad she came he muttered as soon as he was once more alone Wynston is provoking and fiery too Were I in my present mood to seek a tete a tete with him who knows what might come of it Blood my own heart whispers blood I ll not trust myself He strode to the study door locked it and taking out the key shut it in the drawer of one of the cabinets Now it will need more than accident or impulse to lead me to him I cannot go at least without reflection without premeditation Avaunt fiend I have baffled you He stood in the center of the room cowering and scowling as he said this and looked round with a glance half defiant half fearful as if he expected to see some dreadful form in the dusky recesses of the desolate chamber He sat himself by the smouldering fire in somber and agitated rumination He was restless he rose again unbuckled his sword which he had not loosed since evening and threw it hastily into a corner He looked at his watch it was half past twelve he glanced at the door and thence at the cabinet in which he had placed the key then he turned hastily and sate down again He leaned his elbows on his knees and his chin upon his clenched hand still he was restless and excited Once more he arose and paced up and down He consulted his watch again it was now but a quarter to one Sir Wynston s man having received the letters and his master s permission to retire to rest got into his bed and was soon beginning to dose We have already mentioned that his and Sir Wynston s apartments were separated by a small dressing room so that any ordinary noise or conversation could be heard but imperfectly from one to the other The servant however was startled by a sound of something falling on the floor of his master s apartment and broken to pieces by the violence of the shock He sate up in his bed listened and heard some sentences spoken vehemently and gabbled very fast He thought he distinguished the words wretch and God and there was something so strange in the tone in which they were spoken that the man got up and stole noiselessly through the dressing room and listened at the door He heard him as he thought walking in his slippers through the room and making his customary arrangements previously to getting into bed He knew that his master had a habit of speaking when alone and concluded that the accidental breakage of some glass or chimney ornament had elicited the volley of words he had heard Well knowing that except at the usual hours or in obedience to Sir Wynston s bell nothing more displeased his master than his presuming to enter his sleeping apartment while he was there the servant quietly retreated and perfectly satisfied that all was right composed himself to slumber and was soon beginning to dose again The adventures of the night however were not yet over Waking as men sometimes do without any ascertainable cause without a start or an uneasy sensation without even a disturbance of the attitude of repose he opened his eyes and beheld Merton the servant of whom we have spoken standing at a little distance from his bed The moonlight fell in a clear flood upon this figure the man was ghastly pale there was a blotch of blood on his face his hands were clasped upon something which they nearly concealed and his eyes fixed on the servant who had just awakened shone in the cold light with a wild and lifeless glitter This specter drew close to the side of the bed and stood for a few moments there with a look of agony and menace which startled the newly awakened man who rose upright and said mister Merton mister Merton in God s name what is the matter Merton recoiled at the sound of his voice and as he did so dropped something on the floor which rolled away to a distance and he stood gazing silently and horribly upon his interrogator mister Merton I say what is it urged the man Are you hurt Your face is bloody Merton raised his hand to his face mechanically and Sir Wynston s man observed that it too was covered with blood Why man he said vehemently and actually freezing with horror you are all bloody hands and face all over blood My hand is cut to the bone said Merton in a harsh whisper and speaking to himself rather than addressing the servant I wish it was my neck I wish to God I bled to death You have hurt your hand mister Merton repeated the man scarce knowing what he said Aye whispered Merton wildly drawing toward the bedside again who told you I hurt my hand It is cut to the bone sure enough He stooped for a moment over the bed and then cowered down toward the floor to search for what he had dropped Why mister Merton what brings you here at this hour urged the man after a pause of a few seconds It is drawing toward morning Aye aye said Merton doubtfully and starting upright again while he concealed in his bosom what he had been in search of Near morning is it Night and morning it is all one to me I believe I am going mad by But what do you want What did you come here for at this hour persisted the man What Aye that is it why his boots and spurs to be sure I forgot them His his Sir Wynston s boots and spurs I forgot to take them I say said Merton looking toward the dressing room as if about to enter it Don t mind them tonight I say don t go in there said the man peremptorily and getting out upon the floor I say mister Merton this is no hour to be going about searching in the dark for boots and spurs You ll waken the master I can t have it I say go down and let it be for tonight Thus speaking in a resolute and somewhat angry under key the valet stood between Merton and the entrance of the dressing room and signing with his hand toward the other door of the apartment continued Go down I say mister Merton go down you may as well quietly for I tell you plainly you shall neither go a step further nor stay here a moment longer The man drew his shoulders up and made a sort of shivering moan and clasping his hands together shook them as it seemed in great agony He then turned abruptly and hurried from the room by the door leading to the kitchen By my faith said the servant I am glad he is gone The poor chap is turning crazy as sure as I am a living man I ll not have him prowling about here anymore however that I am resolved on In pursuance of this determination by no means an imprudent one as it seemed he fastened the door communicating with the lower apartments upon the inside He had hardly done this when he heard a step traversing the stable yard which lay under the window of his apartment He looked out and saw Merton walking hurriedly across and into a stable at the farther end Feeling no very particular curiosity about his movements the man hurried back to his bed Merton s eccentric conduct of late had become so generally remarked and discussed among the servants that Sir Wynston s man was by no means surprised at the oddity of the visit he had just had nor after the first few moments of doubt before the appearance of blood had been accounted for had he entertained any suspicions whatever connected with the man s unexpected presence in the room Merton was in the habit of coming up every night to take down Sir Wynston s boots whenever the baronet had ridden in the course of the day and this attention had been civilly undertaken as a proof of good will toward the valet whose duty this somewhat soiling and ungentlemanlike process would otherwise have been So far the nature of the visit was explained and the remembrance of the friendly feeling and good offices which had been mutually interchanged as well as of the inoffensive habits for which Merton had earned a character for himself speedily calmed the uneasiness for a moment amounting to actual alarm with which the servant had regarded his appearance We must now pass on to the morrow and ask the reader s attention for a few moments to a different scene In contact with Gray Forest upon the northern side and divided by a common boundary lay a demesne in many respects presenting a very striking contrast to its grander neighbor It was a comparatively modern place It could not boast the towering timber which enriched and overshadowed the vast and varied expanse of its aristocratic rival but if it was inferior in the advantages of antiquity and perhaps also in some of those of nature its superiority in other respects was striking and important Gray Forest was not more remarkable for its wild and neglected condition than was Newton Park for the care and elegance with which it was kept No one could observe the contrast without at the same time divining its cause The proprietor of the one was a man of wealth fully commensurate with the extent and pretensions of the residence he had chosen the owner of the other was a man of broken fortunes Under a green shade which nearly met above a very young man scarcely one and twenty of a frank and sensible rather than a strictly handsome countenance was walking followed by half a dozen dogs of as many breeds and sizes This young man was George Mervyn the only son of the present proprietor of the place As he approached the great gate the clank of a horse s hoofs in quick motion upon the sequestered road which ran outside it reached him and hardly had he heard these sounds when a young gentleman rode briskly by directing his look into the demesne as he passed He had no sooner seen him than wheeling his horse about he rode up to the iron gate and dismounting threw it open and let his horse in Ha Charles Marston I protest said the young man quickening his pace to meet his friend Marston my dear fellow he called aloud how glad I am to see you There was another entrance into Newton Park opening from the same road about half a mile further on and Charles Marston made his way lie through this Thus the young people walked on talking of a hundred things as they proceeded in the mirth of their hearts Between the fathers of the two young men who thus walked so affectionately together there subsisted unhappily no friendly feelings There had been several slight disagreements between them touching their proprietary rights and one of these had ripened into a formal and somewhat expensive litigation respecting a certain right of fishing claimed by each This legal encounter had terminated in the defeat of Marston Mervyn however promptly wrote to his opponent offering him the free use of the waters for which they had thus sharply contested and received a curt and scarcely civil reply declining the proposed courtesy This exhibition of resentment on Marston s part had been followed by some rather angry collisions where chance or duty happened to throw them together It is but justice to say that upon all such occasions Marston was the aggressor But Mervyn was a somewhat testy old gentleman and had a certain pride of his own which was not to be trifled with Thus though near neighbors the parents of the young friends were more than strangers to each other On Mervyn s side however this estrangement was unalloyed with bitterness and simply of that kind which the great moralist would have referred to defensive pride It did not include any member of Marston s family and Charles as often as he desired it which was in truth as often as his visits could escape the special notice of his father was a welcome guest at Newton Park These details respecting the mutual relation in which the two families stood it was necessary to state for the purpose of making what follows perfectly clear The young people had now reached the further gate at which they were to part Charles Marston with a heart beating happily in the anticipation of many a pleasant meeting bid him farewell for the present and in a few minutes more was riding up the broad straight avenue towards the gloomy mansion which closed in the hazy and somber perspective As he moved onward he passed a laborer with whose face from his childhood he had been familiar How do you do Tom he cried At your service sir replied the man uncovering and welcome home sir There was something dark and anxious in the man s looks which ill accorded with the welcome he spoke and which suggested some undefined alarm The master and mistress and Miss Rhoda are all well he asked eagerly All well sir thank God replied the man Young Marston spurred on filled with vague apprehensions and observing the man still leaning upon his spade and watching his progress with the same gloomy and curious eye At the hall door he met with one of the servants booted and spurred Well Daly he said as he dismounted how are all at home This man like the former met his smile with a troubled countenance and stammered All sir that is the master and mistress and Miss Rhoda quite well sir but Well well said Charles eagerly speak on what is it Bad work sir replied the man lowering his voice I am going off this minute for For what urged the young gentleman Why sir for the coroner replied he The coroner the coroner Why good God what has happened cried Charles aghast with horror Sir Wynston commenced the man and hesitated Well pursued Charles pale and breathless Sir Wynston he it is he said the man He Sir Wynston Is he dead or who is Who is dead demanded the young man almost fiercely Sir Wynston sir it is he that is dead There is bad work sir very bad I m afraid replied the man Charles did not wait to inquire further but with a feeling of mingled horror and curiosity entered the house He hurried up the stairs and entered his mother s sitting room She was there perfectly alone and so deadly pale that she scarcely looked like a living being In an instant they were locked in one another s arms Mother my dear mother you are ill said the young man anxiously Oh no no dear Charles but frightened horrified and as she said this the poor lady burst into tears What is this horrible affair Something about Sir Wynston He is dead I know but is it is it suicide he asked Oh no not suicide said missus Marston greatly agitated Good God Then he is murdered whispered the young man growing very pale Yes Charles horrible dreadful I can scarcely believe it replied she shuddering while she wept Where is my father inquired the young man after a pause Why why Charles darling why do you ask for him she said wildly grasping him by the arm as she looked into his face with a terrified expression Why why he could tell me the particulars of this horrible tragedy answered he meeting her agonized look with one of alarm and surprise as far as they have been as yet collected How is he mother is he well Oh yes quite well thank God she answered more collectedly quite well but of course greatly dreadfully shocked I will go to him mother I will see him said he turning towards the door He has been wretchedly depressed and excited for some days said missus Marston dejectedly and this dreadful occurrence will I fear affect him most deplorably The young man kissed her tenderly and affectionately and hurried down to the library where his father usually sat when he desired to be alone or was engaged in business He opened the door softly His father was standing at one of the windows his face haggard as from a night s watching unkempt and unshorn and with his hands thrust into his pockets At the sound of the revolving door he started and seeing his son first recoiled a little with a strange doubtful expression and then rallying walked quickly towards him with a smile which had in it something still more painful Charles I am glad to see you he said shaking him with an agitated pressure by both hands Charles this is a great calamity and what makes it still worse is that the murderer has escaped it looks badly you know He fixed his gaze for a few moments upon his son turned abruptly and walked a little way into the room then in a disconcerted manner he added hastily turning back Not that it signifies to us of course but I would fain have justice satisfied And who is the wretch the murderer inquired Charles Who Why everyone knows that scoundrel Merton answered Marston in an irritated tone Merton murdered him in his bed and fled last night he is gone escaped and I suspect Sir Wynston s man of being an accessory Which was Sir Wynston s bedroom asked the young man The room that old Lady Mostyn had the room with the portrait of Grace Hamilton in it I know I know said the young man much excited I should wish to see it Stay said Marston the door from the passage is bolted on the inside and I have locked the other here is the key if you choose to go but you must bring Hughes with you and do not disturb anything leave all as it is the jury ought to see and examine for themselves Charles took the key and accompanied by the awestruck servant he made his way by the back stairs to the door opening from the dressing room which as we have said intervened between the valet s chamber and Sir Wynston s After a momentary hesitation Charles turned the key in the door and stood In the dark chamber of white death The shutters lay partly open as the valet had left them some hours before on making the astounding discovery which the partially admitted light revealed The corpse lay in the silk embroidered dressing gown and other habiliments which Sir Wynston had worn while taking his ease in his chamber on the preceding night The coverlet was partially dragged over it The mouth was gaping and filled with clotted blood a wide gash was also visible in the neck under the ear and there was a thickening pool of blood at the bedside and quantities of blood doubtless from other wounds had saturated the bedclothes under the body There lay Sir Wynston stiffened in the attitude in which the struggle of death had left him with his stern stony face and dim terrible gaze turned up Charles looked breathlessly for more than a minute upon this mute and unchanging spectacle and then silently suffered the curtain to fall back again and stepped with the light tread of awe again to the door There he turned back and pausing for a minute said in a whisper to the attendant And Merton did this Troth I m afeard he did sir answered the man gloomily And has made his escape continued Charles Yes sir he stole away in the night time replied the servant after the murder was done and he glanced fearfully toward the bed God knows where he s gone The villain muttered Charles but what was his motive why did he do all this what does it mean I don t know exactly sir but he was very queer for a week and more before it replied the man there was something bad over him for a long time It is a terrible thing said Charles with a profound sigh a terrible and shocking occurrence He hesitated again at the door but his feelings had sustained a terrible revulsion at sight of the corpse and he was no longer disposed to prosecute his purposed examination of the chamber and its contents with a view to conjecturing the probable circumstances of the murder Observe Hughes that I have moved nothing in the chamber from the place it occupied when we entered he said to the servant as they withdrew He locked the door and as he passed through the hall on his return he encountered his father and restoring the key said I could not stay there I am almost sorry I have seen it I am overpowered what a determined ferocious murder it was the place is all in a pool of gore he must have received many wounds I can t say the particulars will be elicited soon enough those details are for the inquest as for me I hate such spectacles said Marston gloomily go now and see your sister you will find her there He pointed to the small room where we have first seen her and her fair governess Charles obeyed the direction and Marston proceeded himself to his wife s sitting room The young man dispirited and horrified by the awful spectacle he had just contemplated hurried to the little study occupied by his sister Marston himself ascended as we have said the great staircase leading to his wife s private sitting room missus Marston he said entering this is a hateful occurrence a dreadful thing to have taken place here I don t mean to affect grief which I don t feel but the thing is very shocking and particularly so as having occurred under my roof but that cannot now be helped I have resolved to spare no exertions and no influence to bring the assassin to justice and a coroner s jury will within a few hours sift the evidence which we have succeeded in collecting But my purpose in seeking you now is to recur to the conversation we yesterday had respecting a member of this establishment Mademoiselle de Barras suggested the lady Yes Mademoiselle de Barras echoed Marston I wish to say that having reconsidered the circumstances affecting her I am absolutely resolved that she shall not continue to be an inmate of this house He paused and missus Marston said Well Richard I am sorry very sorry for it but your decision shall never be disputed by me Of course said Marston drily and therefore the sooner you acquaint her with it and let her know that she must go the better Having said this he left her and went to his own chamber where he proceeded to make his toilet with elaborate propriety in preparation for the scene which was about to take place under his roof missus Marston meanwhile suffered from a horrible uncertainty She never harbored it is true one doubt as to her husband s perfect innocence of the ghastly crime which filled their house with fear and gloom but at the same time that she thoroughly and indignantly scouted the possibility of his under any circumstances being accessory to such a crime she experienced a nervous and agonizing anxiety lest anyone else should possibly suspect him however obliquely and faintly of any participation whatever in the foul deed This vague fear tortured her it had taken possession of her mind and it was the more acutely painful because it was of a kind which precluded the possibility of her dispelling it as morbid fears so often are dispelled by taking counsel upon its suggestions with a friend The day wore on and strange faces began to fill the great parlor The coroner accompanied by a physician had arrived Several of the gentry in the immediate vicinity had been summoned as jurors and now began to arrive in succession Marston in a handsome and sober suit received these visitors with a stately and melancholy courtesy befitting the occasion Mervyn and his son had both been summoned and of course were in attendance There being now a sufficient number to form a jury they were sworn and immediately proceeded to the chamber where the body of the murdered man was lying Marston accompanied them and with a pale and stern countenance and in a clear and subdued tone called their attention successively to every particular detail which he conceived important to be noted Having thus employed some minutes the jury again returned to the parlor and the examination of the witnesses commenced Marston at his own request was first sworn and examined He deposed merely to the circumstance of his parting on the night previous with Sir Wynston and to the state in which he had seen the room and the body in the morning He mentioned also the fact that on hearing the alarm in the morning he had hastened from his own chamber to Sir Wynston s and found on trying to enter that the door opening upon the passage was secured on the inside This circumstance showed that the murderer must have made his egress at least through the valet s chamber and by the back stairs Marston s evidence went no further The next witness sworn was Edward Smith the servant of the late Sir Wynston Berkley His evidence was a narrative of the occurrences we have already stated He described the sounds which he had overheard from his master s room the subsequent appearance of Merton and the conversation which had passed between them He then proceeded to mention that it was his master s custom to have himself called at seven o clock at which hour he usually took some medicine which it was the valet s duty to bring to him after which he either settled again to rest or rose in a short time if unable to sleep Having measured and prepared the dose in the dressing room the servant went on to say he had knocked at his master s door and receiving no answer had entered the room and partly unclosed the shutters He perceived the blood on the carpet and on opening the curtains saw his master lying with his mouth and eyes open perfectly dead and weltering in gore He had stretched out his hand and seized that of the dead man which was quite stiff and cold then losing heart he had run to the door communicating with the passage but found it locked and turned to the other entrance and ran down the back stairs crying murder mister Hughes the butler and James Carney another servant came immediately and they all three went back into the room The key was in the outer door upon the inside but they did not unlock it until they had viewed the body There was a great pool of blood in the bed and in it was lying a red handled case knife which was produced and identified by the witness Just then they heard mister Marston calling for admission and they opened the door with some difficulty for the lock was rusty mister Marston had ordered them to leave the things as they were and had used very stern language to the witness They had then left the room securing both doors This witness underwent a severe and searching examination but his evidence was clear and consistent In conclusion Marston produced a dagger which was stained with blood and asked the man whether he recognized it Smith at once stated this to have been the property of his late master who when traveling carried it together with his pistols along with him Since his arrival at Gray Forest it had lain upon the chimney piece in his bedroom where he believed it to have been upon the previous night James Carney one of Marston s servants was next sworn and examined He had he said observed a strange and unaccountable agitation and depression in Merton s manner for some days past he had also been several times disturbed at night by his talking aloud to himself and walking to and fro in his room Their bedrooms were separated by a thin partition in which was a window through which Carney had on the night of the murder observed a light in Merton s room and on looking in had seen him dressing hastily He also saw him twice take up and again lay down the red hafted knife which had been found in the bed of the murdered man He knew it by the handle being broken near the end He had no suspicion of Merton having any mischievous intentions and lay down again to rest He afterwards heard him pass out of his room and go slowly up the back stairs leading to the upper story Shortly after this he had fallen asleep and did not hear or see him return He then described as Smith had already done the scene which presented itself in the morning on his accompanying him into Sir Wynston s bedchamber The next witness examined was a little Irish boy who described himself as a poor scholar His testimony was somewhat singular He deposed that he had come to the house on the preceding evening and had been given some supper and was afterwards permitted to sleep among the hay in one of the lofts He had however discovered what he considered a snugger berth This was an unused stable in the further end of which lay a quantity of hay Among this he had lain down and gone to sleep He was however awakened in the course of the night by the entrance of a man whom he saw with perfect distinctness in the moonlight and his description of his dress and appearance tallied exactly with those of Merton This man occupied himself for sometime in washing his hands and face in a stable bucket which happened to stand by the door and during the whole of this process he continued to moan and mutter like one in woeful perturbation He said distinctly twice or thrice by I am done for and every now and then he muttered and nothing for it after all When he had done washing his hands he took something from his coat pocket and looked at it shaking his head at this time he was standing with his back turned toward the boy so that he could not see what this object might be The man however put it into his breast and then began to search hurriedly as it seemed for some hiding place for it After looking at the pavement and poking at the chinks of the wall he suddenly went to the window and forced up the stone which formed the sill Under this he threw the object which the boy had seen him examine with so much perplexity and then he readjusted the stone and removed the evidences of its having been recently stirred The boy was a little frightened but very curious about all that he saw and when the man left the stable in which he lay he got up and following to the door peeped after him He saw him putting on an outside coat and hat near the yard gate and then with great caution unbolt the wicket constantly looking back towards the house and so let himself out The boy was uneasy and sat in the hay wide awake until morning He then told the servants what he had seen and one of the men having raised the stone which he had not strength to lift they found the dagger which Smith had identified as belonging to his master This weapon was stained with blood and some hair which was found to correspond in color with Sir Wynston s was sticking in the crevice between the blade and the handle It appears very strange that one man should have employed two distinct instruments of this kind observed Mervyn after a pause A silence followed Yes strange it does seem strange said Marston clearing his voice Yet it is clear said another of the jury that the same hand did employ them It is proved that the knife was in Merton s possession just as he left his chamber and proved also that the dagger was secreted by him after he quitted the house Yes said Marston with a grisly sort of smile and glancing sarcastically at Mervyn while he addressed the last speaker I thank you for recalling my attention to the facts It certainly is not a very pleasant suggestion that there still remains within my household an undetected murderer Mervyn ruminated for a time and said he should wish to put a few more questions to Smith and Carney They were accordingly recalled and examined in great detail with a view to ascertain whether any indication of the presence of a second person having visited the chamber with Merton was discoverable Nothing however appeared except that the valet mentioned the noise and the exclamations which he had indistinctly heard You did not mention that before sir said Marston sharply I did not think of it sir replied the man the gentlemen were asking me so many questions but I told you sir about it in the morning Oh ah yes yes I believe you did said Marston but you then said that Sir Wynston often talked when he was alone eh sir Yes sir and so he used which was the reason I did not go into the room when I heard it replied the man How long afterwards was it when you saw Merton in your own room asked Mervyn I could not say sir answered Smith I was soon asleep and can t say how long I slept before he came Was it an hour pursued Mervyn I can t say said the man doubtfully Was it five hours asked Marston No Sir I am sure it was not five Could you swear it was more than half an hour persisted Marston No I could not swear that answered he I am afraid mister Mervyn you have found a mare s nest said Marston contemptuously I have done my duty sir retorted Mervyn cynically which plainly requires that I shall have no doubt which the evidence of the witness can clear up unsifted and unsatisfied I happened to think it of some moment to ascertain if possible whether more persons than one were engaged in this atrocious murder You don t seem to think the question so important a one different men sir take different views Views sir in matters of this sort especially where they tend to multiply suspicions and to implicate others ought to be supported by something more substantial than mere fancies retorted Marston I don t know what you call fancies replied Mervyn testily but here are two deadly weapons a knife and a dagger each it would seem employed in doing this murder if you see nothing odd in that I can t enable you to do so Well sir said Marston grimly the whole thing is as you term it odd and I can see no object in your picking out this particular singularity for long winded criticism except to cast scandal upon my household by leaving a hideous and vague imputation floating among the members of it Sir sir this is a foul way he cried sternly to gratify a paltry spite mister Marston said Mervyn rising and thrusting his hands into his pockets while he confronted him to the full as sternly the country knows in which of our hearts the spite if any there be between us is harbored I owe you no friendship but sir I cherish no malice either and against the worst enemy I have on earth I am incapable of perverting an opportunity like this and inflicting pain under the pretence of discharging a duty Marston was on the point of retorting but the coroner interposed and besought them to confine their attention strictly to the solemn inquiry which they were summoned together to prosecute There remained still to be examined the surgeon who had accompanied the coroner for the purpose of reporting upon the extent and nature of the injuries discoverable upon the person of the deceased He accordingly deposed that having examined the body he found no less than three deep wounds inflicted with some sharp instrument two of them had actually penetrated the heart and were of course supposed to cause instant death Besides these there were two contusions one upon the back of the head the other upon the forehead with a slight abrasion of the eyebrow There was a large lock of hair torn out by the roots at the front of the head and the palm and fingers of the right hand were cut This evidence having been taken the jury once more repaired to the chamber where the body lay and proceeded with much minuteness to examine the room with a view to ascertain if possible more particularly the exact circumstances of the murder The result of this elaborate scrutiny was as follows The deceased they conjectured had fallen asleep in his easy chair and while he was unconscious the murderer had stolen into the room and before attacking his victim had secured the bedroom door upon the inside This was argued from the non discovery of blood upon the handle or any other part of the door It was supposed that he had then approached Sir Wynston with the view either of robbing or of murdering him while he slept and that the deceased had awakened just after he had reached him that a brief and desperate struggle had ensued in which the assailant had struck his victim with his fist upon the forehead and having stunned him had hurriedly clutched him by the hair and stabbed him with the dagger which lay close by upon the chimneypiece forcing his head violently against the back of the chair This part of the conjecture was supported by the circumstance of there being discovered a lock of hair upon the ground at the spot and a good deal of blood The carpet too was tumbled and a water decanter which had stood upon the table close by was lying in fragments upon the floor It was supposed that the murderer had then dragged the half lifeless body to the bed where having substituted the knife which he had probably brought to the room in the same pocket from which the boy afterwards saw him take the dagger he dispatched him and either hearing some alarm perhaps the movement of the valet in the adjoining room or from some other cause he dropped the knife in the bed and was not able to find it again The wounds upon the hand of the dead man indicated his having caught and struggled to hold the blade of the weapon with which he was assailed The impression of a bloody hand thrust under the bolster where it was Sir Wynston s habit to place his purse and watch when making his arrangements for the night supplied the motive of this otherwise unaccountable atrocity After some brief consultation the jury agreed upon a verdict of willful murder against John Merton a finding of which the coroner expressed his entire approbation Marston as a justice of the peace had informations embodying the principal part of the evidence given before the coroner sworn against Merton and transmitted a copy of them to the Home Office A reward for the apprehension of the culprit was forthwith offered but for some months without effect Marston had in the interval written to several of Sir Wynston s many relations announcing the catastrophe and requesting that steps might immediately be taken to have the body removed Meanwhile undertakers were busy in the chamber of death The corpse was enclosed in lead and that again in cedar and a great oak shell covered with crimson cloth and goldheaded nails and with a gilt plate recording the age title c c of the deceased was screwed down firmly over all Nearly a fortnight elapsed before any reply to Marston s letters was received A short epistle at last arrived from Lord H the late Sir Wynston s uncle deeply regretting the sad and inexplicable occurrence and adding that the will which on receipt of the distressing intelligence was immediately opened and read contained no direction whatever respecting the sepulture of the deceased which had therefore better be completed as modestly and expeditiously as possible in the neighborhood and in conclusion he directed that the accounts of the undertakers c employed upon the melancholy occasion might be sent in to mister Skelton who had kindly undertaken to leave London without any delay for the purpose of completing these last arrangements and who would in any matter of business connected with the deceased represent him Lord H as executor of the late baronet This letter was followed in a day or two by the arrival of Skelton a well dressed languid impertinent London tuft hunter a good deal faded with a somewhat sallow and puffy face charged with a pleasant combination at once of meanness insolence and sensuality just such a person as Sir Wynston s parasite might have been expected to prove However well disposed to impress the natives with high notions of his extraordinary refinement and importance he very soon discovered that in Marston he had stumbled upon a man of the world and one thoroughly versed in the ways and characters of London life After some ineffectual attempts therefore to overawe and astonish his host mister Skelton became aware of the fruitlessness of the effort and condescended to abate somewhat of his pretensions Marston could not avoid inviting this person to pass the night at his house an invitation which was accepted of course and next morning after a late breakfast mister Skelton observed with a yawn And now about this body poor Berkley what do you propose to do with him I have no proposition to make said Marston drily It is no affair of mine except that the body may be removed without more delay I have no suggestion to offer H s notion was to have him buried as near the spot as may be said Skelton Marston nodded There is a kind of vault is not there in the demesne a family burial place inquired the visitor Yes sir replied Marston curtly Well drawled Skelton Well sir what then responded Marston Why as the wish of the parties is to have him buried poor fellow as quietly as possible I think he might just as well be laid there as anywhere else Had I desired it mister Skelton I should myself have made the offer said Marston abruptly Then you don t wish it said Skelton No sir certainly not most peremptorily not answered Marston with more sharpness than in his early days he would have thought quite consistent with politeness Perhaps replied Skelton for want of something better to say and with a callous sort of levity perhaps you hold the idea some people do that murdered men can t rest in their graves until their murderers have expiated their guilt Marston made no reply but shot two or three lurid glances from under his brow at the speaker Well then at all events continued Skelton indolently resuming his theme if you decline your assistance may I at least hope for your advice Knowing nothing of this country I would ask you whither you would recommend me to have the body conveyed I don t care to advise in the matter said Marston but if I were directing I should have the remains buried in Chester It is not more than twenty miles from this and if at any future time his family should desire to remove the body it could be effected more easily from thence But you can decide Egad I believe you are right said Skelton glad to be relieved of the trouble of thinking about the matter and I shall take your advice In accordance with this declaration the body was within four and twenty hours removed to Chester and buried there mister Skelton attending on behalf of Sir Wynston s numerous and afflicted friends and relatives There are certain heartaches for which time brings no healing nay which grow but the sorer and fiercer as days and years roll on of this kind perhaps were the stern and bitter feelings which now darkened the face of Marston with an almost perpetual gloom His habits became even more unsocial than before The society of his son he no longer seemed to enjoy Long and solitary rambles in his wild and extensive demesne consumed the listless hours or his waking existence and when the weather prevented this he shut himself up upon pretence of business in his study He had not since the occasion we have already mentioned referred to the intended departure of Mademoiselle de Barras Truth to say his feelings with respect to that young lady were of a conflicting and mysterious kind and as often as his dark thoughts wandered to her which indeed was frequently enough his muttered exclamation seemed to imply some painful and horrible suspicions respecting her Yes he would mutter I thought I heard your light foot upon the lobby on that accursed night Fancy Well it may have been but assuredly a strange fancy I cannot comprehend that woman She baffles my scrutiny I have looked into her face with an eye she might well understand were it indeed as I sometimes suspect and she has been calm and unmoved I have watched and studied her still doubt doubt hideous doubt is she what she seems or a tigress missus Marston on the other hand procrastinated from day to day the painful task of announcing to Mademoiselle de Barras the stern message with which she had been charged by her husband And thus several weeks had passed and she began to think that his silence upon the subject notwithstanding his seeing the young French lady at breakfast every morning amounted to a kind of tacit intimation that the sentence of banishment was not to be carried into immediate execution but to be kept suspended over the unconscious offender It was now six or eight weeks since the hearse carrying away the remains of the ill fated Sir Wynston Berkley had driven down the dusky avenue the autumn was deepening into winter and as Marston gloomily trod the woods of Gray Forest the withered leaves whirled drearily along his pathway and the gusts that swayed the mighty branches above him were rude and ungenial It was a bleak and somber day and as he broke into a long and picturesque vista deep among the most sequestered woods he suddenly saw before him and scarcely twenty paces from the spot on which he stood an apparition which for some moments absolutely froze him to the earth Travel soiled tattered pale and wasted John Merton the murderer stood before him He did not exhibit the smallest disposition to turn about and make his escape On the contrary he remained perfectly motionless looking upon his former master with a wild and sorrowful gaze Marston twice or thrice essayed to speak his face was white as death and had he beheld the specter of the murdered baronet himself he could not have met the sight with a countenance of ghastlier horror Take me sir said Merton doggedly Still Marston did not stir Arrest me sir in God s name here I am he repeated dropping his arms by his side I ll go with you wherever you tell me Murderer cried Marston with a sudden burst of furious horror murderer assassin miscreant take that And as he spoke he discharged one of the pistols he always carried about him full at the wretched man The shot did not take effect and Merton made no other gesture but to clasp his hands together with an agonized pressure while his head sunk upon his breast Shoot me shoot me he said hoarsely kill me like a dog better for me to be dead than what I am The report of Marston s pistol had however reached another ear and its ringing echoes had hardly ceased to vibrate among the trees when a stern shout was heard not fifty yards away and breathless and amazed Charles Marston sprang to the place His father looked from Merton to him and from him again to Merton with a guilty and stupefied scowl still holding the smoking pistol in his hand What how Good God Merton ejaculated Charles Aye sir Merton ready to go to gaol or wherever you will said the man recklessly A murderer a madman don t believe him muttered Marston scarce audibly with lips as white as wax Do you surrender yourself Merton demanded the young man sternly advancing toward him Yes sir I desire nothing more God knows I wish to die responded he despairingly and advancing slowly to meet Charles Come then said young Marston seizing him by the collar come quietly to the house Guilty and unhappy man you are now my prisoner and depend upon it I shall not let you go I don t want to go I tell you sir I have traveled fifteen miles today to come here and give myself up to the master Accursed madman said Marston unconsciously gazing at the prisoner and then suddenly rousing himself he said Well miscreant you wish to die and by you are in a fair way to have your wish So best said the man doggedly I don t want to live I wish I was in my grave I wish I was dead a year ago Some fifteen minutes afterwards Merton accompanied by Marston and his son Charles entered the hall of the mansion which not ten weeks before he had quitted under circumstances so guilty and terrible When they reached the house Merton seemed much agitated and wept bitterly on seeing two or three of his former fellow servants who looked on him in silence as they passed with a gloomy and fearful curiosity These too were succeeded by others peeping and whispering and upon one pretence or another crossing and re crossing the hall and stealing hurried glances at the criminal Merton sate with his face buried in his hands sobbing and taking no note of the humiliating scrutiny of which he was the subject Meanwhile Marston pale and agitated made out his committal and having sworn in several of his laborers and servants as special constables dispatched the prisoner in their charge to the county gaol where under lock and key we leave him in safe custody for the present After this event Marston became excited and restless He scarcely ate or slept and his health seemed now as much scattered as his spirits had been before One day he glided into the room in which as we have said it was missus Marston s habit frequently to sit alone His wife was there and as he entered she uttered an exclamation of doubtful joy and surprise He sate down near her in silence and for some time looked gloomily on the ground She did not care to question him and anxiously waited until he should open the conversation At length he raised his eyes and looking full at her asked abruptly Well what about mademoiselle missus Marston was embarrassed and hesitated I told you what I wished with respect to that young lady some time ago and commissioned you to acquaint her with my pleasure and yet I find her still here and apparently as much established as ever Again missus Marston hesitated She scarcely knew how to confess to him that she had not conveyed his message Don t suppose Gertrude that I wish to find fault I merely wanted to know whether you had told Mademoiselle de Barras that we were agreed as to the necessity or expediency or what you please of dispensing henceforward with her services I perceive by your manner that you have not done so I have no doubt your motive was a kind one but my decision remains unaltered and I now assure you again that I wish you to speak to her I wish you explicitly to let her know my wishes and yours Not mine Richard she answered faintly Well mine then he replied roughly we shan t quarrel about that And when how soon do you wish me to speak to her on this to both of us most painful subject asked she with a sigh Today this hour this minute if you can in short the sooner the better he replied rising I see no reason for holding it back any longer I am sorry my wishes were not complied with immediately Pray let there be no further hesitation or delay I shall expect to learn this evening that all is arranged Marston having thus spoken left her abruptly went down to his study with a swift step shut himself in and throwing himself into a great chair gave a loose to his agitation which was extreme Meanwhile missus Marston had sent for Mademoiselle de Barras anxious to get through her painful task as speedily as possible The fair French girl quickly presented herself Sit down mademoiselle said missus Marston taking her hand kindly and drawing her to the prie dieu chair beside herself Mademoiselle de Barras sate down and as she did so read the countenance of her patroness with one rapid glance of her flashing eyes These eyes however when missus Marston looked at her the next moment were sunk softly and sadly upon the floor There was a heightened color however in her cheek and a quicker heaving of her bosom which indicated the excitement of an anticipated and painful disclosure The outward contrast of the two women whose hands were so lovingly locked together was almost as striking as the moral contrast of their hearts The one so chastened sad and gentle the other so capable of pride and passion so darkly excitable and yet so mysteriously beautiful The one like a Niobe seen in the softest moonshine the other a Venus lighted in the glare of distant conflagration Mademoiselle dear mademoiselle I am so much grieved at what I have to say that I hardly know how to speak to you said poor missus Marston pressing her hand but mister Marston has twice desired me to tell you what you will hear with far less pain than it costs me to say it Mademoiselle de Barras stole another flashing glance at her companion but did not speak mister Marston still persists mademoiselle in desiring that we shall part Est il possible cried the Frenchwoman with a genuine start Indeed mademoiselle you may well be surprised said missus Marston encountering her full and dilated gaze which however dropped again in a moment to the ground You may indeed naturally be surprised and shocked at this to me most severe decision When did he speak last of it said she rapidly But a few moments since answered missus Marston Ha said mademoiselle and remained silent and motionless for more than a minute Madame she cried at last mournfully I suppose then I must go but it tears my heart to leave you and dear Miss Rhoda I would be very happy if before departing you would permit me dear madame once more to assure mister Marston of my innocence and in his presence to call heaven to witness how unjust are all his suspicions Do so mademoiselle and I will add my earnest assurances again though heaven knows she said despondingly I anticipate little success but it is well to leave no chance untried Marston was sitting as we have said in his library His agitation had given place to a listless gloom and he leaned back in his chair his head supported by his hand and undisturbed except by the occasional fall of the embers upon the hearth There was a knock at the chamber door His back was towards it and without turning or moving he called to the applicant to enter The door opened closed again a light tread was audible a tall shadow darkened the wall Marston looked round and Mademoiselle de Barras was standing before him Without knowing how or why he rose and stood gazing upon her in silence Mademoiselle de Barras he said at last in a tone of cold surprise Yes poor Mademoiselle de Barras replied the sweet voice of the young Frenchwoman while her lips hardly moved as the melancholy tones passed them Well mademoiselle what do you desire he asked in the same cold accents and averting his eyes Ah monsieur do you ask can you pretend to be ignorant Have you not sent me a message a cruel cruel message She spoke so low and gently that a person at the other end of the room could hardly have heard her words Yes Mademoiselle de Barras I did send you a message he replied doggedly A cruel one you will scarcely presume to call it when you reflect upon your own conduct and the circumstances which have provoked the measures I have taken What have I done Monsieur what circumstances do you mean asked she plaintively What have you done A pretty question truly Ha ha he repeated bitterly and then added with suppressed vehemence ask your own heart mademoiselle I have asked I do ask and my heart answers nothing she replied raising her fine melancholy eyes for a moment to his face It lies then he retorted with a fierce scoff Monsieur before heaven I swear you wrong me foully she said earnestly clasping her hands together Did ever woman say she was accused rightly mademoiselle retorted Marston with a sneer I don t know I don t care I only know that I am innocent continued she piteously I call heaven to witness you have wronged me Wronged you why after all with what have I charged you said he scoffingly but let that pass I have formed my opinions arrived at my conclusions If I have not named them broadly you at least seem to understand their nature thoroughly I know the world I am no novice in the arts of women mademoiselle Reserve your vows and attestations for schoolboys and simpletons they are sadly thrown away upon me Marston paced to and fro with his hands thrust into his pockets as he thus spoke Then you don t or rather you will not believe what I tell you said she imploringly No he answered drily and slowly as he passed her I don t and I won t as you say believe one word of it so pray spare yourself further trouble about the matter She raised her head and darted after him a glance that seemed absolutely to blaze and at the same time smote her little hand fast clenched upon her breast The words however that trembled on her pale lips were not uttered her eyes were again cast down and her fingers played with the little locket that hung round her neck I must make before I go she said with a deep sigh and a melancholy voice one confidence one last confidence judge me by it You cannot choose but believe me now it is a secret and it must even here be whispered whispered whispered As she spoke the color fled from her face and her tones became so strange and resolute that Marston turned short upon his heel and stopped before her She looked in his face he frowned but lowered his eyes She drew nearer laid her hand upon his shoulder and whispered for a few moments in his ear He raised his face suddenly its features were sharp and fixed its hue was changed it was livid and moveless like a face cut in gray stone He staggered back a little and a little more and then a little more and fell backward Fortunately the chair in which he had been sitting received him and he lay there insensible as a corpse When at last his eyes opened there was no gleam of triumph no shade of anger nothing perceptible of guilt or menace in the young woman s countenance The flush had returned to her cheeks her dimpled chin had sunk upon her full white throat sorrow shame and pride seemed struggling in her handsome face and she stood before him like a beautiful penitent who has just made a strange and humbling shrift to her father confessor Next day Marston was mounting his horse for a solitary ride through his park when Doctor Danvers rode abruptly into the courtyard from the back entrance Marston touched his hat and said I don t stand on forms with you doctor and you I know will waive ceremony with me You will find missus Marston at home Nay my dear sir interrupted the clergyman sitting firm in his saddle my business lies with you today The devil it does said Marston with discontented surprise Truly it does sir repeated he with a look of gentle reproof for the profanity of Marston s ejaculation far more than the rudeness of his manner offended him and I grieve that your surprise should have somewhat carried you away Well then Doctor Danvers interrupted Marston drily and without heeding his concluding remark if you really have business with me it is at all events of no very pressing kind and may be as well told after supper as now So pray go into the house and rest yourself we can talk together in the evening My horse is not tired said the clergyman patting his steed s neck and if you do not object I will ride by your side for a short time and as we go I can say out what I have to tell Well well be it so said Marston with suppressed impatience and without more ceremony he rode slowly along the avenue and turned off upon the soft sward in the direction of the wildest portion of his wooded demesne the clergyman keeping close beside him They proceeded some little way at a walk before Doctor Danvers spoke I have been twice or thrice with that unhappy man at length he said What unhappy man Unhappiness is no distinguishing singularity is it said Marston sharply No truly you have well said replied Doctor Danvers True it is that man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward I speak however of your servant Merton a most unhappy wretch Ha you have been with him you say replied Marston with evident interest and anxiety Yes several times and conversed with him long and gravely continued the clergyman Humph I thought that had been the chaplain s business not yours my good friend observed Marston He has been unwell replied doctor Danvers and thus for a day or two I took his duty and this poor man Merton having known something of me preferred seeing me rather than a stranger and so at the chaplain s desire and his I continued my visits Well and you have taught him to pray and sing psalms I suppose and what has come of it all demanded Marston testily He does pray indeed poor man and I trust his prayers are heard with mercy at the throne of grace said his companion in his earnestness disregarding the sneering tone of his companion He is full of compunction and admits his guilt Ho that is well well for himself well for his soul at least you are sure of it he confesses confesses his guilt Marston put his question so rapidly and excitedly that the clergyman looked with a slight expression of surprise and recovering himself he added in an unconcerned tone Well well it was just as well he did so the evidence is too clear for doubt or mystification he knew he had no chance and has taken the seemliest course and doubtless the best for his hopes hereafter I did not question him upon the subject said Doctor Danvers I even declined to hear him speak upon it at first but he told me he was resolved to offer no defense and that he saw the finger of God in the fate which had overtaken him He will plead guilty then I suppose suggested Marston watching the countenance of his companion with an anxious and somewhat sinister eye His words seem to imply so much answered he and having thus frankly owned his guilt and avowed his resolution to let the law take its due course in his case without obstruction or evasion I urged him to complete the grand work he had begun and to confess to you or to some other magistrate fully and in detail every circumstance connected with the perpetration of the dreadful deed Marston knit his brows and rode on for some minutes in silence At length he said abruptly In this it seems to me sir you a little exceeded your commission How so my dear sir asked the clergyman Why sir answered Marston the man may possibly change his mind before the day of trial and it is the hangman s office not yours my good sir to fasten the halter about his neck You will pardon my freedom but were this deposition made as you suggest it would undoubtedly hang him God forbid mister Marston rejoined Danvers that I should induce the unhappy man to forfeit his last chances of escape and to shut the door of human mercy against himself but on this he seems already resolved he says so he has solemnly declared his resolution to me and even against my warning again and again reiterated the same declaration That I should have thought quite enough were I in your place without inviting a detailed description of the whole process by which this detestable butchery was consummated What more than the simple knowledge of the man s guilt does any mortal desire guilty or not guilty is the plain question which the law asks and no more take my advice sir as a poor Protestant layman and leave the acts of the confessional and inquisition to Popish priests Nay mister Marston you greatly misconceive me as matters stand there exists among the coroner s jury and thus among the public some faint and unfounded suspicion of the possibility of Merton s having had an accessory or accomplice in the perpetration of this foul murder It is a lie sir a malignant d d lie the jury believe no such thing nor the public neither said Marston starting in his saddle and speaking in a voice of thunder you have been crammed with lies sir malicious unmeaning vindictive lies lies invented to asperse my family and torture my feelings suggested in my presence by that scoundrel Mervyn and scouted by the common sense of the jury I do assure you replied Doctor Danvers in a voice which seemed scarcely audible after the stunning and passionate explosion of Marston s wrath I did not imagine that you could feel thus sorely upon the point nay I thought that you yourself were not without such painful doubts Again I tell you sir said Marston in a tone somewhat calmer but no less stern such doubts as you describe have no existence your unsuspecting ear has been alarmed by a vindictive wretch an old scoundrel who has scarce a passion left but spite towards me few such there are thank God few such villains as would from a man s very calamities distil poison to kill the peace and character of his family I am sorry mister Marston said the clergyman you have formed so ill an opinion of a neighbor and I am very sure that mister Mervyn meant you no ill in frankly expressing whatever doubts still rested on his mind after the evidence was taken He did the scoundrel said Marston furiously striking his hand in which his whip was clutched upon his thigh he did mean to wound and torture me and with the same object he persists in circulating what he calls his doubts Meant me no ill forsooth why my great God sir could any man be so stupid as not to perceive that the suggestion of such suspicions absurd contradictory incredible as they were was precisely the thing to exasperate feelings sufficiently troubled already and not content with raising the question where it was scouted as I said as soon as named the vindictive slanderer proceeds to propagate and publish his pretended surmises d n him mister Marston you will pardon me when I say that as a Christian minister I cannot suffer a spirit so ill as that you manifest and language so unseemly as that you have just uttered to pass unreproved said Danvers solemnly If you will cherish those bitter and unchristian feelings at least for the brief space that I am with you command your fierce unbecoming words Marston was about to make a sneering retort but restrained himself and turned his head away The wretched man himself appears now very anxious to make some further disclosures resumed Doctor Danvers after a pause and I recommended him to make them to you mister Marston as the most natural depository of such a statement Well mister Danvers to cut the matter short as it appears that a confession of some sort is to be made be it so I will attend and receive it The judges will not be here for eight or ten weeks to come so there is no great hurry about it I shall ride down to the town and see him in the jail some time in the next week With this assurance Marston parted from the old clergyman and rode on alone through the furze and fern of his wild and somber park After supper that evening Marston found himself alone in the parlor with his wife missus Marston availed herself of the opportunity to redeem her pledge to Mademoiselle de Barras She was not aware of the strange interview which had taken place between him and the lady for whom she pleaded The result of her renewed entreaties perhaps the reader has anticipated Marston listened doubted listened hesitated again put questions pondered the answers debated the matter inwardly and at last gruffly consented to give the young lady another trial and permit her to remain some time longer Poor missus Marston little suspecting the dreadful future overwhelmed her husband with gratitude for granting to her entreaties as he had predetermined to do this fatal boon Not caring to protract this scene either from a disinclination to listen to expressions of affection which had long lost their charm for him and had become even positively distasteful or perhaps from some instinctive recoil from the warm expression of gratitude from lips which were the truth revealed might justly have trembled with execration and reproach he abruptly left the room and missus Marston full of her good news hastened in the kindness of her heart to communicate the fancied result of her advocacy to Mademoiselle de Barras It was about a week after this that Marston was one evening surprised in his study by the receipt of the following letter from doctor Danvers My Dear Sir You will be shocked to hear that Merton is most dangerously ill and at this moment in imminent peril He is thoroughly conscious of his situation and himself regards it as a merciful interposition of Providence to spare him the disgrace and terror of the dreadful fate which he anticipated The unhappy man has twice repeated his anxious desire this day to state some facts connected with the murder of the late Sir Wynston Berkley which he says it is of the utmost moment that you should hear He says that he could not leave the world in peace without having made this disclosure which he especially desires to make to yourself and entreats that you will come to receive his communication as early as you can in the morning This is indeed needful as the physician says that he is fast sinking I offer no apology for adding my earnest solicitations to those or the dying man and am dear sir your very obedient servant J Danvers He regards it as a merciful interposition of Providence muttered Marston as he closed the letter with a sneer Well some men have odd notions of mercy and providence to be sure but if it pleases him certainly I shall not complain for one Marston was all this evening in better spirits than he had enjoyed for months or even years A mountain seemed to have been lifted from his heart He joined in the conversation during and after supper listened with apparent interest talked with animation and even laughed and jested It is needless to say all this flowed not from the healthy cheer of a heart at ease but from the excited and almost feverish sense of sudden relief Next morning Marston rode into the old fashioned town at the further end of which the dingy and grated front of the jail looked warningly out upon the rustic passengers He passed the sentries and made his inquiries of the official at the hatch He was relieved from the necessity of pushing these into detail however by the appearance of the physician who at that moment passed from the interior of the prison doctor Danvers told me he expected to see you here this morning said the medical man after the customary salutation had been interchanged Your call I believe is connected with the prisoner John Merton Yes sir so it is said Marston Is he in a condition pray to make a statement of considerable length Far from it mister Marston he has but a few hours to live answered the physician and is now insensible but I believe he last night saw doctor Danvers and told him whatever was weighing upon his mind Ha And can you say where doctor Danvers now is inquired Marston anxiously and hurriedly Not here is he No but I saw him as I came here not ten minutes since ride into the town It is market day and you will probably find him somewhere in the high street for an hour or two to come answered he Marston thanked him and lost in abstraction rode down to the little inn entered a sitting room and wrote a hurried line to doctor Danvers entreating his attendance there as a place where they might converse less interruptedly than in the street and committing this note to the waiter with the injunction to deliver it at once and an intimation of where doctor Danvers was probably to be found he awaited with intense and agitating anxiety the arrival of the clergyman It was not for nearly ten minutes however which his impatience magnified into an eternity that the well known voice of doctor Danvers reached him from the little hall It was in vain that Marston strove to curb his violent agitation his heart swelled as if it would smother him he felt as it were the chill of death pervade his frame and he could scarcely see the door through which he momentarily expected the entrance of the clergyman A few minutes more and doctor Danvers entered the little apartment My dear sir said he gravely and earnestly as he grasped the cold hand of Marston I am rejoiced to see you I have matters of great moment and the strangest mystery to lay before you I dare say I was sure that is I suspected so much answered Marston breathing fast and looking very pale I heard at the prison that the murderer Merton was fast dying and now is in an unconscious state and from the physician that you had seen him at his urgent entreaty last night My mind misgives me sir I fear I know not what I long yet dread to hear the wretched man s confession For God s sake tell me does it implicate anybody else in the guilt No no one specifically but it has thrown a hideous additional mystery over the occurrence Listen to me my dear sir and the whole narrative as he stated it to me shall be related now to you said doctor Danvers Marston had closed the door carefully and they sate down together at the further end of the apartment Marston breathless and ghastly pale his lips compressed his brows knit and his dark dilated gaze fixed immovably upon the speaker doctor Danvers on the other hand tranquil and solemn and with perhaps some shade of awe overcasting the habitual sweetness of his countenance His confession was a strange one renewed doctor Danvers shaking his head gravely He said that the first idea of the crime was suggested by Sir Wynston s man accidentally mentioning a few days after their arrival that his master slept with his bank notes to the amount of some hundreds of pounds in a pocketbook under his pillow He declared that as the man mentioned this circumstance something muttered the infernal suggestion in his ear and from that moment he was the slave of that one idea it was ever present with him He contended against it in vain he dreaded and abhorred it but still it possessed him he felt his power of resistance yielding This horrible stranger which had stolen into his heart waxed in power and importunity and tormented him day and night He resolved to fly from the house He gave notice to you and missus Marston of his intended departure but accident protracted his stay until that fatal night which sealed his doom The influence which had mastered him forced him to rise from his bed and take the knife the discovery of which afterwards helped to convict him and led him to Sir Wynston s chamber he entered it was a moonlight night Here the clergyman glancing round the room lowered his voice and advanced his lips so near to Marston that their heads nearly touched In this tone and attitude he continued his narrative for a few minutes At the end of this brief space Marston rose up slowly and with a movement backward every feature strung with horror and saying in a long whisper the one word yes which seemed like the hiss of a snake before he makes his last deadly spring Both were silent for a time At last Marston broke out with hoarse vehemence Dreadful horrible oh God God My God How frightful And throwing himself into a chair he clasped his hands across his eyes and forehead while the sweat of agony literally poured down his pale face Truly it is so said the clergyman scarcely above his breath and after a long interval horrible indeed Well said Marston rising suddenly to his feet wiping the dews of horror from his face and looking wildly round like one newly awoke from a nightmare I must make the most of this momentous and startling disclosure I shall spare no pains to come at the truth said he energetically Meanwhile my dear sir for the sake of justice and of mercy observe secrecy Leave me to sift this matter give no note anywhere that we suspect Observe this reserve and security and with it detection will follow Breathe but one word and you arm the guilty with double caution and turn licentious gossip loose upon the fame of an innocent and troubled family Once more I entreat I expect I implore silence silence at least for the present silence I quite agree with you my dear mister Marston answered doctor Danvers I have not divulged one syllable of that poor wretch s confession save to yourself alone You as a magistrate a relative of the murdered gentleman and the head of that establishment among whom the guilt rests are invested with an interest in detecting and powers of sifting the truth in this matter such as none other possesses I clearly see with you too the inexpediency and folly of talking for talking s sake of this affair I mean to keep my counsel and shall most assuredly irrespectively even of your request which should however of course have weight with me maintain a strict and cautious silence upon this subject Some little time longer they remained together and Marston buried in strange thoughts took his leave and rode slowly back to Gray Forest Months passed away a year and more and though no new character appeared upon the stage the relations which had subsisted among the old ones became in some respects very materially altered A gradual and disagreeable change came over Mademoiselle de Barras s manner her affectionate attentions to missus Marston became less and less frequent nor was the change merely confined to this growing coldness there was something of a positive and still more unpleasant kind in the alteration we have noted There was a certain independence and carelessness conveyed in a hundred intangible but significant little incidents and looks a something which without being open to formal rebuke or remonstrance yet bordered in effect upon impertinence and even insolence This indescribable and provoking self assertion implied in glances tones emphasis and general bearing surprised missus Marston far more than it irritated her As often as she experienced one of these studied slights or insinuated impertinences she revolved in her own mind all the incidents of their past intercourse in the vain endeavor to recollect some one among them which could possibly account for the offensive change so manifest in the conduct of the young Frenchwoman missus Marston although she sometimes rebuked these artful affronts by a grave look a cold tone or a distant manner yet had too much dignity to engage in a petty warfare of annoyance and had in reality no substantial and well defined ground of complaint against her such as would have warranted her either in taking the young lady herself to task or in bringing her conduct under the censure of Marston One evening it happened that missus Marston and Mademoiselle de Barras had been left alone together After the supper party had dispersed they had been for a long time silent missus Marston resolved to improve the Tate a Tate for the purpose of eliciting from mademoiselle an explanation of her strange behavior Mademoiselle said she I have lately observed a very marked change in your conduct to me Indeed said the Frenchwoman Yes mademoiselle you must be yourself perfectly aware of that change it is a studied and intentional one continued missus Marston in a gentle but dignified tone Although I have felt some doubt as to whether it were advisable so long as you observe toward me the forms of external respect and punctually discharge the duties you have undertaken to open any discussion whatever upon the subject yet I have thought it better to give you a fair opportunity of explaining frankly should you desire to do so the feelings and impressions under which you are acting Ah you are very obliging madame said she coolly It is quite clear mademoiselle that you have either misunderstood me or that you are dissatisfied with your situation among us your conduct cannot otherwise be accounted for said missus Marston gravely My conduct ma foi what conduct retorted the handsome Frenchwoman confidently and with a disdainful glance If you question the fact mademoiselle said the elder lady it is enough Your ungracious manner and ungentle looks I presume arise from what appears to you a sufficient and well defined cause of which however I know nothing I really was not aware said Mademoiselle de Barras with a supercilious smile that my looks and my manner were subjected to so strict a criticism or that it was my duty to regulate both according to so nice and difficult a standard Well mademoiselle continued missus Marston it is plain that whatever may be the cause of your dissatisfaction you are resolved against confiding it to me I only wish to know frankly from your own lips whether you have formed a wish to leave this situation If so I entreat you to declare it freely You are very obliging indeed madame said the pretty foreigner drily but I have no such wish at least at present Very well mademoiselle replied missus Marston with gentle dignity I regret your want of candor on your own account You would I am sure be much happier were you to deal frankly with me May I now have your permission madame to retire to my room asked the French girl rising and making a low courtesy that is if madame has nothing further to censure Certainly mademoiselle I have nothing further to say replied the elder lady The Frenchwoman made another and a deeper courtesy and withdrew missus Marston however heard as she was designed to do the young lady tittering and whispering to herself as she lighted her candle in the hall This scene mortified and grieved poor missus Marston inexpressibly She was little if at all accessible to emotions of anger and certainly none such mingled in the feelings with which she regarded Mademoiselle de Barras But she had found in this girl a companion and even a confidante in her melancholy solitude she had believed her affectionate sympathetic tender and the disappointment was as bitter as unimagined The annoyances which she was fated to receive from Mademoiselle de Barras were destined however to grow in number and in magnitude The Frenchwoman sometimes took a fancy for some unrevealed purpose to talk a good deal to missus Marston and on such occasions would persist notwithstanding that lady s marked reserve and discouragement in chatting away as if she were conscious that her conversation was the most welcome entertainment possible to her really unwilling auditor No one of their interviews did she ever suffer to close without in some way or other suggesting or insinuating something mysterious and untold to the prejudice of mister Marston Those vague and intangible hints the meaning of which for an instant legible and terrific seemed in another moment to dissolve and disappear tortured missus Marston like the intrusion of a specter and this along with the portentous change rather felt than visible in mademoiselle s conduct toward her invested the beautiful Frenchwoman in the eyes of her former friend and patroness with an indefinable character that was not only repulsive but formidable missus Marston s feelings with respect to this person were still further disturbed by the half conveyed hints and innuendoes of her own maid who never lost an opportunity of insinuating her intense dislike of the Frenchwoman and appeared perpetually to be upon the very verge of making some explicit charges or some shocking revelations respecting her which however she as invariably evaded and even when missus Marston once or twice insisted upon her explaining her meaning distinctly she eluded her mistress s desire and left her still in the same uneasy uncertainty Marston on his part however much his conduct might tend to confirm suspicion certainly did nothing to dissipate the painful and undefined apprehension respecting himself which Mademoiselle de Barras with such malign and mysterious industry labored to raise His spirits and temper were liable to strange fluctuations In the midst of that excited gaiety to which until lately he had been so long a stranger would sometimes intervene paroxysms of the blackest despair all the ghastlier for the contrast and with a suddenness so abrupt and overwhelming that one might have fancied him crossed by the shadow of some terrific apparition Sometimes for a whole day or even more he would withdraw himself from the society of his family and in morose and moody solitude take his meals alone in his library and steal out unattended to wander among the thickets and glades of his park Sometimes again he would sit for hours in the room which had been Sir Wynston s and with a kind of horrible resolution often loiter there till after nightfall In such hours the servants would listen with curious awe as they heard his step pacing to and fro in that deserted and inauspicious chamber while his voice in broken sentences was also imperfectly audible as if maintaining a muttered dialogue These eccentric practices gradually invested him in the eyes of his domestics with a certain preternatural mystery which enhanced the fear with which they habitually regarded him and was subsequently confirmed by his giving orders to have the furniture taken out of the ominous suite of rooms and the doors nailed up and secured He gave no reason for this odd and abrupt measure and gossip of course reported that the direction had originated in his having encountered the specter of the murdered baronet in one of these strange and unseasonable visits to the scene of the fearful catastrophe In addition to all this Marston s conduct towards his wife became strangely capricious He avoided her society more than ever and when he did happen to exchange a few words with her they were sometimes harsh and violent and at others remorsefully gentle and sad and this without any changes of conduct upon her part to warrant the wayward uncertainty of his treatment Under all these circumstances missus Marston s unhappiness and uneasiness greatly increased Mademoiselle de Barras too upon several late occasions had begun to assume a tone of authority and dictation which justly offended the mistress of the establishment Meanwhile Charles Marston had returned to Cambridge and Rhoda no longer enjoying happy walks with her brother pursued her light and easy studies with Mademoiselle de Barras and devoted her leisure hours to the loved society of her mother One day missus Marston sitting in her room with Rhoda had happened to call her own maid to take down and carefully dust some richly bound volumes which filled a bookcase in the little chamber You have been crying Willett said missus Marston observing that the young woman s eyes were red and swollen Indeed and I was ma am she replied reluctantly and I could not help it so I could not Why what has happened to vex you Has anyone ill treated you said missus Marston who had an esteem for the poor girl Come come you must not fret about it only tell me what has vexed you Oh Ma am no one has ill used me ma am but I can t but be vexed sometimes ma am and fretted to see how things is going on I have one wish just one wish ma am and if I got that I d ask no more said the girl And what is it asked missus Marston what do you wish for Speak plainly Willett what is it Ah Ma am if I said it maybe you might not be pleased Don t ask me ma am said the girl dusting the books very hard and tossing them down again with angry emphasis I don t desire anybody s harm God knows but for all that I wish what I wish and that is the truth Why Willett I really cannot account for your strange habit of lately hinting and insinuating and always speaking riddles and refusing to explain your meaning What do you mean Speak plainly If there are any dishonest practices going on it is your duty to say so distinctly Oh Ma am it is just a wish I have I wish but it s no matter If I could once see the house clear of that Frenchwoman If you mean Mademoiselle de Barras she is a lady interrupted missus Marston Well ma am I beg pardon continued the woman lady or no lady it is all one to me for I am very sure ma am she ll never leave the house till there is something bad comes about and and I can t bring myself to talk to you about her ma am I can t say what I want to tell you but but Oh ma am for God s sake try and get her out any way no matter how try and get rid of her As she said this the poor girl burst into a passionate agony of tears and missus Marston and Rhoda looked on in silent amazement while she for some minutes continued to sob and weep The party were suddenly recalled from their various reveries by a knock at the chamber door It opened and the subject of the girl s deprecatory entreaty entered There was something unusually excited and assured in Mademoiselle de Barras s air and countenance perhaps she had a suspicion that she had been the topic of their conversation At all events she looked round upon them with a smile in which there was something supercilious and even defiant and without waiting to be invited sate herself down with a haughty air I was about to ask you to sit down mademoiselle but you have anticipated me said missus Marston gravely You have something to say to me I suppose I am quite at leisure so pray let me hear it now Thank you thank you madame replied she with a sharp and even scornful glance I ought to have asked your permission to sit I forgot but you have condescended to give it without my doing so that was very kind very kind indeed But I wish to know mademoiselle whether you have anything very particular to say to me said missus Marston You wish to know and why pray madame asked Mademoiselle de Barras sharply Because unless it is something very urgent I should prefer your talking to me some other time as at present I desire to be alone with my daughter Oh ho I ought to ask pardon again said mademoiselle with the same glance and the same smile I find I am de trop quite in the way Helas I am very unfortunate today Mademoiselle de Barras made not the slightest movement and it was evident that she was resolved to prolong her stay in sheer defiance of missus Marston s wishes Mademoiselle I conclude from your silence that you have nothing very pressing to say and therefore must request that you will have the goodness to leave me for the present said missus Marston who felt that the spirit of the French girl s conduct was too apparent not to have been understood by Rhoda and the servant and that it was of a kind for example sake impossible to be submitted to or tolerated Mademoiselle de Barras darted a fiery and insolent glance at missus Marston and was doubtless upon the point of precipitating the open quarrel which was impending by setting her authority at defiance but she checked herself and changed her line of operations We are not alone madame she said with a heightened color and a slight toss of the head I was about to speak of mister Marston I had something not much I confess to say but before servants I shan t speak nor indeed now at all So madame as you desire it I shall no further interrupt you Come Miss Rhoda come to the music room if you please and finish your practice for today You forget mademoiselle that I wish to have my daughter with me at present said missus Marston I am very sorry madame said the French lady with the same heightened color and unpleasant smile and her finely penciled brows just discernibly knit so as to give a novel and menacing expression to her beautiful face I am very sorry madame but she must so long as I remain accountable for her education complete her allotted exercises at the appointed hours and nothing shall I assure you with my consent interfere with these duties Come Miss Rhoda precede me if you please to the music room Come come Stay where you are Rhoda said missus Marston firmly and gently and betraying no symptom of excitement except in a slight tremor of her voice and a faint flush upon her cheek Stay where you are my dear child I am your mother and next to your father have the first claim upon your obedience Mademoiselle she continued addressing the Frenchwoman calmly but firmly my daughter will remain here for some time longer and you will have the goodness to withdraw I insist upon it Mademoiselle de Barras I will not leave the room I assure you madame without my pupil retorted mademoiselle with resolute insolence Your husband madame has invested me with this authority and she shall obey me Miss Rhoda I say again go down to the music room Remain where you are Rhoda said missus Marston again Mademoiselle you have long been acting as if your object were to provoke me to part with you I find it impossible any longer to overlook this grossly disrespectful conduct conduct of which I had indeed believed you absolutely incapable Willett she continued addressing the maid who was evidently bursting with rage at the scene she had just witnessed your master is I believe in the library go down and tell him that I entreat him to come here immediately The maid started on her mission with angry alacrity darting a venomous glance at the handsome Frenchwoman as she passed Mademoiselle de Barras meanwhile sate listless and defiant in her chair and tapping her little foot with angry excitement upon the floor Rhoda sate close by her mother holding her hand fast and looking frightened perplexed and as if she were on the point of weeping missus Marston though flushed and excited yet maintained her dignified and grave demeanor And thus in silence did they all three await the arrival of the arbiter to whom missus Marston had so promptly appealed A few minutes more and Marston entered the room Mademoiselle s expression changed as he did so to one of dejected and sorrowful submission and as Marston s eye lighted upon her his brow darkened and his face grew pale Well well what is it What is all this he said glancing with a troubled eye from one to the other Speak someone missus Marston you sent for me what is it I want to know mister Marston from your own lips said the lady in reply whether Rhoda is to obey me or Mademoiselle de Barras Bah A question of women s prerogative said Marston with muttered vehemence Of a wife s and a mother s prerogative Richard said missus Marston with gentle emphasis A very simple question and one I should have thought needing no deliberation to decide it Well child sad he turning to Rhoda with angry irony pray what is all this fuss about You are a very ill used young lady I dare aver Pray what cruelties does Mademoiselle de Barras propose inflicting upon you that you need to appeal thus to your mother for protection You quite mistake me Richard interposed missus Marston Rhoda is perfectly passive in the matter I simply wish to learn from you in mademoiselle s presence whether I or she is to command my daughter Command said Marston evading the direct appeal and pray what is all this commanding about What do you want the girl to do I wish her to remain here with me for a little time and mademoiselle knowing this desires her instantly to go to the music room and leave me That is all said missus Marston And pray is there nothing to make her going to the music room advisable or necessary Has she no music to learn or studies to pursue Pshaw missus Marston what needs all this noise about nothing Go miss he added sharply and peremptorily addressing Rhoda go this moment to the music room The girl glided from the room and mademoiselle as she followed shot a glance at missus Marston which wounded and humbled her in the dust Oh Richard Richard if you knew all you would not have subjected me to this indignity she said and throwing her arms about his neck she wept for the first time for many a long year upon his breast Marston was embarrassed and agitated He disengaged her arms from his neck and placed her gently in a chair She sobbed on for some time in silence a silence which Marston himself did not essay to break He walked to the door apparently with the intention of leaving her He hesitated however and returned took a hurried turn through the room hesitated again sat down then returned to the door not to depart but to close it carefully and walked gloomily to the window whence he looked forth buried in agitating and absorbing thoughts Richard to you this seems a trifling thing but indeed it is not so said missus Marston sadly You are very right Gertrude he said quickly and almost with a start it is very far from a trifling thing it is very important You don t blame me Richard said she I blame nobody said he Indeed I never meant to offend you Richard she urged Of course not no no I never said so he interrupted sarcastically what could you gain by that Oh Richard better feelings have governed me she said in a melancholy and reproachful tone Well well I suppose so he said and after an interval he added abstractedly This cannot however go on no no it cannot Sooner or later it must have come better at once better now What do you mean Richard she said greatly alarmed she knew not why What are you resolving upon Dear Richard in mercy tell me I implore of you tell me Why Gertrude you seem to me to fancy that because I don t talk about what is passing that I don t see it either Now this is quite a mistake said Marston calmly and resolutely I have long observed your growing dislike of Mademoiselle de Barras I have thought it over this fracas of today has determined me it is decisive I suppose you now wish her to go as earnestly as you once wished her to stay You need not answer I know it I neither ask nor care to whose fault I am to attribute these changed feelings female caprice accounts sufficiently for it but whatever the cause the effect is undeniable and the only way to deal satisfactorily with it is to dismiss mademoiselle at once You need take no part in the matter I take it upon myself Tomorrow morning she shall have left this house I have said it and am perfectly resolved As he thus spoke as if to avoid the possibility of any further discussion he turned abruptly from her and left the room The extreme agitation which she had just undergone combined with her physical delicacy to bring on an hysterical attack and poor missus Marston with an aching head and a heavy heart lay down upon her bed She had swallowed an opiate and before ten o clock upon that night an eventful one as it proved she had sunk into a profound slumber Some hours after this she became in a confused way conscious of her husband s presence in the room He was walking with an agitated mien up and down the chamber and casting from time to time looks of great trouble toward the bed where she lay Though the presence of her husband was a strange and long unwonted occurrence there at such an hour and though she felt the strangeness of the visit the power of the opiate overwhelmed her so that she could only see this apparition gliding slowly back and forward before her with the passive wonder and curiosity with which one awaits the issue of an interesting dream For a time she lay once more in an uneasy sleep but still throughout even this she was conscious of his presence and when a little while after she again saw him he was not walking to and fro before the foot of the bed but sitting beside her with one hand laid upon the pillow on which her head was resting the other supporting his chin He was looking steadfastly upon her with a changed face an expression of bitter sorrow compunction and tenderness There was not one trace of sternness all was softened The look was what she fancied he might have turned upon her had she lain there dead ere yet the love of their early and ill fated union had grown cold in his heart There was something in it which reminded her of days and feelings gone never to return And while she looked in his face with a sweet and mournful fascination tears unconsciously wet the pillow on which her poor head was resting Unable to speak unable to move she heard him say It was not your fault Gertrude it was not yours nor mine There is a destiny in these things too strong for us Past is past what is done is done forever and even were it all to do over again what power have I to mend it No no how could I contend against the combined power of passions circumstances influences in a word of fate You have been good and patient while I but no matter Your lot Gertrude is a happier one than mine missus Marston heard him and saw him but she had not the power nor even the will herself to speak or move He appeared before her passive sense like the phantasm of a dream He stood up at the bedside and looked on her steadfastly with the same melancholy expression For a moment he stooped over her as if about to kiss her face but checked himself stood erect again at the bedside then suddenly turned the curtain fell back into its place and she saw him no more With a strange mixture of sweet and bitter feelings this vision rested upon the memory of missus Marston until gradually deep slumber again overcame her senses and the incident and all its attendant circumstances faded into oblivion It was past eight o clock when missus Marston awoke next morning The sun was shining richly and cheerily in at the windows and as the remembrance of Marston s visit to her chamber and the unwonted manifestations of tenderness and compunction which accompanied it returned she felt something like hope and happiness to which she had long been a stranger flutter her heart The pleasing reverie to which she was yielding was however interrupted The sound of stifled sobbing in the room reached her ear and pushing back the bed curtains and leaning forward to look she saw her maid Willett sitting with her back to the wall crying bitterly and striving as it seemed to stifle her sobs with her apron which was wrapped about her face Willet Willett is it you who are sobbing What is the matter with you child said missus Marston anxiously The girl checked herself dried her eyes hastily and walking briskly to a little distance as if engaged in arranging the chamber she said with an affectation of carelessness Oh ma am it is nothing nothing at all indeed ma am missus Marston remained silent for a time while all her vague apprehensions returned Meantime the girl continued to shove the chairs hither and thither and to arrange and disarrange everything in the room with a fidgety industry intended to cover her agitation A few minutes however served to weary her of this for she abruptly stopped stood by the bedside and looking at her mistress burst into tears Good God What is it said missus Marston shocked and even terrified while new alarms displaced her old ones Is Miss Rhoda can it be is she is my darling well Oh yes ma am answered the maid very well ma am she is up and out walking and knows nothing of all this All what urged missus Marston Tell me tell me Willett what has happened What is it Speak child say what it is Oh ma am Oh my poor dear mistress continued the girl and stopped almost stifled with sobs Willett you must speak you must say what is the matter I implore of you desire you urged the distracted lady Still the girl having made one or two ineffectual efforts to speak continued to sob Willett you will drive me mad For mercy s sake for God s sake speak tell me what it is cried the unhappy lady Oh ma am it is it is about the master sobbed the girl Why he can t he has not oh merciful God He has not hurt himself she almost screamed No ma am no not himself no no but and again she hesitated But what Speak out Willett dear Willett have mercy on me and speak out cried her wretched mistress Oh ma am don t be fretted don t take it to heart ma am said the maid clasping her hands together in anguish Anything anything Willett only speak at once she answered Well ma am it is soon said it is easy told The master ma am the master is gone with the Frenchwoman they went in the traveling coach last night ma am he is gone away with her ma am that is all missus Marston looked at the girl with a gaze of stupefied stony terror not a muscle of her face moved not one heaving respiration showed that she was living Motionless with this fearful look fixed upon the girl and her thin hands stretched towards her she remained second after second At last her outstretched hands began to tremble more and more violently and as if for the first time the knowledge of this calamity had reached her with a cry as though body and soul were parting she fell back motionless in her bed Several hours had passed before missus Marston was restored to consciousness To this state of utter insensibility one of silent terrified stupor succeeded and it was not until she saw her daughter Rhoda standing at her bedside weeping that she found voice and recollection to speak My child my darling my poor child she cried sobbing piteously as she drew her to her heart and looked in her face alternately my darling my darling child Rhoda could only weep and return her poor mother s caresses in silence Too young and inexperienced to understand the full extent and nature of this direful calamity the strange occurrence the general and apparent consternation of the whole household and the spectacle of her mother s agony had filled her with fear perplexity and anguish Scared and stunned with a vague sense of danger like a young bird that for the first time cowers under a thunderstorm she nestled in her mother s bosom there with a sense of protection and of boundless love and tenderness she lay frightened wondering and weeping Two or three days passed and doctor Danvers came and sate for several hours with poor missus Marston To comfort and console were of course out of his power The nature of the bereavement far more terrible than death its recent occurrence the distracting consciousness of all its complicated consequences rendered this a hopeless task She bowed herself under the blow with the submission of a broken heart The hope to which she had clung for years had vanished the worst that ever her imagination feared had come in earnest One idea was now constantly present in her mind She felt a sad but immovable assurance that she should not live long and the thought what will become of my darling when I am gone who will guard and love my child when I am in my grave to whom is she to look for tenderness and protection then perpetually haunted her and superadded the pangs of a still wilder despair to the desolation of a broken heart It was not for more than a week after this event that one day Willett with a certain air of anxious mystery entered the silent and darkened chamber where missus Marston lay She had a letter in her hand the seal and handwriting were mister Marston s It was long before the injured wife was able to open it when she did so the following sentences met her eye Gertrude You can be ignorant neither of the nature nor of the consequences of the decisive step I have taken I do not seek to excuse it For the censure of the world its meddling and mouthing hypocrisy I care absolutely nothing I have long set it at defiance And you yourself Gertrude when you deliberately reconsider the circumstances of estrangement and coldness under which though beneath the same roof we have lived for years without either sympathy or confidence can scarcely if at all regret the rupture of a tie which had long ceased to be anything better than an irksome and galling formality I do not desire to attribute to you the smallest blame There was an incompatibility not of temper but of feelings which made us strangers though calling one another man and wife Upon this fact I rest my own justification our living together under these circumstances was I dare say equally undesired by us both It was in fact but a deference to the formal hypocrisy of the world At all events the irrevocable act which separates us forever is done and I have now merely to state so much of my intentions as may relate in anywise to your future arrangements I have written to your cousin and former guardian mister Latimer telling him how matters stand between us You I told him shall have without opposition from me the whole of your own fortune to your own separate use together with whatever shall be mutually agreed upon as reasonable from my income for your support and that of my daughter It will be necessary to complete your arrangements with expedition as I purpose returning to Gray Forest in about three weeks and as of course a meeting between you and those by whom I shall be accompanied is wholly out of the question you will see the expediency of losing no time in adjusting everything for yours and my daughter s departure In the details of course I shall not interfere I think I have made myself clearly intelligible and would recommend your communicating at once with mister Latimer with a view to completing temporary arrangements until your final plans shall have been decided upon RICHARD MARSTON The reader can easily conceive the feelings with which this letter was perused We shall not attempt to describe them nor shall we weary his patience by a detail of all the circumstances attending missus Marston s departure Suffice it to mention that in less than a fortnight after the receipt of the letter which we have just copied she had forever left the mansion of Gray Forest In a small house in a sequestered part of the rich county of Warwick the residence of missus Marston and her daughter was for the present fixed And there for a time the heart broken and desolate lady enjoyed at least the privilege of an immunity from the intrusions of all external trouble But the blow under which the feeble remains of her health and strength were gradually to sink had struck too surely home and from month to month almost from week to week the progress of decay was perceptible Meanwhile though grieved and humbled and longing to comfort his unhappy mother Charles Marston for the present absolutely dependant upon his father had no choice but to remain at Cambridge and to pursue his studies there At Gray Forest Marston and the partner of his guilt continued to live The old servants were all gradually dismissed and new ones hired by Mademoiselle de Barras There they dwelt shunned by everybody in a stricter and more desolate seclusion than ever The novelty of the unrestraint and licence of their new mode of life speedily passed away and with it the excited and guilty sense of relief which had for a time produced a false and hollow gaiety The sense of security prompted in mademoiselle a hundred indulgences which in her former precarious position she would not have dreamed of Outbreaks of temper sharp and sometimes violent began to manifest themselves on her part and renewed disappointment and blacker remorse to darken the soul of Marston himself Often in the dead of the night the servants would overhear their bitter and fierce altercations ringing through the melancholy mansion and often the reckless use of terrible and mysterious epithets of crime Their quarrels increased in violence and in frequency and before two years had passed feelings of bitterness hatred and dread alone seemed to subsist between them Yet upon Marston she continued to exercise a powerful and mysterious influence There was a dogged apathetic submission on his part and a growing insolence on hers constantly more and more strikingly visible Neglect disorder and decay too were more than ever apparent in the dreary air of the place Doctor Danvers save by rumor and conjecture knew nothing of Marston and his abandoned companion He had more than once felt a strong disposition to visit Gray Forest and expostulate face to face with its guilty proprietor This idea however he had upon consideration dismissed not on account of any shrinking from the possible repulses and affronts to which the attempt might subject him but from a thorough conviction that the endeavor would be utterly fruitless for good while it might very obviously expose him to painful misinterpretation and suspicion and leave it to be imagined that he had been influenced if by no meaner motive at least by the promptings of a coarse curiosity Meanwhile he maintained a correspondence with missus Marston and had even once or twice since her departure visited her Latterly however this correspondence had been a good deal interrupted and its intervals had been supplied occasionally by Rhoda whose letters although she herself appeared unconscious of the mournful event the approach of which they too plainly indicated were painful records of the rapid progress of mortal decay He had just received one of those ominous letters at the little post office in the town we have already mentioned and full of the melancholy news it contained doctor Danvers was returning slowly towards his home As he rode into a lonely road traversing an undulating tract of some three miles in length the singularity it may be of his costume attracted the eye of another passenger who was as it turned out no other than Marston himself For two or three miles of this desolate road their ways happened to lie together Marston s first impulse was to avoid the clergyman his second which he obeyed was to join company and ride along with him at all events for so long as would show that he shrank from no encounter which fortune or accident presented There was a spirit of bitter defiance in this which cost him a painful effort How do you do Parson Danvers said Marston touching his hat with the handle of his whip Danvers thought he had seldom seen a man so changed in so short a time His face had grown sallow and wasted and his figure slightly stooped with an appearance almost of feebleness mister Marston said the clergyman gravely and almost sternly though with some embarrassment it is a long time since you and I have seen one another and many and painful events have passed in the interval I scarce know upon what terms we meet I am prompted to speak to you and in a tone perhaps which you will hardly brook and yet if we keep company as it seems likely we may I cannot and I ought not to be silent Well mister Danvers I accept the condition speak what you will said Marston with a gloomy promptitude If you exceed your privilege and grow uncivil I need but use my spurs and leave you behind me preaching to the winds Ah mister Marston said doctor Danvers almost sadly after a considerable pause when I saw you close beside me my heart was troubled within me You looked on me as something from the nether world and expected to see the cloven hoof said Marston bitterly and raising his booted foot a little as he spoke but after all I am but a vulgar sinner of flesh and blood without enough of the preternatural about me to frighten an old nurse much less to agitate a pillar of the Church mister Marston you talk sarcastically but you feel that recent circumstances as well as old recollections might well disturb and trouble me at sight of you answered doctor Danvers Well yes perhaps it is so said Marston hastily and sullenly and became silent for a while My heart is full mister Marston charged with grief when I think of the sad history of those with whom in my mind you must ever be associated said Doctor Danvers Aye to be sure said Marston with stern impatience but then you have much to console you You have got your comforts and your respectability all the dearer too from the contrast of other people s misfortunes and degradations then you have your religion moreover Yes interrupted Danvers earnestly and hastening to avoid a sneer upon this subject God be blessed I am an humble follower of his gracious Son our Redeemer and though I trust I should bear with patient submission whatever chastisement in his wisdom and goodness he might see fit to inflict upon me yet I do praise and bless him for the mercy which has hitherto spared me and I do feel that mercy all the more profoundly from the afflictions and troubles with which I daily see others overtaken And in the matter of piety and decorum doubtless you bless God also said Marston sarcastically that you are not as other men are nor even as this publican Nay mister Marston God forbid I should harden my sinful heart with the wicked pride of the Pharisee Evil and corrupt am I already over much Too well I know the vileness of my heart to make myself righteous in my own eyes replied doctor Danvers humbly But sinner as I am I am yet a messenger of God whose mission is one of authority to his fellow sinners and woe is me if I speak not the truth at all seasons and in all places where my words may be profitably heard Well Doctor Danvers it seems you think it your duty to speak to me of course respecting my conduct and my spiritual state I shall save you the pain and trouble of opening the subject I shall state the case for you in two words said Marston almost fiercely I have put away my wife without just cause and am living in sin with another woman Come what have you to say on this theme Speak out Deal with me as roughly as you will I will hear it and answer you again Alas mister Marston And do not these things trouble you exclaimed doctor Danvers earnestly Do they not weigh heavy upon your conscience Ah sir do you not remember that slowly and surely you are drawing towards the hour of death and the Day of Judgment The hour or death Yes I know it is coming and I await it with indifference But for the Day of Judgment with its books and trumpets My dear doctor pray don t expect to frighten me with that Marston spoke with an angry scorn which had the effect of interrupting the conversation for some moments They rode on side by side for a long time without speaking At length however Marston unexpectedly broke the silence Doctor Danvers said he you asked me some time ago if I feared the hour of death and the Day of Judgment I answered you truly I do not fear them nay death I think I could meet with a happier and a quieter heart than any other chance that can befall me but there are other fears fears that do trouble me much Doctor Danvers looked inquiringly at him but neither spoke for a time You have not seen the catastrophe of the tragedy yet said Marston with a stern stony look made more horrible by a forced smile and something like a shudder I wish I could tell you you Doctor Danvers for you are honorable and gentle hearted I wish I durst tell you what I fear the only only thing I really do fear No mortal knows it but myself and I see it coming upon me with slow but unconquerable power Oh God dreadful Spirit spare me Again they were silent and again Marston resumed Doctor Danvers don t mistake me he said turning sharply and fixing his eyes with a strange expression upon his companion I dread nothing human I fear neither death nor disgrace nor eternity I have no secrets to keep no exposures to apprehend but I dread I dread He paused scowled darkly as if stung with pain turned away muttering to himself and gradually became much excited I can t tell you now sir and I won t he said abruptly and fiercely and with a countenance darkened with a wild and appalling rage that was wholly unaccountable I see you searching me with your eyes Suspect what you will sir you shan t inveigle me into admissions Aye pry whisper stare question conjecture sir I suppose I must endure the world s impertinence but d n me if I gratify it It would not be easy to describe doctor Danvers astonishment at this unaccountable explosion of fury He was resolved however to bear his companion s violence with temper They rode on slowly for fully ten minutes in utter silence except that Marston occasionally muttered to himself as it seemed in excited abstraction Danvers had at first felt naturally offended at the violent and insulting tone in which he had been so unexpectedly and unprovokedly addressed but this feeling of irritation was but transient and some fearful suspicions as to Marston s sanity flitted through his mind In a calmer and more dogged tone his companion now addressed him There is little profit you see doctor in worrying me about your religion said Marston it is but sowing the wind and reaping the whirlwind and to say the truth the longer you pursue it the less I am in the mood to listen If ever you are cursed and persecuted as I have been you will understand how little tolerant of gratuitous vexations and contradictions a man may become We have squabbled over religion long enough and each holds his own faith still Continue to sun yourself in your happy delusions and leave me untroubled to tread the way of my own dark and cheerless destiny Thus saying he made a sullen gesture of farewell and spurring his horse crossed the broken fence at the roadside and so at a listless pace through gaps and by farm roads penetrated towards his melancholy and guilty home Two years had now passed since the decisive event which had forever separated Marston from her who had loved him so devotedly and so fatally two years to him of disappointment abasement and secret rage two years to her of gentle and heart broken submission to the chastening hand of heaven At the end of this time she died Marston read the letter that announced the event with a stern look and silently but the shock he felt was terrific No man is so self abandoned to despair and degradation that at some casual moment thoughts of amendment some gleams of hope however faint and transient from the distant future will not visit him With Marston those thoughts had somehow ever been associated with vague ideas of a reconciliation with the being whom he had forsaken good and pure and looking at her from the darkness and distance of his own fallen state almost angelic as she seemed But she was now dead he could make her no atonement she could never smile forgiveness upon him This long familiar image the last that had reflected for him one ray of the lost peace and love of happier times had vanished and henceforward there was before him nothing but storm and fear Marston s embarrassed fortunes made it to him an object to resume the portion of his income heretofore devoted to the separate maintenance of his wife and daughter In order to effect this it became of course necessary to recall his daughter Rhoda and fix her residence once more at Gray Forest No more dreadful penalty could have been inflicted upon the poor girl no more agonizing ordeal than that she was thus doomed to undergo She had idolized her mother and now adored her memory She knew that Mademoiselle de Barras had betrayed and indirectly murdered the parent she had so devotedly loved she knew that that woman had been the curse the fate of her family and she regarded her naturally with feelings of mingled terror and abhorrence the intensity of which was indescribable The few scattered friends and relatives whose sympathies had been moved by the melancholy fate of poor missus Marston were unanimously agreed that the intended removal of the young and innocent daughter to the polluted mansion of sin and shame was too intolerably revolting to be permitted But each of these virtuous individuals unhappily thought it the duty of the others to interpose and with a running commentary of wonder and reprobation and much virtuous criticism events were suffered uninterruptedly to take their sinister and melancholy course It was about two months after the death of missus Marston and on a bleak and ominous night at the wintry end of autumn that poor Rhoda in deep mourning and pale with grief and agitation descended from a chaise at the well known door of the mansion of Gray Forest Whether from consideration for her feelings or as was more probable from pure indifference Rhoda was conducted on her arrival direct to her own chamber and it was not until the next morning that she saw her father He entered her room unexpectedly he was very pale and as she thought greatly altered but he seemed perfectly collected and free from agitation The marked and even shocking change in his appearance and perhaps even the trifling though painful circumstance that he wore no mourning for the beloved being who was gone caused her after a moment s mute gazing in his face to burst into an irrepressible flood of tears Marston waited stoically until the paroxysm had subsided and then taking her hand with a look in which a dogged sternness was contending with something like shame he said There there you can weep when I am gone I shan t say very much to you at present Rhoda and only wish you to attend to me for one minute Listen Rhoda the lady whom you have been in the habit here he slightly averted his eyes of calling Mademoiselle de Barras is no longer so she is married she is my wife and consequently you will treat her with the respect due to he would have said a mother but could not and supplied the phrase by adding to that relation Rhoda was unable to speak but almost unconsciously bowed her head in token of attention and submission and her father pressed her hand more kindly as he continued I have always found you a dutiful and obedient child Rhoda and expected no other conduct from you missus Marston will treat you with proper kindness and consideration and desires me to say that you can whenever you please keep strictly to yourself and need not unless you feel so disposed attend the regular meals of the family This privilege may suit your present depressed spirits and you must not scruple to use it After a few words more Marston withdrew leaving his daughter to her reflections and bleak and bitter enough they were Some weeks passed away and perhaps we shall best consult our readers ease by substituting for the formal precision of narrative a few extracts from the letters which Rhoda wrote to her brother still at Cambridge These will convey her own impressions respecting the scenes and personages among whom she was now to move The house and place are much neglected and the former in some parts suffered almost to go to decay The windows broken in the last storm nearly eight months ago they tell me are still unmended and the roof too unrepaired The pretty garden near the well among the lime trees that our darling mother was so fond of is all but obliterated with weeds and grass and since my first visit I have not had heart to go near it again All the old servants are gone new faces everywhere I have been obliged several times through fear of offending my father to join the party in the drawing room You may conceive what I felt at seeing mademoiselle in the place once filled by our dear mamma I was so choked with sorrow bitterness and indignation and my heart so palpitated that I could not speak and I believe they thought I was going to faint Mademoiselle looked very angry but my father pretending to show me heaven knows what from the window led me to it and the air revived me a little Mademoiselle for I cannot call her by her new name is altered a good deal more however in the character than in the contour of her face and figure Certainly however she has grown a good deal fuller and her color is higher and whether it is fancy or not I cannot say but certainly to me it seems that the expression of her face has acquired something habitually lowering and malicious and which I know not how inspires me with an undefinable dread She has however been tolerably civil to me but seems contemptuous and rude to my father and I am afraid he is very wretched I have seen them exchange such looks and overheard such intemperate and even appalling altercations between them as indicate something worse and deeper than ordinary ill will This makes me additionally wretched especially as I cannot help thinking that some mysterious cause enables her to frighten and tyrannise over my poor father I sometimes think he absolutely detests her yet though fiery altercations ensue he ultimately submits to this bad and cruel woman Oh my dear Charles you have no idea of the shocking or rather the terrifying reproaches I have heard interchanged between them as I accidently passed the room where they were sitting such terms as have sent me to my room feeling as if I were in a horrid dream and made me cry and tremble for hours after I got there I see my father very seldom and when I do he takes but little notice of me Poor Willett you know returned with me She accompanies me in my walks and is constantly dropping hints about mademoiselle from which I know not what to gather I often fear that my father has some secret and mortal ailment He generally looks ill and sometimes quite wretchedly He came twice lately to my room I think to speak to me on some matter of importance but he said only a sentence or two and even these broken and incoherent He seemed unable to command spirits for the interview and indeed he grew so agitated and strange that I was alarmed and felt greatly relieved when he left me I do not you see disguise my feelings dear Charles I do not conceal from you the melancholy and anguish of my present situation How intensely I long for your promised arrival I have not a creature to whom I can say one word in confidence except poor Willett who though very good natured and really dear to me is yet far from being a companion I sometimes think my intense anxiety to see you here is almost selfish for I know you will feel as acutely as I do the terrible change observable everywhere But I cannot help longing for your return dear Charles and counting the days and the very hours till you arrive Be cautious in writing to me not to say anything which you would not wish mademoiselle to see for Willett tells me that she knows that she often examines and even intercepts the letters that arrive and though Willett may be mistaken and I hope she is yet it is better that you should be upon your guard Ever since I heard this I have brought my letters to the post office myself instead of leaving them with the rest upon the hall table and you know it is a long walk for me I go to church every Sunday and take Willett along with me No one from this seems to think of doing so but ourselves I see the Mervyns there missus Mervyn is particularly kind and I know that she wishes to offer me an asylum at Newton Park and you cannot think with how much tenderness and delicacy she conveys the wish But I dare not hint the subject to my father and earnestly as I desire it I could not but feel that I should go there not to visit but to reside And so even in this in many respects delightful project is mingled the bitter apprehension of dependence something so humiliating that kindly and delicately as the offer is made I could not bring myself to embrace it I have a great deal to say to you and long to see you These extracts will enable the reader to form a tolerably accurate idea of the general state of affairs at Gray Forest Some particulars must however be added Marston continued to be the same gloomy and joyless being as heretofore Sometimes moody and apathetic sometimes wayward and even savage but never for a moment at ease never social an isolated disdainful ruined man One day as Rhoda sate and read under the shade of some closely interwoven evergreens in a lonely and sheltered part of the neglected pleasure grounds with her honest maid Willett in attendance she was surprised by the sudden appearance of her father who stood unexpectedly before her Though his attitude for some time was fixed his countenance was troubled with anxiety and pain and his sunken eyes rested upon her with a fiery and fretted gaze He seemed lost in thought for a while and then touching Willett sharply on the shoulder said abruptly Go I shall call you when you are wanted Walk down that alley And as he spoke he indicated with his walking cane the course he desired her to take When the maid was sufficiently distant to be quite out of hearing Marston sate down beside Rhoda upon the bench and took her hand in silence His grasp was cold and alternately relaxed and contracted with an agitated uncertainty while his eyes were fixed upon the ground and he seemed meditating how to open the conversation At last as if suddenly awaking from a fearful reverie he said You correspond with Charles Yes sir she replied with the respectful formality prescribed by the usages of the time we correspond regularly Aye aye and pray when did you last hear from him he continued About a month since sir she replied Ha and and was there nothing strange nothing nothing mysterious and menacing in his letter Come come you know what I speak of He stopped abruptly and stared in her face with an agitated gaze No indeed sir there was not anything of the kind she replied I have been greatly shocked I may say incensed said Marston excitedly by a passage in his last letter to me Not that it says anything specific but but it amazes me it enrages me He again checked himself and Rhoda much surprised and even shocked said stammeringly I am sure sir that dear Charles would not intentionally say or do anything that could offend you Ah as to that I believe so too But it is not with him I am indignant no no Poor Charles I believe he is as you say disposed to conduct himself as a son ought to do respectfully and obediently Yes yes Charles is very well but I fear he is leading a bad life notwithstanding a very bad life He is becoming subject to influences which never visit or torment the good believe me he is Marston shook his head and muttered to himself with a look of almost craven anxiety and then whispered to his daughter Just read this and then tell me is it not so Read it read it and pronounce As he thus spoke he placed in her hand the letter of which he had spoken and with the passage to which he invited her attention folded down It was to the following effect I cannot tell you how shocked I have been by a piece of scandal as I must believe it conveyed to me in an anonymous letter and which is of so very delicate a nature that without your special command I should hesitate to pain you by its recital I trust it may be utterly false Indeed I assume it to be so It is enough to say that it is of a very distressing nature and affects the lady Mademoiselle de Barras whom you have recently honored with your hand Now you see cried Marston with a shuddering fierceness as she returned the letter with a blanched cheek and trembling hand now you see it all Are you stupid the stamp of the cloven hoof eh Rhoda unable to gather his meaning but at the same time with a heart full and trembling very much stammered a few frightened words and became silent It is he I tell you that does it all and if Charles were not living an evil life he could not have spread his nets for him said Marston vehemently He can t go near anything good but like a scoundrel he knows where to find a congenial nature and when he does he has skill enough to practice upon it I know him well and his arts and his smiles aye and his scowls and his grins too He goes like his master up and down and to and fro upon the earth for ceaseless mischief There is not a friend of mine he can get hold of but he whispered in his ear some damned slander of me He is drawing them all into a common understanding against me and he takes an actual pleasure in telling me how the thing goes on how one after the other he has converted my friends into conspirators and libelers to blast my character and take my life and now the monster essays to lure my children into the hellish confederation Who is he father who is he faltered Rhoda You never saw him retorted Marston sternly No no you can t have seen him and you probably never will but if he does come here again don t listen to him He is half fiend and half idiot and no good comes of his mouthing and muttering Avoid him I warn you avoid him Let me see how shall I describe him Let me see You remember you remember Berkley Sir Wynston Berkley Well he greatly resembles that dead villain he has all the same grins and shrugs and monkey airs and his face and figure are like But he is a grimed ragged wasted piece of sin little better than a beggar a shrunken malignant libel on the human shape Avoid him I tell you avoid him he is steeped in lies and poison like the very serpent that betrayed us Beware of him I say for if he once gains your ear he will delude you spite of all your vigilance he will make you his accomplice and thenceforth inevitably there is nothing but mortal and implacable hatred between us Frightened at this wild language Rhoda did not answer but looked up in his face in silence A fearful transformation was there a scowl so livid and maniacal that her very senses seemed leaving her with terror Perhaps the sudden alteration observable in her countenance as this spectacle so unexpectedly encountered her recalled him to himself for he added hurriedly and in a tone of gentler meaning Rhoda Rhoda watch and pray My daughter my child keep your heart pure and nothing bad can approach you for ill No no you are good and the good need not fear Suddenly Marston burst into tears as he ended this sentence and wept long and convulsively She did not dare to speak or even to move but after a while he ceased appeared uneasy half ashamed and half angry and looking with a horrified and bewildered glance into her face he said Rhoda child what what have I said My God what have I been saying Did I do I look ill Oh Rhoda Rhoda may you never feel this He turned away from her without awaiting her answer and walked away with the appearance of intense agitation as if to leave her He turned again however and with a face pallid and sunken as death approached her slowly Rhoda said he don t tell what I have said to anyone don t I conjure you even to Charles I speak too much at random and say more than I mean a foolish rambling habit so do not repeat one word of it not one word to any living mortal You and I Rhoda must have our little secrets He ended with an attempt at a smile so obviously painful and fear stricken that as he walked hurriedly away the astounded girl burst into a bitter flood of tears What was what could be the meaning of the shocking scene she had then been forced to witness She dared not answer the question Yet one ghastly doubt haunted her like her shadow a suspicion that the malignant and hideous light of madness was already glaring upon his mind As leaning upon the arm of her astonished attendant she retracted her steps the trees the flowers the familiar hall door the echoing passages every object that met her eye seemed strange and unsubstantial and she gliding on among them in a horrid dream Time passed on there was no renewal of the painful scene which dwelt so sensibly in the affrighted imagination of Rhoda 
5968_71320_000001_000001	train-clean-360	Marston s manner was changed towards her he seemed shy cowed and uneasy in her presence and thenceforth she saw less than ever of him 
5968_71320_000001_000002	train-clean-360	Meanwhile the time approached which was to witness the long expected and by Rhoda the intensely prayed for arrival of her brother 
none	none	Some four or five days before this event mister Marston having as he said some business in Chester and further designing to meet his son there took his departure from Gray Forest leaving poor Rhoda to the guardianship of her guilty stepmother and although she had seen so little of her father yet the very consciousness of his presence had given her a certain confidence and sense of security which vanished at the moment of his departure Fear stricken and wretched as he had been his removal nevertheless seemed to her to render the lonely and inauspicious mansion still more desolate and ominous than before She had with a vague and instinctive antipathy avoided all contact and intercourse with missus Marston or as for distinctness sake we shall continue to call her Mademoiselle since her return and she on her part had appeared to acquiesce with a sort of scornful nonchalance in the tacit understanding that she and her former pupil should see and hear as little as might be of one another Meanwhile poor Willett with her good natured honesty and her inexhaustible gossip endeavored to amuse and reassure her young mistress and sometimes even with some partial success 
5968_71320_000005_000000	train-clean-360	We must now follow mister Marston in his solitary expedition to Chester When he took his place in the stagecoach he had the whole interior of the vehicle to himself and thus continued to be its solitary occupant for several miles 
5968_71320_000005_000001	train-clean-360	The coach however was eventually hailed brought to and the door being opened doctor Danvers got in and took his place opposite to the passenger already established there 
none	none	The worthy man was so busied in directing the disposition of his luggage from the window and in arranging the sundry small parcels with which he was charged that he did not recognize his companion until they were in motion When he did so it was with no very pleasurable feeling and it is probable that Marston too would have gladly escaped the coincidence which thus reduced them once more to the temporary necessity of a Tate a Tate 
5968_71320_000005_000004	train-clean-360	Embarrassing as each felt the situation to be there was however no avoiding it and after a recognition and a few forced attempts at conversation they became by mutual consent silent and uncommunicative 
5968_71320_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The journey though in point of space a mere trifle was in those slowcoach days a matter of fully five hours duration and before it was completed the sun had set and darkness began to close 
5968_71320_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Whether it was that the descending twilight dispelled the painful constraint under which Marston had seemed to labor or that some more purely spiritual and genial influence had gradually dissipated the repulsion and distrust with which at first he had shrunk from a renewal of intercourse with doctor Danvers he suddenly accosted him thus 
5968_71320_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 doctor Danvers I have been fifty times on the point of speaking to you confidentially of course while sitting here opposite to you what I believe I could scarcely bring myself to hint to any other man living yet I must tell it and soon too or I fear it will have told itself 
none	none	doctor Danvers intimated his readiness to hear and advise if desired and Marston resumed abruptly after a pause
5968_71320_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Pray Doctor Danvers have you heard any stories of an odd kind any surmises I don t mean of a moral sort for those I hold very cheap to my prejudice 
none	none	Indeed I should hardly say to my prejudice I mean I ought to say in short have you heard people remark upon any fancied eccentricities or that sort of thing about me 
5968_71320_000010_000000	train-clean-360	He put the question with obvious difficulty and at last seemed to overcome his own reluctance with a sort of angry and excited self contempt and impatience 
none	none	Doctor Danvers was a little puzzled by the interrogatory and admitted in reply that he did not comprehend its drift Doctor Danvers he resumed sternly and dejectedly I told you in the chance interview we had some months ago that I was haunted by a certain fear 
5968_71320_000011_000001	train-clean-360	I did not define it nor do I think you suspect its nature 
5968_71320_000011_000002	train-clean-360	It is a fear of nothing mortal but of the immortal tenant of this body 
5968_71320_000011_000003	train-clean-360	My mind sir is beginning to play me tricks my guide mocks and terrifies me 
5968_71320_000012_000000	train-clean-360	There was a perceptible tinge of horror in the look of astonishment with which doctor Danvers listened 
5968_71320_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 You are a gentleman sir and a Christian clergyman what I have said and shall say is confided to your honor to be held sacred as the confession of misery and hidden from the coarse gaze of the world 
none	none	I have become subject to a hideous delusion 
5968_71320_000013_000002	train-clean-360	It comes at intervals 
5968_71320_000013_000003	train-clean-360	I do not think any mortal suspects it except maybe my daughter Rhoda 
5968_71320_000013_000004	train-clean-360	It comes and disappears and comes again 
5968_71320_000013_000005	train-clean-360	I kept my pleasant secret for a long time but at last I let it slip and committed myself fortunately to but one person and that my daughter and even so I hardly think she understood me 
5968_71320_000013_000006	train-clean-360	I recollected myself before I had disclosed the grotesque and infernal chimera that haunts me 
none	none	Marston paused 
5968_71320_000014_000001	train-clean-360	He was stooped forward and looking upon the floor of the vehicle so that his companion could not see his countenance 
5968_71320_000014_000002	train-clean-360	A silence ensued which was interrupted by Marston who once more resumed 
none	none	Sir said he I know not why but I have longed intensely longed for some trustworthy ear into which to pour this horrid secret why I repeat I cannot tell for I expect no sympathy and hate compassion 
5968_71320_000015_000001	train-clean-360	It is I suppose the restless nature of the devil that is in me but be it what it may I will speak to you but to you only for the present at least to you alone 
none	none	Doctor Danvers again assured him that he might repose the most entire confidence in his secrecy
5968_71320_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 The human mind I take it must have either comfort in the past or hope in the future he continued otherwise it is in danger 
none	none	To me sir the past is intolerably repulsive one boundless barren and hideous Golgotha of dead hopes and murdered opportunities the future still blacker and more furious peopled with dreadful features of horror and menace and losing itself in utter darkness Sir I do not exaggerate Between such a past and such a future I stand upon this miserable present and the only comfort I still am capable of feeling is that no human being pities me that I stand aloof from the insults of compassion and the hypocrisies of sympathetic morality and that I can safely defy all the respectable scoundrels in Christendom to enhance by one feather s weight the load which I myself have accumulated and which I myself hourly and unaided sustain Doctor Danvers here introduced a word or two in the direction of their former conversation
5968_71320_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 No sir there is no comfort from that quarter either said Marston bitterly you but cast your seeds as the parable terms your teaching upon the barren sea in wasting them on me 
none	none	My fate be it what it may is as irrevocably fixed as though I were dead and judged a hundred years ago This cursed dream he resumed abruptly that everyday enslaves me more and more has reference to that that occurrence about Wynston Berkley he is the hero of the hellish illusion At certain times sir it seems to me as if he though dead were still invested with a sort of spurious life going about unrecognized except by me in squalor and contempt and whispering away my fame and life laboring with the malignant industry of a fiend to involve me in the meshes of that special perdition from which alone I shrink and to which this emissary of hell seems to have predestined me 
5968_71320_000020_000002	train-clean-360	Sir this is a monstrous and hideous extravagance a delusion but after all no more than a trick of the imagination the reason the judgment is untouched 
5968_71320_000020_000003	train-clean-360	I cannot choose but see all the damned phantasmagoria but I do not believe it real and this is the difference between my case and and madness 
5968_71320_000021_000000	train-clean-360	They were now entering the suburbs of Chester and Doctor Danvers pained and shocked beyond measure by this unlooked for disclosure and not knowing what remark or comfort to offer relieved his temporary embarrassment by looking from the window as though attracted by the flash of the lamps among which the vehicle was now moving 
5968_71320_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Marston however laid his hand upon his arm and thus recalled him for a moment to a forced attention 
5968_71320_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 It must seem strange to you Doctor that I should trust this cursed secret to your keeping he said and truth to say it seems so to myself 
none	none	I cannot account for the impulse the irresistible power of which has forced me to disclose the hateful mystery to you but the fact is this beginning like a speck this one idea has gradually darkened and dilated until it has filled my entire mind The solitary consciousness of the gigantic mastery it has established there had grown intolerable I must have told it 
5968_71320_000022_000003	train-clean-360	The sense of solitude under this aggressive and tremendous delusion was agony hourly death to my soul 
5968_71320_000022_000004	train-clean-360	That is the secret of my talkativeness my sole excuse for plaguing you with the dreams of a wretched hypochondriac 
none	none	Doctor Danvers assured him that no apologies were needed and was only restrained from adding the expression of that pity which he really felt by the fear of irritating a temper so full of bitterness pride and defiance 
5968_71320_000023_000001	train-clean-360	A few minutes more and the coach having reached its destination they bid one another farewell and parted 
5968_71320_000024_000000	train-clean-360	At that time there resided in a decent mansion about a mile from the town of Chester a dapper little gentleman whom we shall call Doctor Parkes This gentleman was the proprietor and sole professional manager of a private asylum for the insane and enjoyed a high reputation and a proportionate amount of business in his melancholy calling 
5968_71320_000024_000001	train-clean-360	It was about the second day after the conversation we have just sketched that this little gentleman having visited according to his custom all his domestic patients was about to take his accustomed walk in his somewhat restricted pleasure grounds when his servant announced a visitor 
5968_71320_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 A gentleman he repeated you have seen him before eh 
5968_71320_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 No sir replied the man he is in the study sir 
5968_71320_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Ha a professional call 
5968_71320_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Well we shall see 
none	none	So saying the little gentleman summoned his gravest look and hastened to the chamber of audience On entering he found a man dressed well but gravely having in his air and manner something of high breeding In countenance striking dark featured and stern furrowed with the lines of pain or thought rather than of age although his dark hairs were largely mingled with white The physician bowed and requested the stranger to take a chair he however nodded slightly and impatiently as if to intimate an intolerance of ceremony and advancing a step or two said abruptly
5968_71320_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 My name sir is Marston I have come to give you a patient 
5968_71320_000032_000000	train-clean-360	The doctor bowed with a still deeper inclination and paused for a continuance of the communication thus auspiciously commenced 
none	none	You are doctor Parkes I take it for granted said Marston in the same tone
5968_71320_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Your most obedient humble servant sir replied he with the polite formality of the day and another grave bow 
5968_71320_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Doctor demanded Marston fixing his eye upon him sternly and significantly tapping his own forehead can you stay execution 
5968_71320_000036_000000	train-clean-360	The physician looked puzzled hesitated and at last requested his visitor to be more explicit 
5968_71320_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Can you said Marston with the same slow and stern articulation and after a considerable pause can you prevent the malady you profess to cure can you meet and defeat the enemy halfway can you scare away the spirit of madness before it takes actual possession and while it is still only hovering about its threatened victim 
none	none	Sir he replied in certain cases in very many indeed the enemy as you well call it may thus be met and effectually worsted at a distance Timely interposition in ninety cases out of a hundred is everything and I assure you I hear your question with much pleasure inasmuch as I assume it to have reference to the case of the patient about whom you desire to consult me and who is therefore I hope as yet merely menaced with the misfortune from which you would save him I myself am that patient sir said Marston with an effort your surmise is right I am not mad but unequivocally menaced with madness it is not to be mistaken Sir there is no misunderstanding the tremendous and intolerable signs that glare upon my mind And pray sir have you consulted your friends or your family upon the course best to be pursued inquired doctor Parkes with grave interest No sir he answered sharply and almost fiercely I have no fancy to make myself the subject of a writ de lunatico inquirendo I don t want to lose my liberty and my property at a blow The course I mean to take has been advised by no one but myself is known to no other I now disclose it and the causes of it to you a gentleman and my professional adviser in the expectation that you will guard with the strictest secrecy my spontaneous revelations this you promise me Certainly mister Marston I have neither the disposition nor the right to withhold such a promise answered the physician Well then I will first tell you the arrangement I propose with your permission to make and then I shall answer all your questions respecting my own case resumed Marston gloomily I wish to place myself under your care to live under your roof reserving my full liberty of action I must be free to come and to go as I will and on the other hand I undertake that you shall find me an amenable and docile patient enough In addition I stipulate that there shall be no attempt whatever made to communicate with those who are connected with me these terms agreed upon I place myself in your hands You will find in me as I said before a deferential patient and I trust not a troublesome one I hope you will excuse my adding that I shall myself pay the charge of my sojourn here from week to week in advance The proposed arrangement was a strange one and although doctor Parkes dimly foresaw some of the embarrassments which might possibly arise from his accepting it there was yet so much that was reasonable as well as advantageous in the proposal that he could not bring himself to decline it The preliminary arrangement concluded doctor Parkes proceeded to his more strictly professional investigation It is of course needless to recapitulate the details of Marston s tormenting fancies with which the reader has indeed been already sufficiently acquainted Doctor Parkes having attentively listened to the narrative and satisfied himself as to the physical health of his patient was still sorely puzzled as to the probable issue of the awful struggle already but too obviously commenced between the mind and its destroyer in the strange case before him One satisfactory symptom unquestionably was the as yet transitory nature of the delusion and the evident and energetic tenacity with which reason contended for her vital ascendancy It was a case however which for many reasons sorely perplexed him but of which notwithstanding he was disposed whether rightly or wrongly the reader will speedily see to take by no means a decidedly gloomy view Having disburdened his mind of this horrible secret Marston felt for a time a sense of relief amounting almost to elation With far less of apprehension and dismay than he had done so for months before he that night repaired to his bedroom There was nothing in his case Doctor Parkes believed to warrant his keeping any watch upon Marston s actions and accordingly he bid him good night in the full confidence of meeting him if not better at least not worse on the ensuing morning He miscalculated however Marston had probably himself been conscious of some coming crisis in his hideous malady when he took the decisive step of placing himself under the care of Doctor Parkes Certain it is that upon that very night the disease broke forth in a new and appalling development Doctor Parkes whose bedroom was next to that occupied by Marston was awakened in the dead of night by a howling more like that of a beast than a human voice and which gradually swelled into an absolute yell then came some horrid laughter and entreaties thick and frantic then again the same unearthly howl The practiced ear of Doctor Parkes recognized but too surely the terrific import of those sounds Springing from his bed and seizing the candle which always burned in his chamber in anticipation of such sudden and fearful emergencies he hurried with a palpitating heart and spite of his long habituation to such scenes as he expected with a certain sense of horror to the chamber of his aristocratic patient Late as it was Marston had not yet gone to bed his candle was still burning and he himself half dressed stood in the center of the floor shaking and livid his eyes burning with the preterhuman fires of insanity As Doctor Parkes entered the chamber another shout or rather yell thundered from the lips of this demoniac effigy and the mad doctor stood freezing with horror in the doorway and yet exerting what remained to him of presence of mind in the vain endeavor in the flaring light of the candle to catch and fix with his own practiced eye the gaze of the maniac Second after second and minute after minute he stood confronting this frightful slave of Satan in the momentary expectation that he would close with and destroy him On a sudden however this brief agony of suspense was terminated a change like an awakening consciousness of realities or rather like the withdrawal of some hideous and visible influence from within passed over the tense and darkened features of the wretched being a look of horrified perplexity doubt and inquiry supervened and he at last said in a subdued and sullen tone to Doctor Parkes Who are you sir What do you want here Who are you sir I say Who am I Why your physician sir Doctor Parkes sir the owner of this house sir replied he with all the sternness he could command and yet white as a specter with agitation For shame sir for shame to give way thus What do you mean by creating this causeless alarm and disturbing the whole household at so unseasonable an hour For shame sir go to your bed undress yourself this moment for shame Doctor Parkes as he spoke was reassured by the arrival of one of his servants alarmed by the unmistakable sounds of violent frenzy he signed however to the man not to enter feeling confident as he did that the paroxysm had spent itself Aye aye muttered Marston looking almost sheepishly Doctor Parkes to be sure What was I thinking of how cursedly absurd And this he continued glancing at his sword which he threw impatiently upon a sofa as he spoke Folly nonsense A false alarm as you say doctor I beg your pardon As Marston spoke he proceeded with much agitation slowly to undress himself He had however but commenced the process when turning abruptly to Doctor Parkes he said with a countenance of horror and in a whisper By doctor it has been upon me worse than ever I would have sworn I had the villain with me for hours hours sir torturing me with his damned sneering threats till by I could stand it no longer and took my sword Oh doctor can t you save me can nothing be done for me Pale covered with the dews of horror he uttered these last words in accents of such imploring despair as might have borne across the dreadful gulf the prayer of Dives for that one drop of water which never was to cool his burning tongue When Rhoda learned that her father on leaving Gray Forest had fixed no definite period for his return she began to feel her situation at home so painful and equivocal that having taken honest Willett to counsel she came at last to the resolution of accepting the often conveyed invitation of missus Mervyn and sojourning at all events until her father s return at Newton Park My dear young friend said the kind lady as soon as she heard Rhoda s little speech to its close I can scarcely describe the gratification with which I see you here the happiness with which I welcome you to Newton Park nor indeed the anxiety with which I constantly contemplated your trying and painful position at Gray Forest Indeed I ought to be angry with you for having refused me this happiness so long but you have made amends at last though indeed it was impossible to have deferred it longer You must not fancy however that I will consent to lose you so soon as you seem to have intended No no I have found it too hard to catch you to let you take wing so easily besides I have others to consult as well as myself and persons too who are just as anxious as I am to make a prisoner of you here The good missus Mervyn accompanied these words with looks so sly and emphasis so significant that Rhoda was fain to look down to hide her blushes and compassionating the confusion she herself had caused the kind old lady led her to the chamber which was henceforward so long as she consented to remain to be her own apartment How that day was passed and how fleetly its hours sped away it is needless to tell Old Mervyn had his gentle as well as his grim aspect and no welcome was ever more cordial and tender than that with which he greeted the unprotected child of his morose and repulsive neighbor It would be impossible to convey any idea of the countless assiduities and the secret delight with which young Mervyn attended their rambles The party were assembled at supper What a contrast did this cheerful happy unutterably happy gathering present in the mind of Rhoda to the dull drear fearful evenings which she had long been wont to pass at Gray Forest As they sate together in cheerful and happy intercourse a chaise drove up to the hall door and the knocking had hardly ceased to reverberate when a well known voice was heard in the hall Young Mervyn started to his feet and merrily ejaculating Charles Marston this is delightful disappeared and in an instant returned with Charles himself We pass over all the embraces of brother and sister the tears and smiles of re united affection We omit the cordial shaking of hands the kind looks the questions and answers all these and all the little attentions of that good old fashioned hospitality which was never weary of demonstrating the cordiality of its welcome we abandon to the imagination of the good natured reader Charles Marston with the advice of his friend mister Mervyn resolved to lose no time in proceeding to Chester whither it was ascertained his father had gone with the declared intention of meeting and accompanying him home He arrived in that town in the evening and having previously learned that Doctor Danvers had been for some time in Chester he at once sought him at his usual lodgings and found the worthy old gentleman at his solitary dish of tea My dear Charles said he greeting his young friend with earnest warmth I am rejoiced beyond measure to see you Your father is in town as you supposed and I have just had a note from him which has I confess not a little agitated me referring as it does to a subject of painful and horrible interest one with which I suppose you are familiar but upon which I myself have never yet spoken fully to any person excepting your father only And pray my dear sir what is this topic inquired Charles with marked interest Read this note answered the clergyman placing one at the same time in his young visitor s hand Charles read as follows My Dear Sir I have a singular communication to make to you but in the strictest privacy with reference to a subject which merely to name is to awaken feelings of doubt and horror I mean the confession of Merton with respect to the murder of Wynston Berkley I will call upon you this evening after dark for I have certain reasons for not caring to meet old acquaintances about town and if you can afford me half an hour I promise to complete my intended disclosure within that time Let us be strictly private this is my only proviso Yours with much respect Richard Marston Your father has been sorely troubled in mind said Doctor Danvers as soon as the young man had read this communication he has told me as much it may be that the discovery he has now made may possibly have relieved him from certain galling anxieties The fear that unjust suspicion should light upon himself or those connected with him has I dare say tormented him sorely God grant that as the providential unfolding of all the details of this mysterious crime comes about he maybe brought to recognize in the just and terrible process the hand of heaven God grant that at last his heart may be softened and his spirit illuminated by the blessed influence he has so long and so sternly rejected As the old man thus spake as if in symbolic answering to his prayer a sudden glory from the setting sun streamed through the funereal pile of clouds which filled the western horizon and flooded the chamber where they were After a silence Charles Marston said with some little embarrassment It may be a strange confession to make though indeed hardly so to you for you know but too well the gloomy reserve with which my father has uniformly treated me that the exact nature of Merton s confession never reached my ears and once or twice when I approached the subject in conversation with you it seemed to me that the subject was one which for some reason it was painful to you to enter upon And so it was in truth my young friend so it was for that confession left behind it many fearful doubts proving indeed nothing but the one fact that morally the wretched man was guilty of the murder Charles urged by a feeling of the keenest interest requested doctor Danvers to detail to him the particulars of the dying man s narration Willingly answered doctor Danvers with a look of gloom and heaving a profound sigh willingly for you have now come to an age when you may safely be entrusted with secrets affecting your own family and which although thank God as I believe they in no respect involve the honor of anyone of its members yet might deeply involve its peace and its security against the assaults of vague and horrible slander Here then is the narrative Merton when he was conscious of the approach of death qualified by a circumstantial and detailed statement the absolute confession of guilt which he had at first sullenly made In this he declared that the guilt of design and intention only was his that in the act itself he had been anticipated He stated that from the moment when Sir Wynston s servant had casually mentioned the circumstance of his master s usually sleeping with his watch and pocketbook under his pillow the idea of robbing him had taken possession of his mind With the idea of robbing him under the peculiar circumstances his servant sleeping in the apartment close by and the slightest alarm being in all probability sufficient to call him to the spot the idea of anticipating resistance by murder had associated itself He had contended against these haunting and growing solicitations of Satan with an earnest agony He had intended to leave his place and fly from the mysterious temptation which he felt he wanted power to combat but accident or fate prevented him In a state of ghastly excitement he had on the memorable night of Sir Wynston s murder proceeded as had afterwards appeared in evidence by the back stair to the baronet s chamber he had softly stolen into it and gone to the bedside with the weapon in his hand He drew his breath for the decisive stroke which was to bereave the supposedly sleeping man of life and when stretching his left hand under the clothes it rested upon a dull cold corpse and at the same moment his right hand was immersed in a pool of blood He dropped the knife recoiled a pace or so With a painful effort however he again grasped with his hand to recover the weapon he had suffered to escape and secured as it afterwards turned out not the knife with which he had meditated the commission of his crime but the dagger which was afterwards found where he had concealed it He was now fully alive to the horror of his situation he was compromised as fully as if he had in very deed driven home the weapon To be found under such circumstances would convict him as surely as if fifty eyes had seen him strike the blow He had nothing now for it but flight and in order to guard himself against the contingency of being surprised from the door opening upon the corridor he bolted it then groped under the murdered man s pillow for the booty which had so fatally fascinated his imagination Here he was disappointed What further happened you already know Charles listened with breathless attention to this recital and after a painful interval said Then the actual murderer is after all unascertained This is indeed horrible it was very natural that my father should have felt the danger to which such a disclosure would have exposed the reputation of our family yet I should have preferred encountering it were it ten times as great to the equivocal prudence of suppressing the truth with respect to a murder committed under my own roof He has however it would seem arrived at some new conclusions said doctor Danvers and is now prepared to throw some unanticipated light upon the whole transaction Even as they were talking a knocking was heard at the hall door and after a brief and hurried consultation it was agreed that considering the strict condition of privacy attached to this visit by mister Marston himself as well as his reserved and wayward temper it might be better for Charles to avoid presenting himself to his father on this occasion A few seconds afterwards the door opened and mister Marston entered the apartment It was now dark and the servant unbidden placed candles upon the table Without answering one word to doctor Danvers greeting Marston sat down as it seemed in agitated abstraction Removing his hat suddenly for he had not even made this slight homage to the laws of courtesy he looked round with a care worn fiery eye and a pale countenance and said We are quite alone doctor Danvers no one anywhere near doctor Danvers assured him that all was secure After a long and agitated pause Marston said You remember Merton s confession He admitted his intention to kill Berkley but denied that he was the actual murderer He spoke truth no one knew it better than I for I am the murderer doctor Danvers was so shocked and overwhelmed that he was utterly unable to speak Aye sir in point of law and of morals literally and honestly the murderer of Wynston Berkley I am resolved you shall know it all Make what use of it you will I care for nothing now but to get rid of the d d unsustainable secret and that is done I did not intend to kill the scoundrel when I went to his room but with the just feelings of exasperation with which I regarded him it would have been wiser had I avoided the interview and I meant to have done so But his candle was burning I saw the light through the door and went in It was his evil fortune to indulge in his old strain of sardonic impertinence He provoked me I struck him he struck me again and with his own dagger I stabbed him three times I did not know what I had done I could not believe it I felt neither remorse nor sorrow why should I but the thing was horrible astounding There he sat in the corner of his cushioned chair with the old fiendish smile on still Sir I never thought that any human shape could look so dreadful I don t know how long I stayed there freezing with horror and detestation and yet unable to take my eyes from the face Did you see it in the coffin Sir there was a sneer of triumph on it that was diabolic and prophetic Marston was fearfully agitated as he spoke and repeatedly wiped from his face the cold sweat that gathered there I could not leave the room by the back stairs he resumed for the valet slept in the intervening chamber I felt such an appalled antipathy to the body that I could scarcely muster courage to pass it But sir I am not easily cowed I mastered this repugnance in a few minutes or rather I acted spite of it I knew not how but instinctively it seemed to me that it was better to lay the body in the bed than leave it where it was shewing as its position might that the thing occurred in an altercation So sir I raised it and bore it softly across the room and laid it in the bed and while I was carrying it it swayed forward the arms glided round my neck and the head rested against my cheek that was a parody upon a brotherly embrace I do not know at what moment it was but some time when I was carrying Wynston or laying him in the bed continued Marston who spoke rather like one pursuing a horrible reverie than as a man relating facts to a listener I heard a light tread and soft breathing in the lobby A thunderclap would have stunned me less that minute I moved softly holding my breath to the door I believe in moments of strong excitement men hear more acutely than at other times but I thought I heard the rustling of a gown going from the door again I waited it ceased I waited until all was quiet I then extinguished the candle and groped my way to the door there was a faint light in the corridor and I thought I saw a head projected from the chamber door next to the Frenchwoman s mademoiselle s As I came on it was softly withdrawn and the door not quite noiselessly closed I could not be absolutely certain but I learned all afterward And now sir you have the story of Sir Wynston s murder doctor Danvers groaned in spirit being wrung alike with fear and sorrow With hands clasped and head bowed down in an exceeding bitter agony of soul he murmured only the words of the Litany Lord have mercy upon us Christ have mercy upon us Lord have mercy upon us Marston had recovered his usual lowering aspect and gloomy self possession in a few moments and was now standing erect and defiant before the humbled and afflicted minister of God The contrast was terrible almost sublime Doctor Danvers resolved to keep this dreadful secret at least for a time to himself He could not make up his mind to inflict upon those whom he loved so well as Charles and Rhoda the shame and agony of such a disclosure yet he was sorely troubled for his was a conflict of duty and mercy of love and justice He told Charles Marston when urged with earnest inquiry that what he had heard that evening was intended solely for his own ear and gently but peremptorily declined telling at least until some future time the substance of his father s communication Charles now felt it necessary to see his father for the purpose of letting him know the substance of the letter respecting mademoiselle and the late Sir Wynston which had reached him Accordingly he proceeded accompanied by Doctor Danvers on the next morning to the hotel where Marston had intimated his intention of passing the night On their inquiring for him in the hall the porter appeared much perplexed and disturbed and as they pressed him with questions his answers became conflicting and mysterious mister Marston was there he had slept there last night he could not say whether or not he was then in the house but he knew that no one could be admitted to see him He would if the gentlemen wished it send their cards to not mister Marston but the proprietor And finally he concluded by begging that they would themselves see the proprietor and dispatched a waiter to apprise him of the circumstances of the visit There was something odd and even sinister in all this which along with the whispering and the curious glances of the waiters who happened to hear the errand on which they came inspired the two companions with vague misgivings which they did not care mutually to disclose In a few moments they were shown into a small sitting room up stairs where the proprietor a fussy little gentleman and apparently very uneasy and frightened received them We have called here to see mister Marston said Doctor Danvers and the porter has referred us to you Yes sir exactly precisely so answered the little man fidgeting excessively and as it seemed growing paler every instant but but in fact sir there is there has been in short have you not heard of the the accident He wound up with a prodigious effort and wiped his forehead when he had done Pray sir be explicit we are near friends of mister Marston in fact sir this is his son said Doctor Danvers pointing to Charles Marston and we are both uneasy at the reserve with which our inquiries have been met Do I entreat of you say what has happened Why why hesitated the man I really I would not for five hundred pounds it had happened in my house The the unhappy gentleman has in short He glanced at Charles as if afraid of the effect of the disclosure he was on the point of making and then hurriedly said He is dead sir he was found dead in his room this morning at eight o clock I assure you I have not been myself ever since Charles Marston was so stunned by this sudden blow that he was upon the point of fainting Rallying however with a strong effort he demanded to be conducted to the chamber where the body lay The man assented but hesitated on reaching the door and whispered something in the ear of Doctor Danvers who as he heard it raised his hands and eyes with a mute expression of horror and turning to Charles said My dear young friend remain where you are for a few moments I will return to you immediately and tell you whatever I have ascertained You are in no condition for such a scene at present Charles indeed felt that the fact was so and sick and giddy suffered Doctor Danvers with gentle compulsion to force him into a seat In silence the venerable clergyman followed his conductor With a palpitating heart he advanced to the bedside and twice essayed to draw the curtain and twice lost courage but gathering resolution at last he pulled the drapery aside and beheld all he was to see again of Richard Marston The bedclothes were drawn so as nearly to cover the mouth There is the wound sir whispered the man as with coarse officiousness he drew back the bedclothes from the throat of the corpse and exhibited a gash as it seemed nearly severing the head from the body With sickening horror Doctor Danvers turned away from the awful spectacle He covered his face in his hands and it seemed to him as if a soft solemn voice whispered in his ear the mystic words Whoso sheddeth man s blood by man shall his blood be shed The hand which but a few years before had unsuspected consigned a fellow mortal to the grave had itself avenged the murder Marston had perished by his own hand Naturally ambitious and intriguing the perilous tendencies of such a spirit in Mademoiselle de Barras had never been schooled by the mighty and benignant principles of religion of her accidental acquaintance at Rouen with Sir Wynston Berkley and her subsequent introduction in an evil hour into the family at Gray Forest it is unnecessary to speak The unhappy terms on which she found Marston living with his wife suggested in their mutual alienation the idea of founding a double influence in the household and to conceive the idea and to act upon it were in her active mind the same Young beautiful fascinating she well knew the power of her attractions and determined though probably without one thought of transgressing the limits of literal propriety to bring them to bear upon the discontented retired roue for whom she cared absolutely nothing except as the instrument and in part the victim of her schemes Thus yielding to the double instinct that swayed her she gratified at the same time her love of intrigue and her love of power At length however came the hour which demanded a sacrifice to the evil influence she had hitherto worshipped on such easy terms She found that her power must now be secured by crime and she fell Then came the arrival of Sir Wynston his murder her elopement with Marston and her guilty and joyless triumph At last however came the blow long suspended and terrific which shattered all her hopes and schemes and drove her once again upon the world The catastrophe we have just described After it she made her way to Paris Arrived in the capital of France she speedily dissipated whatever remained of the money and valuables which she had taken with her from Gray Forest and Madame Marston as she now styled herself was glad to place herself once more as a governess in an aristocratic family So far her good fortune had prevailed in averting the punishment but too well earned by her past life But a day of reckoning was to come A few years later France was involved in the uproar and conflagration of revolution Noble families were scattered beggared decimated and their dependants often dragged along with them into the flaming abyss in many instances suffered the last dire extremities of human ill It was at this awful period that a retribution so frightful and extraordinary overtook Madame Marston that we may hereafter venture to make it the subject of a separate narrative Until then the reader will rest satisfied with what he already knows of her history and meanwhile bid a long and as it may possibly turn out an eternal farewell to that beautiful embodiment of an evil and disastrous influence The concluding chapter in a novel is always brief though seldom so short as the world would have it In a tale like this the winding up must be proportionately contracted We have scarcely a claim to so many lines as the formal novelist may occupy pages in the distribution of poetic justice and the final grouping of his characters into that effective tableau upon which at last the curtain gracefully descends We too may be all the briefer inasmuch as the reader has doubtless anticipated the little we have to say It amounts then to this Within two years after the fearful event which we have just recorded an alliance had drawn together in nearer and dearer union the inmates of Gray Forest and Newton Park Rhoda had given her hand to young Mervyn of ulterior consequences we say nothing the nursery is above our province And now at length after this Christmas journey through somewhat stern and gloomy scenery in this long deferred flood of golden sunshine we bid thee gentle reader a fond farewell THE END Transcriber s note Tate a Tate is sic twice in the original book End
