6014_32856_000000_000000	train-clean-360	An undulating landscape with a homely farmstead here and there and plenty of old English timber scattered grandly over it extended mistily to my right on the left the road is overtopped by masses of noble forest 
6014_32856_000000_000001	train-clean-360	The old park of Brandon lies there more than four miles from end to end 
6014_32856_000000_000002	train-clean-360	These masses of solemn and discoloured verdure the faint but splendid lights and long filmy shadows the slopes and hollows my eyes wandered over them all with that strange sense of unreality and that mingling of sweet and bitter fancy with which we revisit a scene familiar in very remote and early childhood and which has haunted a long interval of maturity and absence like a romantic reverie 
6014_32856_000001_000000	train-clean-360	As I looked through the chaise windows every moment presented some group or outline or homely object for years forgotten and now with a strange surprise how vividly remembered and how affectionately greeted We drove by the small old house at the left with its double gable and pretty grass garden and trim yews and modern lilacs and laburnums backed by the grand timber of the park 
none	none	It was the parsonage and old bachelor Doctor Crewe the rector in my nonage still stood in memory at the door in his black shorts and gaiters with his hands in his pockets and a puckered smile on his hard ruddy countenance as I approached He smiled little on others I believe but always kindly upon me 
6014_32856_000001_000003	train-clean-360	This general liking for children and instinct of smiling on them is one source of the delightful illusions which make the remembrance of early days so like a dream of Paradise and give us at starting such false notions of our value 
6014_32856_000002_000000	train-clean-360	There was a little fair haired child playing on the ground before the steps as I whirled by 
6014_32856_000002_000001	train-clean-360	The old rector had long passed away the shorts gaiters and smile a phantom and nature who had gathered in the past was providing for the future 
6014_32856_000003_000000	train-clean-360	The pretty mill road running up through Redman s Dell dank and dark with tall romantic trees was left behind in another moment and we were now traversing the homely and antique street of the little town with its queer shops and solid steep roofed residences 
6014_32856_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Up Church street I contrived a peep at the old gray tower where the chimes hung and as we turned the corner a glance at the Brandon Arms How very small and low that palatial hostelry of my earlier recollections had grown 
6014_32856_000003_000002	train-clean-360	There were new faces at the door 
6014_32856_000003_000003	train-clean-360	It was only two and twenty years ago and I was then but eleven years old 
6014_32856_000003_000004	train-clean-360	A retrospect of a score of years or so at three and thirty is a much vaster affair than a much longer one at fifty 
6014_32856_000004_000000	train-clean-360	The whole thing seemed like yesterday and as I write I open my eyes and start and cry can it be twenty five and twenty aye by Jove five and thirty years since then How my days have flown 
6014_32856_000004_000001	train-clean-360	And I think when another such yesterday shall have arrived where shall I be 
6014_32856_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The first ten years of my life were longer than all the rest put together and I think would continue to be so were my future extended to an ante Noachian span 
6014_32856_000005_000001	train-clean-360	It is the first ten that emerge from nothing and commencing in a point it is during them that consciousness memory all the faculties grow and the experience of sense is so novel crowded and astounding 
none	none	It is this beginning at a point and expanding to the immense disk of our present range of sensuous experience that gives to them so prodigious an illusory perspective and makes us in childhood measuring futurity by them form so wild and exaggerated an estimate of the duration of human life 
6014_32856_000005_000003	train-clean-360	But I beg your pardon 
6014_32856_000006_000000	train-clean-360	My journey was from London 
none	none	When I had reached my lodgings after my little excursion up the Rhine upon my table there lay among the rest one letter there generally is in an overdue bundle which I viewed with suspicion 
6014_32856_000006_000002	train-clean-360	I could not in the least tell why 
none	none	It was a broad faced letter of bluish complexion and had made inquisition after me in the country had asked for me at Queen s Folkstone and vised by my cousin had presented itself at the Friars in Shropshire and thence proceeded by Sir Harry s direction there was the autograph to Nolton Hall thence again to Ilchester whence my fiery and decisive old aunt sent it straight back to my cousin with a whisk of her pen which seemed to say How the plague can I tell where the puppy is tis your business Sir not mine to find him out And so my cousin despatched it to my head quarters in town where from the table it looked up in my face with a broad red seal and a countenance scarred and marred all over with various post marks erasures and transverse directions the scars and furrows of disappointment and adventure 
6014_32856_000007_000000	train-clean-360	It had not a good countenance somehow 
6014_32856_000007_000001	train-clean-360	The original lines were not prepossessing 
none	none	The handwriting I knew as one sometimes knows a face without being able to remember who the plague it belongs to but still with an unpleasant association about it 
6014_32856_000007_000003	train-clean-360	I examined it carefully and laid it down unopened 
6014_32856_000007_000004	train-clean-360	I went through half a dozen others and recurred to it and puzzled over its exterior again and again postponed what I fancied would prove a disagreeable discovery and this happened every now and again until I had quite exhausted my budget and then I did open it and looked straight to the signature 
none	none	Pooh 
6014_32856_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Mark Wylder I exclaimed a good deal relieved 
none	none	Mark Wylder Yes Master Mark could not hurt me 
6014_32856_000009_000002	train-clean-360	There was nothing about him to excite the least uneasiness on the contrary I believe he liked me as well as he was capable of liking anybody and it was now seven years since we had met 
none	none	I have often since thought upon the odd sensation with which I hesitated over his unopened letter and now remembering how the breaking of that seal resembled in my life the breaking open of a portal through which I entered a labyrinth or rather a catacomb where for many days I groped and stumbled looking for light and was in a manner lost hearing strange sounds witnessing imperfectly strange sights and at last arriving at a dreadful chamber a sad sort of superstition steals over me I had then been his working junior in the cause of Wylder v Trustees of Brandon minor Dorcas Brandon his own cousin 
6014_32856_000011_000001	train-clean-360	There was a complicated cousinship among these Brandons Wylders and Lakes inextricable intermarriages which five years ago before I renounced the bar I had at my fingers ends but which had now relapsed into haze 
6014_32856_000011_000002	train-clean-360	There must have been some damnable taint in the blood of the common ancestor a spice of the insane and the diabolical 
6014_32856_000011_000003	train-clean-360	They were an ill conditioned race that is to say every now and then there emerged a miscreant with a pretty evident vein of madness 
6014_32856_000011_000004	train-clean-360	There was Sir Jonathan Brandon for instance who ran his own nephew through the lungs in a duel fought in a paroxysm of Cencian jealousy and afterwards shot his coachman dead upon the box through his coach window and finally died in Vienna whither he had absconded of a pike thrust received from a sentry in a brawl 
6014_32856_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The Wylders had not much to boast of even in contrast with that wicked line 
6014_32856_000012_000001	train-clean-360	They had produced their madmen and villains too and there had been frequent intermarriages not very often happy 
6014_32856_000012_000002	train-clean-360	There had been many lawsuits frequent disinheritings and even worse doings 
none	none	The Wylders of Brandon appear very early in history and the Wylder arms with their legend resurgam stands in bold relief over the great door of Brandon Hall 
6014_32856_000012_000004	train-clean-360	So there were Wylders of Brandon and Brandons of Brandon 
6014_32856_000012_000005	train-clean-360	In one generation a Wylder ill using his wife and hating his children would cut them all off and send the estate bounding back again to the Brandons 
6014_32856_000012_000006	train-clean-360	The next generation or two would amuse themselves with a lawsuit until the old Brandon type reappeared in some bachelor brother or uncle with a Jezebel on his left hand and an attorney on his right and presto 
6014_32856_000012_000007	train-clean-360	the estates were back again with the Wylders 
6014_32856_000013_000000	train-clean-360	A statement of title is usually a dry affair 
none	none	But that of the dynasty of Brandon Hall was a truculent romance Their very wills were spiced with the devilment of the testators and abounded in insinuations and even language which were scandalous 
6014_32856_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Here is Mark Wylder s letter 
6014_32856_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 DEAR CHARLES Of course you have heard of my good luck and how kind poor Dickie from whom I never expected anything proved at last 
none	none	It was a great windfall for a poor devil like me but after all it was only right for it ought never to have been his at all I went down and took possession on the fourth the tenants very glad and so they might well be for between ourselves Dickie poor fellow was not always pleasant to deal with He let the roof all out of repair and committed waste beside in timber he had no right to in life as I am told but that don t signify much only the house will cost me a pretty penny to get it into order and furnish The rental is five thousand a year and some hundreds and the rents can be got up a bit so Larkin tells me 
6014_32856_000015_000005	train-clean-360	Do you know anything of him 
none	none	He says he did business for your uncle once 
6014_32856_000015_000007	train-clean-360	He seems a clever fellow a bit too clever perhaps and was too much master here I suspect in poor Dickie s reign 
6014_32856_000015_000008	train-clean-360	Tell me all you can make out about him It is a long time since I saw you Charles I m grown brown and great whiskers 
6014_32856_000015_000009	train-clean-360	I met poor Dominick what an ass that chap is but he did not know me till I introduced myself so I must be a good deal changed 
6014_32856_000015_000010	train-clean-360	Our ship was at Malta when I got the letter 
6014_32856_000015_000011	train-clean-360	I was sick of the service and no wonder a lieutenant and there likely to stick all my days 
none	none	Six months last year on the African coast watching slavers think of that I had a long yarn from the viscount advice and that sort of thing 
6014_32856_000015_000013	train-clean-360	I do not think he is a year older than I but takes airs because he s a trustee 
6014_32856_000015_000014	train-clean-360	But I only laugh at trifles that would have riled me once 
none	none	So I wrote him a yarn in return and drew it uncommon mild And he has been useful to me and I think matters are pretty well arranged to disappoint the kind intention of good Uncle Wylder the brute he hated my father but that was no reason to persecute me and I but an infant almost when he died d him 
6014_32856_000015_000017	train-clean-360	Well you know he left Brandon with some charges to my Cousin Dorcas 
none	none	She is a superbly fine girl 
6014_32856_000015_000019	train-clean-360	Our ship was at Naples when she was there two years ago and I saw a good deal of her 
6014_32856_000015_000020	train-clean-360	Of course it was not to be thought of then but matters are quite different you know now and the viscount who is a very sensible fellow in the main saw it at once 
6014_32856_000015_000021	train-clean-360	You see the old brute meant to leave her a life estate but it does not amount to that though it won t benefit me for he settled that when I die it shall go to his right heirs that will be to my son if I ever have one 
6014_32856_000015_000022	train-clean-360	So Miss Dorcas must pack and turn out whenever I die that is if I slip my cable first 
none	none	Larkin told me this and I took an opinion and found it is so and the viscount seeing it agreed the best thing for her as well as me would be we should marry 
6014_32856_000015_000024	train-clean-360	She is a wide awake young lady and nothing the worse for that I m a bit that way myself 
6014_32856_000015_000025	train-clean-360	And so very little courtship has sufficed 
6014_32856_000015_000026	train-clean-360	She is a splendid beauty and when you see her you ll say any fellow might be proud of such a bride and so I am 
6014_32856_000015_000027	train-clean-360	And now dear Charlie you have it all 
6014_32856_000015_000028	train-clean-360	It will take place somewhere about the twenty fourth of next month and you must come down by the first if you can 
6014_32856_000015_000029	train-clean-360	Don t disappoint 
6014_32856_000015_000030	train-clean-360	I want you for best man maybe and besides I would like to talk to you about some things they want me to do in the settlements and you were always a long headed fellow so pray don t refuse 
6014_32856_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Dear Charlie ever most sincerely 
6014_32856_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Your old Friend 
none	none	MARK WYLDER
6014_32856_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 P S I stay at the Brandon Arms in the town until after the marriage and then you can have a room at the Hall and capital shooting when we return which will be in a fortnight after 
none	none	I can t say that Wylder was an old friend 
6014_32856_000020_000001	train-clean-360	But he was certainly one of the oldest and most intimate acquaintances I had 
6014_32856_000020_000002	train-clean-360	We had been for nearly three years at school together and when his ship came to England met frequently and twice when he was on leave we had been for months together under the same roof and had for some years kept up a regular correspondence which first grew desultory and finally as manhood supervened died out 
none	none	The plain truth is I did not very much like him 
6014_32856_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Then there was that beautiful apathetic Dorcas Brandon 
6014_32856_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Where is the laggard so dull as to experience no pleasing flutter at his heart in anticipation of meeting a perfect beauty in a country house 
6014_32856_000021_000002	train-clean-360	I was romantic like every other youngish fellow who is not a premature curmudgeon and there was something indefinitely pleasant in the consciousness that although a betrothed bride the young lady still was fancy free not a bit in love 
6014_32856_000021_000003	train-clean-360	It was but a marriage of convenience with mitigations 
none	none	And so there hovered in my curiosity some little flicker of egotistic romance which helped to rouse my spirits and spur me on to action CHAPTER II IN WHICH I ENTER THE DRAWING ROOM I was now approaching Brandon Hall less than ten minutes more would set me down at its door steps The stiff figure of missus Marston the old housekeeper pale and austere in rustling black silk she was accounted a miser and estimated to have saved I dare not say how much money in the Wylder family kind to me with the bread and jam and Naples biscuit kindness of her species in old times stood in fancy at the doorway She too was a dream and I dare say her money spent by this time And that other dream to which she often led me with the large hazel eyes and clear delicate tints so sweet so riante yet so sad poor Lady Mary Brandon dying there so unhappily mated a young mother and her baby sleeping in long Broderie Anglaise attire upon the pillow on the sofa and whom she used to show me with a peeping mystery and her finger to her smiling lip and a gaiety and fondness in her pretty face That little helpless groping wailing creature was now the Dorcas Brandon the mistress of the grand old mansion and all its surroundings who was the heroine of the splendid matrimonial compromise which was about to reconcile a feud and avert a possible lawsuit and for one generation at least to tranquillise the troubled annals of the Brandons and Wylders And now the ancient gray chapel with its stained window and store of old Brandon and Wylder monuments among its solemn clump of elm trees flitted by on my right and in a moment more we drew up at the great gate on the left not a hundred yards removed from it and with an eager recognition I gazed on the noble front of the old manorial house Up the broad straight avenue with its solemn files of gigantic timber towering at the right and the left hand the chaise rolled smoothly and through the fantastic iron gate of the courtyard and with a fine swinging sweep and a jerk we drew up handsomely before the door steps with the Wylder arms in bold and florid projection carved above it The sun had just gone down The blue shadows of twilight overcast the landscape and the mists of night were already stealing like thin smoke among the trunks and roots of the trees Through the stone mullions of the projecting window at the right a flush of fire light looked pleasant and hospitable and on the threshold were standing Lord Chelford and my old friend Mark Wylder a faint perfume of the mildest cheroot declared how they had been employed So I jumped to the ground and was greeted very kindly by the smokers I m here you know in loco parentis my mother and I keep watch and ward We allow Wylder you see to come every day to his devotions But you are not to go to the Brandon Arms you got my note didn t you I had and had come direct to the Hall in consequence I looked over the door Yes my memory had served me right There were the Brandon arms and the Brandon quartered with the Wylder but the Wylder coat in the centre with the grinning griffins for supporters and flaunting scrolls all round and the ominous word resurgam underneath proclaimed itself sadly and vauntingly over the great entrance I often wonder how the Wylder coat came in the centre who built the old house a Brandon or a Wylder and if a Wylder why was it Brandon Hall Dusty and seedy somewhat as men are after a journey I chatted with Mark and the noble peer for a few minutes at the door while my valise and et ceteras were lifted in and hurried up the stairs to my room whither I followed them While I was at my toilet in came Mark Wylder laughing as was his wont and very unceremoniously he took possession of my easy chair and threw his leg over the arm of it I m glad you re come Charlie you were always a good fellow and I really want a hand here confoundedly I think it will all do very nicely but of course there s a lot of things to be arranged settlements you know and I can t make head or tail of their lingo and a fellow don t like to sign and seal hand over head you would not advise that you know and Chelford is a very good fellow of course and all that but he s taking care of Dorcas you see and I might be left in the lurch It is a better way at all events Mark than Wylder versus Trustees of Brandon minor said I Well things do turn out very oddly don t they said Mark with a sly glance of complacency and his hands in his pockets But I know you ll hold the tiller till I get through hang me if I know the soundings or where I m going and you have the chart by heart Charlie I m afraid you ll find me by no means so well up now as six years ago in Wylder and Brandon but surely you have your lawyer mister Larkin haven t you To be sure that s exactly it he s Dorcas s agent I don t know anything about him and I do know you don t you see A fellow doesn t want to put himself into the hands of a stranger altogether especially a lawyer ha ha it wouldn t pay I did not half like the equivocal office which my friend Mark had prepared for me If family squabbles were to arise I had no fancy to mix in them and I did not want a collision with mister Larkin either and on the whole notwithstanding his modesty I thought Wylder very well able to take care of himself There was time enough however to settle the point So by this time being splendid in French boots and white vest and altogether perfect and refreshed I emerged from my dressing room Wylder by my side We had to get along a dim oak panelled passage and into a sort of oeil de boeuf with a lantern light above from which diverged two other solemn corridors and a short puzzling turn or two brought us to the head of the upper stairs For I being a bachelor and treated accordingly was airily perched on the third storey To my mind there is something indescribably satisfactory in the intense solidity of those old stairs and floors no spring in the planks not a creak you walk as over strata of stone What clumsy grandeur What Cyclopean carpenters What a prodigality of oak It was dark by this time and the drawing room a vast and grand chamber with no light but the fire and a pair of dim soft lamps near the sofas and ottomans lofty and glowing with rich tapestry curtains and pictures and mirrors and carved oak and marble was already tenanted by the ladies Old Lady Chelford stiff and rich a Vandyke dowager with a general effect of deep lace funereal velvet and pearls and pale with dreary eyes and thin high nose sat in a high backed carved oak throne with red cushions To her I was first presented and cursorily scrutinised with a stately old fashioned insolence as if I were a candidate footman and so dismissed On a low seat chatting to her as I came up was a very handsome and rather singular looking girl fair with a light golden tinted hair and a countenance though then grave enough instinct with a certain promise of animation and spirit not to be mistaken Could this be the heroine of the pending alliance No I was mistaken A third lady at what would have been an ordinary room s length away half reclining on an ottoman was now approached by Wylder who presented me to Miss Brandon Dorcas this is my old friend Charles de Cresseron You have often heard me speak of him and I want you to shake hands and make his acquaintance and draw him out do you see for he s a shy youth and must be encouraged He gave me a cheerful slap on the shoulder as he uttered this agreeable bit of banter and altogether disconcerted me confoundedly Wylder s dress coats always smelt of tobacco and his talk of tar I was quietly incensed and disgusted for in those days I was a little shy The lady rose in a soft floating way tall black haired but a blackness with a dull rich shadow through it I had only a general impression of large dusky eyes and very exquisite features more delicate than the Grecian models and with a wonderful transparency like tinted marble and a superb haughtiness quite unaffected She held forth her hand which I did little more than touch There was a peculiarity in her greeting which I felt a little overawing without exactly discovering in what it consisted and it was I think that she did not smile She never took that trouble for form s sake like other women So as Wylder had set a chair for me I could not avoid sitting upon it though I should much have preferred standing after the manner of men and retaining my liberty CHAPTER III OUR DINNER PARTY AT BRANDON I was curious I had heard a great deal of her beauty and it had exceeded all I heard so I talked my sublimest and brightest chit chat in my most musical tones and was rather engaging and amusing I ventured to hope But the best man cannot manage a dialogue alone Miss Brandon was plainly not a person to make any sort of exertion towards what is termed keeping up a conversation at all events she did not and after a while the present one got into a decidedly sinking condition An acquiescence a faint expression of surprise a fainter smile she contributed little more after the first few questions of courtesy had been asked in her low silvery tones and answered by me To me the natural demise of a tete a tete discourse has always seemed a disgrace But this apathetic beauty had either more moral courage or more stupidity than I and was plainly terribly indifferent about the catastrophe I ve sometimes thought my struggles and sinkings amused her cruel serenity Bella ma stupida I experienced at last the sort of pique with which George Sand s hero apostrophises la derniere Aldini Yet I could not think her stupid The universal instinct honours beauty It is so difficult to believe it either dull or base In virtue of some mysterious harmonies it is the image of God and must we feel enclose the God like so I suppose I felt for though I wished to think her stupid I could not She was not exactly languid but a grave and listless beauty and a splendid beauty for all that I told her my early recollections of Brandon and Gylingden and how I remembered her a baby and said some graceful trifles on that theme which I fancied were likely to please But they were only received and led to nothing In a little while in comes Lord Chelford always natural and pleasant and quite unconscious of his peerage he was above it I think and chatted away merrily with that handsome animated blonde who on earth could she be and did not seem the least chilled in the stiff and frosted presence of his mother but was genial and playful even with that Spirit of the Frozen Ocean who received his affectionate trifling with a sort of smiling though wintry pride and complacency reflecting back from her icy aspects something of the rosy tints of that kindly sunshine I thought I heard him call the young lady Miss Lake and there rose before me an image of an old General Lake and a dim recollection of some reverse of fortune He was I was sure of that connected with the Brandon family and was with the usual fatality a bit of a mauvais sujet He had made away with his children s money or squandered his own or somehow or another impoverished his family not creditably So I glanced at her and Miss Brandon divined it seemed what was passing in my mind for she said That is my cousin Miss Lake and I think her very beautiful don t you Yes she certainly is very handsome and I was going to say something about her animation and spirit but remembered just in time that that line of eulogy would hardly have involved a compliment to Miss Brandon I know her brother a little that is Captain Lake Stanley Lake he s her brother I fancy Oh said the young lady in that tone which is pointed with an unknown accent between a note of enquiry and of surprise Yes he s her brother And she paused as if something more were expected But at that moment the bland tones of Larcom the solemn butler announced the reverend William Wylder and missus Wylder and I said William is an old college friend of mine and I observed him as he entered with an affectionate and sad sort of interest Eight years had passed since we met last and that is something at any time It had thinned my simple friend s hair a little and his face too was more careworn than I liked but his earnest sweet smile was there still Slight gentle with something of a pale and studious refinement in his face The same gentle voice with that slight occasional hesitation which somehow I liked There is always a little shock after an absence of some years before identities adjust themselves and then we find the change is not after all so very great I suspect it is rather that something of the old picture is obliterated in that little interval to return no more And so William Wylder was vicar now instead of that straight wiry cleric of the mulberry face and black leggings And who was this little missus William Wylder who came in so homely of feature so radiant of goodhumour so eager and simple in a very plain dress a Brandon housemaid would not have been seen in it leaning so pleasantly on his lean long clerical arm made for reaching books down from high shelves a lank scholarlike limb with a somewhat threadbare cuff and who looked round with that anticipation of pleasure and that simple confidence in a real welcome which are so likely to insure it Was she an helpmeet for a black letter man who talked with the Fathers in his daily walks could extemporise Latin hexameters and dream in Greek Was she very wise or at all learned I think her knowledge lay chiefly in the matters of poultry and puddings and latterly of the nursery where one treasure lay that golden haired little boy four years old whom I had seen playing among the roses before the parsonage door asleep by this time half past seven precise as old Lady Chelford loved to write on her summons to dinner When the vicar I dare say in a very odd quaint way made his proposal of marriage moved thereto assuredly neither by fortune nor by beauty to good merry little Miss Dorothy Chubley whom nobody was supposed to be looking after and the town had somehow set down from the first as a natural born old maid there was a very general amazement some disappointment here and there with customary sneers and compassion and a good deal of genuine amusement not ill natured Miss Chubley all the shopkeepers in the town knew and liked and in a way respected her as Miss Dolly Old Reverend John Chubley D D who had been in love with his wife from the period of his boyhood and yet so grudging was Fate had to undergo an engagement of nigh thirty years before Hymen rewarded their constancy being at length made Vicar of Huddelston and master of church revenues to the amount of three hundred pounds a year had at forty five married his early love now forty two They had never grown old in one another s fond eyes Their fidelity was of the days of chivalry and their simplicity comical and beautiful Twenty years of happy and loving life were allotted them and one pledge poor Miss Dorothy was left alone when little more than nineteen years old This good old couple having loved early and waited long and lived together with wonderful tenderness and gaiety of heart their allotted span bid farewell for a little while the gentle little lady going first and in about two years more the good rector following I remembered him but more dimly than his merry little wife though she went first She made raisin wine and those curious biscuits that tasted of Windsor soap And this missus William Wylder just announced by soft toned Larcom is the daughter there is no mistaking the jolly smile and lumpy odd little features and radiance of amiability of the good doctor and missus Chubley so curiously blended in her loving face And last comes in old Major Jackson smiling largely squaring himself and doing his courtesies in a firm but florid military style and plainly pleased to find himself in good company and on the eve of a good dinner And so our dinner list is full The party were just nine and it is wonderful what a row nine well behaved people will contrive to make at a dinner table The inferior animals as we see them caged and cared for and fed at one o clock precise in those public institutions provided for their maintenance confine their uproar to the period immediately antecedent to their meal and perform the actual process of deglutition with silent attention and only such suckings lappings and crunchings as illustrate their industry and content It is the distinctive privilege of man to exert his voice during his repast and to indulge also in those specially human cachinnations which no lower creature except that disreputable Australian biped known as the laughing jackass presumes to imitate and to these vocal exercises of the feasters respond the endless ring and tinkle of knife and fork on china plate and the ministering angels in white chokers behind the chairs those murmured solicitations which hum round and round the ears of the revellers Of course when great guns are present and people talk pro bono publico one at a time with parliamentary regularity things are different but at an ordinary symposium when the garrulous and diffident make merry together and people break into twos or threes and talk across the table or into their neighbours ears and all together the noise is not only exhilarating and peculiar but sometimes perfectly unaccountable The talk of course has its paroxysms and its subsidences I have once or twice found myself on a sudden in total silence in the middle of a somewhat prolix though humorous story commenced in an uproar for the sole recreation of my pretty neighbour and ended patched up renounced a faltering failure under the converging gaze of a sternly attentive audience On the other hand there are moments when the uproar whirls up in a crescendo to a pitch and volume perfectly amazing and at such times I believe that anyone might say anything to the reveller at his elbow without the smallest risk of being overheard by mortal You may plan with young Caesar Borgia on your left the poisoning of your host or ask pretty missus Fusible on your right to elope with you from her grinning and gabbling lord whose bald head flashes red with champagne only at the other side of the table There is no privacy like it you may plot your wickedness or make your confession or pop the question and not a soul but your confidant be a bit the wiser provided only you command your countenance I don t know how it happened but Wylder sat beside Miss Lake I fancied he ought to have been differently placed but Miss Brandon did not seem conscious of his absence and it seemed to me that the handsome blonde would have been as well pleased if he had been anywhere but where he was There was no look of liking though some faint glimmerings both of annoyance and embarrassment in her face But in Wylder s I saw a sort of conceited consciousness and a certain eagerness too while he talked though a shrewd fellow in many ways he had a secret conviction that no woman could resist him I suppose the world thinks me a very happy fellow Miss Lake he said with a rather pensive glance of enquiry into that young lady s eyes as he set down his hock glass I m afraid it s a selfish world mister Wylder and thinks very little of what does not concern it Now you I dare say continued Wylder not caring to perceive the soupcon of sarcasm that modulated her answer so musically look upon me as a very fortunate fellow You are a very fortunate person mister Wylder a gentleman of very moderate abilities with no prospects and without fortune who finds himself without any deservings of his own on a sudden possessed of an estate and about to be united to the most beautiful heiress in England is I think rather a fortunate person You did not always think me so stupid Miss Lake said mister Wylder showing something of the hectic of vexation Stupid did I say Well you know we learn by experience mister Wylder One s judgment matures and we are harder to please don t you think so as we grow older Aye so we are I dare say at any rate some things don t please us as we calculated I remember when this bit of luck would have made me a devilish happy fellow twice as happy but you see if a fellow hasn t his liberty where s the good of money I don t know how I got into it but I can t get away now and the lawyer fellows and trustees and all that sort of prudent people get about one and persuade and exhort and they bully you by Jove into what they call a marriage of convenience I forget the French word you know and then you see your feelings may be very different and all that and where s the good of money I say if you can t enjoy it And mister Wylder looked poetically unhappy and trundled over a little bit of fricandeau on his plate with his fork desolately as though earthly things had lost their relish Yes I think I know the feeling said Miss Lake quietly That ballad you know expresses it very prettily Oh thou hast been the cause of this anguish my mother It was not then as old a song as it is now Wylder looked sharply at her but she did not smile and seemed to speak in good faith and being somewhat thick in some matters though a cunning fellow he said Yes that is the sort of thing you know of course with a difference a girl is supposed to speak there but men suffer that way too though of course very likely it s more their own fault It is very sad said Miss Lake who was busy with a pate She has no life in her she s a mere figurehead she s awfully slow I don t like black hair I m taken by conversation and all that There are some men that can only really love once in their lives and never forget their first love I assure you Wylder murmured all this and looked as plaintive as he could without exciting the attention of the people over the way Mark Wylder had as you perceive rather vague notions of decency and not much experience of ladies and thought he was making just the interesting impression he meditated He was a good deal surprised then when Miss Lake said and with quite a cheerful countenance and very quickly but so that her words stung his ear like the prick of a bodkin Your way of speaking of my cousin Sir is in the highest degree discreditable to you and offensive to me and should you venture to repeat it I will certainly mention it to Lady Chelford And so she turned to old Major Jackson at her right who had been expounding a point of the battle of Vittoria to Lord Chelford and she led him again into action and acquired during the next ten minutes a great deal of curious lore about Spanish muleteers and French prisoners together with some particulars about the nature of picket duty and that scoundrel Castanos CHAPTER IV IN WHICH WE GO TO THE DRAWING ROOM AND THE PARTY BREAKS UP Wylder was surprised puzzled and a good deal incensed that saucy craft had fired her shot so unexpectedly across his bows He looked a little flushed and darted a stealthy glance across the table but no one he thought had observed the manoeuvre He would have talked to ugly missus W Wylder his sister in law at his left but she was entertaining Lord Chelford now He had nothing for it but to perform cavalier seul with his slice of mutton a sensual sort of isolation while all the world was chatting so agreeably and noisily around him He would have liked at that moment a walk upon the quarter deck with a good head wind blowing and liberty to curse and swear a bit over the bulwark Women are so full of caprice and hypocrisy and humbugging impudence Wylder was rather surly after the ladies had floated away from the scene and he drank his liquor doggedly It was his fancy I suppose to revive certain sentimental relations which had it may be once existed between him and Miss Lake and he was a person of that combative temperament that magnifies an object in proportion as its pursuit is thwarted In the drawing room he watched Miss Lake over his cup of coffee and after a few words to his fiancee he lounged toward the table at which she was turning over some prints Do come here Dorothy she exclaimed not raising her eyes I have found the very thing What thing my dear Miss Lake said that good little woman skipping to her side The story of Fridolin and Retzch s pretty outlines Sit down beside me and I ll tell you the story Oh said the vicar s wife taking her seat and the inspection and exposition began and Mark Wylder who had intended renewing his talk with Miss Lake saw that she had foiled him and stood with a heightened colour and his hands in his pockets looking confoundedly cross and very like an outcast in the shadow behind After a while in a pet he walked away Lord Chelford had joined the two ladies and had something to say about German art and some pleasant lights to throw from foreign travel and devious reading and was as usual intelligent and agreeable and Mark was still more sore and angry and strutted away to another table a long way off and tossed over the leaves of a folio of Wouverman s works and did not see one of the plates he stared at so savagely I don t think Mark was very clear as to what he wanted or even if he had had a cool half hour to define his wishes that he would seriously have modified existing arrangements But he had a passionate sort of obstinacy and his whims took a violent character when they were crossed and he was angry and jealous and unintelligible reminding one of Carlyle s description of Philip Egalite a chaos Then he joined a conversation going on between Dorcas Brandon and the vicar his brother He assisted at it but took no part and in fact was listening to that other conversation which sounded with its pleasant gabble and laughter like a little musical tinkle of bells in the distance His gall rose and that distant talk rang in his ears like a cool but intangible insult It was dull work He looked at his watch the brougham would be at the door to take Miss Lake home in a quarter of an hour so he glided by old Lady Chelford who was dozing stiffly through her spectacles on a French novel and through a second drawing room and into the hall where he saw Larcom s expansive white waistcoat and disregarded his advance and respectful inclination and strode into the outer hall or vestibule where were hat stands walking sticks great coats umbrellas and the exuviae of gentlemen Mark clapped on his hat and rifled the pocket of his paletot of his cigar case and matches and spluttered a curse or two according to old Nollekins receipt for easing the mind and on the door steps lighted his cheroot and became gradually more philosophical In due time the brougham came round with its lamps lighted and Mark who was by this time placid greeted Price on the box familiarly after his wont and asked him whom he was going to drive as if he did not know cunning fellow and actually went so far as to give Price one of those cheap and nasty weeds of which he kept a supply apart in his case for such occasions of good fellowship So Mark waited to put the lady into the carriage and he meditated walking a little way by the window and making his peace and there was perhaps some vague vision of jumping in afterwards I know not Mark s ideas of ladies and of propriety were low and he was little better than a sailor ashore and not a good specimen of that class of monster He walked about the courtyard smoking looking sometimes on the solemn front of the old palatial mansion and sometimes breathing a white film up to the stars impatient like the enamoured Aladdin watching in ambuscade for the emergence of the Princess Badroulbadour But honest Mark forgot that young ladies do not always come out quite alone and jump unassisted into their vehicles And in fact not only did Lord Chelford assist the fair lady cloaked and hooded into the carriage but the vicar s goodhumoured little wife was handed in also the good vicar looking on and as the gay good night and leave taking took place by the door steps Mark drew back like a guilty thing in silence and showed no sign but the red top of his cigar glowing like the eye of a Cyclops in the dark and away rolled the brougham with the two ladies and Chelford and the vicar went in and Mark hurled the stump of his cheroot at Fortune and delivered a fragmentary soliloquy through his teeth and so in a sulk without making his adieux he marched off to his crib at the Brandon Arms CHAPTER V IN WHICH MY SLUMBER IS DISTURBED The ladies had accomplished their ascension to the upper regions The good vicar had marched off with the major who was by this time unbuckling in his lodgings and Chelford and I tete a tete had a glass of sherry and water together in the drawing room before parting And over this temperate beverage I told him frankly the nature of the service which Mark Wylder wished me to render him and he as frankly approved and said he would ask Larkin the family lawyer to come up in the morning to assist The more I saw of this modest refined and manly peer the more I liked him There was a certain courteous frankness and a fine old English sense of duty perceptible in all his serious talk So I felt no longer like a conspirator and was to offer such advice as might seem expedient with the clear approbation of Miss Brandon s trustee And this point clearly settled I avowed myself a little tired and lighting our candles at the foot of the stairs we scaled that long ascent together and he conducted me through the intricacies of the devious lobbies up stairs to my chamber door where he bid me good night shook hands and descended to his own quarters My room was large and old fashioned but snug and I beginning to grow very drowsy was not long in getting to bed where I fell asleep indescribably quickly In all old houses one is of course liable to adventures Where is the marvellous to find refuge if not among the chambers the intricacies which have seen the vicissitudes the crimes and the deaths of generations of such men as had occupied these There was a picture in the outer hall one of those full length gentlemen of George II s time with a dark peruke flowing on his shoulders a cut velvet coat and lace cravat and ruffles This picture was pale and had a long chin and somehow had impressed my boyhood with a singular sense of fear The foot of my bed lay towards the window distant at least five and twenty feet and before the window stood my dressing table and on it a large looking glass I dreamed that I was arranging my toilet before this glass just as I had done that evening when on a sudden the face of the portrait I have mentioned was presented on its surface confronting me like a real countenance and advancing towards me with a look of fury and at the instant I felt myself seized by the throat and unable to stir or to breathe After a struggle with this infernal garotter I succeeded in awaking myself and as I did so I felt a rather cold hand really resting on my throat and quietly passed up over my chin and face I jumped out of bed with a roar and challenged the owner of the hand but received no answer and heard no sound I poked up my fire and lighted my candle Everything was as I had left it except the door which was the least bit open In my shirt candle in hand I looked out into the passage There was nothing there in human shape but in the direction of the stairs the green eyes of a large cat were shining I was so confoundedly nervous that even a harmless necessary cat appalled me and I clapped my door as if against an evil spirit In about half an hour s time however I had quite worked off the effect of this night mare and reasoned myself into the natural solution that the creature had got on my bed and lay as I have been told they will upon my throat and so all the rest had followed Not being given to the fear of larvae and lemures and also knowing that a mistake is easily committed in a great house like that and that my visitor might have made one I grew drowsy in a little while and soon fell asleep again But knowing all I now do I hold a different conclusion and so I think will you In the morning Mark Wylder was early upon the ground He had quite slept off what he would have called the nonsense of last night and was very keen upon settlements consols mortgages jointures and all that dry but momentous lore I find a note in my diary of that day From half past ten o clock until two with Mark Wylder and mister Larkin the lawyer in the study dull work over papers and title Lord Chelford with us now and then to lend a helping hand Lawyer Larkin though he made our work lighter for he was clear quick and orderly and could lay his hand on any paper in those tin walls of legal manuscripts that built up two sides of his office did not make our business to me at least any pleasanter Wylder thought him a clever man and so perhaps in a certain sense he was Lord Chelford a most honourable one yet there came to me by instinct an unpleasant feeling about him It was not in any defined way I did not fancy that he was machinating for instance any sort of mischief in the business before us but I had a notion that he was not quite what he pretended Perhaps his personnel prejudiced me though I could not quite say why He was a tall lank man rather long of limb long of head and gaunt of face He wanted teeth at both sides and there was rather a skull like cavity when he smiled which was pretty often His eyes were small and reddish as if accustomed to cry and when everything went smoothly were dull and dove like but when things crossed or excited him which occurred when his own pocket or plans were concerned they grew singularly unpleasant and greatly resembled those of some not amiable animal was it a rat or a serpent It was a peculiar concentrated vigilance and rapine that I have seen there But that was long afterwards Now indeed they were meek and sad and pink He had an ambition too to pass for a high bred gentleman and thought it might be done by a somewhat lofty and drawling way of talking and distributing his length of limb in what he fancied were easy attitudes If the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel so are the elegances of a vulgar man and his made me wince I might be all in the wrong and was no doubt unreasonable for he bore a high character and passed for a very gentlemanlike man among the villagers He was also something of a religious light and had for a time conformed to Methodism but returned to the Church He had a liking for long sermons and a sad abhorrence of amusements and sat out the morning and the evening services regularly and kept up his dissenting connection too and gave them money and appeared in print in all charitable lists and mourned over other men s backslidings and calamities in a lofty and Christian way shaking his tall bald head and turning up his pink eyes mildly Notwithstanding all which he was somehow unlovely in my eyes and in an indistinct way formidable It was not a pleasant misgiving about a gentleman of Larkin s species the family lawyer who become viscera magnorum domuum My duties were lighter as adviser than I at first apprehended Wylder s crotchets were chiefly mare s nests We had read the draft of the settlement preparatory to its being sent to senior counsel to be approved Wylder s attorney had done his devoir and mister Larkin avowed a sort of parental interest in both parties to the indentures and made at closing a little speech very high in morality and flavoured in a manly way with religion and congratulated Mark on his honour and plain dealing which he gave us to understand were the secrets of all success in life as they had been in an humble way of his own CHAPTER VI IN WHICH DORCAS BRANDON SPEAKS In answer to the roaring shiver of the gong we all trooped away together to luncheon Lady Chelford and Dorcas and Chelford had nearly ended that irregular repast when we entered My chair was beside Miss Brandon she had breakfasted with old Lady Chelford that morning and this was my first meeting that day It was not very encouraging People complained that acquaintance made little way with her That you were perhaps well satisfied with your first day s progress but the next made no head way you found yourself this morning exactly at the point from which you commenced yesterday and to morrow would recommence where you started the day before This is very disappointing but may sometimes be accounted for by there being nothing really to discover It seemed to me however that the distance had positively increased since yesterday and that the oftener she met me the more strange she became As we went out Wylder enquired with his usual good taste Well what do you think of her Then he looked slily at me laughing with his hands in his pockets A little bit slow eh he whispered and laughed again and lounged into the hall If Dorcas Brandon had been a plain woman I think she would have been voted an impertinent bore but she was so beautiful that she became an enigma I looked at her as she stood gravely gazing from the window Is it Lady Macbeth No she never would have had energy to plan her husband s career and manage that affair of Duncan A sultana rather sublimely egotistical without reverence a voluptuous and haughty embodiment of indifference I paused looking at a picture but thinking of her and was surprised by her voice very near me Will you give me just a minute mister De Cresseron in the drawing room while I show you a miniature I want your opinion So she floated on and I accompanied her I think she said you mentioned yesterday that you remembered me when an infant You remember my poor mamma don t you very well This was the first time she had yet shown any tendency so far as I had seen to be interested in anything or to talk to me I seized the occasion and gave her as well as I could the sad and pretty picture that remained and always will in the vacant air when I think of her on the mysterious retina of memory How filmy they are the moonlight shines through them as through the phantom Dane in Retzch s outlines colour without substance How they come wearing for ever the sweetest and pleasantest look of their earthly days Their sweetest and merriest tones hover musically in the distance how far away how near to silence yet how clear And so it is with our remembrance of the immortal part It is the loveliest traits that remain with us perennially all that was noblest and most beautiful is there in a changeless and celestial shadow and this is the resurrection of the memory the foretaste and image which the Faithful Creator accords us of the resurrection and glory to come the body redeemed the spirit made perfect On a cabinet near to where she stood was a casket of ormolu which she unlocked and took out a miniature opened and looked at it for a long time I knew very well whose it was and watched her countenance for as I have said she interested me strangely I suppose she knew I was looking at her but she showed always a queenlike indifference about what people might think or observe There was no sentimental softening but her gaze was such as I once saw the same proud and handsome face turn upon the dead pale exquisite perhaps a little stern What she read there what procession of thoughts and images passed by threw neither light nor shadow on her face Its apathy interested me inscrutably At last she placed the picture in my hand and asked Is this really very like her It is and it is not I said after a little pause The features are true it is what I call an accurate portrait but that is all I dare say exact as it is it would give to one who had not seen her a false as it must an inadequate idea of the original There was something naive and spirituel and very tender in her face which he has not caught perhaps it could hardly be fixed in colours Yes I always heard her expression and intelligence were very beautiful It was the beauty of mobility true beauty There is a beauty of another stamp equally exquisite Miss Brandon and perhaps more overpowering I said this in nearly a whisper and in a very marked way almost tender and the next moment was amazed at my own audacity She looked on me for a second or two with her dark drowsy glance and then it returned to the picture which was again in her hand There was a total want of interest in the careless sort of surprise she vouchsafed my little sally neither was there the slightest resentment If a wafer had been stuck upon my forehead and she had observed it there might have been just that look and no more I was ridiculously annoyed with myself I was betrayed I don t know how into this little venture and it was a flat failure The position of a shy man who has just made an unintelligible joke at a dinner table was not more pregnant with self reproach and embarrassment Upon my honour I don t think there was anything of the roue in me I own I did feel towards this lady who either was or seemed to me so singular a mysterious interest just beginning of that peculiar kind which becomes at last terribly absorbing I was more elated by her trifling notice of me than I can quite account for It was a distinction She was so indescribably handsome so passively disdainful I think if she had listened to me with even the faintest intimation of caring whether I spoke in this tone or not with even a flash of momentary resentment I might have rushed into a most reprehensible and ridiculous rigmarole In this the subtlest and most perilous of all intoxications it needs immense presence of mind to conduct ourselves always with decorum But she was looking just as before at the miniature as it seemed to me in fancy infusing some of the spirit I had described into the artist s record and she said only in soliloquy as it were Yes I see I think I see So there was a pause and then she said without however removing her eyes from the miniature You are I believe mister De Cresseron a very old friend of mister Wylder s Is it not so So soon after my little escapade I did not like the question but it was answered There was not the faintest trace of a satirical meaning however in her face and after another very considerable interval at the end of which she shut the miniature in its case she said It was a peculiar face and very beautiful It is odd how many of our family married for love wild love matches My poor mother was the last I could point you out many pictures and tell you stories my cousin Rachel knows them all You know Rachel Lake I ve not the honour of knowing Miss Lake I had not an opportunity of making her acquaintance yesterday but I know her brother so does Wylder What s that said Mark who had just come in and was tumbling over a volume of Punch at the window I was telling Miss Brandon that we both know Stanley Lake On hearing which Wylder seemed to discover something uncommonly interesting or clever in the illustration before him for he approached his face very near to it in a scrutinising way and only said Oh That marrying for love was a fatality in our family she continued in the same low tone too faint I think to reach Mark They were all the most beautiful who sacrificed themselves so they were all unhappy marriages So the beauty of our family never availed it any more than its talents and its courage for there were clever and witty men as well as very brave ones in it Meaner houses have grown up into dukedoms ours never prospers I wonder what it is Many families have disappeared altogether Miss Brandon It is no small thing through so many centuries to have retained your ancestral estates and your pre eminent position and even this splendid residence of so many generations of your lineage I thought that Miss Brandon having broken the ice was henceforth to be a conversable young lady But this sudden expansion was not to last Ovid tells us in his Fasti how statues sometimes surprised people by speaking more frankly and to the purpose even than Miss Brandon and straight were cold chiselled marble again and so it was with that proud cold chef d oeuvre of tinted statuary Yet I thought I could even in that dim glimpse discern how the silent subterranean current of her thoughts was flowing like other representatives of a dynasty she had studied the history of her race to profit by its errors and misfortunes There was to be no weakness or passion in her reign The princess by this time was seated on the ottoman and chose to read a letter thus intimating I suppose that my audience was at an end so I took up a book put it down and then went and looked over Wylder s shoulder and made my criticisms not very novel I fear upon the pages he turned over and I am sorry to say I don t think he heard much of what I was saying for he suddenly came out with And where is Stanley Lake now do you know I saw him in town only for a moment though about a fortnight ago he was arranging he said about selling out Oh retiring and what does he propose doing then asked Wylder without raising his eyes from his book He spoke in a sort of undertone like a man who does not want to be overheard and the room was quite large enough to make that sort of secrecy easy without the appearance of seeking it I have not an idea I don t think he s fit for many things He knows something of horses I believe and something of play But he ll hardly make out a living that way said Wylder with a sort of sneer or laugh I thought he seemed put out and a little flushed I fancy he has enough to live upon without adding to it however I said Wylder leaned back in his low chair with his hands stuffed in his pockets and the air of a man trying to look unconcerned but both annoyed and disconcerted nevertheless I tell you what Charlie between you and me that fellow Stanley is a d d bad lot I may be mistaken of course he s always been very civil to me but we don t like one another and I don t think I ever heard him say a good word of any one I dare say he abuses you and me as he does everyone else Does he I said I was not aware he had that failing Oh yes He does not stick at trifles Master Stanley He s about the greatest liar I think I ever met with and he laughed angrily I happened at that moment to raise my eyes and I saw Dorcas s face reflected in the mirror her back was towards us and she held the letter in her hand as if reading it but her large eyes were looking over it and on us in the glass with a gaze of strange curiosity Our glances met in the mirror but hers remained serenely undisturbed and mine dropped and turned away hastily I wonder whether she heard us I do not know Some people are miraculously sharp of hearing I dare say said Wylder with a sneer he was asking affectionately for me eh No not that I recollect in fact there was not time but I suppose he does not like you less for what has happened you re worth cultivating now you know Wylder was leaning on his elbow with just the tip of his thumb to his teeth with a vicious character of biting it which was peculiar to him when anything vexed him considerably and glancing sharply this way and that You know he said suddenly we are a sort of cousins his mother was a Brandon a second cousin of Dorcas s no of her father s I don t know exactly how He s a pushing fellow one of the coolest hands I know but I don t see that I can be of any use to him or why the devil I should I say old fellow come out and have a weed will you I raised my eyes Miss Brandon had left the room I don t know that her presence would have prevented his invitation for Wylder s wooing was certainly of the coolest So forth we sallied and under the autumnal foliage in the cool amber light of the declining evening we enjoyed our cheroots and with them Wylder his thoughts and I the landscape and the whistling of the birds for we waxed Turkish and taciturn over our tobacco CHAPTER VII RELATING HOW A LONDON GENTLEMAN APPEARED IN REDMAN S DELL I believe the best rule in telling a story is to follow events chronologically So let me mention that just about the time when Wylder and I were filming the trunks of the old trees with wreaths of lingering perfume Miss Rachel Lake had an unexpected visitor There is near the Hall a very pretty glen called Redman s Dell very steep with a stream running at the bottom of it but so thickly wooded that in summer time you can only now and then catch a glimpse of the water gliding beneath you Deep in this picturesque ravine buried among the thick shadows of tall old trees runs the narrow mill road which lower down debouches on the end of the village street There in the transparent green shadow stand the two mills the old one with A D sixteen seventy nine and the Wylder arms and the eternal resurgam projecting over its door and higher up on a sort of platform the steep bank rising high behind it with its towering old wood overhanging and surrounding upon a site where one of king Arthur s knights of an autumn evening as he rode solitary in quest of adventures might have seen the peeping gray gable of an anchorite s chapel dimly through the gilded stems and heard the drowsy tinkle of his vesper bell stands an old and small two storied brick and timber house and though the sun does not very often glimmer on its windows it yet possesses an air of sad old world comfort a little flower garden lies in front with a paling round it But not every kind of flowers will grow there under the lordly shadow of the elms and chestnuts This sequestered tenement bears the name of Redman s Farm and its occupant was that Miss Lake whom I had met last night at Brandon Hall and whose pleasure it was to live here in independent isolation There she is now busy in her tiny garden with the birds twittering about her and the yellow leaves falling and her thick gauntlets on her slender hands How fresh and pretty she looks in that sad sylvan solitude with the background of the dull crimson brick and the climbing roses Bars of sunshine fall through the branches above across the thick tapestry of blue yellow and crimson that glow so richly upon their deep green ground There is not much to be done just now I fancy in the gardening way but work is found or invented for sometimes the hour is dull and that bright spirited and at heart it may be bitter exile will make out life somehow There is music and drawing There are flowers as we see and two or three correspondents and walks into the village and her dark cousin Dorcas drives down sometimes in the pony carriage and is not always silent and indeed they are a good deal together This young lady s little Eden though overshadowed and encompassed with the solemn sylvan cloister of nature s building and vocal with sounds of innocence the songs of birds and sometimes those of its young mistress was no more proof than the Mesopotamian haunt of our first parents against the intrusion of darker spirits So as she worked she lifted up her eyes and beheld a rather handsome young man standing at the little wicket of her garden with his gloved hand on the latch A man of fashion a town man his dress bespoke him smooth cheeks light brown curling moustache and eyes very peculiar both in shape and colour and something of elegance of finish in his other features and of general grace in the coup d oeil struck one at a glance He was smiling silently and slily on Rachel who with a little cry of surprise said Oh Stanley is it you And before he could answer she had thrown her arms about his neck and kissed him two or three times Laughingly half resisting the young man waited till her enthusiastic salutation was over and with one gloved hand caressingly on her shoulder and with the other smoothing his ruffled moustache he laughed a little more a quiet low laugh He was not addicted to stormy greetings and patted his sister s shoulder gently his arm a little extended like a man who tranquillises a frolicsome pony Yes Radie you see I ve found you out and his eye wandered still smiling oddly over the front of her quaint habitation And how have you been Radie Oh very well No life like a gardener s early hours work air and plenty of quiet And the young lady laughed You are a wonderful lass Radie Thank you dear And what do you call this place The Happy Valley I call it Don t you remember Rasselas No he said looking round him I don t think I was ever there You horrid dunce it s a book but a stupid one so no matter laughed Miss Rachel giving him a little slap on the shoulder with her slender fingers His reading you see lay more in circulating library lore and he was not deep in Johnson as few of us would be I m afraid if it were not for Boswell It s a confounded deal more like the Valley of the Shadow of Death in Pilgrim s Progress you remember that old Tamar used to read to us in the nursery replied Master Stanley who had never enjoyed being quizzed by his sister not being blessed with a remarkably sweet temper If you don t like my scenery come in Stanley and admire my decorations You must tell me all the news and I ll show you my house and amaze you with my housekeeping Dear me how long it is since I ve seen you So she led him in by the arm to her tiny drawing room and he laid his hat and stick and gray paletot on her little marquetrie table and sat down and looked languidly about him with a sly smile like a man amused It is an odd fancy living alone here An odd necessity Stanley Aren t you afraid of being robbed and murdered Radie he said leaning forward to smell at the pretty bouquet in the little glass and turning it listlessly round There are lots of those burglar fellows going about you know Thank you dear for reminding me But somehow I m not the least afraid There hasn t been a robbery in this neighbourhood I believe for eight hundred years The people never think of shutting their doors here in summer time till they are going to bed and then only for form s sake and beside there s nothing to rob and I really don t much mind being murdered He looked round and smiled on as before like a man contemptuously amused but sleepily withal You are very oddly housed Radie I like it she said quietly also with a glance round her homely drawing room What do you call this your boudoir or parlour I call it my drawing room but it s anything you please What very odd people our ancestors were he mused on They lived I suppose out of doors like the cows and only came into their sheds at night when they could not see the absurd ugliness of the places they inhabited I could not stand upright in this room with my hat on Lots of rats I fancy Radie behind that wainscoting What s that horrid work of art against the wall A shell work cabinet dear It is not beautiful I allow If I were strong enough or poor old Tamar I should have put it away and now that you re here Stanley I think I ll make you carry it out to the lobby for me I should not like to touch it dear Radie And pray how do you amuse yourself here How on earth do you get over the day and worse still the evenings Very well well enough I make a very good sort of a nun and a capital housemaid I work in the garden I mend my dresses I drink tea and when I choose to be dissipated I play and sing for old Tamar why did not you ask how she is I do believe Stanley you care for no one but she was going to say yourself she said instead however but perhaps the least in the world for me and that not very wisely she continued a little fiercely for from the moment you saw me you ve done little else than try to disgust me more than I am with my penury and solitude What do you mean You always have a purpose will you ever learn to be frank and straightforward and speak plainly to those whom you ought to trust if not to love What are you driving at Stanley He looked up with a gentle start like one recovering from a reverie and said with his yellow eyes fixed for a moment on his sister before they dropped again to the carpet You re miserably poor Rachel upon my word I believe you haven t clear two hundred a year I ll drink some tea please if you have got any and it isn t too much trouble and it strikes me as very curious you like living in this really very humiliating state I don t intend to go out for a governess if that s what you mean nor is there any privation in living as I do Perhaps you think I ought to go and housekeep for you Why ha ha I really don t know Radie where I shall be I m not of any regiment now Why you have not sold out She flushed and suddenly grew pale for she was afraid something worse might have happened having no great confidence in her brother But she was relieved I have sold my commission She looked straight at him with large eyes and compressed lips and nodded her head two or three times just murmuring Well well well Women never understand these things The army is awfully expensive I mean of course a regiment like ours and the interest of the money is better to me than my pay and see Rachel there s no use in lecturing me so don t let us quarrel We re not very rich you and I and we each know our own affairs you yours and I mine best There was something by no means pleasant in his countenance when his temper was stirred and a little thing sometimes sufficed to do so Rachel treated him with a sort of deference a little contemptuous perhaps such as spoiled children receive from indulgent elders and she looked at him steadily with a faint smile and arched brows for a little while and an undefinable expression of puzzle and curiosity You are a very amusing brother if not a very cheery or a very useful one Stanley She opened the door and called across the little hall into the homely kitchen of the mansion Tamar dear Master Stanley s here and wishes to see you Oh yes poor dear old Tamar ha ha says the gentleman with a gentle little laugh I suppose she s as frightful as ever that worthy woman Certainly she is awfully like a ghost I wonder Radie you re not afraid of her at night in this cheerful habitation I should I know A ghost indeed the ghost of old times an ugly ghost enough for many of us Poor Tamar she was always very kind to you Stanley And just then old Tamar opened the door I must allow there was something very unpleasant about that worthy old woman and not being under any personal obligations to her I confess my acquiescence in the spirit of Captain Lake s remarks She was certainly perfectly neat and clean but white predominated unpleasantly in her costume Her cotton gown had once had a pale pattern over it but wear and washing had destroyed its tints till it was no better than white with a mottling of gray She had a large white kerchief pinned with a grisly precision across her breast and a white linen cap tied under her chin fitting close to her head like a child s nightcap such as they wore in my young days and destitute of border or frilling about the face It was a dress very odd and unpleasant to behold and suggested the idea of an hospital or a madhouse or death in an undefined way She was past sixty with a mournful puckered and puffy face tinted all over with a thin gamboge and burnt sienna glazing and very blue under the eyes which showed a great deal of their watery whites This old woman had in her face and air along with an expression of suspicion and anxiety a certain character of decency and respectability which made her altogether a puzzling and unpleasant apparition Being taciturn and undemonstrative she stood at the door looking with as pleased a countenance as so sad a portrait could wear upon the young gentleman He got up at his leisure and greeted old Tamar with his sleepy amused sort of smile and a few trite words of kindness So Tamar withdrew to prepare tea and he said all at once with a sudden accession of energy and an unpleasant momentary glare in his eyes You know Rachel this sort of thing is all nonsense You cannot go on living like this you must marry you shall marry Mark Wylder is down here and he has got an estate and a house and it is time he should marry you Mark Wylder is here to marry my cousin Dorcas and if he had no such intention and were as free as you are and again to urge his foolish suit upon his knees Stanley I would die rather than accept him It was not always so foolish a suit Radie answered her brother his eyes once more upon the carpet Why should not he do as well as another You liked him well enough once The young lady coloured rather fiercely I am not a girl of seventeen now Stanley and and besides I hate him What d d nonsense I really beg your pardon Radie but it is precious stuff You are quite unreasonable you ve no cause to hate him he dropped you because you dropped him It was only prudent he had not a guinea But now it is different and he must marry you The young lady stared with a haughty amazement upon her brother I ve made up my mind to speak to him and if he won t I promise you he shall leave the country said the young man gently just lifting his yellow eyes for a second with another unpleasant glare I almost think you re mad Stanley and if you do anything so insane sure I am you ll rue it while you live and wherever he is I ll find him out and acquit myself with the scorn I owe him of any share in a plot so unspeakably mean and absurd Brava brava you re a heroine Radie and why the devil he continued in a changed tone do you apply those insolent terms to what I purpose doing I wish I could find words strong enough to express my horror of your plot a plot every way disgusting You plainly know something to Mark Wylder s discredit and you mean Stanley to coerce him by fear into a marriage with your penniless sister who hates him Sir do you pretend to be a gentleman I rather think so he said with a quiet sneer Give up every idea of it this moment Has it not struck you that Mark Wylder may possibly know something of you you would not have published I don t think he does What do you mean On my life Stanley I ll acquaint mister Wylder this evening with what you meditate and the atrocious liberty you presume yes Sir though you are my brother the atrocious liberty you dare to take with my name unless you promise upon your honour now and here to dismiss for ever the odious and utterly resultless scheme Captain Lake looked very angry after his fashion but said nothing He could not at any time have very well defined his feelings toward his sister but mingling in them certainly was a vein of unacknowledged dread and shall I say respect He knew she was resolute fierce of will and prompt in action and not to be bullied There s more in this Stanley than you care to tell me You have not troubled yourself a great deal about me you know and I m no worse off now than any time for the last three years You ve not come down here on my account that is altogether and be your plans what they may you sha n t mix my name in them What you please wise or foolish you ll do in what concerns yourself you always have without consulting me but I tell you again Stanley unless you promise upon your honour to forbear all mention of my name I will write this evening to Lady Chelford apprising her of your plans and of my own disgust and indignation and requesting her son s interference Do you promise There s no such haste Radie I only mentioned it If you don t like it of course it can lead to nothing and there s no use in my speaking to Wylder and so there s an end of it There may be some use a purpose in which neither my feelings nor interests have any part I venture to say Stanley your plans are all for yourself You want to extort some advantage from Wylder and you think in his present situation about to marry Dorcas you can use me for the purpose Thank Heaven Sir you committed for once the rare indiscretion of telling the truth and unless you make me the promise I require I will take before evening such measures as will completely exculpate me Once again do you promise Yes Radie ha ha of course I promise Upon your honour Upon my honour there I believe you gentlemen dragoons observe that oath I hope so If you choose to break it you may give me some trouble but you sha n t compromise me And now Stanley one word more I fancy mister Wylder is a resolute man none of the Wylders wanted courage Captain Lake was by this time smiling his sly sleepy smile upon his French boots If you have formed any plan which depends upon frightening him it is a desperate one All I can tell you Stanley is this that if I were a man and an attempt made to extort from me any sort of concession by terror I would shoot the miscreant who made it through the head like a highwayman What the devil are you talking about said he About your danger she answered For once in your life listen to reason Mark Wylder is as prompt as you and has ten times your nerve and sense you are more likely to have committed yourself than he Take care he may retaliate your threat by a counter move more dreadful I know nothing of your doings Stanley Heaven forbid but be warned or you ll rue it Why Radie you know nothing of the world Do you suppose I m quite demented Ask a gentleman for his estate or watch because I know something to his disadvantage Why ha ha dear Radie every man who has ever been on terms of intimacy with another must know things to his disadvantage but no one thinks of telling them The world would not tolerate it It would prejudice the betrayer at least as much as the betrayed I don t affect to be angry or talk romance and heroics because you fancy such stuff but I assure you when will that old woman give me a cup of tea I assure you Radie there s nothing in it Rachel made no reply but she looked steadfastly and uneasily upon the enigmatical face and downcast eyes of the young man Well I hope so she said at last with a sigh and a slight sense of relief CHAPTER VIII IN WHICH CAPTAIN LAKE TAKES HIS HAT AND STICK So the young people sitting in the little drawing room of Redman s farm pursued their dialogue Rachel Lake had spoken last and it was the captain s turn to speak next Do you remember Miss Beauchamp Radie he asked rather suddenly after a very long pause Miss Beauchamp Oh to be sure you mean little Caroline yes she must be quite grown up by this time five years she promised to be pretty What of her Rachel very flushed and agitated still was now trying to speak as usual She is good looking a little coarse some people think resumed the young man but handsome black eyes black hair rather on a large scale but certainly handsome A style I admire rather though it is not very refined nor at all classic But I like her and I wish you d advise me He was talking after his wont to the carpet Oh she exclaimed with a gentle sort of derision You mean he said looking up for a moment with a sudden stare she has got money Of course she has I could not afford to admire her if she had not but I see you are not just now in a mood to trouble yourself about my nonsense we can talk about it to morrow and tell me now how do you get on with the Brandon people Rachel was curious and would if she could have recalled that sarcastic oh which had postponed the story but she was also a little angry and with anger there was pride which would not stoop to ask for the revelation which he chose to defer so she said Dorcas and I are very good friends but I don t know very well what to make of her Only I don t think she s quite so dull and apathetic as I at first supposed but still I m puzzled She is either absolutely uninteresting or very interesting indeed and I can t say which Does she like you he asked I really don t know She tolerates me like everything else and I don t flatter her and we see a good deal of one another upon those terms and I have no complaint to make of her She has some aversions but no quarrels and has a sort of laziness mental bodily and moral that is sublime but provoking and sometimes I admire her and sometimes I despise her and I do not yet know which feeling is the juster Surely she is woman enough to be fussed a little about her marriage Oh dear no she takes the whole affair with a queenlike and supernatural indifference She is either a fool or a very great philosopher and there is something grand in the serene obscurity that envelopes her and Rachel laughed a very little I must I suppose pay my respects but to morrow will be time enough What pretty little tea cups Radie quite charming old cock china isn t it These were Aunt Jemima s I think Yes they used to stand on the little marble table between the windows Old Tamar had glided in while they here talking and placed the little tea equipage on the table unnoticed and the captain was sipping his cup of tea and inspecting the pattern while his sister amused him This place I suppose is confoundedly slow is not it Do they entertain the neighbours ever at Brandon Sometimes when old Lady Chelford and her son are staying there But the neighbours can t entertain them I fancy or you What a dreary thing a dinner party made up of such people must be like Aesop s Fables where the cows and sheep converse And sometimes a wolf or a fox she said Well Radie I know you mean me but as you wish it I ll carry my fangs elsewhere and what has become of Will Wylder Oh he s in the Church Quite right the only thing he was fit for and Captain Lake laughed like a man who enjoys a joke slily And where is poor Billy quartered Not quite half a mile away he has got the vicarage of Naunton Friars Oh then Will is not quite such a fool as we took him for It is worth just Lone hundred eighty a year but he s very far from a fool Yes of course he knows Greek poets and Latin fathers and all the rest of it I don t mean he ever was plucked I dare say he s the kind of fellow you d like very well Radie And his sly eyes had a twinkle in them which seemed to say Perhaps I ve divined your secret And so I do and I like his wife too very much His wife So William has married on Lone hundred eighty a year and the captain laughed quietly but very pleasantly again On a very little more at all events and I think they are about the happiest and I m sure they are the best people in this part of the world Well Radie I ll see you to morrow again You preserve your good looks wonderfully I wonder you haven t become an old woman here And he kissed her and went his way with a slight wave of his hand and his odd smile as he closed the little garden gate after him He turned to his left walking down towards the town and the innocent green trees hid him quickly and the gush and tinkle of the clear brook rose faint and pleasantly through the leaves from the depths of the glen and refreshed her ear after his unpleasant talk She was flushed and felt oddly a little stunned and strange although she had talked lightly and easily enough I forgot to ask him where he is staying the Brandon Arms I suppose I don t at all like his coming down here after Mark Wylder what can he mean He certainly never would have taken the trouble for me What can he want of Mark Wylder I think he knew old mister Beauchamp He may be a trustee but that s not likely Mark Wylder was not the person for any such office I hope Stanley does not intend trying to extract money from him anything rather than that degradation than that villainy Stanley was always impracticable perverse deceitful and so foolish with all his cunning and suspicion so very foolish Poor Stanley He s so unscrupulous I don t know what to think He said he could force Mark Wylder to leave the country It must be some bad secret If he tries and fails I suppose he will be ruined I don t know what to think I never was so uneasy He will blast himself and disgrace all connected with him and it is quite useless speaking to him Perhaps if Rachel Lake had been in Belgravia leading a town life the matter would have taken no such dark colouring and portentous proportions But living in a small old house in a dark glen with no companion and little to occupy her it was different She looked down the silent way he had so lately taken and repeated rather bitterly My only brother my only brother my only brother That young lady was not quite a pauper though she may have thought so Comparatively indeed she was but not I venture to think absolutely She had just that symmetrical three hundred pounds a year which the famous Dean of saint Patrick s tells us he so often wished that he had clear She had had some money in the Funds besides still more insignificant but this her Brother Stanley had borrowed and begged piecemeal and the Consols were no more But though something of a nun in her way of life there was no germ of the old maid in her and money was not often in her thoughts It was not a bad dot and her Brother Stanley had about twice as much and therefore was much better off than many a younger son of a duke But these young people after the manner of men were spited with fortune and indeed they had some cause Old General Lake had once had more than ten thousand pounds a year and lived until the crash came in the style of a vicious old prince It was a great break up and a worse fall for Rachel than for her brother when the plate coaches pictures and all the valuable effects of old Tiberius went to the hammer and he himself vanished from his clubs and other haunts and lived only a thin intermittent rumour surmised to be in gaol or in Guernsey and quite forgotten soon and a little later actually dead and buried CHAPTER IX I SEE THE RING OF THE PERSIAN MAGICIAN That s a devilish fine girl said Mark Wylder He was sitting at this moment on the billiard table with his coat off and his cue in his hand and had lighted a cigar He and I had just had a game and were tired of it Who I asked He was looking on me from the corners of his eyes and smiling in a sly rakish way that no man likes in another Radie Lake she s a splendid girl by Jove Don t you think so and she liked me once devilish well I can tell you She was thin then but she has plumped out a bit and improved every way Whatever else he was Mark was certainly no beauty a little short he was and rather square one shoulder a thought higher than the other and a slight energetic hitch in it when he walked His features in profile had something of a Grecian character but his face was too broad very brown rather a bloodless brown and he had a pair of great dense vulgar black whiskers He was very vain of his teeth his only really good point for his eyes were a small cunning gray pair and this perhaps was the reason why he had contracted his habit of laughing and grinning a good deal more than the fun of the dialogue always warranted This sea monster smoked here as unceremoniously as he would have done in Rees s Divan and I only wonder he did not call for brandy and water He had either grown coarser a great deal or I more decent during our separation He talked of his fiancee as he might of an opera girl almost and was now discussing Miss Lake in the same style Yes she is she s very well but hang it Wylder you re a married man now and must give up talking that way People won t like it you know they ll take it to mean more than it does and you oughtn t Let us have another game By and by what do you think of Larkin asked Wylder with a sly glance from the corners of his eyes I think he prays rather more than is good for his clients mind I spell it with an a not with an e but hang it for an attorney you know and such a sharp chap it does seem to me rather a a joke eh He bears a good character among the townspeople doesn t he And I don t see that it can do him any harm remembering that he has a soul to be saved Or the other thing eh laughed Wylder But I think he comes it a little too strong two sermons last Sunday and a prayer meeting at nine o clock Well it won t do him any harm I repeated Harm O let Jos Larkin alone for that It gets him all the religious business of the county and there are nice pickings among the charities and endowments and purchases of building sites and trust deeds I dare say it brings him in two or three hundred a year eh And Wylder laughed again It has broken up his hard proud heart he says but it left him a devilish hard head I told him and I think it sharpens his wits I rather think you ll find him a useful man and to be so in his line of business he must have his wits about him I can tell you He amused me devilishly said Wylder with a sort of exhortation he treated me to he s a delightfully impudent chap and gave me to understand I was a limb of the Devil and he a saint I told him I was better than he in my humble opinion and so I am by chalks I know very well I m a miserable sinner but there s mercy above and I don t hide my faults I don t set up for a light or a saint I m just what the Prayer book says neither more nor less a miserable sinner There s only one good thing I can safely say for myself I am no Pharisee that s all I air no religious prig puffing myself and trusting to forms making long prayers in the market place Mark s quotations were paraphrastic and thinking of nothing but the uppermost seats in the synagogue and broad borders and the praise of men hang them I hate those fellows So Mark like other men we meet with was proud of being a Publican and his prayer was I thank Thee that I am not as other men are spiritually proud formalists hypocrites or even as this Pharisee Do you wish another game I asked Just now said Wylder emitting first a thin stream of smoke and watching its ascent Dorcas is the belle of the county and she likes me though she s odd and don t show it the way other girls would But a fellow knows pretty well when a girl likes him and you know the marriage is a sensible sort of thing and I m determined of course to carry it through but hang it a fellow can t help thinking sometimes there are other things besides money and Dorcas is not my style Rachel s more that way she s a tremendious fine girl by Jove and a spirited minx too and I think he added with an oath having first taken two puffs at his cigar if I had seen her first I d have thought twice before I d have got myself into this business I only smiled and shook my head I did not believe a word of it Yet perhaps I was wrong He knew very well how to take care of his money in fact compared with other young fellows he was a bit of a screw But he could do a handsome and generous thing for himself His selfishness would expand nobly and rise above his prudential considerations and drown them sometimes and he was the sort of person who if the fancy were strong enough might marry in haste and repent and make his wife too repent at leisure What do you laugh at Charlie said Wylder grinning himself At your confounded grumbling Mark The luckiest dog in England Will nothing content you Why I grumble very little I think considering how well off I am rejoined he with a laugh Grumble If you had a particle of gratitude you d build a temple to Fortune you re pagan enough for it Mark Fortune has nothing to do with it says Mark laughing again Well certainly neither had you It was all the Devil I m not joking Charlie upon my word though I m laughing Mark swore now and then but I take leave to soften his oaths It was the Persian Magician Come Mark say what you mean I mean what I say When we were in the Persian Gulf near six years ago I was in command of the ship The captain you see was below with a hurt in his leg We had very rough weather a gale for two days and a night almost and a heavy swell after In the night time we picked up three poor devils in an open boat One was a Persian merchant with a grand beard We called him the magician he was so like the pictures of Aladdin s uncle Why he was an African I interposed my sense of accuracy offended I don t care a curse what he was rejoined Mark he was exactly like the picture in the story books And as we were lying off I forget the cursed name of it he begged me to put him ashore He could not speak a word of English but one of the fellows with him interpreted and they were all anxious to get ashore Poor devils they had a notion I believe we were going to sell them for slaves and he made me a present of a ring and told me a long yarn about it It was a talisman it seems and no one who wore it could ever be lost So I took it for a keepsake here it is and he extended his stumpy brown little finger and showed a thick coarsely made ring of gold with an uncut red stone of the size of a large cherry stone set in it The stone is a humbug said Wylder It s not real I showed it to Platten and Foyle It s some sort of glass But I would not part with it I got a fancy into my head that luck would come with it and maybe that glass stuff was the thing that had the virtue in it Now look at these Persian letters on the inside for that s the oddest thing about it Hang it I can t pull it off I m growing as fat as a pig but they are like a queer little string of flowers and I showed it to a clever fellow at Malta a missionary chap and he read it off slick and what do you think it means I will come up again and he swore a great oath It s as true as you stand there our motto Is not it odd So I got the resurgam you see there engraved round it and by Jove it did bring me up I was near lost and did rise again Eh Well it certainly was a curious accident Mark had plenty of odd and not unamusing lore Men who beat about the world in ships usually have and these yarns furnished after the pattern of Othello s tales of Anthropophagites and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders one of the many varieties of fascination which he practised on the fair sex Only in justice to Mark I must say that he was by no means so shameless a drawer of the long bow as the Venetian gentleman and officer When I got this ring Charlie three hundred a year and a London life would have been Peru and Paradise to poor Pill Garlick and see what it has done for me Aye and better than Aladdin s for you need not rub it and bring up that confounded ugly genii the slave of your ring works unseen So he does laughed Wylder in a state of elation and he s not done working yet I can tell you When the estates are joined in one they ll be good eleven thousand a year and Larkin says with smart management I shall have a rental of thirteen thousand before three years And that s only the beginning by George Sir Henry Twisden can t hold his seat he s all but broke as poor as Job and the gentry hate him and he lives abroad He has had a hint or two already and he ll never fight the next election D ye see hey And Wylder winked and grinned with a wag of his head M P eh You did not see that before I look a head a bit eh and can take my turn at the wheel eh And he laughed with cunning exultation Miss Rachel will find I m not quite such a lubber as she fancies But even then it is only begun Come Charlie you used to like a bet What do you say I ll buy you that twenty five guinea book of pictures what s its name if you give me three hundred guineas one month after I m a peer of Parliament Hey There s a sporting offer for you Well what do you say eh You mean to come out as an orator then Orator be diddled Do you take me for a fool No Charlie but I ll come out strong as a voter that s the stuff they like at the right side of course and that is the way to manage it Thirteen thousand a year the oldest family in the county and a steady thick and thin supporter of the minister Strong points eh Charlie Well do you take my offer I laughed and declined to his great elation and just then the gong sounded and we were away to our toilets While making my toilet for dinner I amused myself by conjecturing whether there could be any foundation in fact for Mark s boast that Miss Brandon liked him Women are so enigmatical some in everything all in matters of the heart Don t they sometimes actually admire what is repulsive Does not brutality in our sex and even rascality interest them sometimes Don t they often affect indifference and occasionally even aversion where there is a different sort of feeling As I went down I heard Miss Lake chatting with her queen like cousin near an open door on the lobby Rachel Lake was indeed a very constant guest at the Hall and the servants paid her much respect which I look upon as a sign that the young heiress liked her and treated her with consideration and indeed there was an insubordinate and fiery spirit in that young lady which would have brooked nothing less and dreamed of nothing but equality CHAPTER X THE ACE OF HEARTS Who should I find in the drawing room talking fluently and smiling after his wont to old Lady Chelford who seemed to receive him very graciously for her at least but Captain Stanley Lake I can t quite describe to you the odd and unpleasant sort of surprise which that very gentlemanlike figure standing among the Brandon household gods at this moment communicated to me I thought of the few odd words and looks that had dropped from Wylder about him with an ominous pang as I looked and I felt somehow as if there were some occult relation between that confused prelude of Wylder s and the Mephistophelean image that had risen up almost upon the spot where it was spoken I glanced round for Wylder but he was not there You know Captain Lake said Lord Chelford addressing me And Lake turned round upon me a little abruptly his odd yellowish eyes a little like those of the sea eagle and the ghost of his smile that flickered on his singularly pale face with a stern and insidious look confronted me There was something evil and shrinking in his aspect which I felt with a sort of chill like the commencing fascination of a serpent I often thought since that he had expected to see Wylder before him The church yard meteor expired there was nothing in a moment but his ordinary smile of recognition You re surprised to see me here he said in his very pleasing low tones I lighted on him in the village and I knew Miss Brandon would not forgive me if I allowed him to go away without coming here He had his hand upon Lake s shoulder They are cousins you know we are all cousins I m bad at genealogies My mother could tell us all about it we Brandons Lakes Wylders and Chelfords At this moment Miss Brandon entered with her brilliant Cousin Rachel The blonde and the dark it was a dazzling contrast So Chelford led Stanley Lake before the lady of the castle I thought of the Fair Brunnisende with the captive knight in the hands of her seneschal before her and I fancied he said something of having found him trespassing in her town and brought him up for judgment Whatever Lord Chelford said Miss Brandon received it very graciously and even with a momentary smile I wonder she did not smile oftener it became her so But her greeting to Captain Lake was more than usually haughty and frozen and her features I fancied particularly proud and pale It seemed to me to indicate a great deal more than mere indifference something of aversion and nearer to a positive emotion than anything I had yet seen in that exquisitely apathetic face How was it that this man with the yellow eyes seemed to gleam from them an influence of pain or disturbance wherever almost he looked Shake hands with your cousin my dear said old Lady Chelford peremptorily The little scene took place close to her chair and upon this stage direction the little piece of by play took place and the young lady coldly touched the captain s hand and passed on Young as he was Stanley Lake was an old man of the world not to be disconcerted and never saw more than exactly suited him Waiting in the drawing room I had some entertaining talk with Miss Lake Her conversation was lively and rather bold not at all in the coarse sense but she struck me as having formed a system of ethics and views of life both good humoured and sarcastic and had carried into her rustic sequestration the melancholy and precocious lore of her early London experience When Lord Chelford joined us I perceived that Wylder was in the room and saw a very cordial greeting between him and Lake The captain appeared quite easy and cheerful but Mark I thought notwithstanding his laughter and general jollity was uncomfortable and I saw him once or twice when Stanley s eye was not upon him glance sharply on the young man with an uneasy and not very friendly curiosity At dinner Lake was easy and amusing That meal passed off rather pleasantly and when we joined the ladies in the drawing room the good vicar s enthusiastic little wife came to meet us in one of her honest little raptures Now here s a thing worth your looking at Did you ever see anything so bee utiful in your life It is such a darling little thing and look now is not it magnificent She arrested the file of gentlemen just by a large lamp before whose effulgence she presented the subject of her eulogy one of those costly trifles which announce the approach of Hymen as flowers spring up before the rosy steps of May Well it was pretty French I dare say a little set of tablets a toy the cover of enamel studded in small jewels with a slender border of symbolic flowers and with a heart in the centre a mosaic of little carbuncles rubies and other red and crimson stones placed with a view to light and shade Exquisite indeed said Lord Chelford Is this yours missus Wylder Mine indeed laughed poor little missus Dorothy Well dear me no indeed and in an earnest whisper close in his ear a present to Miss Brandon and the donor is not a hundred miles away from your elbow my lord and she winked slyly and laughed with a little nod at Wylder Oh I see to be sure really Wylder it does your taste infinite credit I m glad you like it says Wylder chuckling benignantly on it over his shoulder I believe I have a little taste that way those are all real you know those jewels Oh yes of course Have you seen it Captain Lake And he placed it in that gentleman s fingers who now took his turn at the lamp and contemplated the little parallelogram with a gleam of sly amusement What are you laughing at asked Wylder a little snappishly I was thinking it s very like the ace of hearts answered the captain softly smiling on Fie Lake there s no poetry in you said Lord Chelford laughing Well now though really it is funny it did not strike me before but do you know now it is laughs out jolly missus Dolly isn t it Look at it do mister Wylder isn t it like the ace of hearts Wylder was laughing rather redly with the upper part of his face very surly I thought Never mind Wylder it s the winning card said Lord Chelford laying his hand on his shoulder Whereupon Lake laughed quietly still looking on the ace of hearts with his sly eyes And Wylder laughed too more suddenly and noisily than the humour of the joke seemed quite to call for and glanced a grim look from the corners of his eyes on Lake but the gallant captain did not seem to perceive it and after a few seconds more he handed it very innocently back to missus Dorothy only remarking Seriously it is very pretty and appropriate And Wylder making no remark helped himself to a cup of coffee and then to a glass of Curacoa and then looked industriously at a Spanish quarto of Don Quixote and lastly walked over to me on the hearthrug What the d has he come down here for It can t be for money or balls or play and he has no honest business anywhere Do you know Lake Oh I really can t tell but he ll soon tire of country life I don t think he s much of a sportsman Ha isn t he I don t know anything about him almost but I hate him Why should you though He s a very gentlemanlike fellow and your cousin My cousin the Devil s cousin everyone s cousin I don t know who s my cousin or who isn t nor you don t who ve been for ten years over those d d papers but I think he s the nastiest dog I ever met I took a dislike to him at first sight long ago and that never happened me but I was right Wylder looked confoundedly angry and flustered standing with his heels on the edge of the rug his hands in his pockets jingling some silver there and glancing from under his red forehead sternly and unsteadily across the room He s not a man for country quarters he ll soon be back in town or to Brighton I said If he doesn t I will That s all Just to get him off this unpleasant groove with a little jolt I said By the bye Wylder you know the pictures here who is the tall man with the long pale face and wild phosphoric eyes I was always afraid of him in a long peruke and dark red velvet coat facing the hall door I had a horrid dream about him last night That Oh I know that s Lorne Brandon He was one of our family devils he was A devil in a family now and then is not such a bad thing when there s work for him All the time he was talking to me his angry little eyes were following Lake They say he killed his son a blackguard who was found shot with his face in the tarn in the park He was going to marry the gamekeeper s daughter it was thought and he and the old boy who was for high blood and all that were at loggerheads about it It was not proved only thought likely which showed what a nice character he was but he might have done worse I suppose Miss Partridge would have had a precious lot of babbies and who knows where the estate would have been by this time I believe Charlie he recommenced suddenly there is not such an unnatural family on record as ours is there Ha ha ha It s well to be distinguished in any line I forget all the other good things he did but he ended by shooting himself through the head in his bed room and that was not the worst thing ever he did And Wylder laughed again and began to whistle very low not I fancy for want of thought but as a sort of accompaniment thereto for he suddenly said And where is he staying Who Lake Yes I don t know but I think he mentioned Larkins s house didn t he I m not quite sure I suppose he this I m made of money By Jove if he wants to borrow any I ll surprise him the cur I ll talk to him ha ha ha And Wylder chuckled angrily and the small change in his pocket tinkled fiercely as his eye glanced on the graceful captain who was entertaining the ladies no doubt very agreeably in the distance CHAPTER XI IN WHICH LAKE UNDER THE TREES OF BRANDON AND I IN MY CHAMBER SMOKE OUR NOCTURNAL CIGARS Miss Lake declined the carriage to night Her brother was to see her home and there was a leave taking and the young ladies whispered a word or two and kissed after the manner of their kind To Captain Lake Miss Brandon s adieux were as cold and haughty as her greeting Did you see that said Wylder in my ear with a chuckle and wagging his head he added rather loftily for him Miss Brandon I reckon has taken your measure Master Stanley as well as I I wonder what the deuce the old dowager sees in him Old women always like rascals And he added something still less complimentary I suppose the balance of attraction and repulsion was overcome by Miss Lake much as he disliked Stanley for Wylder followed them out with Lord Chelford to help the young lady into her cloak and goloshes and I found myself near Miss Brandon for the first time that evening and much to my surprise she was first to speak and that rather strangely You seem to be very sensible mister De Cresseron pray tell me frankly what do you think of all this I am not quite sure Miss Brandon that I understand your question I replied enquiringly I mean of the the family arrangements in which as mister Wylder s friend you seem to take an interest she said There can hardly be a second opinion Miss Brandon I think it a very wise measure I replied much surprised Very wise exactly But don t these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly Do you really think your friend mister Wylder cares about me I take that for granted in the nature of things it can hardly be otherwise I replied a good deal startled and perplexed by the curious audacity of her interrogatory It was very foolish of me to expect from mister Wylder s friend any other answer you are very loyal mister De Cresseron And without awaiting my reply she made some remark which I forget to Lady Chelford who sat at a little distance and appearing quite absorbed in her new subject she placed herself close beside the dowager and continued to chat in a low tone I was vexed with myself for having managed with so little skill a conversation which opened so oddly and frankly might have placed me on relations so nearly confidential with that singular and beautiful girl I ought to have rejoiced but we don t always see what most concerns our peace In the meantime I had formed a new idea of her She was so unreserved it seemed and yet in this directness there was something almost contemptuous By this time Lord Chelford and Wylder returned and disgusted rather with myself I ruminated on my want of general ship In the meantime Miss Lake with her hand on her brother s arm was walking swiftly under the trees of the back avenue towards that footpath which through wild copse and broken clumps near the park emerges upon the still darker road which passes along the wooded glen by the mills and skirts the little paling of the recluse lady s garden They had not walked far when Lake suddenly said What do you think of all this Radie this particular version I mean of marriage a la mode they are preparing up there and he made a little dip of his cane towards Brandon Hall over his shoulder I really don t think Wylder cares twopence about her or she about him and Stanley Lake laughed gently and sleepily I don t think they pretend to like one another It is quite understood It was all you know old Lady Chelford s arrangement and Dorcas is so supine I believe she would allow herself to be given away by anyone and to anyone rather than be at the least trouble She provokes me But I thought she liked Sir Harry Bracton he s a good looking fellow and Queen s Bracton is a very nice thing you know Yes so they said but that would I think have been worse Something may be made of Mark Wylder He has some sense and caution has not he but Sir Harry is wickedness itself Why what has Sir Harry done That is the way you women run away with things If a fellow s been a little bit wild he s Beelzebub at once Bracton s a very good fellow I can assure you The fact is Captain Lake an accomplished player made a pretty little revenue of Sir Harry s billiards which were wild and noisy and liking his money thought he liked himself a confusion not uncommon I don t know and can t say how you fine gentlemen define wickedness only as an obscure female I speak according to my lights and he is generally thought the wickedest man in this county Well you know Radie women like wicked fellows it is contrast I suppose but they do and I m sure from what Bracton has said to me I know him intimately that Dorcas likes him and I can t conceive why they are not married It is very happy for her at least they are not said Rachel and a long silence ensued Their walk continued silent for the greater part neither was quite satisfied with the other But Rachel at last said Stanley you meditate some injury to Mark Wylder I Radie he answered quietly why on earth should you think so I saw you twice watch him when you thought no one observed you and I know your face too well Stanley to mistake Now that s impossible Radie for I really don t think I once thought of him all this evening except just while we were talking You keep your secret as usual Stanley said the young lady Really Radie you re quite mistaken I assure you upon my honour I ve no secret You re a very odd girl why won t you believe me Miss Rachel only glanced across her mufflers on his face There was a bright moonlight broken by the shadows of overhanging boughs and withered leaves and the mottled lights and shadows glided oddly across his pale features But she saw that he was smiling his sly sleepy smile and she said quietly Well Stanley I ask no more but you don t deceive me I don t try to If your feelings indeed had been different and that you had not made such a point you know Don t insult me Stanley by talking again as you did this morning What I say is altogether on your own account Mark my words you ll find him too strong for you aye and too deep I see very plainly that he suspects you as I do You saw it too for nothing of that kind escapes you Whatever you meditate he probably anticipates it you know best and you will find him prepared You have given him time enough You were always the same close dark and crooked and wise in your own conceit I am very uneasy about it whatever it is I can t help it It will happen and most ominously I feel that you are courting a dreadful retaliation and that you will bring on yourself a great misfortune but it is quite vain I know speaking to you Really Radie you re enough to frighten a poor fellow you won t mind a word I say and go on predicting all manner of mischief between me and Wylder the very nature of which I can t surmise Would you dislike my smoking a cigar Radie Oh no answered the young lady with a little laugh and a heavy sigh for she knew it meant silence and her dark auguries grew darker To my mind there has always been something inexpressibly awful in family feuds Mortal hatred seems to deepen and dilate into something diabolical in these perverted animosities The mystery of their origin their capacity for evolving latent faculties of crime and the steady vitality with which they survive the hearse and speak their deep mouthed malignities in every new born generation have associated them somehow in my mind with a spell of life exceeding and distinct from human and a special Satanic action My chamber as I have mentioned was upon the third storey It was one of many opening upon the long gallery which had been the scene four generations back of that unnatural and bloody midnight duel which had laid one scion of this ancient house in his shroud and driven another a fugitive to the moral solitudes of a continental banishment Much of the day as I told you had been passed among the grisly records of these old family crimes and hatreds They had been an ill conditioned and not a happy race When I heard the servant s step traversing that long gallery as it seemed to the in haste to be gone and when all grew quite silent I began to feel a dismal sort of sensation and lighted the pair of wax candles which I found upon the small writing table How wonderful and mysterious is the influence of light What sort of beings must those be who hate it The floor more than anything else showed the great age of the room It was warped and arched all along by the wall between the door and the window The portion of it which the carpet did not cover showed it to be oak dark and rugged My bed was unexceptionably comfortable but in my then mood I could have wished it a great deal more modern Its four posts were like the rest of it oak well nigh black fantastically turned and carved with a great urn like capital and base and shaped midway like a gigantic lance handle Its curtains were of thick and faded tapestry I was always a lover of such antiquities but I confess at that moment I would have vastly preferred a sprightly modern chintz and a trumpery little French bed in a corner of the Brandon Arms There was a great lowering press of oak and some shelves with withered green and gold leather borders All the furniture belonged to other times I would have been glad to hear a step stirring or a cough even or the gabble of servants at a distance But there was a silence and desertion in this part of the mansion which somehow made me feel that I was myself a solitary intruder on this level of the vast old house I shan t trouble you about my train of thoughts or fancies but I began to feel very like a gentleman in a ghost story watching experimentally in a haunted chamber My cigar case was a resource I was not a bit afraid of being found out I did not even take the precaution of smoking up the chimney I boldly lighted my cheroot I peeped through the dense window curtain there were no shutters A cold bright moon was shining with clear sharp lights and shadows Everything looked strangely cold and motionless outside The sombre old trees like gigantic hearse plumes black and awful The chapel lay full in view where so many of the strange and equivocal race under whose ancient roof tree I then stood were lying under their tombstones Somehow I had grown nervous A little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney and startled me confoundedly Then some time after I fancied I heard a creaking step on the lobby outside and candle in hand opened the door and looked out with an odd sort of expectation and a rather agreeable disappointment upon vacancy CHAPTER XII IN WHICH UNCLE LORNE TROUBLES ME I was growing most uncomfortably like one of missus Anne Radcliffe s heroes a nervous race of demigods I walked like a sentinel up and down my chamber puffing leisurely the solemn incense and trying to think of the Opera and my essay on Paradise Lost and other pleasant subjects But it would not do Every now and then as I turned towards the door I fancied I saw it softly close I can t the least say whether it was altogether fancy It was with the corner or as the Italians have it the tail of my eye that I saw or imagined that I saw this trifling but unpleasant movement I called out once or twice sharply Come in Who s there Who s that and so forth without any sort of effect except that unpleasant reaction upon the nerves which follows the sound of one s own voice in a solitude of this kind The fact is I did not myself believe in that stealthy motion of my door and set it down to one of those illusions which I have sometimes succeeded in analysing a half seen combination of objects which rightly placed in the due relations of perspective have no mutual connection whatever So I ceased to challenge the unearthly inquisitor and allowed him after a while serenely enough to peep as I turned my back or to withdraw again as I made my regular right about face I had now got half way in my second cheroot and the clock clanged one It was a very still night and the prolonged boom vibrated strangely in my excited ears and brain I had never been quite such an ass before but I do assure you I was now in an extremely unpleasant state One o clock was better however than twelve Although by Jove the bell was beating one as I remember precisely as that king of ghosts old Hamlet revisited the glimpses of the moon upon the famous platform of Elsinore I had pondered too long over the lore of this Satanic family and drunk very strong tea I suppose I could not get my nerves into a comfortable state and cheerful thoughts refused to inhabit the darkened chamber of my brain As I stood in a sort of reverie looking straight upon the door I saw and this time there could be no mistake whatsoever the handle the only modern thing about it slowly turned and the door itself as slowly pushed about a quarter open I do not know what exclamation I made The door was shut instantly and I found myself standing at it and looking out upon the lobby with a candle in my hand and actually freezing with foolish horror I was looking towards the stair head The passage was empty and ended in utter darkness I glanced the other way and thought I saw though not distinctly in the distance a white figure not gliding in the conventional way but limping off with a sort of jerky motion and in a second or two quite lost in darkness I got into my room again and shut the door with a clap that sounded loudly and unnaturally through the dismal quiet that surrounded me and stood with my hand on the handle with the instinct of resistance I felt uncomfortable and I would have secured the door but there was no sort of fastening within So I paused I did not mind looking out again To tell you the plain truth I was just a little bit afraid Then I grew angry at having been put into such remote and possibly suspected quarters and then my comfortable scepticism supervened I was yet to learn a great deal about this visitation So in due course having smoked my cheroot I jerked the stump into the fire Of course I could not think of depriving myself of candle light and being already of a thoughtful old bachelor temperament and averse from burning houses I placed one of my tall wax lights in a basin on the table by my bed in which I soon effected a lodgment and lay with a comparative sense of security Then I heard two o clock strike but shortly after as I suppose sleep overtook me and I have no distinct idea for how long my slumber lasted The fire was very low when I awoke and saw a figure and a very odd one seated by the embers and stooping over the grate with a pair of long hands expanded as it seemed to catch the warmth of the sinking fire It was that of a very tall old man entirely dressed in white flannel a very long spencer and some sort of white swathing about his head His back was toward me and he stooped without the slightest motion over the fire place in the attitude I have described As I looked he suddenly turned toward me and fixed upon me a cold and as it seemed a wrathful gaze over his shoulder It was a bleached and a long chinned face the countenance of Lorne s portrait only more faded sinister and apathetic And having as it were secured its awful command over me by a protracted gaze he rose supernaturally lean and tall and drew near the side of my bed I continued to stare upon this apparition with the most dreadful fascination I ever experienced in my life For two or three seconds I literally could not move When I did I am not ashamed to confess it was to plunge my head under the bed clothes with the childish instinct of terror and there I lay breathless for what seemed to me not far from ten minutes during which there was no sound nor other symptom of its presence On a sudden the bed clothes were gently lifted at my feet and I sprang backwards sitting upright against the back of the bed and once more under the gaze of that long chinned old man A voice as peculiar as the appearance of the figure said You are in my bed I died in it a great many years ago I am Uncle Lorne and when I am not here a devil goes up and down in the room See he had his face to your ear when I came in I came from Dorcas Brandon s bed chamber door where her evil angel told me a thing and Mark Wylder must not seek to marry her for he will be buried alive if he does and he will maybe never get up again Say your prayers when I go out and come here no more He paused as if these 
6014_32904_000036_000002	train-clean-360	incredible 
none	none	words were to sink into my memory and then in the same tone and with the same countenance he asked Is the blood on my forehead I don t know whether I answered So soon as a calamity is within twelve hours the blood comes upon my forehead as they found me in the morning it is a sign The old man then drew back slowly and disappeared behind the curtains at the foot of the bed and I saw no more of him during the rest of that odious night So long as this apparition remained before me I never doubted its being supernatural I don t think mortal ever suffered horror more intense My very hair was dripping with a cold moisture For some seconds I hardly knew where I was But soon a reaction came and I felt convinced that the apparition was a living man It was no process of reason or philosophy but simply I became persuaded of it and something like rage overcame my terrors CHAPTER XIII THE PONY CARRIAGE So soon as daylight came I made a swift cold water toilet and got out into the open air with a solemn resolution to see the hated interior of that bed room no more When I met Lord Chelford in his early walk that morning I m sure I looked myself like a ghost at all events very wild and seedy for he asked me more seriously than usual how I was and I think I would have told him the story of my adventure despite the secret ridicule with which I fancied he would receive it had it not been for a certain insurmountable disgust and horror which held me tongue tied upon the affair I told him however that I had dreamed dreams and was restless and uncomfortable in my present berth and begged his interest with the housekeeper to have my quarters changed to the lower storey quite resolved to remove to the Brandon Arms rather than encounter another such night as I had passed Stanley Lake did not appear that day Wylder was glowering and abstracted worse company than usual and Rachel seemed to have quite passed from his recollection While Rachel Lake was as usual busy in her little garden that day Lord Chelford on his way to the town by the pretty mill road took off his hat to her with a smiling salutation and leaning on the paling he said I often wonder how you make your flowers grow here you have so little sun among the trees and yet it is so pretty and flowery it remains in my memory as if the sun were always shining specially on this little garden Miss Lake laughed I am very proud of it They try not to blow but I never let them alone till they do See all my watering pots and pruning scissors my sticks and bass mat and glass covers Skill and industry conquer churlish nature and this is my Versailles I don t believe in those sticks and scissors and watering pots You won t tell your secret but I m sure it s an influence you smile and whisper to them She smiled without raising her eyes on the flower she was tying up and indeed it was such a smile as must have made it happy and she said gaily You forget that Lord Chelford passes this way sometimes and shines upon them too No he s a dull earthly dog and if he shines here it is only in reflected light Margery child fetch me the scissors And a hobble de hoy of a girl with round eyes and a long white apron and bare arms came down the little walk and eyeing the peer with an awful curiosity presented the shears to the charming Atropos who clipped off the withered blossoms that had bloomed their hour and were to cumber the stalk no more Now you see what art may do how passee this creature was till I made her toilet and how wonderfully the poor old beauty looks now and she glanced complacently at the plant she had just trimmed Well it is young again and beautiful but no I have no faith in the scissors I still believe in the influence from the tips of your fingers your looks and tones Flowers like fairies have their favourites whom they smile on and obey and I think this is a haunted glen trees flowers all have an intelligence and a feeling and I am sure you see wonderful things by moonlight from your window With a strange meaning echo those words returned to her afterwards I m sure you see wonderful things by moonlight from your window But no matter the winged words making pleasant music flew pleasantly away now among transparent leaves and glimmering sun by and by in moonlight they will return to the casement piping the same tune in ghostly tones And as they chatted in this strain Rachel paused on a sudden with upraised hand listening pleasantly I hear the pony carriage Dorcas is coming she said And the tinkle of tiny wheels coming down the road was audible There s a pleasant sense of adventure too in the midst of your seclusion Sudden arrivals and passing pilgrims like me leaning over the paling and refreshed by the glimpse the rogue steals of this charming oratory Yes here comes the fair Brunnisende And he made his salutation Miss Brandon smiled from under her gipsy hat very pleasantly for her Will you come with me for a drive Radie she asked Yes dear delighted Margery bring my gloves and cloak And she unpinned the faded silk shawl that did duty in the garden and drew off her gauntlets and showed her pretty hands and Margery popped her cloak on her shoulders and the young lady pulled on her gloves All ready in a moment like a young lady of energy and chatting merrily she sat down beside her cousin who held the reins As there were no more gates to open Miss Brandon dismissed the servant who stood at the ponies heads and who touching his hat with his white glove received his conge and strode with willing steps up the road Will you take me for your footman as far as the town asked Lord Chelford so with permission up he jumped behind and away they whirled close over the ground on toy wheels ringing merrily on the shingle he leaning over the back and chatting pleasantly with the young ladies as they drove on They drew up at the Brandon Arms and little girls courtesied at doors and householders peeped from their windows not standing close to the panes but respectfully back at the great lady and the nobleman who was now taking his leave And next they pulled up at that official rendezvous with white washed front and post office in white letters on a brown board over its door and its black hinged window pane through which mister Driver or in his absence Miss Anne Driver answered questions and transacted affairs officially In the rear of this establishment were kept some dogs of Lawyer Larkin s and just as the ladies arrived that person emerged looking overpoweringly gentlemanlike in a white hat gray paletot lavender trowsers and white riding gloves He was in a righteous and dignified way pleased to present himself in so becoming a costume and moreover in good company for Stanley Lake was going with him to Dutton for a day s sport which neither of them cared for But Stanley hoped to pump the attorney and the attorney I m afraid liked being associated with the fashionable captain and so they were each pleased in the way that suited them The attorney being long as well as lank had to stoop under the doorway but drew himself up handsomely on coming out and assumed his easy high bred style which although he was not aware of it was very nearly insupportable and smiled very engagingly and meant to talk a little about the weather but Miss Brandon made him one of her gravest and slightest bows and suddenly saw missus Brown at her shop door on the other side and had a word to say to her And now Stanley Lake drew up in the tax cart and greeted the ladies and told them how he meant to pass the day and the dogs being put in and the attorney I m afraid a little spited at his reception in possession of the reins they drove down the little street at a great pace and disappeared round the corner and in a minute more the young ladies in the opposite direction resumed their drive The ponies being grave and trustworthy and having the road quite to themselves needed little looking after and Miss Brandon was free to converse with her companion I think Rachel you have a lover she said Only a bachelor I m afraid as my poor Margery calls the young gentleman who takes her out for a walk on a Sunday and I fear means nothing more This is the second time I ve found Chelford talking to you Rachel at the door of your pretty little garden Rachel laughed Suppose some fine day he should put his hand over the paling and take yours and make you a speech You romantic darling she said don t you know that peers and princes have quite given over marrying simple maidens of low estate for love and liking and understand match making better than you or I though I could give a tolerable account of myself after the manner of the white cat in the story which I think is a pattern of frankness and modest dignity I d say with a courtesy Think not prince that I have always been a cat and that my birth is obscure my father was king of six kingdoms and loved my mother tenderly and so forth Rachel I like you interrupted the dark beauty fixing her large eyes from which not light but as it were a rich shadow fell softly on her companion It was the first time she had made any such confession Rachel returned her look as frankly with an amused smile and then said with a comic little toss of her head Well Dorcas I don t see why you should not though I don t know why you say so You re not like other people you don t complain and you re not bitter although you have had great misfortunes my poor Rachel There be ladies young and old who the moment they are pitied though never so cheerful before will forthwith dissolve in tears But that was not Rachel s way she only looked at her with a good humoured but grave curiosity for a few seconds and then said with rather a kindly smile And now Dorcas I like you Dorcas made no answer but put her arm round Rachel s neck and kissed her Dorcas made two kisses of it and Rachel one but it was cousinly and kindly and Rachel laughed a soft little laugh after it looking amused and very lovingly on her cousin but she was a bold lass and not given in anywise to the melting mood and said gaily with her open hand still caressingly on Dorcas s waist I make a very good nun Dorcas as I told Stanley the other day I sometimes indeed receive a male visitor at the other side of the paling which is my grille but to change my way of life is a dream that does not trouble me Happy the girl and I am one who cannot like until she is first beloved Don t you remember poor pale Winnie the maid who used to take us on our walks all the summer at Dawling how she used to pluck the leaves from the flowers like Faust s Marguerite saying He loves me a little passionately not at all Now if I were loved passionately I might love a little and if loved a little it should be not at all They had the road all to themselves and were going at a walk up an ascent so the reins lay loosely on the ponies necks and Dorcas looked with an untold meaning in her proud face on her cousin and seemed on the point of speaking but she changed her mind And so Dorcas as swains are seldom passionately in love with so small a pittance as mine I think I shall mature into a queer old maid and take all the little Wylders masters and misses with your leave for their walks and help to make their pinafores Whereupon Miss Dorcas put her ponies into a very quick trot and became absorbed in her driving CHAPTER XIV IN WHICH VARIOUS PERSONS GIVE THEIR OPINIONS OF CAPTAIN STANLEY LAKE Stanley is an odd creature said Rachel so soon as another slight incline brought them to a walk I can t conceive why he has come down here or what he can possibly want of that disagreeable lawyer They have got dogs and guns and are going of course to shoot but he does not care for shooting and I don t think mister Larkin s society can amuse him Stanley is clever and cunning I think but he is neither wise nor frank He never tells me his plans though he must know he does know I love him yes he s a strange mixture of suspicion and imprudence He s wonderfully reserved I am certain he trusts no one on earth and at the same time except in his confidences he s the rashest man living If he were like Lord Chelford or even like our good vicar not in piety for poor Stanley s training like my own was sadly neglected there I mean in a few manly points of character I should be quite happy I think in my solitary nook Is he so very odd said Miss Brandon coldly I only know he makes me often very uncomfortable answered Rachel I never mind what he tells me for I think he likes to mislead everybody and I have been two often duped by him to trust what he says I only know that his visit to Gylingden must have been made with some serious purpose and his ideas are all so rash and violent He was at Donnyston for ten days I think when I was there and seemed clever They had charades and proverbes dramatiques I m no judge but the people who understood it said he was very good Oh yes he is clever I knew he was at Donnyston but he did not mention he had seen you there he only told me he had met you pretty often when you were at Lady Alton s last season Yes in town she answered a little drily While these young ladies are discussing Stanley Lake I may be permitted to mention my own estimate of that agreeable young person Captain Lake was a gentleman and an officer and of course an honourable man but somehow I should not have liked to buy a horse from him He was very gentlemanlike in appearance and even elegant but I never liked him although he undoubtedly had a superficial fascination I always thought when in his company of old Lord Holland s silk stocking with something unpleasant in it I think in fact he was destitute of those fine moral instincts which are born with men but never acquired and in his way of estimating his fellow men and the canons of honour there was occasionally perceptible a faint flavour of the villainous and an undefined savour at times of brimstone I know also that when his temper which was nothing very remarkable was excited he could be savage and brutal enough and I believe he had often been violent and cowardly in his altercations with his sister so at least two or three people who were versed in the scandals of the family affirmed But it is a censorious world and I can only speak positively of my own sensations in his company His morality however I suppose was quite good enough for the world and he had never committed himself in any of those ways of which that respectable tribunal takes cognizance So that d d fellow Lake is down here still and that stupid scheming lubber Larkin driving him about in his tax cart instead of minding his business I could not see him to day That sort of thing won t answer me and he is staying at Larkin s house I find Wylder was talking to me on the door steps after dinner having in a rather sulky way swallowed more than his usual modicum of Madeira and his remarks were delivered interruptedly two or three puffs of his cigar interposed between each sentence I suppose he expects to be asked to the wedding He may expect ha ha ha You don t know that lad as I do Then there came a second cigar and some little time in lighting and full twenty enjoyable puffs before he resumed Now you re a moral man Charlie tell me really what you think of a fellow marrying a girl he does not care that for and he snapt his fingers Just for the sake of her estate it s the way of the world of course and all that but is not it a little bit shabby don t you think Eh Ha ha ha I ll not debate with you Wylder on that stupid old question It s the way of the world as you say and there s an end of it They say she s such a beauty Well so I believe she is but I can t fancy her Now you must not be angry I m not a poet like you book learned you know and she s too solemn by half and grand I wish she was different That other girl Rachel she s a devilish handsome craft I wish almost she was not here at all or I wish she was in Dorcas s shoes Nonsense Wylder stop this stuff and it is growing cold throw away that cigar and come in In a minute No I assure you I m not joking Hang it I must talk to some one I m devilish uncomfortable about this grand match I wish I had not been led into it I don t think I d make a good husband to any woman I did not fancy and where s the good of making a girl unhappy eh Tut Wylder you ought to have thought of all that before I don t like your talking in this strain when you know it is too late to recede besides you are the luckiest fellow in creation Upon my word I don t know why the girl marries you you can t suppose that she could not marry much better and if you have not made up your mind to break off of which the world would form but one opinion you had better not speak in that way any more Why it was only to you Charlie and to tell you the truth I do believe it is the best thing for me but I suppose every fellow feels a little queer when he is going to be spliced a little bit nervous eh But you are right and I m right and we are all right it is the best thing for us both It will make a deuced fine estate but hang it you know a fellow s never satisfied And I suppose I m a bit put out by that disreputable dog s being here I mean Lake not that I need care more than Dorcas or anyone else but he s no credit to the family you see and I never could abide him I ve half a mind Charlie to tell you a thing but hang it you re such a demure old maid of a chap Will you have a cigar No Well I believe two s enough for me and he looked up at the stars I ve a notion of running up to town only for a day or two before this business comes off just on the sly you ll not mention it and I ll have a word with Lake quite friendly of course but I ll shut him up and that s all I wonder he did not dine here to day Did you ever see so pushing a brute So Wylder chucked away his cigar and stood for a minute with his hands in his pockets looking up at the stars as if reading fortunes there I had an unpleasant feeling that Mark Wylder was about some mischief a suspicion that some game of mine and countermine was going on between him and Lake to which I had no clue whatsoever Mark had the frankness of callosity and could recount his evil deeds and confess his vices with hilarity and detail and was prompt to take his part in a lark and was a remarkably hard hitter and never shrank from the brunt of the row and with these fine qualities and a much superior knowledge of the ways of the flash world had commanded my boyish reverence and a general popularity among strangers But with all this he could be as secret as the sea with which he was conversant and as hard as a stonewall when it answered his purpose He had no lack of cunning and a convenient fund of cool cruelty when that stoical attribute was called for Years I dare say and a hard life and profligacy and command had not made him less selfish or more humane or abated his craft and resolution If one could only see it the manoeuvring and the ultimate collision of two such generals as he and Lake would be worth observing I dare say my last night s adventure tended to make me more nervous and prone to evil anticipation And although my quarters had been changed to the lower storey I grew uncomfortable as it waxed late and half regretted that I had not migrated to the Brandon Arms Uncle Lorne however made me no visit that night Once or twice I fancied something and started up in my bed It was fancy merely What state had I really been in when I saw that long chinned apparition of the pale portrait Many a wiser man than I had been mystified by dyspepsia and melancholic vapours CHAPTER XV DORCAS SHOWS HER JEWELS TO MISS LAKE Stanley Lake and his sister dined next day at Brandon Under the cold shadow of Lady Chelford the proprieties flourished and generally very little else Awful she was and prompt to lecture young people before their peers and spoke her mind with fearful directness and precision But sometimes she would talk and treat her hearers to her recollections and recount anecdotes with a sort of grim cleverness not wholly unamusing She did not like Wylder I thought although she had been the inventor and constructor of the family alliance of which he was the hero I did not venture to cultivate her and Miss Brandon had been from the first specially cold and repellent to Captain Lake There was nothing very genial or promising therefore in the relations of our little party and I did not expect a very agreeable evening Notwithstanding all this however our dinner was on the whole much pleasanter than I anticipated Stanley Lake could be very amusing but I doubt if our talk would quite stand the test of print I often thought if one of those artists who photograph language and thought the quiet clever reporters to whom England is obliged for so much of her daily entertainment of her social knowledge and her political safety were pencil in hand to ensconce himself behind the arras and present us at the close of the agreeable banquet with a literal transcript of the feast of reason which we give and take with so much complacency whether it would quite satisfy us upon reconsideration When I entered the drawing room after dinner Lord Chelford was plainly arguing a point with the young ladies and by the time I drew near it was Miss Lake s turn to speak Flattering of mankind I am sure I have no talent for and without flattering and wheedling you ll never have conjugal obedience Don t you remember Robin Hood how The mother of Robin said to her husband My honey my love and my dear And all this for leave to ride with her son to see her own brother at Gamwell I remember said Dorcas with a smile I wonder what has become of that old book with its odd little woodcuts And he said I grant thee thy boon gentle Joan Take one of my horses straightway Well though the book is lost we retain the moral you see said Rachel with a little laugh and it has always seemed to me that if it had not been necessary to say my honey my love and my dear that good soul would not have said it and you may be pretty sure that if she had not and with the suitable by play too she might not have ridden to Gamwell that day And you don t think you could have persuaded yourself to repeat that little charm which obtained her boon and one of his horses straightway said Lord Chelford Well I don t know what a great temptation and a contumacious husband might bring one to but I m afraid I m a stubborn creature and have not the feminine gift of flattery If indeed he felt his inferiority and owned his dependence I think I might perhaps have called him my honey my love and my dear and encouraged and comforted him but to buy my personal liberty and the right to visit my brother at Gamwell never And yet she looked Lord Chelford thought very goodhumoured and pleasant and he fancied a smile from her might do more with some men than all gentle Joan s honeyed vocabulary I own said Lord Chelford laughing that from prejudice I suppose I am in favour of the apostolic method and stand up for the divine right of my sex but then don t you see it is your own fault if you make it a question of right when you may make it altogether one of fascination Who pray is disputing the husband s right to rule demanded old Lady Chelford unexpectedly I am very timidly defending it against very serious odds answered her son Tut tut my dears what s all this you must obey your husbands cried the dowager who put down nonsense with a high hand and had ruled her lord with a rod of iron That s no tradition of the Brandons said Miss Dorcas quietly The Brandons pooh my dear it is time the Brandons should grow like other people Hitherto the Brandon men have all without exception been the wickedest in all England and the women the handsomest and the most self willed Of course the men could not be obeyed in all things nor the women disobeyed I m a Brandon myself Dorcas so I ve a right to speak But the words are precise honour and obey and obey you must though of course you may argue a point if need be and let your husband hear reason And having ruled the point old Lady Chelford leaned back and resumed her doze There was no longer anything playful in Dorcas s look On the contrary something fierce and lurid which I thought wonderfully becoming and after a little she said I promised Rachel to show you my jewels Come now will you and see them And she placed Rachel s hand on her arm and the two young ladies departed Are you well dear asked Rachel when they reached her room Dorcas was very pale and her gaze was stern and something undefinably wild in her quietude What day of the month is this said Dorcas The eighth is not it yes the eighth answered Rachel And our marriage is fixed for the twenty second just a fortnight hence I am going to tell you Rachel what I have resolved on How really beautiful these diamonds are quite superb Yes said Dorcas opening the jewel cases which she had taken from her cabinet one after the other And these pearls how very magnificent I had no idea Mark Wylder s taste was so exquisite Yes very magnificent I suppose How charming quite regal you will look Dorcas Dorcas smiled strangely and her bosom heaved a little Rachel thought Was it elation or was there not something wildly bitter gleaming in that smile I must look a little longer at these diamonds As long dear as you please You are not likely Rachel to see them again From the blue flash of the brilliants Rachel in honest amazement raised her eyes to her cousin s face The same pale smile was there the look was oracular and painful Had she overheard a part of that unworthy talk of Wylder s at the dinner table the day before and mistaken Rachel s share in the dialogue And Dorcas said You have heard of the music on the waters that lures mariners to destruction The pilot leaves the rudder and leans over the prow and listens They steer no more but drive before the wind and what care they for wreck or drowning I suppose it was the same smile but in Rachel s eyes as pictures will it changed its character with her own change of thought and now it seemed the pale rapt smile of one who hears music far off or sees a vision Rachel dear I sometimes think there is an evil genius attendant on our family continued Dorcas in the same subdued tone which in its very sweetness had so sinister a sound in Rachel s ear From mother to child from child to grandchild the same influence continues and one after another wrecks the daughters of our family a wayward family and full of misery Here I stand forewarned with my eyes open determinedly following in the funereal footsteps of those who have gone their way before me These jewels all go back to mister Wylder He never can be anything to me I was I thought to build up our house I am going I think to lay it in the dust With the spirit of the insane I feel the spirit of a prophetess too and I see the sorrow that awaits me You will see Dorcas darling you are certainly ill What is the matter No dear Rachel not ill only maybe agitated a little You must not touch the bell listen to me but first promise so help you Heaven you will keep my secret I do promise indeed Dorcas I swear I ll not repeat one word you tell me It has been a vain struggle I know he s a bad man a worthless man selfish cruel maybe Love is not blind with me but quite insane He does not know nor you nor anyone and now Rachel I tell you what was unknown to all but myself and Heaven looking neither for counsel nor for pity nor for sympathy but because I must and you have sworn to keep my secret I love your brother Rachel you must try to like me She threw her arms round her cousin s neck and Rachel felt in her embrace the vibration of an agony She was herself so astonished that for a good while she could hardly collect her thoughts or believe her senses Was it credible Stanley whom she had received with a coldness if not aversion so marked that if he had a spark of Rachel s spirit he would never have approached her more Then came the thought perhaps they understood one another and that was the meaning of Stanley s unexpected visit Well Dorcas dear I am utterly amazed But does Stanley he can hardly hope Dorcas removed her arms from her cousin s neck her face was pale and her cheeks wet with tears which she did not wipe away Sit down by me Rachel No he does not like me that is I don t know but I am sure he can t suspect that I like him It was my determination it should not be I resolved Rachel quite to extinguish the madness but I could not It was not his doing nor mine but something else There are some families I think too wicked for Heaven to protect and they are given over to the arts of those who hated them in life and pursue them after death and this is the meaning of the curse that has always followed us No good will ever happen us and I must go like the rest There was a short silence and Rachel gazed on the carpet in troubled reflection and then with an anxious look she took her cousin s hand and said Dorcas you must think of this no more I am speaking against my brother s interest But you must not sacrifice yourself your fortune and your happiness to a shadow whatever his means are they hardly suffice for his personal expenses indeed they don t suffice for I have had to help him But that is all trifling compared with other considerations I am his sister and though he has shown little love for me I am not without affection and strong affection for him but I must and will speak frankly You could not I don t think anyone could be happy with Stanley for her husband You don t know him he s profligate he s ill tempered he s cold he s selfish he s secret He was a spoiled boy totally without moral education he might perhaps have been very different but he is what he is and I don t think he ll ever change He may be what he will It is vain reasoning with that which is not reason the battle is over possibly he may never know and that might be best for both but be it how it may I will never marry anyone else Dorcas dear you must not speak to Lady Chelford or to Mark Wylder to night It is too serious a step to be taken in haste There has been no haste Rachel and there can be no change And what reason can you give None no reason said Dorcas slowly Wylder would have been suitable in point of wealth Not so well I am sure as you might have married but neither would he be a good husband though not so bad as Stanley and I do not think that Mark Wylder will quietly submit to his disappointment It was to have been simply a marriage of two estates It was old Lady Chelford s plan I have now formed mine and all that s over Let him do what he will I believe a lawsuit is his worst revenge I m indifferent Just then a knock came to the chamber door Come in said Miss Brandon and her maid entered to say that the carriage please Ma am was at the door to take Miss Lake home I had no idea it was so late said Rachel Stay dear don t go for a moment Jones bring Miss Lake s cloak and bonnet here And now dear she said after a little pause you ll remember your solemn promise I never broke my word dear Dorcas your secret is safe And Rachel try to like me I love you better Dorcas than I thought I ever could Good night dear Good night And the young ladies parted with a kiss and then another CHAPTER XVI JENNY PUT THE KETTLE ON Old Lady Chelford having despatched a sharp and unceremonious message to her young kinswoman absent without leave warning her in effect that if she returned to the drawing room it would be to preside alone over gentlemen departed somewhat to our secret relief Upon this on Lord Chelford s motion in our forlorn condition we went to the billiard room and there under the bright lights and the gay influence of that wonderful game we forgot our cares and became excellent friends apparently cuts canons screws misses flukes Lord Chelford joked Wylder chaffed even Lake seemed to enjoy himself and the game proceeded with animation and no lack of laughter beguiling the watches of the night and we were all amazed at length to find how very late it was So we laid down our cues with the customary ejaculations of surprise We declined wine and water and all other creature comforts Wylder and Lake had a walk before them and we bid Lord Chelford good night in the passage and I walked with them through the deserted and nearly darkened rooms Our talk grew slow and our spirits subsided in this changed and tenebrose scenery The void and the darkness brought back I suppose my recollection of the dubious terms on which these young men stood and a feeling of the hollowness and delusion of the genial hours just passed under the brilliant lights together with an unpleasant sense of apprehension On coming out upon the door steps we all grew silent The moon was low and its yellow disk seemed as it sometimes does dilated to a wondrous breadth as its edge touched the black outline of the distant woods I half believe in presentiments and I felt one now in the chill air the sudden silence and the watchful gaze of the moon I suspect that Wylder and Lake too felt something of the same ominous qualm for I thought their faces looked gloomy in the light as they stood together buttoning their loose wrappers and lighting their cigars With a good night good night we parted and I heard their retreating steps crunching along the walk that led to Redman s Hollow and by Miss Rachel s quiet habitation I heard no talking such as comes between whiffs with friendly smokers side by side and silent as mutes at a funeral they walked on and soon the fall of their footsteps was heard no more and I re entered the hall and shut the door The level moonlight was shining through the stained heraldic window and fell bright on the portrait of Uncle Lorne at the other end throwing a patch of red like a stain on one side of its pale forehead I had forgot at the moment that the ill omened portrait hung there and a sudden horror smote me I thought of what my vision said of the blood upon my forehead and by Jove there it was At this moment the large white Marseilles waistcoat of grave mister Larcom appeared followed by a tall powdered footman and their candles and business like proceedings frightened away the phantoms So I withdrew to my chamber where I am glad to say I saw nothing of Uncle Lorne Miss Lake as she drove that night toward Gylingden said little to the vicar s wife whose good husband had been away to Friars making a sick call and she prattled on very merrily about his frugal little tea awaiting his late return and asked her twice on the way home whether it was half past nine for she did not boast a watch and in the midst of her prattle was peeping at the landmarks of their progress Oh I m so glad here s the finger post at last and then Well here we are at the Cat and Fiddle I thought we d never pass it And at last the brougham stopped at the little garden gate at the far end of the village and the good little mamma called to her maid of all work from the window Has the master come yet Becky No Ma am please And I think she offered up a little thanksgiving she so longed to give him his tea herself and then she asked Is our precious mannikin asleep Which also being answered happily as it should be she bid her fussy adieux with a merry smile and hurried gabbling amicably with her handmaid across the little flower garden and Miss Lake was shut in and drove on alone under the thick canopy of old trees and up the mill road lighted by the flashing lamps to her own little precincts and was in turn at home solitary triste but still her home Get to your bed Margery child you are sleepy said the young lady kindly to her queer little maid of honour Rachel was one of those persons who no matter what may be upon their minds are quickly impressible by the scenes in which they find themselves She stepped into her little kitchen always a fairy kitchen so tiny so white so raddled and shining all over with that pleasantest of all effulgence burnished tins pewters and the homely decorations of the dresser and she looked all round and smiled pleasantly and kissed old Tamar and said So my dear old fairy here s your Cinderella home again from the ball and I ve seen nothing so pretty as this since I left Redman s Farm How white your table is how nice your chairs I wish you d change with me and let me be cook week about and really the fire is quite pleasant to night Come make a cup of tea and tell us a story and frighten me and Margery before we go to our beds Sit down Margery I m only here by permission What do you mean by standing And the young lady with a laugh sat down looking so pleased and good natured and merry that even old Tamar was fain to smile a glimmering smile and little Margery actively brought the tea caddy and the kettle being in a skittish singing state quickly went off in a boil and Tamar actually made tea in her brown tea pot Oh no the delf cups and saucers it will be twice as good in them and as the handsome mistress of the mansion sitting in the deal chair loosened her cloak and untied her bonnet she chatted away to the edification of Margery and the amusement of both This little extemporised bivouac as it were with her domestics delighted the young belle Vanity of vanities as mister Thackeray and King Solomon cry out in turn Silver trays and powdered footmen and Utrecht velvet upholstery miserable comforters What saloon was ever so cheery as this or flashed all over in so small a light so splendidly or yielded such immortal nectar from chased teapot and urn as this brewed in brown crockery from the roaring kettle So Margery sitting upon her stool in the background for the Queen had said it and sit she must and grinning from ear to ear in a great halo of glory partook of tea Well Tamar where s your story said the young lady Story La bless you dear Miss Radie where should I find a story My old head s a poor one to remember whimpered white Tamar Anything no matter what a ghost or a murder Old Tamar shook her head Or an elopement Another shake of the head Or a mystery or even a dream Well a dream Sometimes I do dream I dreamed how Master Stanley was coming the night before You did did you Selfish old thing and you meant to keep it all to yourself What was it Tamar looked anxiously and suspiciously in the kitchen fire and placed her puckered hand to the side of her white linen cap I dreamed Ma am the night before he came a great fellow was at the hall door What here Yes Ma am this hall door So muffled up I could not see his face and he pulls out a letter all over red Red Aye Miss a red letter Red ink No Miss red paper written with black and directed for you Oh And so Miss in my dream I gave it you in the drawing room and you opened it and leaned your hand upon your head sick like reading it I never saw you read a letter so serious like before And says you to me Miss It s all about Master Stanley he is coming And sure enough here he was quite unexpected next morning And was there no more asked Miss Lake No more Miss I awoke just then It is odd said Miss Lake with a little laugh Had you been thinking of him lately Not a bit Ma am I don t know when Well it certainly is very odd At all events it had glanced upon a sensitive recollection unexpectedly The kitchen was only a kitchen now and the young lady on a sudden looked thoughtful perhaps a little sad She rose and old Tamar got up before her with her scared secret look clothed in white the witch whose word had changed all and summoned round her those shapes which threw their indistinct shadows on the walls and faces around Light the candles in the drawing room Margery and then child go to your bed said the young lady awakening from an abstraction I don t mind dreams Tamar nor fortune tellers I ve dreamed so many good dreams and no good ever came of them But talking of Stanley reminds me of trouble and follies that I can t help or prevent He has left the army Tamar and I don t know what his plans are Ah poor child he was always foolish and changeable and a deal too innocent for them wicked officer gentlemen and I m glad he s not among them any longer to learn bad ways I am So the drawing room being prepared Rachel bid Tamar and little Margery good night and the sleepy little handmaid stumped off to her bed and white old Tamar who had not spoken so much for a month before put on her solemn round spectacles and by her dipt candle read her chapter in the ponderous Bible she had thumbed so well and her white lips told over the words as she read them in silence Old Tamar I always thought had seen many untold things in her day and some of her recollections troubled her I dare say and she held her tongue and knitted her white worsteds when she could sit quiet which was most hours of the day and now and then when evil remembrances maybe gathered round her solitude she warned them off with that book of power so that my recollection of her is always the same white clad cadaverous old woman with a pair of barnacles on her nose and her look of secrecy and suffering turned on the large print of that worn volume or else on the fumbling points of her knitting needles It was a small house this Redman s Farm but very silent for all that when the day s work was over and very solemn too the look out from the window among the colonnades of tall old trees on the overshadowed earth and through them into deepest darkness the complaining of the lonely stream far down is the only sound in the air There was but one imperfect vista looking down the glen and this afforded no distant view only a downward slant in the near woodland and a denser background of forest rising at the other side and to night mistily gilded by the yellow moon beams the moon herself unseen Rachel had opened her window shutters as was her wont when the moon was up and with her small white hands on the window sash looked into the wooded solitudes lost in haunted darkness in every direction but one and there massed in vaporous and discoloured foliage hardly more distinct or less solemn Poor old Tamar says her prayers and reads her Bible I wish I could How often I wish it That good simple vicar how unlike his brother is wiser perhaps than all the shrewd people that smile at him He used to talk to me but I ve lost that yes I let him understand I did not care for it and so that good influence is gone from me graceless creature No one seemed to care except poor old Tamar whether I ever said a prayer or heard any good thing and when I was no more than ten years old I refused to say my prayers for her My poor father Well Heaven help us all So she stood in the same sad attitude looking out upon the shadowy scene in a forlorn reverie Her interview with Dorcas remained on her memory like an odd clear half horrible dream What a dazzling prospect it opened for Stanley what a dreadful one might it not prepare for Dorcas What might not arise from such a situation between Stanley and Mark Wylder each in his way a worthy representative of the ill conditioned and terrible race whose blood he inherited Was this doomed house of Brandon never to know repose or fraternity Was it credible Had it actually occurred that strange confession of Dorcas Brandon s Could anything be imagined so mad so unaccountable She reviewed Stanley in her mind s eye She was better acquainted perhaps with his defects than his fascinations and too familiar with both to appreciate at all their effect upon a stranger What can she see in him There s nothing remarkable in Stanley poor fellow except his faults There are much handsomer men than he and many as amusing and he with no estate She had heard of charms and philtres How could she account for this desperate hallucination Rachel was troubled by a sort of fear to night and the low fever of an undefined expectation was upon her She turned from the window intending to write two letters which she had owed too long young ladies letters for Miss Lake like many of her sex as I am told had several little correspondences on her hands and as she turned with a start she saw old Tamar standing in the door way looking at her Tamar Yes Miss Rachel Why do you come so softly Tamar Do you know you frightened me I thought I d look in Miss before I went to bed just to see if you wanted anything No nothing thank you dear Tamar And I don t think Miss Rachel you are quite well to night though you are so gay you re pale dear and there s something on your mind Don t be thinking about Master Stanley he s out of the army now and I m thankful for it and make your mind easy about him and would not it be better dear you went to your bed you rise so early Very true good old Tamar but to night I must write a letter not a long one though and I assure you I m quite well Good night Tamar Tamar stood for a moment with her odd weird look upon her and then bidding her good night glided stiffly away shutting the door So Rachel sat down to her desk and began to write but she could not get into the spirit of her letter on the contrary her mind wandered away and she found herself listening every now and then and at last she fancied that old Tamar about whom that dream and her unexpected appearance at the door had given her a sort of spectral feeling that night was up and watching her and the idea of this white sentinel outside her door excited her so unpleasantly that she opened it but found no Tamar there and then she revisited the kitchen but that was empty too and the fire taken down And finally she passed into the old woman s bed chamber whom she saw her white head upon her pillow dreaming again perhaps And so softly closing her door she left her to her queer visions and deathlike slumber CHAPTER XVII RACHEL LAKE SEES WONDERFUL THINGS BY MOONLIGHT FROM HER WINDOW Though Rachel was unfit for letter writing she was still more unfit for slumber She leaned her temple on her hand and her rich light hair half covered her fingers and her amazing interview with Dorcas was again present with her and the same feeling of bewilderment The suddenness and the nature of the disclosures were dream like and unreal and the image of Dorcas remained impressed upon her sight not like Dorcas though the same but something ghastly wan glittering and terrible like a priestess at a solitary sacrifice It was late now not far from one o clock and around her the terrible silence of a still night All those small sounds lost in the hum of midday life now came into relief a ticking in the wainscot a crack now and then in the joining of the furniture and occasionally the tap of a moth against the window pane from outside sounds sharp and odd which made her wish the stillness of the night were not so intense As from her little table she looked listlessly through the window she saw against the faint glow of the moonlight the figure of a man who seized the paling and vaulted into the flower garden and with a few swift stumbling strides over the flower beds reached the window and placing his pale face close to the glass she saw his eyes glittering through it he tapped or rather beat on the pane with his fingers and at the same time he said repeatedly Let me in let me in Her first impression when she saw this person cross the little fence at the road side was that Mark Wylder was the man But she was mistaken the face and figure were Stanley Lake s She would have screamed in the extremity of her terror but that her voice for some seconds totally failed her and recognising her brother though like Rhoda in Holy Writ she doubted whether it was not his angel she rose up and with an awful ejaculation she approached the window Let me in Radie d you let me in he repeated drumming incessantly on the glass There was no trace now of his sleepy jeering way Rachel saw that something was very wrong and beckoned him toward the porch in silence and having removed the slender fastenings of the door it opened and he entered in a rush of damp night air She took him by the hand and he shook hers mechanically like a man rescued from shipwreck and plainly not recollecting himself well Stanley dear what s the matter in Heaven s name she whispered so soon as she had got him into her little drawing room He has done it d him he has done it gasped Stanley Lake He looked in her face with a glazed and ashy stare His hat remained on his head overshadowing his face and his boots were soiled with clay and his wrapping coat marked here and there with the green of the stems and branches of trees through which he had made his way I see Stanley you ve had a scene with Mark Wylder I warned you of your danger you have had the worst of it I spoke to him He took a course I did not expect I m not well You ve broken your promise I see you have used me How base how stupid How could I tell he was such a fiend I told you how it would be He has frightened you said Rachel herself frightened D him I wish I had done as you said I wish I had never come here Give me a glass of wine He has ruined me You cruel wretched creature said Rachel now convinced that he had compromised her as he threatened Yes I was wrong I m sorry things have turned out different Who s that said Lake grasping her wrist Who where Mark Wylder No it s nothing I believe Where is he Where have you left him Up there at the pathway near the stone steps Waiting there Well yes and I don t think I ll go back Radie You shall go back Sir and carry my message or no I could not trust you I ll go with you and see him and disabuse him How could you how could you Stanley It was a mistake altogether I m sorry but I could not tell there was such a devil on the earth Yes I told you so He has frightened you said Rachel He has maybe At any rate I was a fool and I think I m ruined and I m afraid Rachel you ll be inconvenienced too Yes you have made him savage and brutal and between you I shall be called in question you wretched fool Stanley was taking these hard terms very meekly for a savage young coxcomb like him Perhaps they bore no very distinct meaning just then to his mind Perhaps it was preoccupied with more exciting ideas or it may be his agitation and fear cried amen to the reproach at all events he only said in a pettish but deprecatory sort of way Well where s the good of scolding how can I help it now What s your quarrel why does he wait for you there why has he sent you here It must concern me Sir and I insist on hearing it all So you shall Radie only have patience just a minute and give me a little wine or water anything There is the key There s some wine in the press I think He tried to open it but his hand shook He saw his sister look at him and he flung the keys on the table rather savagely with I dare say a curse between his teeth There was running all this time in Rachel s mind and had been almost since the first menacing mention of Wylder s name by her brother an indistinct remembrance of something unpleasant or horrible It may have been mere fancy or it may have referred to something long ago imperfectly heard It was a spectre of mist that evaporated before she could fix her eyes on it but was always near her elbow Rachel took the key with a faint gleam of scorn on her face and brought out the wine in silence He took a tall stemmed Venetian glass that stood upon the cabinet an antique decoration and filled it with sherry a strange revival of old service How long was it since lips had touched its brim before and whose Lovers maybe and how How long since that cold crystal had glowed with the ripples of wine This at all events was its last service It is an old legend of the Venetian glass its shivering at touch of poison and there are those of whom it is said the poison of asps is under their lips What s that ejaculated Rachel with a sudden shriek that whispered shriek so expressive and ghastly that you perhaps have once heard in your life and her very lips grew white Hollo cried Lake He was standing with his back to the window and sprang forward as pale as she and grasped her with a white leer that she never forgot over his shoulder and the Venice glass was shivered on the ground Who s there he whispered And Rachel in a whisper ejaculated the awful name that must not be taken in vain She sat down She was looking at him with a wild stern stare straight in the face and he still holding her arm and close to her I see it all now she whispered Who what what is it said he I could not have fancied that she whispered with a gasp Stanley looked round him with pale and sharpened features What the devil is it If that scoundrel had come to kill us you could not cry out louder he whispered with an oath Do you want to wake your people up Oh Stanley she repeated in a changed and horror stricken way What a fool I ve been I see it at last I see it all now and she waved her white hands together very slowly towards him as mesmerisers move theirs There was a silence of some seconds and his yellow ferine gaze met hers strangely You were always a sharp girl Radie and I think you do see it he said at last very quietly The witness the witness the dreadful witness she repeated I ll show you though it s not so bad as you fancy I m sorry I did not take your advice but how I say could I know he was such a devil I must go back to him I only came down to tell you because Radie you know you proposed it yourself you must come too you must Radie Oh Stanley Stanley Stanley Why d it it can t be helped now can it said he with a peevish malignity But she was right there was something of the poltroon in him and he was trembling Why could you not leave me in peace Stanley I can t go without you Rachel I won t and if we don t we re both ruined he said with a bleak oath Yes Stanley I knew you were a coward she replied fiercely and wildly You re always calling names d you do as you like I care less than you think how it goes No Stanley you know me too well Ah No you sha n t be lost if I can help it Rachel shook her head as she spoke with a bitter smile and a dreadful sigh Then they whispered together for three or four minutes and Rachel clasped her jewelled fingers tight across her forehead quite wildly for a minute You ll come then said Stanley She made no answer and he repeated the question By this time she was standing and without answering she began mechanically to get on her cloak and hat You must drink some wine first he may frighten you perhaps You must take it Rachel or I ll not go Stanley Lake was swearing in his low tones like a swell mobsman to night Rachel seemed to have made up her mind to submit passively to whatever he required Perhaps indeed she thought there was wisdom in his advice At all events she drank some wine Rachel Lake was one of those women who never lose their presence of mind even under violent agitation for long and who generally even when highly excited see and do instinctively and with decision what is best to be done and now with dilated eyes and white face she walked noiselessly into the kitchen listened there for a moment then stole lightly to the servants sleeping room and listened there at the door and lastly looked in and satisfied herself that both were still sleeping Then as cautiously and swiftly she returned to her drawing room and closed the window shutters and drew the curtain and signalling to her brother they went stealthily forth into the night air closing the hall door and through the little garden at the outer gate of which they paused I don t know Rachel I don t like it I m not fit for it Go back again go in and lock your door we ll not go to him you need not you know He may stay where he is let him I ll not return I say I ll see him no more I ll get away I ll consult Larkin shall I Though that won t do he s in Wylder s interest curse him What had I best do I m not equal to it We must go Stanley You said right just now be resolute we are both ruined unless we go You have brought it to that you must come I m not fit for it I tell you I m not You were right Radie I think I m not equal to a business of this sort and I won t expose you to such a scene You re not equal to it either I think and Lake leaned on the paling Don t mind me you haven t much hitherto Go or stay I m equally ruined now but not equally disgraced and go we must for it is your only chance of escape Come Stanley for shame In a few minutes more they were walking in deep darkness and silence side by side along the path which diverging from the mill road penetrates the coppice of that sequestered gorge along the bottom of which flows a tributary brook that finds its way a little lower down into the mill stream This deep gully in character a good deal resembles Redman s Glen into which it passes being fully as deep and wooded to the summit at both sides but much steeper and narrower and therefore many shades darker They had now reached those rude stone steps some ten or fifteen in number which conduct the narrow footpath up a particularly steep acclivity and here Lake lost courage again for they distinctly heard the footsteps that paced the platform above CHAPTER XVIII MARK WYLDER S SLAVE Nearly two hours had passed before they returned As they did so Rachel Lake went swiftly and silently before her brother The moon had gone down and the glen was darker than ever Noiselessly they re entered the little hall of Redman s Farm The candles were still burning in the sitting room and the light was dazzling after the profound darkness in which they had been for so long Captain Lake did not look at all like a London dandy now His dress was confoundedly draggled the conventional countenance too was wanting There was a very natural savagery and dejection there and a wild leer in his yellow eyes Rachel sat down No living woman ever showed a paler face and she stared with a look that was sharp and stern upon the wainscot before her For some minutes they were silent and suddenly with an exceeding bitter cry she stood up close to him seizing him in her tiny hands by the collar and with wild eyes gazing into his she said See what you ve brought me to wretch wretch wretch And she shook him with violence as she spoke It was wonderful how that fair young face could look so terrible There Radie there said Lake disengaging her fingers You re a little hysterical that s all It will be over in a minute but don t make a row You re a good girl Radie For Heaven s sake don t spoil all by folly now He was overawed and deprecatory A slave only think a slave Oh frightful frightful Is it a dream Oh frightful frightful Stanley Stanley it would be mercy to kill me she broke out again Now Radie listen to reason and don t make a noise you know we agreed you must go and I can t go with you Lake was cooler by this time and his sister more excited than before they went out I used to be brave my courage I think is gone but who d have imagined what s before me Stanley walked to the window and opened the shutter a little He forgot how dark it was The moon had gone down He looked at his watch and then at Rachel She was sitting and in no calmer state serene enough in attitude but the terribly wild look was unchanged He looked at his watch again and held it to his ear and consulted it once more before he placed the tiny gold disk again in his pocket This won t do he muttered With one of the candles in his hand he went out and made a hurried peeping exploration and soon for the rooms were quickly counted in Redman s Farm he found her chamber small neat simplex munditiis Bright and natty were the chintz curtains and the little toilet set out not inelegantly and her pet piping goldfinch asleep on his perch with his bit of sugar between the wires of his cage her pillow so white and unpressed with its little edging of lace Were slumbers sweet as of old ever to know it more What dreams were henceforward to haunt it Shadows were standing about that lonely bed already I don t know whether Stanley Lake felt anything of this being very decidedly of the earth earthy But there are times when men are translated from their natures and forced to be romantic and superstitious When he came back to the drawing room a toilet bottle of eau de cologne in his hand with her lace handkerchief he bathed her temples and forehead There was nothing very brotherly in his look as he peered into her pale sharp features during the process It was the dark and pallid scrutiny of a familiar of the Holy Office bringing a victim back to consciousness She was quickly better There don t mind me she said sharply and getting up she looked down at her dress and thin shoes and seeming to recollect herself she took the candle he had just set down and went swiftly to her room Gliding without noise from place to place she packed a small black leather bag with a few necessary articles Then changed her dress quickly put on her walking boots a close bonnet and thick veil and taking her purse she counted over its contents and then standing in the midst of the room looked round it with a great sigh and a strange look as if it was all new to her And she threw back her veil and going hurriedly to the toilet mechanically surveyed herself in the glass And she looked fixedly on the pale features presented to her and said Rachel Lake Rachel Lake what are you now And so with knitted brows and stern lips a cadaveric gaze was returned on her from the mirror A few minutes later her brother who had been busy down stairs put his head in and asked Will you come with me now Radie or do you prefer to wait here I ll stay here that is in the drawing room she answered and the face was withdrawn In the little hall Stanley looked again at his watch and getting quietly out went swiftly through the tiny garden and once upon the mill road ran at a rapid pace down towards the town The long street of Gylingden stretched dim and silent before him Slumber brooded over the little town and his steps sounded sharp and hollow among the houses He slackened his pace and tapped sharply at the little window of that modest post office at which the young ladies in the pony carriage had pulled up the day before and within which Luke Waggot was wont to sleep in a sort of wooden box that folded up and appeared to be a chest of drawers all day Luke took care of mister Larkin s dogs and groomed mister Wylder s horse and cleaned up his dog cart for Mark being close about money and finding that the thing was to be done more cheaply that way put up his horse and dog cart in the post office premises and so evaded the livery charges of the Brandon Arms But Luke was not there and Captain Lake recollecting his habits and his haunt hurried on to the Silver Lion which has its gable towards the common only about a hundred steps away for distances are not great in Gylingden Here were the flow of soul and of stout long pipes long yarns and tolerably long credits and the humble scapegraces of the town resorted thither for the pleasures of a club life and often revelled deep into the small hours of the morning So Luke came forth D it where s the note said the captain rummaging uneasily in his pockets You know me eh Captain Lake Yes Sir Well oh here it is It was a scrap pencilled on the back of a letter LUKE WAGGOT Put the horse to and drive the dog cart to the White House Look out for me there We must catch the up mail train at Dollington Be lively If Captain Lake chooses to drive you need not come M WYLDER I ll drive said Captain Lake Lose no time and I ll give you half a crown Luke stuck on his greasy wideawake and in a few minutes more the dog cart was trundled out into the lane and the horse harnessed went between the shafts with that wonderful cheerfulness with which they bear to be called up under startling circumstances at unseasonable hours Easily earned Luke said Captain Lake in his soft tones The captain had buttoned the collar of his loose coat across his face and it was dark beside But Luke knew his peculiar smile and presumed it so he grinned facetiously as he put the coin in his breeches pocket and thanked him and in another minute the captain with a lighted cigar between his lips mounted to the seat took the reins the horse bounded off and away rattled the light conveyance sparks flying from the road at a devil of a pace down the deserted street of Gylingden and quickly melted in darkness That night a spectre stood by old Tamar s bedside in shape of her young mistress and shook her by the shoulder and stooping said sternly close in her face Tamar I m going away only for a few days and mind this I d rather be dead than any creature living should know it Little Margery must not suspect you ll manage that Here s the key of my bed room say I m sick and you must go in and out and bring tea and drinks and talk and whisper a little you understand as you might with a sick person and keep the shutters closed and if Miss Brandon sends to ask me to the Hall say I ve a headache and fear I can t go You understand me clearly Tamar Yes Miss Radie answered old Tamar wonder stricken with a strange expression of fear in her face And listen she continued you must go into my room and bring the message back as if from me with my love to Miss Brandon and if she or missus William Wylder the vicar s wife should call to see me always say I m asleep and a little better You see exactly what I mean Yes Miss answered Tamar whose eyes were fixed in a sort of fascination full on those of her mistress If Master Stanley should call he is to do just as he pleases You used to be accurate Tamar may I depend upon you Yes Ma am certainly If I thought you d fail me now Tamar I should never come back Good night Tamar There don t bless me Good night When the light wheels of the dog cart gritted on the mill road before the little garden gate of Redman s Farm the tall slender figure of Rachel Lake was dimly visible standing cloaked and waiting by it Silently she handed her little black leather bag to her brother and then there was a pause He stretched his hand to help her up In a tone that was icy and bitter she said To save myself I would not do it You deserve no love from me you ve showed me none never Stanley and yet I m going to give the most desperate proof of love that ever sister gave all for your sake and it s guilt guilt but my fate and I ll go and you ll never thank me that s all In a moment more she sat beside him and silent as the dead in Charon s boat away they glided toward the White House which lay upon the high road to Dollington The sleepy clerk that night in the Dollington station stamped two first class tickets for London one of which was for a gentleman and the other for a cloaked lady with a very thick veil who stood outside on the platform and almost immediately after the scream of the engine was heard piercing the deep tatting the Cyclopean red lamps glared nearer and nearer and the palpitating monster so stupendous and so docile came smoothly to a stand still before the trelliswork and hollyhocks of that pretty station CHAPTER XIX THE TARN IN THE PARK Next morning Stanley Lake at breakfast with the lawyer said A pretty room this is That bow window is worth all the pictures in Brandon To my eye there is no scenery so sweet as this at least to breakfast by I don t love your crags and peaks and sombre grandeur nor yet the fat flat luxuriance of our other counties These undulations and all that splendid timber and the glorious ruins on that hillock over there How many beautiful ruins that picturesque old fellow Cromwell has left us You don t eat your breakfast though said the attorney with a charming smile of reproach Ah thank you I m a bad breakfaster that is said Stanley recollecting that he had made some very creditable meals at the same table when I smoke so late as I did last night You drove mister Wylder to Dollington Yes he s gone to town he says yes the mail train to get some diamonds for Miss Brandon a present that ought to have come the day before yesterday He says they ll never have them in time unless he goes and blows them up Are you in his secrets at all Something in his confidence I should hope said mister Larkin in rather a lofty and reserved way Oh yes of course in serious matters but I meant other things You know he has been a little bit wild and ladies you know ladies will be troublesome sometimes and to say truth I don t think the diamonds have much to say to it Oh hem well you know I m not exactly the confidant mister Wylder would choose I suspect in a case of that very painful and I will say distressing character I rather think indeed I hope not No of course I dare say but I just fancied he might want a hint about the law of the matter The gracious attorney glanced at his guest with a thoroughly business like and searching eye You don t think there s any really serious annoyance you don t know the party said he I Oh dear no Wylder has always been very reserved with me He told me nothing If he had of course I should not have mentioned it I only conjecture for he really did seem to have a great deal more on his mind and he kept me walking back and forward near the mill road a precious long time And I really think once or twice he was going to tell me Oh you think then mister Lake there may be some serious a a well I should hope not I do most earnestly trust not This was said with upturned eyes and much unction But do you happen Captain Lake to know of any of those unfortunate those miserable connections which young gentlemen of fashion eh It s very sad Still it often needs as you say professional advice to solve such difficulties it is very sad oh is not it sad Pray don t let it affect your spirits said Lake who was leaning back in his chair and looking on the carpet about a yard before his lacquered boots in his usual sly way I may be quite mistaken you know but I wished you to understand having some little experience of the world I d be only too happy to be of any use if you thought my diplomacy could help poor Wylder out of his trouble that is if there really is any But you don t know No said mister Larkin thoughtfully and thoughtful he continued for a minute or two screwing his lips gently as was his wont while ruminating his long head motionless the nails of his long and somewhat large hand tapping on the arm of his chair with a sharp glance now and then at the unreadable visage of the cavalry officer It was evident his mind was working and nothing was heard in the room for a minute but the tapping of his nails on the chair like a death watch No said mister Larkin again I m not suspicious naturally too much the reverse I fear but it certainly does look odd Did he tell the family at Brandon Certainly not that I heard He may have mentioned it But I started with him and we walked together under the impression that he was going as usual to the inn the what d ye call it Brandon Arms and it was a sudden thought now I think of it for he took no luggage though to be sure I dare say he has got clothes and things in town And when does he return In a day or two at furthest he said I wonder what they ll think of it at Brandon said the attorney with a cavernous grin of sly enquiry at his companion which recollecting his character he softened into a sad sort of smile and added No harm I dare say and after all you know why should there any man may have business and indeed it is very likely after all that he really went about the jewels Men are too hasty to judge one another my dear Sir charity let us remember thinketh no evil By the bye said Lake rather briskly for him rummaging his pockets I m glad I remembered he gave me a little note to Chelford Are any of your people going to Brandon this morning I ll send it said the lawyer eyeing the little pencilled note wistfully which Lake presented between two fingers Yes it is to Lord Chelford said the attorney with a grand sort of suavity he liked lords placing it after a scrutiny in his waistcoat pocket Don t you think it had best go at once there may be something requiring an answer and your post leaves doesn t it at twelve Oh an answer is there said mister Larkin drawing it from his pocket and looking at it again with a perceptible curiosity I really can t say not having read it but there may said Captain Lake who was now and then a little impertinent just to keep mister Larkin in his place and perhaps to hint that he understood him Read it Oh my dear Sir my dear Captain Lake how could you but oh no you could not suppose I meant such an idea oh dear no no You and I have our notions about what s gentlemanlike and professional a and gentlemanlike as I say Heaven forbid Quite so said Captain Lake gently Though all the world does not think with us I can tell you things come before us in our profession Oh ho ho and mister Larkin lifted up his pink eyes and long hands and shook his long head with a melancholy smile and a sigh like a shudder When at the later breakfast up at Brandon that irregular pencilled scroll reached Lord Chelford s hand he said as he glanced on the direction This is Mark Wylder s what does he say So Mark s gone to town he said but he ll be back again on Saturday and in the meantime desires me to lay his heart at your feet Dorcas Will you read the note No said Dorcas quietly Lady Chelford extended her long shrivelled fingers on which glimmered sundry jewels and made a little nod to her son who gave it to her with a smile Holding her glasses to her eyes the note at a distance and her head rather back she said It is not a pretty billet and she read in a slow and grim way DEAR CHELFORD I m called up to London just for a day No lark but honest business I ll return on Saturday and tell Dorcas with dozens of loves I would write to her but have not a minute for the train Yours c M WYLDER No it is not pretty repeated the old lady and indeed in no sense was it Before luncheon Captain Lake arrived So Wylder has run up to town I said so soon as we had shaken hands in the hall Yes I drove him to Dollington last night we just caught the up train He says he ll be back again on Saturday I said Saturday is it He seemed to think yes it would be only a day or so Some jewels I think for Dorcas He did not say distinctly I only conjecture Lady Chelford and Miss Brandon I suppose in the drawing room So to the drawing room he passed How is Rachel how is your sister Captain Lake have you seen her to day asked old Lady Chelford rather benignantly She chose to be gracious to the Lakes Only for a moment thank you She has one of her miserable headaches poor thing but she ll be better she says in the afternoon and hopes to come up here to see you and Miss Brandon this evening Lord Chelford and I had a pleasant walk that day to the ruins of Willerton Castle I find in my diary a note Chelford tells me it is written in old surveys Wylderton and was one of the houses of the Wylders What considerable people those Wylders were and what an antique stock After this he wished to make a visit to the vicar and so we parted company I got into Brandon Park by the pretty gate near Latham It was a walk of nearly three miles across the park from this point to the Hall and the slopes and hollows of this noble undulating plain came out grandly in the long shadows and slanting beams of evening That yellow level light has in my mind something undefinably glorious and melancholy such as to make almost any scenery interesting and my solitary walk was delightful People must love and sympathise very thoroughly I think to enjoy natural scenery together Generally it is one of the few spectacles best seen alone The silence that supervenes is indicative of the solitary character of the enjoyment It is a poem and a reverie I was quite happy striding in the amber light and soft long shadows among the ferns the copsewood and the grand old clumps of timber exploring the undulations and the wild nooks and hollows which have each their circumscribed and sylvan charm a wonderful interest those little park like broken dells have always had for me dotted with straggling birch and oak and here and there a hoary ash tree with a grand and melancholy grace dreaming among the songs of wild birds in their native solitudes and the brown leaves tipped with golden light all breathing something of old world romance the poetry of bygone love and adventure and stirring undefinable and delightful emotions that mingle unreality with sense a music of the eye and spirit After many devious wanderings I found under shelter of a wonderful little hollow in which lay dim and still a tarn reflecting the stems of the trees that rose from its edge in a way so clear and beautiful that with a smile and a sigh I sat myself down upon a rock among the ferns and fell into a reverie The image of Dorcas rose before me There is a strange mystery and power in the apathetic and in that unaffected carelessness even defiance of opinion and criticism which I had seen here for the first time so beautifully embodied I was quite sure she both thought and felt and could talk too if she chose it What tremendous self reliance and disdain must form the basis of a female character which accepted misapprehension and depreciation with an indifference so genuine as to scorn even the trifling exertion of disclosing its powers She could not possibly care for Wylder any more than he cared for her That odd look I detected in the mirror what did it mean and Wylder s confusion about Captain Lake what was that I could not comprehend the situation that was forming I went over Wylder s history in my mind and Captain Lake s all I could recollect of it but could find no clue and that horrible visitation or vision what was it This latter image had just glided in and taken its place in my waking dream when I thought I saw reflected in the pool at my feet the shape and face which I never could forget of the white long chinned old man For a second I was unable I think to lift my eyes from the water which presented this cadaverous image But the figure began to move and I raised my eyes and saw it retreat with a limping gait into the thick copse before me in the shadow of which it stopped and turned stiffly round and directed on me a look of horror and then withdrew It is all very fine laughing at me and my fancies I do not think there are many men who in my situation would have felt very differently I recovered myself I shouted lustily after him to stay and then in a sort of half frightened rage I pursued him but I had to get round the pool a considerable circuit I could not tell which way he had turned on getting into the thicket and it was now dusk the sun having gone down during my reverie So I stopped a little way in the copsewood which was growing quite dark and I shouted there again peeping under the branches and felt queer and much relieved that nothing answered or appeared Looking round me in a sort of dream I remembered suddenly what Wylder had told me of old Lorne Brandon to whose portrait this inexplicable phantom bore so powerful a resemblance He was suspected of having murdered his own son at the edge of a tarn in the park This tarn maybe and with the thought the water looked blacker and a deeper and colder shadow gathered over the ominous hollow in which I stood and the rustling in the withered leaves sounded angrily I got up as quickly as might be to the higher grounds and waited there for awhile and watched for the emergence of the old man But it did not appear and shade after shade was spreading solemnly over the landscape and having a good way to walk I began to stride briskly along the slopes and hollows in the twilight now and then looking into vacancy over my shoulder The little adventure and the deepening shades helped to sadden my homeward walk and when at last the dusky outline of the Hall rose before me it wore a sort of weird and haunted aspect CHAPTER XX CAPTAIN LAKE TAKES AN EVENING STROLL ABOUT GYLINGDEN Again I had serious thoughts of removing my person and effects to the Brandon Arms I could not quite believe I had seen a ghost 
5682-32875-0001	train-other-500	but neither was I quite satisfied that the thing was altogether canny The apparition whatever it was seemed to persecute me with a mysterious obstinacy
none	none	 at all events I was falling into a habit of seeing it and I felt a natural desire to escape from the house 
5682-32875-0002	train-other-500	which was plagued with its presence At the same time I had an odd sort of reluctance to mention the subject to my entertainers The thing itself was a ghostly slur upon the house and to run away a reproach to my manhood and besides writing now at a distance
5682-32875-0003	train-other-500	and in the spirit of history I suspect the interest which beauty always excites had a great deal to do with my resolve to hold my ground and I dare say notwithstanding my other reasons had the ladies at the Hall been all either old or ugly
none	none	 I would have made good my retreat to the village hotel 
5682-32875-0004	train-other-500	As it was however I was resolved to maintain my position But that evening was streaked with a tinge of horror and I more silent and distrait
none	none	 than usual The absence of an accustomed face 
5682-32875-0005	train-other-500	even though the owner be nothing very remarkable is always felt
none	none	 and Wylder was missed though sooth to say 
5682-32875-0006	train-other-500	not very much regretted For the first time we were really a small party Miss Lake was not there The gallant captain her brother was also absent The vicar and his good little wife were at Naunton that evening
5682-32875-0007	train-other-500	to hear a missionary recount his adventures and experiences in Japan and none of the neighbours had been called in to fill the empty chairs
none	none	 Dorcas Brandon did not contribute much to the talk neither 
5682-32875-0008	train-other-500	in truth did I Old Lady Chelford occasionally dozed and nodded sternly after tea waking up and eyeing people grimly as though enquiring whether anyone presumed to suspect her ladyship of having had a nap Chelford I recollect took a book
5682-32875-0009	train-other-500	and read to us now and then a snatch of poetry I forget what My book except when I was thinking of the tarn and that old man I so hated was Miss Brandon s exquisite and mysterious face That young lady was leaning back in her great oak chair
5682-32875-0010	train-other-500	in which she looked like the heroine of some sad and gorgeous romance of the old civil wars of England and directing a gaze of contemplative and haughty curiosity upon the old lady who was unconscious of the daring profanation
5682-32875-0011	train-other-500	All on a sudden Dorcas Brandon said And pray what do you think of marriage Lady Chelford What do I think of marriage repeated the dowager throwing back her head and eyeing the beautiful heiress through her gold spectacles with a stony surprise
5682-32875-0012	train-other-500	for she was not accustomed to be catechised by young people Marriage why tis a divine institution What can the child mean
none	none	 Do you think Lady Chelford 
5682-32875-0013	train-other-500	it may be safely contracted solely to join two estates pursued the young lady Do I think it may safely be contracted solely to join two estates repeated the old lady with a look and carriage that plainly showed
5682-32875-0014	train-other-500	how entirely she appreciated the amazing presumption of her interrogatrix There was a little pause Certainly replied Lady Chelford
5682-32875-0015	train-other-500	that is of course under proper conditions and with a due sense of its sacred character and a a obligations The first of which is love continued Miss Brandon the second honour
5682-32875-0016	train-other-500	both involuntary and the third obedience which springs from them Old Lady Chelford coughed and then rallying said Very good Miss
none	none	 And pray Lady Chelford what do you think of mister Mark Wylder pursued Miss Dorcas 
5682-32875-0017	train-other-500	I don t see Miss Brandon that my thoughts upon that subject can concern anyone but myself retorted the old lady severely and from an awful altitude
none	none	 And I may say considering who I am 
5682-32875-0018	train-other-500	and my years and the manner in which I am usually treated I am a little surprised at the tone in which you are pleased to question me These last terrible remarks totally failed to overawe the serene temerity of the grave beauty
5682-32875-0019	train-other-500	I assumed Lady Chelford as you had interested yourself in me so far as to originate the idea of my engagement to mister Wylder that you had considered these to me very important questions a little
5682-32875-0020	train-other-500	and could give me satisfactory answers upon points on which my mind has been employed for some days and indeed I think I ve a right to ask that assistance of you You seem to forget young lady that there are times and places for such discussions
5682-32875-0021	train-other-500	and that to mister a a your visitor a glance at me it can t be very interesting to listen to this kind of of conversation which is neither very entertaining nor very wise I am answerable only for my part
5682-32875-0022	train-other-500	of it and I think my questions very much to the purpose said the young lady in her low silvery tones I don t question your good opinion Miss Brandon of your own discretion but I can t see any profit in
5682-32875-0023	train-other-500	now discussing an engagement of more than two months standing or a marriage which is fixed to take place only ten days hence And I think Sir glancing again at me it must strike you a little oddly
none	none	 that I should be invited in your presence to discuss family matters with Miss Dorcas Brandon 
5682-32875-0024	train-other-500	Now was it fair to call a peaceable inhabitant like me into the thick of a fray like this I paused long enough to allow Miss Brandon to speak but she did not choose to do so thinking I suppose it was my business
5682-32875-0025	train-other-500	I believe I ought to have withdrawn a little I said very humbly and old Lady Chelford at the word shot a gleam of contemptuous triumph at Miss Dorcas
none	none	 but I would not acquiesce in the dowager s abusing my concession to the prejudice of that beautiful and daring young lady I mean Lady Chelford 
5682-32875-0026	train-other-500	in deference to you who are not aware as Miss Brandon is that I am one of mister Wylder s oldest and most intimate friends and at his request and with Lord Chelford s approval
none	none	 have been advised with in detail upon all the arrangements connected with the approaching marriage I am not going at present to say any more upon these subjects because Lady Chelford prefers deferring our conversation said this very odd young lady 
5682-32875-0027	train-other-500	but there is nothing which either she or I may say which I wish to conceal from any friend of mister Wylder s The idea of Miss Brandon s seriously thinking of withdrawing from her engagement with Mark Wylder I confess never entered my mind
none	none	 Lady Chelford perhaps knew more of the capricious and daring character of the ladies of the Brandon line than I and may have discovered some signs of a coming storm in the oracular questions which had fallen so harmoniously from those beautiful lips As for me I was puzzled The old viscountess was flushed she did not rouge and very angry and I think uncomfortable though she affected her usual supremacy 
5682-32875-0028	train-other-500	But the young lady showed no sign of excitement and lay back in her chair in her usual deep cold calm Lake s late smoking with Wylder must have disagreed with him very much indeed
none	none	 for he seemed 
5682-32875-0029	train-other-500	more out of sorts as night approached He stole away from mister Larkin s trellised porch in the dusk He marched into the town rather quickly like a man who has business on his hands
5682-32875-0030	train-other-500	but he had none for he walked by the Brandon Arms and halted and stared at the post office as if he fancied he had something to say there But no there was no need to tap at the wooden window pane
5682-32875-0031	train-other-500	Some idle boys were observing the dandy captain and he turned down
none	none	 the short lane that opened 
5682-32875-0032	train-other-500	on the common and sauntered upon the short grass
none	none	 Two or three groups and an invalid visitor 
5682-32875-0033	train-other-500	or two for Gylingden boasts a spa were lounging away the twilight half hours there He seated himself on one of the rustic seats and his yellow eyes wandered restlessly and vaguely
none	none	 along the outline of the beautiful hills 
5682-32875-0034	train-other-500	Then for nearly ten minutes he smoked an odd recreation for a man suffering from the cigars of last night and after that for nearly as long again he seemed lost in deep thought his eyes upon the misty grass before him and his small French
5682-32875-0035	train-other-500	boot beating time to the music of his thoughts Several groups passed close by him in their pleasant circuit Some wondered what might be the disease of that pale peevish looking gentleman who sat there so still
5682-32875-0036	train-other-500	languid and dejected Others set him down as a gentleman in difficulties of some sort who was using Gylingden for a temporary refuge Others again supposed he might be that Major Craddock
5682-32875-0037	train-other-500	who had lost thirty thousand pounds on Vanderdecken the other day
none	none	 Others knew he was staying with mister Larkin and supposed he was trying to raise money 
5682-32875-0038	train-other-500	at disadvantage and remarked that some of mister Larkin s clients looked always unhappy though they had so godly an attorney to deal with When Lake with a little shudder for it was growing chill
5682-32875-0039	train-other-500	lifted up his yellow eyes suddenly and recollected where he was the common had grown dark and was quite deserted
none	none	 There were lights in the windows of the reading room 
5682-32875-0040	train-other-500	and in the billiard room beneath it and shadowy figures with cues in their hands gliding hither and thither across its uncurtained windows With a shrug and a stealthy glance round him
5682-32875-0041	train-other-500	Captain Lake started up The instinct
none	none	 of the lonely and gloomy man unconsciously drew him towards the light and he approached A bat attracted thither like himself was flitting and flickering this way and that across the casement Captain Lake waiting with his hand on the door handle for the stroke heard the smack of the balls 
5682-32875-0042	train-other-500	and the score called by the marker and entered the hot glaring room Old Major Jackson with his glass in his eye was contending in his shirt sleeves heroically with a Manchester bag man who was palpably too much for him
5682-32875-0043	train-other-500	The double chinned and florid proprietor of the Brandon Arms with a brandy and water familiarity offered Captain Lake two
none	none	 to one on the game in anything he liked which the captain declined and took his seat on the bench He was not interested by the struggle of the gallant major who smiled like a prize fighter under his punishment In fact he could not have told the score at any point of the game and to judge by his face was translated from the glare of that arena into a dark and splenetic world of his own When he wakened up in the buzz 
5682-32875-0044	train-other-500	and clack of tongues that followed the close of the game Captain Lake glared round for a moment like a man called up from sleep the noise rattled and roared in his ears the talk sounded madly and the faces of the people excited and menaced
5682-32875-0045	train-other-500	him undefinably and he felt as if he was on the point of starting to his feet and stamping and shouting The fact is I suppose he was confoundedly nervous
5682-32875-0046	train-other-500	dyspeptic or whatever else it might be and the heat and glare were too much for him So out he went into the chill fresh night air and round the corner into the quaint main street of Gylingden and walked down
none	none	 it in the dark nearly to the last house by the corner of the Redman s Dell road 
5682-32875-0047	train-other-500	and then back again and so on trying to tire himself I think and every time he walked down the street with his face toward London his yellow eyes gleamed through the dark air with the fixed gaze of a man looking out for the appearance of a vehicle
5682-32875-0048	train-other-500	It perhaps indicated an anxiety and a mental look out in that direction for he really expected no such thing
none	none	 Then he dropped into the Brandon Arms and had a glass of brandy and water 
5682-32875-0049	train-other-500	and a newspaper in the coffee room
none	none	 and then he ordered a fly and drove in it to Lawyer Larkin s house The 
5682-32875-0050	train-other-500	Lodge it was called and entered mister Larkin s drawing room very cheerfully How quiet you are here said the captain I have been awfully dissipated since I saw you In an innocent way my dear Captain Lake you mean of course in an innocent way
none	none	 Oh no billiards I assure you Do you play Oh dear no not that I see any essential harm in the game as a game for those I mean who don t object to that sort of thing 
5682-32875-0051	train-other-500	but for a resident here putting aside other feelings a resident holding a position it would not do I assure you There are people there whom one could not associate with comfortably I don t care I hope how poor a man may be
none	none	 but do let him be a gentleman I own to that prejudice A man my dear Captain Lake whose father before him has been a gentleman old Larkin while in the flesh was an organist and kept a small day school at Dwiddleston 
5682-32875-0052	train-other-500	and his grandfather he did not care to enquire after and who has had the education of one does not feel himself at home you know I m sure you have felt the same sort of thing yourself Oh of course
5682-32875-0053	train-other-500	and I had such a nice walk on the common first and then a turn up and down before the Brandon Arms where at last I read a paper and could not resist a glass of brandy and water and growing lazy came home in a fly
5682-32875-0054	train-other-500	so I think I have had a very gay evening Larkin smiled
none	none	 benignantly and would have said something no doubt worth hearing but at that moment the door opened and his old cook and elderly parlour maid no breath of scandal ever troubled the serene fair fame of his household and everyone allowed that in the prudential virtues at least he was nearly perfect and Sleddon the groom walked in with those sad faces which I suppose were first learned in the belief that they were acceptable to their master Oh said mister Larkin in a low reverential tone and the smile vanished prayers 
5682-32875-0055	train-other-500	Well then if you permit me being a little tired I ll go to my bed room With a grave and affectionate interest mister Larkin looked in his face and sighed a little and said Might I perhaps venture to beg just this one night
5682-32875-0056	train-other-500	That chastened and entreating look it was hard to resist But somehow the whole thing seemed to Lake to say Do allow me this once to prescribe do give your poor soul this one chance and Lake answered him
none	none	 superciliously and irreverently No thank you no any prayers I require I can manage for myself thank you Good night And he lighted a bed room candle and left the room What a beast that fellow is I don t know why the d I stay in his house One reason was perhaps that it saved him nearly a guinea a day and he may have had some other little reasons just then Family prayers indeed and such a pair of women witches by Jove and that rascally groom and a hypocritical attorney And the vulgar brute will be as rich as Croesus I dare say Here soliloquised Stanley Lake in that gentleman s ordinary vein His momentary disgust had restored him for a few seconds to his normal self But certain anxieties of a rather ghastly kind and speculations as to what might be going on in London just then were round him again like armed giants in another moment and the riches or hypocrisy of his host were no more to him than those of Overreach or Tartuffe CHAPTER XXI IN WHICH CAPTAIN LAKE VISITS HIS SISTER S SICK BED I suspect there are very few mere hypocrites on earth Of course I do not reckon those 
5682-32876-0001	train-other-500	who are under compulsion to affect purity of manners and a holy integrity of heart and there are such but those who volunteer an extraordinary profession of holiness being all the while conscious villains The Pharisees
none	none	 even while devouring widows houses believed honestly in their own supreme righteousness I am afraid our friend Jos Larkin 
5682-32876-0002	train-other-500	wore a mask I am sure he often wore it when he was quite alone I don t know indeed that he ever took it off He was perhaps content to see it even when he looked in the glass and had not a very
5682-32876-0003	train-other-500	distinct idea what the underlying features might be It answers with the world it almost answers with himself Pity it won t do everywhere When Moses went to speak with God says the admirable Hall
5682-32876-0004	train-other-500	he pulled off his veil It was good reason he should present to God that face which he had made There had been more need of his veil to hide the glorious face of God from him than to hide his from God
5682-32876-0005	train-other-500	Hypocrites are contrary to Moses He showed his worst to men his best to God they show their best to men their worst to God but God sees both their veil and their face and I know not whether He more hates their veil
none	none	 of dissimulation or their face of wickedness Captain Lake wanted rest sleep quiet thoughts at all events When he was alone he was at once in a state of fever and gloom and seemed always watching for something 
5682-32876-0006	train-other-500	His strange eyes glanced now this way now that with a fierce restlessness now to the window now to the door and you would have said he was listening intently to some
none	none	 indistinct and too distant conversation affecting him vitally there was such a look of fear and conjecture always in his face He bolted his door and unlocked his dressing case and from a little silver box in that glittering repository he took 
5682-32876-0007	train-other-500	one after the other two or three little wafers of a dark hue and placed them successively on his tongue and suffered them to melt and so swallowed them
none	none	 They were not liquorice I am afraid Captain Lake dabbled 
5682-32876-0008	train-other-500	a little in opium He was not a great adept yet at least like those gentlemen who can swallow five hundred drops of laudanum at a sitting But he knew the virtues of the drug and cultivated its acquaintance
5682-32876-0009	train-other-500	and was oftener under its influence than perhaps any mortal except himself suspected
none	none	 The greater part of mankind are upon the whole happier and more cheerful than they are always willing to allow Nature subserves the majority She smiled very brightly next morning 
5682-32876-0010	train-other-500	There was a twittering of small birds among the brown leaves and ivy and a thousand other pleasant sounds and sights stirring in the sharp sunny air This sort of inflexible merry making
none	none	 in nature seems marvellously selfish 
5682-32876-0011	train-other-500	in the eyes of anxious Captain Lake Fear hath torment and fear is the worst ingredient in mental pain This is the reason why suspense is so intolerable and the retrospect even of the worst less terrible
none	none	 Stanley Lake would have given more than he could well afford that it were that day week and he no worse off 
5682-32876-0012	train-other-500	Why did time limp so tediously away with him prolonging his anguish gratuitously He felt truculently
none	none	 and would have murdered that week if he could in the midst of its loitering sunshine and gaiety There was a strange pain at his heart and the pain of intense and fruitless calculation in his brain and as the Mahometan prays towards Mecca and the Jew towards Jerusalem so Captain Lake s morning orisons whatsoever they were were offered at the window of his bed room toward London from whence he looked for his salvation or it might be the other thing 
5682-32876-0013	train-other-500	with a dreadful yearning He hated the fresh glitter of that morning scene Why should the world be cheerful It was a repast spread of which he could not partake and it spited him
none	none	 Yes it was selfish and hating selfishness he would have struck the sun out of the sky that morning 
5682-32876-0014	train-other-500	with his walking cane if he could and draped the world in black He saw from his window the
none	none	 good vicar walk smiling by 
5682-32876-0015	train-other-500	in white choker and seedy black
none	none	 his little boy holding by his fingers and capering and wheeling in front and smiling up in his face 
5682-32876-0016	train-other-500	They were very busy talking Little Fairy used to walk when parochial visits were not very distant
5682-32876-0017	train-other-500	with his Wapsie how that name came about no one remembered but the vicar answered to it more cheerily than to any other The little man was solitary and these rambles were a delight A beautiful smiling little fellow very exacting
none	none	 of attention troublesome perhaps he was so sociable and needed sympathy and companionship and repaid it with a boundless sensitive love The vicar told him the stories of David and Goliath and Joseph and his brethren and of the wondrous birth in Bethlehem of Judea the star 
5682-32876-0018	train-other-500	that led the Wise Men and the celestial song heard by the shepherds keeping their flocks by night and snatches of Pilgrim s Progress and sometimes when they made a feast and eat their pennyworth of cherries sitting on the style he treated him
5682-32876-0019	train-other-500	I am afraid to the profane histories of Jack the Giant killer and the Yellow Dwarf the vicar had theories about imagination and fancied it was an important faculty and that the Creator had not given children their
5682-32876-0020	train-other-500	unextinguishable love of stories to no purpose I don t envy the man who is superior to the society of children What can he gain from children s talk Is it witty or wise or learned Be frank Is it not
5682-32876-0021	train-other-500	honestly a mere noise and interruption a musical cackling of geese and silvery braying of tiny asses Well say I out of my large acquaintance there are not many men to whom I would go for wisdom
5682-32876-0022	train-other-500	learning is better found in books and as for wit is it always pleasant The most companionable men are not always the greatest intellects They laugh and though they don t converse
none	none	 they make a cheerful noise and show a cheerful countenance 
5682-32876-0023	train-other-500	There was not a great deal in Will Honeycomb for instance but our dear mister Spectator tells us somewhere that he laughed easily which I think quite accounts for his acceptance with the club He was kindly and enjoying
5682-32876-0024	train-other-500	What is it that makes your dog so charming a companion in your walks Simply that he thoroughly likes you and enjoys himself He appeals imperceptibly to your affections which cannot be stirred
5682-32876-0025	train-other-500	such is God s will ever so lightly without some little thrillings of happiness and through the subtle absorbents of your sympathy he infuses into you something of his own hilarious and exulting spirit When Stanley Lake saw the vicar
5682-32876-0026	train-other-500	the lines of his pale face contracted strangely and his wild gaze followed him and I don t think he breathed once until the thin smiling man
none	none	 in black with the little gambolling 
5682-32876-0027	train-other-500	bright boy holding by his hand had passed by
none	none	 He was thinking you may be sure of his Brother Mark When Lake had ended his toilet and stared in the glass he still looked so haggard 
5682-32876-0028	train-other-500	that on greeting mister Larkin in the parlour he thought it necessary to mention that he had taken cold in that confounded billiard room last night which spoiled his sleep and made him awfully seedy that morning Of course his host was properly afflicted and sympathetic
5682-32876-0029	train-other-500	By the bye I had a letter this morning from that party our common friend mister W you know said Larkin gracefully Well what is he doing and when does he come back You mean Wylder of course
5682-32876-0030	train-other-500	Yes my good client mister Mark Wylder Permit me to assist you to some honey you ll find it remarkably good I venture to say it comes from the gardens of Queen s Audley The late marquis you know prided himself on his honey
none	none	 and my friend Thornbury cousin to Sir Frederick Thornbury I suppose you know him an East Indian judge you know very kindly left it at Dollington for me on his way to the Earl of Epsom s Thank you delicious I m sure it has been in such good company May I see Wylder s note that is if there s no private business 
5682-32876-0031	train-other-500	Oh certainly And with Wylder s great red seal on the back of the envelope the letter ran thus DEAR LARKIN I write in haste to save post to say I shall be detained in town a few days longer than I thought
5682-32876-0032	train-other-500	Don t wait for me about the parchments I am satisfied If anything crosses your mind a word with mister De C at the Hall will clear all up Have all ready to sign and seal when I come back
none	none	 certainly within a week Yours sincerely M WYLDER London 
5682-32876-0033	train-other-500	It was evidently written in great haste with the broad nibbed pen he liked but notwithstanding the sort of swagger with which the writing marched across the page Lake might have seen here and there a little quaver indicative of something different from haste
5682-32876-0034	train-other-500	the vibrations of another sort of flurry Certainly within a week he writes Does he mean he ll be here in a week or only to have the papers ready in a week asked Lake The question certainly does arise It struck me on the first
5682-32876-0035	train-other-500	perusal answered the attorney His address is rather a wide one too London
none	none	 Do you know his club Captain Lake 
5682-32876-0036	train-other-500	The Wanderers He has left the United Service Nothing for me by the way No letter No
none	none	 Tant mieux 
5682-32876-0037	train-other-500	I hate them said the captain I wonder how my sister is this morning Would you like a messenger I ll send down with pleasure to enquire Thank you no I ll walk down and see her And Lake yawned at the window
5682-32876-0038	train-other-500	and then took his hat and stick and sauntered toward Gylingden At the post office window he tapped with the silver tip of his cane and told Miss Driver with a sleepy smile
5682-32876-0039	train-other-500	I m going down to Redman s Farm and any letters for my sister Miss Lake I may as well take with me Everybody in business in the town of Gylingden
none	none	 by this time knew Captain Lake and his belongings 
5682-32876-0040	train-other-500	a most respectable party a high man and of course there was no difficulty There was only one letter the address was written
none	none	 Miss Lake Redman s Farm near Brandon Park Gylingden in a stiff hand rather slanting backwards Captain Lake put it in his paletot pocket looked in her face gently and smiled and thanked her in his graceful way 
5682-32876-0041	train-other-500	and in fact left an enduring impression upon that impressible nature Turning up the dark road at Redman s Dell the gallant captain passed the old mill and all being quiet up and down the road he halted
5682-32876-0042	train-other-500	under the lordly shadow of a clump of chestnuts and opened and read the letter
none	none	 he had just taken charge of 
5682-32876-0043	train-other-500	It contained only these words Wednesday On Friday night next at half past twelve This he read twice or thrice pausing between whiles The envelope bore the London postmark
5682-32876-0044	train-other-500	Then he took out his cigar case selected a promising weed and wrapping the laconic note prettily round one of his scented matches lighted it and the note flamed pale in the daylight and dropped
5682-32876-0045	train-other-500	still blazing at the root of the old tree he stood by and sent up a little curl of blue smoke an incense to the demon of the wood and turned in a minute more into a black film overrun by a hundred creeping sparkles
5682-32876-0046	train-other-500	and having completed his mysterious incremation he with his yellow eyes made a stolen glance around and lighting his cigar glided gracefully up the steep road under the solemn canopy of old timber to the sound of the moaning stream below
none	none	 and the rustle of withered leaves about him toward Redman s Farm As he entered the flower garden the jaundiced face of old Tamar with its thousand small wrinkles and its ominous gleam of suspicion was looking out from the darkened porch The white cap kerchief and drapery courtesied to him as he drew near and the dismal face changed not Well Tamar how do you do 
5682-32876-0047	train-other-500	how are all Where is that girl Margery In the kitchen Master Stanley said she courtesying again Are you sure said Captain Lake peeping toward that apartment over the old woman s shoulder Certain sure Master Stanley
none	none	 Well come up stairs to your mistress s room said Lake mounting the stairs with his hat in his hand and on tip toe like a man approaching a sick chamber There was something I think grim and spectral in this 
5682-32876-0048	train-other-500	ceremonious ascent to the empty chamber Children had once occupied that silent floor for there was a little balustraded gate across the top of the staircase
5682-32876-0049	train-other-500	I keep this closed said old Tamar and forbid her to cross it lest she should disturb the mistress Heaven forgive me Very good he whispered and he peeped over the banister and then entered Rachel s silent room darkened with closed shutters
5682-32876-0050	train-other-500	the white curtains and white coverlet so like the dark chamber of white death He had intended speaking to Tamar there but changed his mind or rather could not make up his mind and he loitered silently and stood with the curtain
5682-32876-0051	train-other-500	in his gloved hand looking upon the cold coverlet as if Rachel lay dead there That will do he said awaking from his wandering thought We ll go down now Tamar
none	none	 And in the same stealthy way 
5682-32876-0052	train-other-500	walking lightly and slowly down the stairs they went and Stanley entered the kitchen How do you do Margery You ll be glad to hear your mistress is better You must run down to the town though and buy some jelly and you are to bring her back
none	none	 change of this And he placed 
5682-32876-0053	train-other-500	half a crown in her hand Put on your bonnet and my old shawl child and take the basket
none	none	 and come back by the side door croaked old Tamar So the girl dried her hands she was washing the teacups and in a twinkling was equipped and on her way to Gylingden CHAPTER XXII IN WHICH CAPTAIN LAKE MEETS A FRIEND NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE 
5682-32877-0000	train-other-500	Lake had no very high opinion of men or women gentle or simple She listens I dare say the little spy said he No Master Stanley She s a good little girl
none	none	 She quite believes her mistress is up stairs eh 
5682-32877-0001	train-other-500	Yes the Lord forgive me I m deceiving her He did not like the tone and look which accompanied this Now my good old Tamar you really can t be such an idiot as to fancy
none	none	 there can be any imaginable wrong in keeping that prying little slut in ignorance 
5682-32877-0002	train-other-500	of that which in no wise concerns her This is a critical matter do you see and if it were known in this place that your young mistress had gone away as she has done though quite innocently upon my honour I think it would blast her
none	none	 You would not like for a stupid 
5682-32877-0003	train-other-500	crotchet to ruin poor Radie I fancy I m doing just what you both bid me said the old woman You sit up stairs chiefly She nodded sadly And keep the hall door shut and bolted
5682-32877-0004	train-other-500	Again she nodded I m going up to the Hall and I ll tell them she s much better and that I ve been in her room and that perhaps she may go up to see them in the morning Old Tamar shook her head and groaned How long
5682-32877-0005	train-other-500	is all this to go on for Master Stanley Why d you Tamar can t you listen he said clutching her wrist in his lavender kid grasp rather roughly How long a very short time I tell you
5682-32877-0006	train-other-500	She ll be home immediately I ll come to morrow and tell you exactly maybe to morrow evening will that do And should they call you must say the same and if Miss Dorcas Miss Brandon you know should wish to go up to see her tell her she s asleep
none	none	 Stop that hypocritical grimacing will you It is no part of your duty to tell the world what can t possibly concern them and may bring your young mistress to perdition That does not strike me as any part of your religion 
5682-32877-0007	train-other-500	Tamar groaned again and she said I opened my Bible Lord help me three times to day Master Stanley and could not go on It s no use I can t read it Time enough I think you ve read more than is good for you I think you are half mad Tamar
5682-32877-0008	train-other-500	but think what you may it must be done Have not you read of straining at gnats and swallowing camels You used not I ve heard to be always so scrupulous old Tamar There was a vile sarcasm in his tone and look
5682-32877-0009	train-other-500	It is not for the child I nursed to say that said Tamar There were scandalous stories of wicked old Tiberius bankrupt dead and buried compromising the fame of Tamar not always a spectacled and cadaverous student of Holy Writ
5682-32877-0010	train-other-500	These indeed were even in Stanley s childhood old world hazy traditions of the servants hall But boys hear often more than is good and more than gospel who live in such houses as old General Lake the old millionaire widower kept
5682-32877-0011	train-other-500	I did not mean anything upon my honour Tamar that could annoy you I only meant you used not to be a fool and pray don t begin now for I assure you Radie and I would not ask it if it could be avoided
none	none	 You have Miss Radie s secret in your hands I don t think you d like to injure her and you used to be trustworthy 
5682-32877-0012	train-other-500	I don t think your Bible teaches you anywhere to hurt your neighbour and to break faith Don t speak of the Bible now but you needn t fear me Master Stanley answered the old woman a little sternly
none	none	 I don t know why she s gone nor why it s a secret I don t and I d rather not 
5682-32877-0013	train-other-500	Poor Miss Radie she never heard anything but what was good from old Tamar whatever I might ha bin myself miserable sinners are we all and I ll do as you bid me and I have done Master Stanley
none	none	 howsoever it troubles my mind and now old Tamar s words spoke that s all Old Tamar is a sensible creature as she always was I hope I did not vex you Tamar I did not mean I assure you 
5682-32877-0014	train-other-500	but we get rough ways in the army I m afraid and you won t mind me You never did mind little Stannie when he was naughty you know There was here a little subsidence in his speech
none	none	 He was thinking of giving her a crown 
5682-32877-0015	train-other-500	but there were several reasons against it so that handsome coin remained in his purse And I forgot to tell you Tamar I ve a ring for you in town a little souvenir you ll think it pretty a gold ring with a stone in it
5682-32877-0016	train-other-500	it belonged to poor dear Aunt Jemima you remember I left it behind so stupid
none	none	 So he shook hands with old Tamar and patted her affectionately on the shoulder and he said Keep the hall door bolted Make any excuse you like only it would not do for anyone to open it and run up to the room as they might so don t forget to secure the door when I go I think that is all Ta ta dear Tamar I ll see you in the morning 
5682-32877-0017	train-other-500	As he walked down the mill road toward the town he met Lord Chelford on his way to make enquiry about Rachel at Redman s Farm and Lake who as we know had just seen his sister gave him all particulars Chelford like the lawyer
5682-32877-0018	train-other-500	had heard from Mark Wylder that morning a few lines postponing his return He merely mentioned it and made no comment but Lake perceived that he was annoyed at his unexplained absence Lake dined at Brandon that evening and though looking ill was
5682-32877-0019	train-other-500	very good company and promised to bring an early report of Rachel s convalescence in the morning I have little to record of next day except that Larkin received another London letter Wylder plainly wrote in great haste and merely said I shall have to wait a day or
5682-32877-0020	train-other-500	two longer than I yesterday thought to meet a fellow from whom I am to receive something of importance rather as I think to me Get the deeds ready as I said in my last If I am not in Gylingden by Monday we must put off the wedding for a week later
none	none	 there is no help for it You need not talk of this I write to Chelford to say the same 
5682-32877-0021	train-other-500	This note was as unceremonious and still shorter Lord Chelford would have written at once to remonstrate with Mark on the unseemliness of putting off his marriage so capriciously or at all events so mysteriously
5682-32877-0022	train-other-500	Miss Brandon not being considered nor her friends consulted But Mark had a decided objection to many letters he had no fancy to be worried when he had made up his mind by prosy remonstrances and he shut out the whole
none	none	 tribe of letter writers by simply omitting to give them his address His cool impertinence and especially this cunning precaution incensed old Lady Chelford She would have liked to write him one of those terse courteous biting notes for which she was famous and her fingers morally tingled to box his ears But what was to be done with mere London 
5682-32877-0023	train-other-500	Wylder was hidden from mortal sight like a heaven protected hero in the Iliad and a cloud of invisibility girdled him Like most rustic communities Gylingden and its neighbourhood were early in bed Few lights burned after half past ten and the whole vicinity
5682-32877-0024	train-other-500	was deep in its slumbers before twelve o clock At that dread hour Captain Lake about a mile on the Dollington which was the old London road from Gylingden was pacing backward and forward under the towering files of beech that overarch it at that point
5682-32877-0025	train-other-500	The White House public with a wide panel over its door presenting in tints subdued by time a stage coach and four horses in mid career lay a few hundred yards nearer to Gylingden
none	none	 Not a soul was stirring not a sound but those sad and soothing 
5682-32877-0026	train-other-500	of nature was to be heard Stanley Lake did not like waiting any more than did Louis
none	none	 XIV He was really a little tired 
5682-32877-0027	train-other-500	of acting sentry and was very peevish by the time the ring of wheels and horse hoofs approaching from the London direction became audible Even so he had a longer wait than he expected
none	none	 sounds are heard so far by night At last however it drew nearer nearer quite close and a sort of nondescript vehicle one horsed loomed in the dark and he calls 
5682-32877-0028	train-other-500	Hallo there I say a passenger for the White House
none	none	 At the same moment a window of the cab shall we call it was let down and a female voice Rachel Lake s called to the driver to stop Lake addressed the driver You come from Johnson s Hotel don t you at Dollington Yes Sir 
5682-32877-0029	train-other-500	Well I ll pay you half fare to bring me there All right Sir But the oss Sir must av is oats fust Feed him here then They are all asleep in the White House
none	none	 I ll be with you in five minutes and you shall have something for yourself when we get into Dollington Stanley opened the door She placed her hand on his and stepped to the ground It was very dark under those great trees He held her hand a little harder than was his wont All quite well ever since You are not very tired are you I m afraid it will be necessary for you to walk to Redman s Farm dear Radie but it is hardly a mile I think for you see the fellow 
5682-32877-0030	train-other-500	must not know who you are and I must go back with him
none	none	 for I have not been very well 
5682-32877-0031	train-other-500	indeed I ve been I may say very ill and I told that fellow Larkin who has his eyes about him and would wonder what kept me out so late that I would run down to some of the places near for a change and sleep a night there
none	none	 and that s the reason dear Radie I can walk only a short way with you but you are not afraid to walk a part of the way home without me You are so sensible 
5682-32877-0032	train-other-500	and you have been really so very kind I assure you I appreciate it Radie I do indeed and I m very grateful I am upon my word
none	none	 Rachel answered with a heavy sigh CHAPTER XXIII HOW RACHEL SLEPT THAT NIGHT IN REDMAN S FARM Allow me pray do and he took her little bag from her hand I hope you are not very tired darling you ve been so very good and you re not afraid you know the place is so quiet of the little walk by yourself Take my arm I ll go as far as I can but it is very late you know and you are sure you are not afraid I ought to be afraid of nothing now Stanley but I think I am afraid of everything Merely a little nervous it s nothing I ve been wretchedly since myself but I m so glad you are home again you shall have no more trouble I assure you and not a creature suspects you have been from home Old Tamar has behaved admirably Rachel sighed again and said Yes poor Tamar And now dear I m afraid I must leave you I m very sorry but you see how it is keep to the shady side close by the hedge where the trees stop but I m certain you will meet no one Tamar will tell you who has called hardly anyone I saw them myself every day at Brandon and told them you were ill You ve been very kind Radie I assure you I ll never forget it You ll find Tamar up and watching for you I arranged all that and I need not say you ll be very careful not to let that girl of yours hear anything You ll be very quiet she suspects nothing and I assure you so far as personal annoyance of any kind is concerned you may be perfectly at ease Good night Radie God bless you dear I wish very much I could see you all the way but there s a risk in it you know Good night dear Radie By the bye here s your bag I ll take the rug it s too heavy for you and I may as well have it to Dollington He kissed her cheek in his slight way and left her and was soon on his way to Dollington where he slept that night rather more comfortably than he had done since Rachel s departure Rachel walked on swiftly Very tired but not at all sleepy on the contrary excited and nervous and rather relieved notwithstanding that Stanley had left her to walk home alone It seemed to her that more than a month had passed since she saw the mill road last How much had happened how awful was the change Familiar objects glided past her the same yet the fashion of the countenance was altered there was something estranged and threatening The pretty parsonage was now close by in the dews of night the spirit of peace and slumbers smiled over it but the sight of its steep roof and homely chimney stacks smote with a shock at her brain and heart a troubled moan escaped her She looked up with the instinct of prayer and clasped her hands on the handle of that little bag which had made the mysterious journey with her a load which no man could lift lay upon her heart Then she commenced her dark walk up the mill road her hands still clasped her lips moving in broken appeals to Heaven She looked neither to the right nor to the left but passed on with inflexible gaze and hasty steps like one who crosses a plank over some awful chasm In such darkness Redman s dell was a solemn not to say an awful spot and at any time I think Rachel in a like solitude and darkness would have been glad to see the red glimmer of old Tamar s candle proclaiming under the branches the neighbourhood of human life and sympathy The old woman with her shawl over her head sat listening for her young mistress s approach on the little side bench in the trellised porch and tottered hastily forth to meet her at the garden wicket whispering forlorn welcomes and thanksgivings which Rachel answered only with a kiss Safe safe at home Thank Heaven at least for that Secluded once more hidden in Redman s Dell but never again to be the same the careless mind no more The summer sunshine through the trees the leafy songs of birds obscured in the smoke and drowned in the discord of an untold and everlasting trouble The hall door was now shut and bolted Wise old Tamar had turned the key upon the sleeping girl There was nothing to be feared from prying eyes and listening ears You are cold Miss Radie and tired poor thing I lit a bit of fire in your room Miss would you like me to go up stairs with you Miss Come And so up stairs they went and the young lady looked round with a strange anxiety like a person seeking for something and forgetting what and sitting down she leaned her head on her hand with a moan the living picture of despair You ve a headache Miss Radie said the old woman standing by her with that painful enquiry which sat naturally on her face A heartache Tamar Let me help you off with these things Miss Radie dear The young lady did not seem to hear but she allowed Tamar to remove her cloak and hat and handkerchief The old servant had placed the tea things on the table and what remained of that wine of which Stanley had partaken on the night from which the eclipse of Rachel s life dated So without troubling her with questions she made tea and then some negus with careful and trembling hands No said Rachel a little pettishly and put it aside See now Miss Radie dear You look awful sick and tired You are tired to death and pale and sorry my dear child and to please old Tamar you ll just drink this Thank you Tamar I believe you are right The truth was she needed it and in the same dejected way she sipped it slowly and then there was a long silence the silence of a fatigue like that of fever near which sleep refuses to come But she sat in that waking lethargy in which are sluggish dreams of horror and neither eyes nor ears for that which is before us When at last with another great sigh she lifted her head her eyes rested on old Tamar s face at the other side of the fire place with a dark dull surprise and puzzle for a moment as if she could not tell why she was there or where the place was and then rising up with piteous look in her old nurse s face she said Oh Tamar Tamar It is a dreadful world So it is Miss Radie answered the old woman her glittering eyes returning her sad gaze wofully Aye so it is sure and such it was and will be For so the Scripture says Cursed is the ground for thy sake hard to the body a vale of tears dark to the spirit But it is the hand of God that is upon you and like me you will say at last It is good for me that I have been in trouble Lie down dear Miss Radie and I ll read to you the blessed words of comfort that have been sealed for me ever since I saw you last They have but that s over And she turned up her pallid puckered face and with a trembling and knotted pair of hands uplifted she muttered an awful thanksgiving Rachel said nothing but her eyes rested on the floor and with the quiet obedience of her early childhood she did as Tamar said And the old woman assisted her to undress and so she lay down with a sigh in her bed And Tamar her round spectacles by this time on her nose sitting at the little table by her pillow read in a solemn and somewhat quavering voice such comfortable passages as came first to memory Rachel cried quietly as she listened and at last worn out by many feverish nights and the fatigues of her journey she fell into a disturbed slumber with many startings and sudden wakings with cries and strange excitement Old Tamar would not leave her but kept her seat in the high backed arm chair throughout the night like a nurse as indeed she was in a sick chamber And so that weary night limped tediously away and morning dawned and tipped the discoloured foliage of the glen with its glow awaking the songs of all the birds and dispersing the white mists of darkness And Rachel with a start awoke and sat up with a wild look and a cry What is it Nothing dear Miss Radie only poor old Tamar And a new day had begun CHAPTER XXIV DORCAS BRANDON PAYS RACHEL A VISIT It was not very much past eleven that morning when the pony carriage from Brandon drew up before the little garden wicket of Redman s Farm The servant held the ponies heads and Miss Dorcas passed through the little garden and met old Tamar in the porch Better to day Tamar enquired this grand and beautiful young lady The sun glimmered through the boughs behind her her face was in shade and its delicate chiselling was brought out in soft reflected lights and old Tamar looked on her in a sort of wonder her beauty seemed so celestial and splendid Well she was better though she had had a bad night She was up and dressed and this moment coming down and would be very happy to see Miss Brandon if she would step into the drawing room Miss Brandon took old Tamar s hand gently and pressed it I suppose she was glad and took this way of showing it and tall beautiful graceful in rustling silks she glided into the tiny drawing room silently and sate down softly by the window looking out upon the flowers and the falling leaves mottled in light and shadow We have been accustomed to see another girl bright and fair haired Rachel Lake in the small rooms of Redman s Farm but Dorcas only in rich and stately Brandon Hall the beautiful genius loci under lofty ceilings curiously moulded in the first James s style amid carved oak and richest draperies tall china vases paintings and cold white statues and somehow in this low roofed room so small and homely she looks like a displaced divinity an exile under Juno s jealousy from the cloudy splendours of Olympus dazzlingly melancholy and humano major among the meannesses and trumperies of earth So there came a step and a little rustling of feminine draperies the small door opened and Rachel entered with her hand extended and a pale smile of welcome Women can hide their pain better than we men and bear it better too except when shame drops fire into the dreadful chalice But poor Rachel Lake had more than that stoical hypocrisy which enables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile She was sanguine she was genial and companionable and her spirits rose at the sight of a friendly face This transient spring and lighting up are beautiful a glamour beguiling our senses It wakens up the frozen spirit of enjoyment and leads the sad faculties forth on a wild forgetful frolic Rachel dear I m so glad to see you said Dorcas placing her arms gently about her neck and kissing her twice or thrice There was something of sweetness and fondness in her tones and manner which was new to Rachel and comforting and she returned the greeting as kindly and felt more like her former self You have been more ill than I thought darling and you are still far from quite recovered Rachel s pale and sharpened features and dilated eye struck her with a painful surprise I shall soon be as well as I am ever likely to be that is quite well answered Rachel You have been very kind I ve heard of your coming here and sending so often They sat down side by side and Dorcas held her hand Maybe Rachel dear you would like to drive a little No darling not yet it is very good of you You have been so ill my poor Rachel Ill and troubled dear troubled in mind and miserably nervous Poor Rachel her nature recoiled from deceit and she told at all events as much of the truth as she dared Dorcas s large eyes rested upon her with a grave enquiry and then Miss Brandon looked down in silence for a while on the carpet and was thinking a little sternly maybe and with a look of pain still holding Rachel s hand she said with a sad sort of reproach in her tone Rachel dear you have not told my secret No indeed Dorcas never and never will and I think though I have learned to fear death I would rather die than let Stanley even suspect it She spoke with a sudden energy which partook of fear and passion and flushed her thin cheek and made her languid eyes flash Thank you Rachel my Cousin Rachel my only friend I ought not to have doubted you and she kissed her again Chelford had a note from mister Wylder this morning another note his coming delayed and something of his having to see some person who is abroad continued Dorcas after a little pause You have heard of course of mister Wylder s absence Yes something everything said Rachel hurriedly looking frowningly at a flower which she was twirling in her fingers He chose an unlucky moment for his departure I meant to speak to him and end all between us and I would now write but there is no address to his letters I think Lady Chelford and her son begin to think there is more in this oddly timed journey of mister Wylder s than first appeared When I came into the parlour this morning I knew they were speaking of it If he does not return in a day or two Chelford I am sure will speak to me and then I shall tell him my resolution Yes said Rachel I don t understand his absence I think they are puzzled too Can you conjecture why he is gone Rachel made no answer but rose with a dreamy look as if gazing at some distant object among the dark masses of forest trees and stood before the window so looking across the tiny garden I don t think Rachel dear you heard me said Dorcas Can I conjecture why he is gone murmured Rachel still gazing with a wild kind of apathy into distance Can I What can it now be to you or me why Yes we sometimes conjecture right and sometimes wrong there are many things best not conjectured about at all some interesting some abominable some that pass all comprehension I never mean to conjecture if I can help it again And the wan oracle having spoken she sate down in the same sort of abstraction again beside Dorcas and she looked full in her cousin s eyes I made you a voluntary promise Dorcas and now you will make me one Of Mark Wylder I say this his name has been for years hateful to me and recently it has become frightful and you will promise me simply this that you will never ask me to speak again about him Be he near or be he far I regard his very name with horror Dorcas returned her gaze with one of haughty amazement and Rachel said Well Dorcas you promise You speak truly Rachel you have a right to my promise I give it Dorcas you are changed have I lost your love for asking so poor a kindness I m only disappointed Rachel I thought you would have trusted me as I did you It is an antipathy an antipathy I cannot get over dear Dorcas you may think it a madness but don t blame me Remember I am neither well nor happy and forgive what you cannot like in me I have very few to love me now and I thought you might love me as I have begun to love you Oh Dorcas darling don t forsake me I am very lonely here and my spirits are gone and I never needed kindness so much before And she threw her arms round her cousin s neck and brave Rachel at last burst into tears Dorcas in her strange way was moved I like you still Rachel I m sure I ll always like you You resemble me Rachel you are fearless and inflexible and generous That spirit belongs to the blood of our strange race all our women were so Yes Rachel I do love you I was wounded to find you had thoughts you would not trust to me but I have made the promise and I ll keep it and I love you all the same Thank you Dorcas dear I like to call you cousin kindred is so pleasant Thank you from my heart for your love you will never know perhaps how much it is to me The young queen looked on her kindly but sadly through her large strange eyes clouded with a presage of futurity and she kissed her again and said Rachel dear I have a plan for you and me we shall be old maids you and I and live together like the ladies of Llangollen careless and happy recluses I ll let Brandon and abdicate We will make a little tour together when all this shall have blown over in a few weeks and choose our retreat and with the winter s snow we ll vanish from Brandon and appear with the early flowers at our cottage among the beautiful woods and hills of Wales Will you come Rachel At sight of this castle or cottage in the air Rachel lighted up The little whim had something tranquillising and balmy It was escape flight from Gylingden flight from Brandon flight from Redman s Farm they and all their hated associations would be far behind and that awful page in her story not torn out indeed but gummed down as it were and no longer glaring and glowering in her eyes every moment of her waking life So she smiled upon the picture painted on the clouds it was the first thing that had interested her for days It was a hope She seized it she clung to it She knew perhaps it was the merest chimera but it rested and consoled her imagination and opened in the blackness of her sky one small vista through whose silvery edge the blue and stars of heaven were visible CHAPTER XXV CAPTAIN LAKE LOOKS IN AT NIGHTFALL In the queer little drawing room of Redman s Farm it was twilight so dense were the shadows from the great old chestnuts that surrounded it before the sun was well beneath the horizon and you could from its darkened window see its red beams still tinting the high grounds of Willerston visible through the stems of the old trees that were massed in the near foreground A figure which had lost its energy a face stamped with the lines and pallor of a dejection almost guilty with something of the fallen grace and beauty of poor Margaret as we see her with her forehead leaning on her slender hand by the stirless spinning wheel the image of a strange and ineffaceable sorrow sat Rachel Lake Tamar might glide in and out her mistress did not speak the shadows deepened round her but she did look up nor call in the old cheerful accents for lights No more roulades and ringing chords from the piano no more clear spirited tones of the lady s voice sounded through the low ceilings of Redman s Farm and thrilled with a haunting melody the deserted glen wherein the birds had ended their vesper songs and gone to rest A step was heard at the threshold it entered the hall the door of the little chamber opened and Stanley Lake entered saying in a doubtful almost timid way It is I Radie come to thank you and just to ask you how you do and to say I ll never forget your kindness upon my honour I never can Rachel shuddered as the door opened and there was a ghastly sort of expectation in her look Imperfectly as it was seen he could understand it She did not bid him welcome or even speak There was a silence Now you re not angry with me Radie dear I venture to say I suffer more than you and how could I have anticipated the strange turn things have taken You know how it all came about and you must see I m not really to blame at least in intention for all this miserable trouble and even if I were where s the good in angry feeling or reproaches now don t you see when I can t mend it Come Radie let by gones be by gones There s a good girl won t you Aye by gones are by gones the past is indeed immutable and the future is equally fixed and more dreadful Come Radie a clever girl like you can make your own future And what do you want of me now she asked with a fierce cold stare But I did not say I wanted anything Of course you do or I should not have seen you Mark me though I ll go no further in the long route of wickedness you seem to have marked out for me I m sacrificed it is true but I won t renew my hourly horrors and live under the rule of your diabolical selfishness Say what you will but keep your temper will you he answered more like his angry self But he checked the rising devil within him and changed his tone he did not want to quarrel quite the reverse I don t know really Radie why you should talk as you do I don t want you to do anything upon my honour I don t only just to exercise your common sense and you have lots of sense Radie Don t you think people have eyes to see and ears and tongues in this part of the world Don t you know very well in a small place like this they are all alive with curiosity and if you choose to make such a tragedy figure and keep moping and crying and all that sort of thing and look so funeste and miserable you ll be sure to fix attention and set the whole d d place speculating and gossiping and really Radie you re making mountains of mole hills It is because you live so solitary here and it is such a gloomy out o the way spot so awfully dark and damp nobody could be well here and you really must change It is the very temple of blue devilry and I assure you if I lived as you do I d cut my throat before a month you mustn t And old Tamar you know such a figure The very priestess of despair She gives me the horrors I assure you whenever I look at her you must not keep her she s of no earthly use poor old thing and you know Radie we re not rich enough you and I to support other people You must really place yourself more cheerfully and I ll speak to Chelford about Tamar There s a very nice place an asylum or something for old women near Dollington he was going to say but the associations were not pleasant near some of those little towns close to this and he s a visitor or governor or whatever they call it It is really not fair to expect you or me to keep people like that She has not cost you much hitherto Stanley and she will give you very little trouble hereafter I won t part with Tamar She has not cost me much said Lake whose temper was not of a kind to pass by anything No of course she has not I can t afford a guinea You re poor enough but in proportion to my expenses a woman of course can live on less than half what a man can I m a great deal poorer than you and I never said I gave her sixpence did I I have not got it to give and I don t think she s fool enough to expect it and to say the truth I don t care I only advise you There are some cheerful little cottages near the green in Gylingden and I venture to think this is one of the very gloomiest and most uncomfortable places you could have selected to live in Rachel looked drearily toward the window and sighed it was almost a groan It was cheerful always till this frightful week changed everything Oh why why why did you ever come She threw back her pale face biting her lip and even in that deepening gloom her small pearly teeth glimmered white and then she burst into sobs and an agony of tears Captain Lake knew something of feminine paroxysms Rachel was not given to hysterics He knew this burst of anguish was unaffected He was rather glad of it When it was over he expected clearer weather and a calm So he waited saying now and then a soothing word or two There there there Radie there s a good girl Never mind there there And between whiles his mind which in truth had a good deal upon it would wander and pursue its dismal and perplexed explorations to the unheard accompaniment of her sobs He went to the door but it was not to call for water or for old Tamar On the contrary it was to observe whether she or the girl was listening But the house though small was built with thick partition walls and sounds were well enclosed in the rooms to which they belonged With Rachel this weakness did not last long It was a gust violent soon over and the o er charged heart and brain were relieved And she pushed open the window and stood for a moment in the chill air and sighed and whispered a word or two over the closing flowers of her little garden toward the darkening glen and with another great sigh closed the window and returned Can I do anything Radie You re better now I knew you would be Shall I get some water from your room No Stanley no thank you I m very well now she said gently Yes I think so I knew you d be better And he patted her shoulder with his soft hand and then followed a short silence I wish you were more pleasantly lodged Radie but we can speak of that another time Yes you re right This place is dreadful and its darkness dreadful but light is still more dreadful now and I think I ll change but as you say there is time enough to think of all that Quite so time enough By the bye Radie you mentioned our old servant whom my father thought so highly of Jim Dutton the other evening I ve been thinking of him do you know and I should like to find him out He was a very honest fellow and attached and a clever fellow too my father thought and he was a good judge Hadn t you a letter from his mother lately You told me so I think and if it is not too much trouble dear Radie would you allow me to see it Rachel opened her desk and silently selected one of those clumsy and original missives directed in a staggering round hand on paper oddly shaped and thick such as mixes not naturally with the aristocratic fabric on which crests and ciphers are impressed and placed it in her brother s hand But you can t read it without light said Rachel No but there s no hurry Does she say where she is staying or her son Both I think answered Rachel languidly but he ll never make a servant for you he s a rough creature she says and was a groom You can t remember him nor I either Perhaps very likely and he put the letter in his pocket I was thinking Rachel you could advise me if you would you are so clever you know Advise said Rachel softly but with a wild and bitter rage ringing under it I did advise when it was yet time to profit by advice I bound you even by a promise to take it but you know how it ended You don t want my advice But really I do Radie I quite allow I was wrong worse than wrong but where is the use of attacking me now when I m in this dreadful fix I took a wrong step and what I now have to do is to guard myself if possible from what I m threatened with She fancied she saw his pale face grow more bloodless even in the shadow where he sat I know you too well Stanley You want no advice You never took advice you never will Your desperate and ingrained perversity has ruined us both I wish you d let me know my own mind I say I do and he uttered an unpleasant exclamation Do you think I ll leave matters to take their course and sit down here to be destroyed I m no such idiot I tell you I ll leave no stone unturned to save myself and in some measure you too Radie You don t seem to comprehend the tremendous misfortune that menaces me us you and me And he cursed Mark Wylder with a gasp of hatred not easily expressed She winced at the name and brushed her hand to her ear Don t don t don t she said vehemently Well what the devil do you mean by refusing to help me even with a hint I say I know all the odds are against us It is sometimes a long game but unless I m sharp I can t escape what s coming I can t you can t sooner or later It is in motion already d him it s coming and you expect me to do everything alone I repeat it Stanley said Rachel with a fierce cynicism in her low tones you don t want advice you have formed your plan whatever it is and that plan you will follow and no other though men and angels were united to dissuade you There was a pause here and a silence for a good many seconds Well perhaps I have formed an outline of a plan and it strikes me as very well I have for I don t think you are likely to take that trouble I only want to explain it and get your advice and any little assistance you can give me and surely that is not unreasonable I have learned one secret and am exposed to one danger I have taken to save you it may be only a respite one step the remembrance of which is insupportable But I was passive I am fallen from light into darkness There ends my share in your confidence and your fortunes I will know no more secrets no more disgrace do what you will you shall never use me again Suppose these heroics of yours Miss Radie should contribute to bring about to bring about the worst said Stanley with a sneer through which his voice trembled Let it come my resolution is taken Stanley walked to the window and in his easy way as he would across a drawing room to stand by a piano and he looked out upon the trees whose tops stood motionless against the darkened sky like masses of ruins Then he came back as gently as he had gone and stood beside his sister she could not see his yellow eyes now as he stood with his back to the window Well Radie dear you have put your hand to the plough and you sha n t turn back now What No you sha n t turn back now You seem Sir to fancy that I have no right to choose for myself said Miss Rachel spiritedly Now Radie you must be reasonable who have I to advise with Not me Stanley keep your plots and your secrets to yourself In the guilty path you have opened for me one step more I will never tread Excuse me Radie but you re talking like a fool I am not sorry you think so you can t understand motives higher than your own You ll see that you must though You ll see it in a little while Self preservation dear Radie is the first law of nature For yourself Stanley and for me self sacrifice she retorted bitterly Well Radie I may as well tell you one thing that I m resolved to carry out said Lake with a dreamy serenity looking on the dark carpet I ll hear no secret Stanley It can t be long a secret at least from you you can t help knowing it he drawled gently Do you recollect Radie what I said that morning when I first called here and saw you Perhaps I do but I don t know what you mean answered she I said Mark Wylder Don t name him she said rising and approaching him swiftly I said he should go abroad and so he shall said Lake in a very low tone with a grim oath Why do you talk that way You terrify me said Rachel with one hand raised toward his face with a gesture of horror and entreaty and the other closed upon his wrist I say he shall Radie Has he lost his wits I can t comprehend you you frighten me Stanley You re talking wildly on purpose I believe to terrify me You know the state I m in sleepless half wild all alone here You re talking like a maniac It s cruel it s cowardly I mean to do it you ll see Suddenly she hurried by him and in a moment was in the little kitchen with its fire and candle burning cheerily Stanley Lake was at her shoulder as she entered and both were white with agitation Old Tamar rose up affrighted her stiff arms raised and uttered a blessing She did not know what to make of it Rachel sat down upon one of the kitchen chairs scarce knowing what she did and Stanley Lake halted near the threshold gazing for a moment as wildly as she with the ghost of his sly smile on his smooth cadaverous face What ails her is she ill Master Stanley asked the old woman returning with her white eyes the young man s strange yellow glare I I don t know maybe give her some water said Lake Glass of water quick child cried old Tamar to Margery Put it on the table said Rachel collected now but pale and somewhat stern And now Stanley dear said she for just then she was past caring for the presence of the servants I hope we understand one another at least that you do me If not it is not for want of distinctness on my part and I think you had better leave me for the present for to say truth I do not feel very well Good night Radie good night old Tamar I hope Radie you ll be better every way when next I see you Good night He spoke in his usual clear low tones and his queer ambiguous smile was there still and hat in hand with his cane in his fingers he made another glance and a nod over his shoulder at the threshold and then glided forth into the little garden and so to the mill road down which at a swift pace he walked towards the village CHAPTER XXVI CAPTAIN LAKE FOLLOWS TO LONDON Wylder s levanting in this way was singularly disconcerting The time was growing short He wrote with a stupid good humour and an insolent brevity which took no account of Miss Brandon s position or that though secondary in awkwardness of her noble relatives Lord Chelford plainly thought more than he cared to say and his mother who never minced matters said perhaps more than she quite thought Chelford was to give the beautiful heiress away But the receiver of this rich and peerless gift like some mysterious knight who having carried all before him in the tourney vanishes no one knows whither when the prize is about to be bestowed and whom the summons of the herald and the call of the trumpet follow in vain had escaped them Lake has gone up to town this morning some business with his banker about his commission and he says he will make Wylder out on his arrival and write to me said Lord Chelford Old Lady Chelford glanced across her shoulder at Dorcas who leaned back in a great chair by the window listlessly turning over a book She s a strange girl she does not seem to feel her situation a most painful and critical one That low coarse creature must be looked up somehow Lake knows where he is likely to be found and will see him I dare say this evening perhaps in time to write by to night s post So in a quiet key Miss Dorcas being at a distance though in the same room the dowager and her son discussed this unpleasant and very nervous topic That evening Captain Lake was in London comfortably quartered in a private hotel in one of the streets off Piccadilly He went to his club and dined better than he had done for many days He really enjoyed his three little courses his pint of claret his cup of cafe noir and his chasse the great Babylon was his Jerusalem and his spirit found rest there He was renovated and refreshed his soul was strengthened and his countenance waxed cheerful and he began to feel like himself again under the brown canopy of metropolitan smoke and among the cabs and gaslights After dinner he got into a cab and drove to Mark Wylder s club Was he there No Had he been there to day No Or within the last week No not for two months He had left his address and was in the country The address to which his letters were forwarded was The Brandon Arms Gylingden So Captain Lake informed that functionary that his friend had come up to town and asked him again whether he was quite certain that he had not called there or sent for his letters No nothing of the sort Then Captain Lake asked to see the billiard marker who was likely to know something about him But he knew nothing He certainly had not been at the Lark s Nest which was kept by the marker s venerable parent and was a favourite haunt of the gay lieutenant Then our friend Stanley having ruminated for a minute pencilled a little note to Mark telling him that he was staying at Muggeridge s Hotel seven Hanover Street Piccadilly and wished most particularly to see him for a few minutes and this he left with the hall porter to give him should he call Then Lake got into his cab again having learned that he had lodgings in saint James s Street when he did not stay at the club and to these he drove There he saw missus M Intyre a Caledonian lady at this hour somewhat mellow and talkative but she could say nothing to the purpose either mister Wylder had not been there for nine weeks and three days and would owe her on Saturday next twenty five guineas So here too he left a little note to the same purpose and re entering his cab he drove a long way and past saint Paul s and came at last to a court outside which he had to dismount from his vehicle entering the grimy quadrangle through a narrow passage He had been there that evening before shortly after his arrival with old Mother Dutton as he called her about her son Jim Jim was in London looking for a situation all which pleased Captain Lake and he desired that she should send him to his hotel to see him in the morning But being in some matters of a nervous and impatient temperament he had come again as we see hoping to find Jim there and to anticipate his interview of the morning The windows however were dark and a little research satisfied Captain Lake that the colony was in bed In fact it was by this time half past eleven o clock and working people don t usually sit up to that hour But our friend Stanley Lake was one of those persons who think that the course of the world s affairs should bend a good deal to their personal convenience and he was not pleased with these unreasonable working people who had gone to their beds and brought him to this remote and grimy amphitheatre of black windows for nothing So wishing them the good night they merited he re entered his cab and drove rapidly back again towards the West end This time he went to a somewhat mysterious and barricadoed place where in a blaze of light in various rooms gentlemen in hats and some in great coats were playing roulette or hazard and I am sorry to say that our friend Captain Lake played first at one and then at the other with what success exactly I don t know But I don t think it was very far from four o clock in the morning when he let himself into his family hotel with that latchkey the cock s tail of Micyllus with which good natured old missus Muggeridge obliged the good looking captain Captain Lake having given orders the evening before that anyone who might call in the morning and ask to see him should be shown up to his bed room sans ceremonie was roused from deep slumber at a quarter past ten by a knock at his door and a waiter s voice Who s that drawled Captain Lake rising pale and half awake on his elbow and not very clear where he was The man Sir as you left a note for yesterday which he desires to see you Tell him to step in So out went the waiter in pumps and the sound of thick shoes was audible on the lobby and a sturdier knock sounded on the door Come in said the captain And Jim Dutton entered the room and closing the door made at the side of the bed his reverence consisting of a nod and a faint pluck at the lock of hair over his forehead Now Stanley Lake had perhaps expected to see some one else for though this was a very respectable looking fellow for his walk in life the gay young officer stared full at him with a frightened and rather dreadful countenance and actually sprung from his bed at the other side with an ejaculation at once tragic and blasphemous The man plainly had not expected to produce any such result and looked very queer Perhaps he thought something had occurred to affect his personal appearance perhaps some doubt about the captain s state of health and misgiving as to delirium tremens may have flickered over his brain They were staring at one another across the bed the captain in his shirt At last the gallant officer seemed to discover things as they were for he said Jim Dutton by Jove The oath was not so innocent but it was delivered quietly and then the captain drew a long breath and then still staring at him he laughed a ghastly little laugh also quietly And so it is you Jim said the captain And how do you do quite well Jim and out of place You ve been hurt in the foot eh so old your missus Dutton tells me but that won t signify I was dreaming when you came in not quite awake yet hardly just wait a bit till I get my slippers on and this So into his red slippers he slid and got his great shawl dressing gown such as fine gentlemen then wore about his slender person and knotted the silken cords with depending tassels and greeted Jim Dutton again in very friendly fashion enquiring very particularly how he had been ever since and what his mother was doing and I m afraid not listening to Jim s answers as attentively as one might have expected Whatever may have been his intrinsic worth Jim was not polished and spoke moreover an uncouth dialect which broke out now and then But he was in a sort of way attached to the Lake family the son of an hereditary tenant on that estate which had made itself wings and flown away like the island of Laputa It could not be said to be love it was a sort of traditionary loyalty a sentiment however not altogether unserviceable When they had talked together for a while the captain said The fact is it is not quite on me you would have to attend the situation perhaps is better You have no objection to travel You have been abroad you know and of course wages and all that will be in proportion Well Jim had not any objection to speak of What s wanted is a trustworthy man perfectly steady you see and a fellow who knows how to hold his tongue The last condition perhaps struck the man as a little odd he looked a little confusedly and he conveyed that he would not like to be in anything that was not quite straight Quite straight Sir repeated Stanley Lake looking round on him sternly neither should I I fancy You are to suppose the case of a gentleman who is nursing his estate you know what that means and wants to travel and keep quite quiet and who requires a steady trustworthy man to look after him in such a way as I shall direct with very little trouble and capital pay I have a regard for you Dutton and seeing so good a situation was to be had and thinking you the fittest man I know I wished to serve you and my friend at the same time Dutton became grateful and docile upon this There are reasons quite honourable I need not tell you which make it necessary James Dutton that the whole of this affair should be kept perfectly to ourselves you are not to repeat one syllable I say to you to your mother do you mind or to any other person living The gentleman is liberal and if you can just hold your tongue you will have little trouble in satisfying him upon all other points But if you can t be quite silent you had better I frankly tell you decline the situation excellent in all respects as it is I m a man Sir as can be close enough So much the better You don t drink Dutton coloured a little and coughed and said No Sir You have your papers Yes Sir We must be satisfied as to your sobriety Dutton Come back at half past eleven and I ll see you and bring your papers and do you see you are not to talk you understand only you may say if anyone presses that I am thinking of hiring you to attend on a gentleman whose name you don t yet know who s going to travel That s all So Jim Dutton made his bow and departed and Captain Lake continued to watch the door for some seconds after his departure as if he could see his retreating figure through it And said he with an oath and his hand to his forehead over his eyebrow It is the most unaccountable thing in nature Then after a reverie of some seconds the young gentleman applied himself energetically to his toilet and coming down to his sitting room he looked into his morning paper and then into the street and told the servant as he sate down to breakfast that he expected a gentleman named Wylder to call that morning and to be sure to show him up directly Captain Lake s few hours sleep contrary to popular ideas about gamesters slumbers had been the soundest and the most natural which he had enjoyed for a good many nights He was refreshed At Gylingden and Brandon he had been simulating Captain Stanley Lake being in truth something quite different with a vigilant histrionic effort which was awfully exhausting and sometimes nearly intolerable Here the captain was perceptibly stealing into his old ways and feelings His spirit revived something like confidence in the future and a possibility even of enjoying the present was struggling visibly through the cold fog that environed him Reason has after all so little to do with our moods The weather the scene the stomach how pleasantly they deal with facts how they supersede philosophy and even arithmetic and teach us how much of life is intoxication and illusion Still there was the sword of Damocles over his pineal gland D that sheer cold blade D him that forged it Still there was a great deal of holding in a horse hair Had not salmon of I know not how many pounds weight been played and brought to land by that slender towage There is the sword a burnished piece of cutlery weighing just so many pounds and the horsehair has sufficed for an hour and why not for another and soon Hang moping and nonsense Waiter another pint of Chian and let the fun go forward So the literal waiter knocked at the door A person wanted to see Captain Lake No it was not mister Wylder It was the man who had been here in the morning Dutton is his name And so it is really half past eleven said Lake in a sleepy surprise Let him come in And so in comes Jim Dutton again to hear particulars and have as he hopes his engagement ratified CHAPTER XXVII LAWYER LARKIN S MIND BEGINS TO WORK That morning Lake s first report upon his inquisition into the whereabouts of Mark Wylder altogether disappointing and barren reached Lord Chelford in a short letter and a similar one only shorter found Lawyer Larkin in his pleasant breakfast parlour Now this proceeding of mister Wylder s at this particular time struck the righteous attorney and reasonably as a very serious and unjustifiable step There was in fact no way of accounting for it that was altogether complimentary to his respected and nutritious client Yes there was something every way very serious in the affair It actually threatened the engagement which was so near its accomplishment Some most powerful and mysterious cause must undoubtedly be in operation to induce so sharp a party so keen after this world s wealth to risk so huge a prize Whatever eminent qualities Mark Wylder might be deficient in the attorney very well knew that cunning was not among the number It is nothing of the nature of debt plenty of money It is nothing that money can buy off easily either though he does not like parting with it Ten twenty to one it is the old story some unfortunate female connection some ambiguous relation involving a doubtful marriage And Josiah Larkin turned up his small pink eyes and shook his tall bald head gently and murmured as he nodded it The sins of his youth find him out the sins of his youth And he sighed and his long palms were raised and waved or rather paddled slowly to the rhythm of the sentiment If the butchers boy then passing saw that gaunt and good attorney standing thus in his bow window I am sure he thought he was at his devotions and abated his whistling as he went by After this mister Larkin s ruminations darkened and grew perhaps less distinct He had no particular objection to a mystery In fact he rather liked it provided he was admitted to confidence A mystery implied a difficulty of a delicate and formidable sort and such difficulties were not disadvantageous to a clever and firm person who might render himself very necessary to an embarrassed principal with plenty of money mister Larkin had a way of gently compressing his under lip between his finger and thumb a mild pinch a reflective caress when contemplations of this nature occupied his brain The silver light of heaven faded from his long face a deep shadow of earth came thereon and his small dove like eyes grew intense hungry and rat like Oh Lawyer Larkin your eyes though very small are very sharp They can read through the outer skin of ordinary men as through a parchment against the light the inner writing and spell out its meanings How is it that they fail to see quite through one Jos Larkin a lawyer of Gylingden The layover of Gylingden is somehow two opaque for them I almost think Is he really too deep for you Or is it that you don t care to search him too narrowly or have not time or as men in money perplexities love not the scrutiny of their accounts or papers you don t care to tire your eyes over the documents in that neatly japanned box the respectable lawyer s conscience If you have puzzled yourself you have also puzzled me I don t quite know what to make of you I ve sometimes thought you were simply an impostor and sometimes simply the dupe of your own sorceries The heart of man is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked Some men with a piercing insight into the evil of man s nature have a blurred vision for their own moralities For them it is not easy to see where wisdom ends and guile begins what wiles are justified to honour and what partake of the genius of the robber and where lie the delicate boundaries between legitimate diplomacy and damnable lying I am not sure that Lawyer Larkin did not often think himself very nearly what he wished the world to think him an eminent Christian What an awful abyss is self delusion Lawyer Larkin was on the whole I dare say tolerably well pleased with the position as he would have said of his spiritual interest and belonged to that complacent congregation who said I am rich and have need of nothing and who no doubt opened their eyes wide enough and misdoubted the astounding report of their ears when the judge thundered Thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked When Jos Larkins had speculated thus and built rich but sombre castles in the air for some time longer he said quietly to himself Yes And then he ordered his dog cart and drove off to Dollington and put up at Johnson s Hotel where Stanley Lake had slept on the night of his sister s return from London The people there knew the lawyer very well of course they quite understood his position mister Johnson the proprietor you may be sure does not confound him with the great squires the baronets and feudal names of the county but though he was by comparison easy in his company with even a dash of familiarity he still respected mister Larkin as a man with money and a sort of influence and in whose way at election and other times it might lie to do his house a good or an ill turn mister Larkin got into a little brown room looking into the inn garden and called for some luncheon and pen and ink and had out a sheaf of law papers he had brought with him tied up in professional red tape and asked the waiter with a grand smile and recognition how he did and asked him next for his good friend mister Johnson and trusted that business was improving and would be very happy to see him for two or three minutes if he could spare time So in due time in came the corpulent proprietor and Lawyer Larkin shook hands with him and begged him to sit down like a man who confers a distinction and assured him that Lord Edward Buxleigh whom he had recommended to stay at the house for the shooting had been very well pleased with the accommodation very highly so indeed and his lordship had so expressed himself when they had last met at Sir Hugh Huxterley s of Hatch Court The good lawyer liked illuminating his little narratives compliments and reminiscences with plenty of armorial bearings and heraldic figures and played out his court cards in easy and somewhat overpowering profusion Then he enquired after the two heifers that mister Johnson was so good as to feed for him on his little farm and then he mentioned that his friend Captain Lake who was staying with him at his house at Gylingden was also very well satisfied with his accommodation when he too at Lawyer Larkin s recommendation had put up for a night at Johnson s Hotel and it was not every house which could satisfy London swells of Captain Lake s fashion and habits he could tell him Then followed some conversation which I dare say interested the lawyer more than be quite showed in mister Johnson s company For when that pleased and communicative host had withdrawn Jos Larkin made half a dozen little entries in his pocket book with Statement of mister William Johnson and the date of their conversation at the head of the memorandum So the lawyer having to run on as far as Charteris by the goods train upon business walked down to the station where having half an hour to wait he fell into talk with the station master whom he also knew and afterwards with Tom Christmas the porter and in the waiting room he made some equally business like memoranda being certain chips and splinters struck off the clumsy talk of these officials and laid up in the lawyer s little private museum for future illustration and analysis By the time his little book was again in the bottom of his pocket the train had arrived and doors swung open and clapt and people got in and out to the porter s accompaniment of Dollington Dollington Dollington and Lawyer Larkin took his place and glided away to Charteris where he had a wait of two hours for the return train and a good deal of barren talk with persons at the station rewarded by one or two sentences worth noting and accordingly duly entered in the same little pocket book Thus was the good man s day consumed and when he mounted his dog cart at Dollington wrapped his rug about his legs whip and reins in hand and the ostler buckled the apron across the sun was setting redly behind the hills and the air was frosty and the night dark as he drew up before his own door steps near Gylingden A dozen lines of one of these pages would suffice to contain the fruits of his day s work and yet the lawyer was satisfied and even pleased with it and eat his late dinner very happily and though dignified of course was more than usually mild and gracious with all his servants that evening and expounded at family prayers in a sense that was liberal and comforting and went to bed after a calm and pleased review of his memoranda and slept the sleep of the righteous CHAPTER XXVIII MARK WYLDER S SUBMISSION Every day the position grew more critical and embarrassing The day appointed for the nuptials was now very near and the bridegroom not only out of sight but wholly untraceable What was to be done A long letter from Stanley Lake told Lord Chelford in detail all the measures adopted by that energetic young gentleman for the discovery of the truant knight I have been at his club repeatedly as also at his lodgings still his though he has not appeared there since his arrival in town The billiard marker at his club knows his haunts and I have taken the liberty to employ through him several persons who are acquainted with his appearance and at my desire frequent those places with a view to discovering him and bringing about an interview with me He was seen I have reason to believe a day or two before my arrival here at a low place called the Miller s Hall in the City where members of the Fancy resort at one of their orgies but not since I have left notes for him wherever he is likely to call entreating an interview On my arrival I was sanguine about finding him but I regret to say my hopes have very much declined and I begin to think he must have changed his quarters If you have heard from him within the last few days perhaps you will be so kind as to send me the envelope of his letter which by its postmark may possibly throw some light or hint some theory as to his possible movements He is very clever and having taken this plan of concealing his residence will conduct it skilfully If the case were mine I should be much tempted to speak with the detective authorities and try whether they might not give their assistance of course without eclat But this is I am aware open to objection and in fact would not be justifiable except under the very peculiar urgency of the case Will you be so good as to say what you think upon this point also to instruct me what you authorise me to say should I be fortunate enough to meet him At present I am hardly in a position to say more than an acquaintance never I fear very cordial on his part would allow which of course could hardly exceed a simple mention of your anxiety to be placed in communication with him If I might venture to suggest I really think a peremptory alternative should be presented to him Writing however in ignorance of what may since have passed at Brandon I may be assuming a state of things which possibly no longer exists Pray understand that in any way you please to employ me I am entirely at your command It is also possible though I hardly hope it that I may be able to communicate something definite by this evening s post I do not offer any conjectures as to the cause of this very embarrassing procedure on his part and indeed I find a great difficulty in rendering myself useful with any likelihood of really succeeding without at the same exposing myself to an imputation of impertinence You will easily see how difficult is my position Whatever may be the cause of Mark Wylder s present line of conduct it appears to me that if he really did attend that meeting at the Miller s Hall there cannot be anything very serious weighing upon his spirits My business will detain me here I rather think three days longer By return of post Lord Chelford wrote to Stanley Lake I am so very much obliged to you for all the trouble you have taken The measures which you have adopted are I think most judicious and I should not wish on consideration to speak to any official person I think it better to trust entirely to the means you have already employed Like you I do not desire to speculate as to the causes of Wylder s extraordinary conduct but all the circumstances considered I cannot avoid concluding as you do that there must be some very serious reason for it I enclose a note which perhaps you will be so good as to give him should you meet before you leave town The note to Mark Wylder was in these terms DEAR WYLDER I had hoped to see you before now at Brandon Your unexplained absence longer continued you must see will impose on me the necessity of offering an explanation to Miss Brandon s friends of the relations under these strange circumstances in which you and she are to be assumed to stand You have accounted in no way for your absence You have not even suggested a postponement of the day fixed for the completion of your engagement to that young lady and as her guardian I cannot avoid telling her should I fail to hear explicitly from you within three days from this date that she is at liberty to hold herself acquitted of her engagement to you I do not represent to you how much reason everyone interested by relationship in that young lady has to feel offended at the disrespect with which you have treated her Still hoping however that all may yet be explained I remain my dear Wylder yours very truly CHELFORD Lord Chelford had not opened the subject to Dorcas Neither had old Lady Chelford although she harangued her son upon it as volubly and fiercely as if he had been Mark Wylder in person whenever he and she were tete a tete She was extremely provoked too at Dorcas s evident repose under this astounding treatment and was enigmatically sarcastic upon her when they sat together in the drawing room She and her son were it seemed not only to think and act but to feel also for this utterly immovable young lady The Brandons in her young days were not wanting in spirit No they had many faults but they were not sticks or stones They were not to be taken up and laid down like wax dolls they could act and speak It would not have been safe to trample upon them and they were not less beautiful for being something more than pictures and statues This evening in the drawing room there were two very pretty ormolu caskets upon the little marble table A new present from Mark Wylder thought Lady Chelford as these objects met her keen glance The unceremonious bridegroom has I suppose found his way back with a peace offering in his hand And she actually peered through her spectacles into the now darkened corners of the chamber half expecting to discover the truant Wylder awaiting there the lecture she was well prepared to give him but the square form and black whiskers of the prodigal son were not discernible there So so something new and very elegant and pretty said the old lady aloud holding her head high and looking as if she were disposed to be propitiated I think I can risk a conjecture mister Wylder is about to reappear and has despatched these heralds of his approach no doubt suitably freighted to plead for his reacceptance into favour You have heard then from mister Wylder my dear Dorcas No Lady Chelford said the young lady with a grave serenity turning her head leisurely towards her No Oh then where is my son He perhaps can explain and pray my dear what are these These caskets contain the jewels which mister Wylder gave me about six weeks since I had intended restoring them to him but as his return is delayed I mean to place them in Chelford s hands because I have made up my mind a week ago to put an end to this odious engagement It is all over Lady Chelford stared at the audacious young lady with a look of incensed amazement for some seconds unable to speak Upon my word young lady vastly fine and independent You chasser mister Wylder without one moment s notice and without deigning to consult me or any other person capable of advising you You are about to commit as gross and indelicate a breach of faith as I recollect anywhere to have heard of What will be thought what will the world say what will your friends say Will you be good enough to explain yourself I ll not undertake your excuses I promise you Excuses I don t think of excuses Lady Chelford no person living has a right to demand one Very tragic young lady and quite charming sneered the dowager angrily Neither one nor the other I venture to think but quite true Lady Chelford answered Miss Brandon haughtily I don t believe you are serious Dorcas said Lady Chelford more anxiously and also more gently I can t suppose it I m an old woman my dear and I sha n t trouble you very long I can have no object in misleading you and you have never experienced from me anything but kindness and affection I think you might trust me a little Dorcas but that of course is for you you are your own mistress now but at least you may reconsider the question you propose deciding in so extraordinary a way I allow you might do much better than Mark Wylder but also worse He has not a title and his estate is not enough to carry the point a force d argent I grant all that But together the estates are more than most titled men possess and the real point is the fatal slip in your poor uncle s will which makes it so highly important that you and Mark should be united bear that in mind dear Dorcas I look for his return every day every hour indeed and no doubt his absence will turn out to have been unavoidable You must not act precipitately and under the influence of mere pique His absence I will lay my life will be satisfactorily accounted for he has set his heart upon this marriage and I really think you will almost drive him mad if you act as you threaten You have indeed dear Lady Chelford been always very kind to me and I do trust you replied this beautiful heiress turning her large shadowy eyes upon the dowager and speaking in slow and silvery accents somehow very melancholy I dare say it is very imprudent and I don t deny that mister Wylder may have reason to complain of me and the world will not spare me either but I have quite made up my mind and nothing can ever change me all is over between me and mister Wylder quite over for ever Upon my life young lady this is being very sharp indeed mister Wylder s business detains him a day or two longer than he expected and he is punished by a final dismissal The old lady s thin cheeks were flushed and her eyes shot a reddish light and altogether she made an angry sight It was hardly reasonable She had been inveighing against Miss Brandon s apathy under Wylder s disrespect and now that the young lady spoke and acted too she was incensed She had railed upon Wylder in no measured terms herself and even threatened as the proper measure that very step which Dorcas had announced and now she became all at once the apologist of this insolent truant and was ready to denounce her unreasonable irritation So far dear Lady Chelford from provoking me to this decision his absence is I assure you the sole reason of my having delayed to inform him of it And I assure you Miss Brandon I sha n t undertake to deliver your monstrous message He will probably be here to morrow You have prepared an agreeable surprise for him You shall have the pleasure of administering it yourself Miss Brandon For my part I have done my duty and here and now renounce all responsibility in the future management of your affairs Saying which she rose in a stately and incensed way and looking with flashing eyes over Dorcas s head to a far corner of the apartment without another word she rustled slowly and majestically from the drawing room She was a good deal shocked and her feelings quite changed however when next morning the post brought a letter to Chelford from Mark Wylder bearing the Boulogne postmark It said DEAR CHELFORD Don t get riled but the fact is I don t see my way out of my present business this last word was substituted for another crossed out which looked like scrape for a couple of months maybe Therefore you see my liberty and wishes being at present interfered with it would be very hard lines if poor Dorcas should be held to her bargain Therefore I will say this she is quite free for me Only of course I don t decline to fulfil my part whenever at liberty In the meantime I return the miniature with her hair in it which I constantly wore about me since I got it But I have no right to it any longer till I know her decision Don t be too hard on me dear Chelford It is a very old lark has got me into this present vexation In the meantime I wish to make it quite clear what I mean Not being able by any endeavour here a nautical phrase scratched out and endeavour substituted of mine to be up to time and as these are P P affairs I must only forfeit I mean I am at the lady s disposal either to fulfil my engagement the earliest day I can or to be turned adrift That is all I can say In more trouble than you suppose I remain dear Chelford yours whatever you may think faithfully MARK WYLDER CHAPTER XXIX HOW MARK WYLDER S DISAPPEARANCE AFFECTED HIS FRIENDS Lady Chelford s wrath was now turned anew upon Wylder and the inconvenience of having no visible object on which to expend it was once more painfully felt Railing at Mark Wylder was alas but beating the air The most crushing invective was thanks to his adroit mystification simply a soliloquy Poor Lady Chelford who loved to give the ingenious youngsters of both sexes when occasion invited a piece of her mind was here in the case of this vulgar and most provoking delinquent absolutely tongue tied If it had been possible to tell Wylder what she thought of him it would perhaps have made her more tolerable than she was for some days after the arrival of that letter to other members of the family The idea of holding Miss Brandon to this engagement and proroguing her nuptials from day to day to convenience the bridegroom absent without explanation was of course quite untenable Fortunately the marriage considering the antiquity and the territorial position of the two families who were involved was to have been a very quiet affair indeed no festivities no fire works nothing of the nature of a county gala no glare or thunder no concussion of society a dignified but secluded marriage This divested the inevitable dissolution of these high relations of a great deal of its eclat and ridicule Of course there was abundance of talk Scarce a man or woman in the shire but had a theory or a story sometimes bearing hard on the lady sometimes on the gentleman still it was an abstract breach of promise and would have much improved by some outward and visible sign of disruption and disappointment Some concrete pageantries to be abolished and removed flag staffs for instance and banners marquees pyrotechnic machinery and long tiers of rockets festoons of evergreens triumphal arches with appropriate mottoes to come down and hide themselves away would have been pleasant to the many who like a joke and to the few let us hope who love a sneer But there were no such fopperies to hurry off the stage disconcerted In the autumnal sun among the embrowned and thinning foliage of the noble trees Brandon Hall looked solemn sad and magnificent as usual with a sort of retrospective serenity buried in old world glories and sorrows and heeding little the follies and scandals of the hour In the same way Miss Brandon with Lord and Lady Chelford was seen next Sunday serene and unchanged in the great carved oak Brandon pew raised like a dais two feet at least above the level of mere Christians who frequented the family chapel There among old Wylder and Brandon tombs some painted stone effigies of the period of Elizabeth and the first James and some much older stone and marble knights praying on their backs with their spurs on and said to have been removed nearly three hundred years ago from the Abbey of Naunton Friars when that famous monastery began to lose its roof and turn into a picturesque ruin and by gone generations of Wylders and Brandons had offered up their conspicuous devotions with judging from their heathen lives I fear no very remarkable efficacy Here then next Sunday afternoon when the good vicar the reverend William Wylder at three o clock performed his holy office in reading desk and pulpit the good folk from Gylingden assembled in force saw nothing noticeable in the demeanour or appearance of the great Brandon heiress A goddess in her aerial place haughty beautiful unconscious of human gaze and seen as it were telescopically by mortals from below No shadow of trouble on that calm marble beauty no light of joy but a serene superb indifference Of course there was some satire in Gylingden but in the main it was a loyal town and true to its princess mister Wylder s settlements were not satisfactory it was presumed or the young lady could not bring herself to like him or however it came to pass one way or another that sprig of willow inevitably to be mounted by hero or heroine upon such equivocal occasions was placed by the honest town by no means in her breast but altogether in his button hole Gradually in a more authentic shape information traceable to old Lady Chelford through some of the old county families who visited at Brandon made it known that mister Wylder s affairs were not at present by any means in so settled a state as was supposed and that a long betrothal not being desirable on the whole Miss Brandon s relatives thought it advisable that the engagement should terminate and had so decided mister Wylder having very properly placed himself absolutely in their hands As for Mark it was presumed he had gone into voluntary banishment and was making the grand tour in the spirit of that lackadaisical gentleman in the then fashionable song who says From sport to sport they hurry me To banish my regret And if they win a smile from me They think that I forget It was known to be quite final and as the lady evinced no chagrin and affected no unusual spirits but held swanlike and majestic the even tenor of her way there was on the whole little doubt anywhere that the gentleman had received his conge and was hiding his mortification and healing his wounds in Paris or Vienna or some other suitable retreat But though the good folk of Gylingden in general cared very little how Mark Wylder might have disposed of himself there was one inhabitant to whom his absence was fraught with very serious anxiety and inconvenience This was his brother William the vicar Poor William sound in morals free from vice no dandy a quiet bookish self denying mortal was yet when he took holy orders and quitted his chambers at Cambridge as much in debt as many a scamp of his college He had been perhaps a little foolish and fanciful in the article of books and had committed a serious indiscretion in the matter of a carved oak bookcase and worse still he had published a slender volume of poems and a bulkier tome of essays scholastic and theologic both which ventures notwithstanding their merits had turned out unhappily and worse still he had lent that costly loan his sign manual on two or three occasions to friends in need and one way or another found that on winding up and closing his Cambridge life his assets fell short of his liabilities very seriously The entire amount it is true was not very great A pupil or two and a success with his work On the Character and Inaccuracies of Eusebius would make matters square in a little time But his advertisements for a resident pupil had not been answered they had cost him something and he had not any more spare bread just then to throw upon the waters So the advertisements for the present were suspended and the publishers somehow did not take kindly to Eusebius who was making the tour of that fastidious and hard hearted fraternity He had staved off some of his troubles by a little loan from an insurance company but the premium and the instalments were disproportioned to his revenue and indeed very nearly frightful to contemplate The Cambridge tradesmen were growing minatory and there was a stern person who held a renewal of one of his old paper subsidies to the necessities of his scampish friend Clarkson who was plainly a difficult and awful character to deal with Dreadful as were the tradesmen s peremptory and wrathful letters the promptitude and energy of this latter personage were such as to produce a sense of immediate danger so acute that the scared vicar opened his dismal case to his Brother Mark Mark sorely against the grain and with no good grace at last consented to advance Lthree hundred in this dread emergency and the vicar blessed his benefactor and in his closet on his knees shed tears of thankfulness over his deliverance and the sky opened and the flowers locked bright and life grew pleasant once more But the Lthree hundred were not yet in his pocket and Mark had gone away and although of course the loan was sure to come the delay any delay in his situation was critical and formidable Here was another would be correspondent of Mark s foiled for want of his address Still he would not believe it possible that he could forget his promise or shut up his bowels of mercy or long delay the remittance which he knew to be so urgently needed In the meantime however a writ reached the hand of the poor Vicar of Naunton Friars who wrote in eager and confused terror to a friend in the Middle Temple on the dread summons and learned that he was now in court and must appear or suffer judgment by default The end was that he purchased a respite of three months by adding thirty pounds to his debt and so was thankful for another deliverance and was confident of the promised subsidy within a week or at all events a fortnight or at worst three months was a long reprieve and the subsidy must arrive before the emergency In this there can be no dismay My ships come home a month before the day When the service was over the neighbourly little congregation with a sprinkling of visitors to Gylingden for sake of its healing waters broke up and loitered in the vicinity of the porch to remark on the sermon or the weather and ask one another how they did and to see the Brandon family enter their carriage and the tall powdered footman shut the door upon them and mount behind and move off at a brilliant pace and with a glorious clangour and whirl of dust and this incident over they broke up gradually into little groups in Sunday guise and many colours some for a ramble on the common and some to tea according to the primitive hours that ruled old Gylingden The vicar and John Hughes clerk and sexton were last out and the reverend gentleman thin and tall in white necktie and black a little threadbare stood on the steps of the porch in a sad abstraction The red autumnal sun nearing the edge of the distant hills Looked through the horizontal misty air Shorn of its beams and lighted the thin and gentle features of the vicar with a melancholy radiance The sound of the oak door closing heavily behind him and John Hughes and the key revolving in the lock recalled him and with a sigh and a smile and a kindly nod to John he looked up and round on the familiar and pretty scenery undecided It was not quite time to go home his troubles were heavy upon him too just then they have their paroxysms like ague and the quiet of the road and the sweet air and sunshine tempted him to walk off the chill and fever of the fit As he passed the little cottage where old Widow Maddock lay sick Rachael Lake emerged He was not glad He would rather have had his sad walk in his own shy company But there she was he could not pass her by so he stopped and lifted his hat and greeted her and then they shook hands She was going his way He looked wistfully on the little hatch of old Widow Maddock s cottage for he felt a pang of reproach at passing her door but there was no comfort then in his thoughts only a sense of fear and hopeless fatigue How is poor old missus Maddock he asked you have been visiting the sick and afflicted and I was passing by but indeed if I were capable at this moment I should not fail to see her poor creature There was something apologetic and almost miserable in his look as he said this She is not better but you have been very good to her and she is very grateful and I am glad said Rachel that I happened to light on you And she paused They were by this time walking side by side and she glanced at him enquiringly and he thought that the handsome girl looked rather thin and pale You once said Miss Lake resumed that sooner or later I should be taught the value of religion and would learn to prize my great privileges and that for some spirits the only approach to the throne of mercy was through great tribulation I have often thought since of those words and they have begun for me to take the spirit of a prophecy sometimes that is but at others they sound differently like a dreadful menace as if my afflictions were only to bring me to the gate of life to find it shut Knock and it shall be opened said the vicar but the comfort was sadly spoken and he sighed But is not there a time mister Wylder when He shall have shut to the door and are there not some who crying to him to open shall yet remain for ever in outer darkness I see dear Miss Lake that your mind is at work it is a good influence at work upon the great theme which every mortal spirit ought to be employed upon My fears are at work my mind is altogether dark and turbid I am sometimes at the brink of despair Take comfort from those fears There is hope in that despair and he looked at her with great interest in his gentle eyes She looked at him and then away toward the declining sun and she said despairingly I cannot comprehend you Come said he Miss Lake bethink you was there not a time and no very distant one when futurity caused you no anxiety and when the subject which has grown so interesting was altogether distasteful to you The seed of the Word is received at length into good ground but a grain of wheat will bring forth no fruit unless it die first The seed dies to outward sense and despair follows but the principle of life is working in it and it will surely grow and bring forth fruit thirty sixty an hundredfold be not dismayed The body dies and the Lord of life compares it to the death of the seed in the earth and then comes the palingenesis the rising in glory In like manner He compares the reception of the principle of eternal life into the soul to the dropping of a seed into the earth it follows the general law of mortality It too dies such a death as the children of heaven die here only to germinate afresh with celestial power and beauty Miss Lake s way lay by a footpath across a corner of the park to Redman s Dell So they crossed the stile and still conversing followed the footpath under the hedgerow of the pretty field and crossing another stile entered the park CHAPTER XXX IN BRANDON PARK To me from association no doubt that park has always had a melancholy character The ground undulates beautifully and noble timber studs it in all varieties of grouping and now as when I had seen the ill omened form of Uncle Lorne among its solitudes the descending sun shone across it with a saddened glory tipping with gold the blades of grass and the brown antlers of the distant deer Still pursuing her solemn and melancholy discourse the young lady followed the path accompanied by the vicar True said the vicar your mind is disturbed but not by doubt No it is by truth He glanced aside at the tarn where I had seen the phantom and by which their path now led them You remember Parnell s pretty image So when a smooth expanse receives imprest Calm nature s image on its watery breast Down bend the banks the trees depending grow And skies beneath with answering colours glow But if a stone the gentle scene divide Swift ruffling circles curl on every side And glimmering fragments of a broken sun Banks trees and skies in thick disorder run But as I said it is not a doubt that agitates your mind that is well represented by the stone that subsides and leaves the pool clear it maybe but stagnant as before Oh no it is an angel who comes down and troubles the water What a heavenly evening said a low sweet voice but with something insidious in it close at his shoulder With a start Rachel glanced back and saw the pale peculiar face of her brother His yellow eyes for a moment gleamed into hers and then on the vicar and with his accustomed smile he extended his hand How do you do better I hope Radie How are you William Rachel grew deadly pale and then flushed and then was pale again I thought Stanley you were in London So I was but I arrived here this morning I m staying for a few days at the Lodge Larkin s house you re going home I suppose Radie Yes oh yes but I don t know that I ll go this way You say you must return to Gylingden now mister Wylder I think I ll turn also and go home that way Nothing would give me greater pleasure said the vicar truly as well as kindly for he had grown interested in their conversation but I fear you are tired he looked very kindly on her pale face and you know it will cost you a walk of more than two miles I forgot yes I believe I am a little tired I m afraid I have led you too farther than you intended She fancied that her sudden change of plan on meeting her brother would appear odd I ll see you a little bit on your way home Radie said Stanley It was just what she wished to escape She was more nervous though not less courageous than formerly But the old fierce defiant spirit awoke Why should she fear Stanley or what could it be to her whether he was beside her in her homeward walk So the vicar made his adieux there and began at a brisker pace to retrace his steps toward Gylingden and she and Stanley side by side walked on toward Redman s Dell What a charming park and what delightful air Radie and the weather so very delicious They talk of Italian evenings but there is a pleasant sharpness in English evenings quite peculiar Is not there just a little suspicion of frost don t you think so not actually cold but crisp and sharp unspeakably exhilarating now really this evening is quite celestial I ve just been listening to a good man s conversation and I wish to reflect upon it said Rachel very coldly Quite so that is of course when you are alone answered Stanley serenely William was always a very clever fellow to talk very well read in theology is not he yes he does talk very sweetly and nobly on religion it is a pity he is not quite straight or at least more punctual in his money affairs He is distressed for money William Wylder is distressed for money Do you mean that said Rachel turning a tone of sudden surprise and energy almost horror turning full upon him and stopping short Oh dear no not the least distressed that I ever heard of laughed Stanley coldly only just a little bit roguish maybe That s so like you Stanley said the young lady with a quiet scorn resuming her onward walk How very beautiful that clump of birch trees is near the edge of the slope there you really can t imagine who are always here how very intensely a person who has just escaped from London enjoys all this I don t think Stanley said the young lady coldly and looking straight before her as she walked you ever cared for natural scenery or liked the country and yet you are here I don t think you ever loved me or cared whether I was alone or in company and yet seeing for you did see it that I would now rather be alone you persist in walking with me and talking of trees and air and celestial evenings and thinking of something quite different Had not you better turn back to Gylingden or the Lodge or wherever you mean to pass the evening and leave me to my quiet walk and my solitude In a few minutes dear Radie you are so odd I really believe you think no one can enjoy a ramble like this but yourself Come Stanley what do you want said his sister stopping short and speaking with the flush of irritation on her cheek do you mean to walk to Redman s Dell or have you anything unpleasant to say Neither I hope said the captain with his sleepy smile his yellow eyes resting on the innocent grass blades before him I don t understand you Stanley I am always uncomfortable when you are near me You stand there like an evil spirit with some purpose which I cannot divine but you shall not ensnare me Go your own way why can t you Pursue your own plots your wicked plots but let me rest I will be released Sir from your presence Really this is very fine Radie considering how we are related I m Mephistopheles I suppose and you Margaret or some other simple heroine rebuking the fiend in the majesty of your purity And indeed in the reddish light and in that lonely and solemn spot the slim form of the captain pale sneering with his wild eyes confronting the beautiful light haired girl looked not quite unlike a type of the jaunty fiend he was pleased to suppose himself I tell you Stanley I feel that you design employing me in some of your crooked plans I have horrible reasons as you know for avoiding you and so I will I hope I may never desire to see you alone again but if I do it shall not be to receive but to impose commands You had better return to Gylingden and leave me So I will dear Radie by and by said he with his amused smile That is you won t until you have said what you meditate Well then as it seems I must hear it pray speak at once standing where we are and quickly for the sun will soon go down and one step more I will not walk with you Well Radie you are pleased to be whimsical and to say truth I was thinking of saying a word or two just about as idea that has been in my mind some time and which you half divined you are so clever the first day I saw you at Redman s Farm You know you fancied I was thinking of marrying I don t remember that I said so but I thought it You mentioned Caroline Beauchamp but I don t see how your visit here could have been connected with that plan But don t you think Radie I should do well to marry that is assuming everything to be suitable Well perhaps for yourself Stanley but Yes of course said Lake but the unfortunate girl you were going to say thank you She s of course very much to be pitied and you have my leave to pity her as much as you please I do pity her said Rachel Thank you again said Stanley but seriously Radie you can be I think very essentially of use to me in this affair and you must not refuse Now Stanley I will cut this matter short I can t serve you I won t I don t know the young lady and I don t mean to make her acquaintance But I tell you that you can serve me retorted Stanley with a savage glare and features whitened with passion and you shall serve me and you do know the young lady intimately I say Sir I do not replied Rachel haughtily and fiercely She is Dorcas Brandon you know her I believe I came down here to marry her I had made up my mind when I saw you first and I ll carry my point I always do She does not like me maybe but she shall I never yet resolved to make a woman like me and failed You need not look so pale and put on that damned affected look of horror I may be wild and and what you please but I m no worse than that brute Mark Wylder and you never turned up your eyes when he was her choice and I knew things about him that ought to have damned him and she s well rid of a branded rascal And now Rachel you know her and you must say a good word for me I expect your influence and if you don t use it and effectually it will be worse for you You women understand one another and how to get a fellow favourably into one another s thoughts So listen to me this is a vital matter indeed it is Radie I have lost a lot of money like a fool I suppose well it is gone and this marriage is indispensable I must go in for it it is life or death and if I fail through your unkindness here he swore an impious oath I ll end all with a pistol and leave a letter to Chelford disclosing everything concerning you and me and Mark Wylder I think Rachel Lake was as near fainting as ever lady was without actually swooning It was well they had stopped just by the stem of a great ash tree against which Rachel leaned for some seconds with darkness before her eyes and the roar of a whirlpool in her ears After a while with two or three gasps she came to herself Lake had been railing on all this time and his voice which in ill temper was singularly bleak and terrible was again in her ears the moment she recovered her hearing I do not care to quarrel there are many reasons why we should not Lake said in his peculiar tones You have some of my secrets and you must have more it can t be helped and I say you must I ve been very foolish I ll give up play It has brought me to this I ve had to sell out I ve paid away all I could and given bills for the rest but I can t possibly pay them don t you see and if things go to the worst I tell you I ll not stay I don t want to make my bow just yet and I ve no wish to injure you but I ll do as I have said he swore again and Chelford shall have a distinct statement under my hand of everything that has happened I don t suppose you wish to be accessory to all this and therefore it behoves you Rachel to do what you can to prevent it One woman can always influence another and you are constantly with Dorcas You ll do all you can I m sure you will and you can do a great deal I know it I ll do as much for you Radie Anything you like For the first time her brother stood before her in a really terrible shape she felt his villainy turning with a cowardly and merciless treason upon her forlorn self Sacrificed for him and that sacrifice used by him to torture to extort perhaps to ruin She quailed for a minute in the presence of this gigantic depravity and cruelty But Rachel was a brave lass and rallied quickly After all I have done and suffered said she with a faint smile of unimaginable bitterness I did not think that human wickedness could produce such a brother as you are Well it is no news what you think of me and not much matter either I don t see that I am a worse brother than you are a sister Stanley Lake was speaking with a livid intensity You see how I m placed a ruined man with a pistol to my head what you can do to save me may amount to nothing but it may be everything and you say you won t try Now I say you shall and with every energy and faculty you possess or else abide the consequences And I tell you Sir replied Rachel I know you you are capable of anything but of hurting yourself I ll never be your slave though if I pleased I might make you mine I scorn your threats I defy you Stanley Lake looked transported and the yellow fires of his deep set eyes glared on her while his lips moved to speak but not a word came and it became a contortion he grasped the switch in his hand as if to strike her Take care Sir Lord Chelford s coming said the young lady haughtily with a contracted glance of horror fixed on Lake Lake collected himself He was a man who could do it pretty quickly but he had been violently agitated and the traces of his fury could not disappear in a moment Lord Chelford was indeed approaching only a few hundred yards away Take my arm said Lake And Rachel mechanically as story tellers say placed her slender gloved hand upon his arm the miscreant arm that had been so nearly raised to strike her and they walked along brother and sister in the Sabbath sunset light to meet him CHAPTER XXXI IN REDMAN S DELL 
6014_32886_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Lord Chelford raised his hat smiling I am so very glad I met you I was beginning to feel so solitary he placed himself beside Miss Lake I ve had such a long walk across the park 
none	none	How do you do Lake when did you come And so on Lake answering and looking wonderfully as usual 
6014_32886_000008_000000	train-clean-360	I think Lord Chelford perceived there was something amiss between the young people for his eye rested on Rachel with a momentary look of enquiry unconscious no doubt and quickly averted and he went on chatting pleasantly but he looked once or twice a little hard at Stanley Lake 
none	none	I don t think he had an extraordinarily good opinion of that young gentleman He seldom expressed an ill one of anybody and then it was in very measured language 
6014_32886_000008_000003	train-clean-360	But though he never hinted at an unfavourable estimate of the captain his intimacies with him were a little reserved and I think I have seen him even when he smiled look the least little bit in the world uncomfortable as if he did not quite enter into the captain s pleasantries 
6014_32886_000009_000000	train-clean-360	They had not walked together very far when Stanley recollected that he must take his leave and walk back to Gylingden and so the young lady and Lord Chelford were left to pursue their way towards Redman s Farm together 
none	none	It would have been a more unaccountable proceeding on the part of Stanley Lake and a more romantic situation if Rachel and his lordship had not had before two or three little accidental rambles together in the grounds and gardens of Brandon There was nothing quite new in the situation therefore and Rachel was for a moment indescribably relieved by Stanley s departure 
6014_32886_000011_000000	train-clean-360	The shock of her brief interview with her brother over reflection assured her knowing all she did that Stanley s wooing would prosper and so this cause of quarrel had really nothing in it no nothing but a display of his temper and morals not very astonishing after all and like an ugly picture or a dreadful dream in no way to affect her after life except as an odious remembrance 
none	none	Therefore little by little like a flower that has been bruised in the tranquillising influences about her the young lady got up expanded and grew like herself again not like enough indeed to say much but to listen and follow his manly refined and pleasant talk every moment with a pang that had yet something pleasurable in it contrasting the quiet and chivalric tone of her present companion with the ferocious duplicity of the sly smooth terrorist who had just left her side 
6014_32886_000013_000000	train-clean-360	It was rather a marked thing as lean missus Loyd of Gylingden who had two thin spinsters with pink noses under her wing remarked this long walk of Lord Chelford and Miss Lake in the park and she enjoined upon her girls the propriety of being specially reserved in their intercourse with persons of Lord Chelford s rank not that they were much troubled with dangers from any such quarter 
none	none	Miss Lake had she supposed her own notions and would act as she pleased but she owned for her part she preferred the old fashion and thought the men did also and was sure too that young ladies lost nothing by a little reserve and modesty Now something of this no doubt passed in the minds of Lord Chelford and his pretty companion But what was to be done 
6014_32886_000014_000002	train-clean-360	That perverse and utterly selfish brother Stanley Lake had chosen to take his leave 
none	none	Lord Chelford could not desert the young lady and would it have been a very nice delicacy in Miss Lake to make her courtesy in the middle of the park and protest against pursuing their walk together any further 
6014_32886_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Lord Chelford was a lively and agreeable companion but there was something unusually gentle almost resembling tenderness in his manner She was so different from her gay fiery self in this walk so gentle so subdued and he was more interested by her perhaps than he had ever been before 
6014_32886_000016_000000	train-clean-360	The sun just touched the verge of the wooded uplands as the young people began to descend the slope of Redman s Dell 
6014_32886_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 How very short Lord Chelford paused with a smile at these words 
none	none	I was just going to say how short the days have grown as if it had all happened without notice and contrary to the almanac but really the sun sets cruelly early this evening and I am so very sorry our little walk is so soon to end 
6014_32886_000018_000000	train-clean-360	There was not much in this little speech but it was spoken in a low sweet voice and Rachel looked down on the ferns before her feet as they walked on side by side not with a smile but with a blush and that beautiful look of gratification so becoming and indescribable 
none	none	Happy that moment that enchanted moment of oblivion and illusion 
6014_32886_000018_000002	train-clean-360	But the fitful evening breeze came up through Redman s Dell with a gentle sweep over the autumnal foliage 
6014_32886_000018_000003	train-clean-360	Sudden as a sigh and cold in her ear it sounded like a whisper or a shudder and she lifted up her eyes and saw the darkening dell before her and with a pang the dreadful sense of reality returned 
6014_32886_000018_000004	train-clean-360	She stopped with something almost wild in her look 
6014_32886_000018_000005	train-clean-360	But with an effort she smiled and said with a little shiver The air has grown quite chill and the sun nearly set we loitered Stanley and I a great deal too long in the park but I am now at home and I fear I have brought you much too far out of your way already good bye And she extended her hand 
none	none	You must not dismiss your escort here I must see you through the enchanted dell it is only a step and then I shall return with a good conscience like a worthy knight having done my devoir honestly She looked down the dell with a dark and painful glance and then she said a few words of hesitating apology and acquiescence and in a few minutes more they parted at the little wicket of Redman s Farm They shook hands 
6014_32886_000020_000002	train-clean-360	He had a few pleasant lingering words to say 
none	none	She paused as he spoke at the other side of that little garden door 
6014_32886_000020_000004	train-clean-360	She seemed to like those lingering sentences and hung upon them and even smiled but in her eyes there was a vague and melancholy pleading a wandering and unfathomable look that pained him 
none	none	They shook hands again it was the third time and then she walked up the little gravel walk hardly a dozen steps and disappeared within the door of Redman s Farm without turning another parting look on Lord Chelford who remained at the little paling expecting one I think to lift his hat and say one more parting word 
6014_32886_000022_000000	train-clean-360	She turned into the little drawing room at the left and herself unseen did take that last look and saw him go up the road again towards Brandon 
none	none	The shadows and mists of Redman s Dell anticipated night and it was already deep twilight there On the table there lay a letter which Margery had brought from the post office So Rachel lighted her candles and read it with very little interest for it concerned a world towards which she had few yearnings There was just one sentence which startled her attention it said We shall soon be at Knowlton for Christmas I suppose It is growing too wintry for mamma near the sea though I like it better in a high wind than in a calm and a gale is such fun such a romp 
6014_32886_000023_000003	train-clean-360	The Dulhamptons have arrived the old Marchioness never appears till three o clock and only out in the carriage twice since they came 
none	none	I can t say I very much admire Lady Constance though she is to be Chelford s wife 
6014_32886_000023_000005	train-clean-360	She has fine eyes and I think no other good point much too dark for my taste but they say clever and not another word was there on this subject 
none	none	Lady Constance arranged I suppose by Lady Chelford no great dot and an unamiable family an odious family nothing to recommend her but her rank So ruminated Rachel Lake as she looked out on her shadowy garden and tapped a little feverish tattoo with her finger on the window pane and she meditated a great while trying to bring back distinctly her recollection of Lady Constance and also vaguely conjecturing who had arranged the marriage and how it had come about Chelford cannot like her It is all Lady Chelford s doing Can I have mistaken the name 
6014_32886_000027_000000	train-clean-360	But no Nothing could be more perfectly distinct than Chelford traced in her fair correspondent s very legible hand 
6014_32886_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 He treats the young lady very coolly thought Rachel forgetting perhaps that his special relations to Dorcas Brandon had compelled his stay in that part of the world 
none	none	Mingled with this criticism was a feeling quite unavowed even to herself a sore feeling that Lord Chelford had been and this she never admitted to herself before more particular no not exactly that but more something or other not exactly expressible in words in his approaches to her than was consistent with his situation 
6014_32886_000029_000001	train-clean-360	But then she had been very guarded not stiff or prudish indeed but frank and cold enough with him and that was comforting 
none	none	Still there was a sense of wonder a great blank and something of pain in the discovery yes pain though she smiled a faint blushing smile alone as she was and then came a deep sigh and then a sort of start Rachel Rachel is it possible murmured the young lady with the same dubious smile looking down upon the ground and shaking her head Yes I do really think you had begun to like Lord Chelford only begun the least little insidious bit but thank you wild Bessie Frankleyn you have quite opened my eyes 
6014_32886_000031_000002	train-clean-360	Rachel Rachel girl what a fool you were near becoming 
none	none	She looked like her old pleasant self during this little speech arch and fresh and still smiling she looked up and sighed and then her dark look returned and she said dismally What utter madness And leaned for a while with her fingers upon the window sash and when she turned to old Tamar who brought in her tiny tea equipage it seemed as if the shadow of the dell into which she had been vacantly gazing still rested on her face Not here Tamar I ll drink tea in my room and you must bring your tea cup too and we ll take it together I am I think I am a little nervous darling and you won t leave me 
6014_32886_000036_000000	train-clean-360	So they sat down together in her chamber 
none	none	It was a cheery little bed room when the shutters were closed and the fire burning brightly in the grate My good Tamar will read her chapters aloud I wish I could enjoy them like you I can only wish You must pray for me Tamar There is a dreadful image and I sometimes think a dreadful being always near me Though the words you read are sad and awful they are also sweet like funeral music a long way off and they tranquillise me without making me better as the harping of David did the troubled and forsaken King Saul

LARKIN AND THE VICAR The good vicar was not only dismayed but endangered by his brother s protracted absence It was now the first week in November Bleak and wintry that ungenial month set in at Gylingden and in accord with the tempestuous and dismal weather the fortunes of the reverend William Wylder were darkened and agitated This morning a letter came at breakfast by post and when he had read it the poor vicar grew a little white and he folded it very quietly and put it in his waistcoat pocket and patted little Fairy on the head Little Fairy was asking him a question all this time very vehemently How long was Jack s sword that he killed the giants with and several times to this distinct question he received only the unsatisfactory reply Yes my darling and at last when little Fairy mounted his knee and hugging the abstracted vicar round the neck urged his question with kisses and lamentations the parson answered with a look of great perplexity and only half recalled said Indeed little man I don t know How long you say was Jack s sword Well I dare say it was as long as the umbrella He got up with the same perplexed and absent look as he said this and threw an anxious glance about the room as if looking for something he had mislaid You are not going to write now Willie dear expostulated his good little wife you have not tasted your tea yet I have indeed dear haven t I Well I will And standing he drank nearly half the cup she had poured out for him and set it down and felt in his pocket she thought for his keys Are you looking for anything Willie darling Your keys are in my basket No darling no darling nothing I have everything I want I think I must go to the Lodge and see mister Larkin for a moment But you have eaten nothing remonstrated his partner you must not go until you have eaten something Time enough darling I can t wait I sha n t be away twenty minutes time enough when I come back Have you heard anything of Mark darling she enquired eagerly Of Mark Oh no nothing of Mark And he added with a deep sigh Oh dear I wonder he does not write no nothing of Mark She followed him into the hall Now Willie darling you must not go till you have had your breakfast you will make yourself ill indeed you will do come back just to please me and eat a little first No darling no my love I can t indeed I ll be back immediately but I must catch mister Larkin before he goes out It is only a little matter I want to ask his opinion and oh here is my stick and I ll return immediately And I ll go with you cried little Fairy No no little man I can t take you no it is business stay with mamma and I ll be back again in a few minutes So spite of Fairy s clamours and the remonstrances of his fond clinging little wife with a hurried kiss or two away he went alone at a very quick pace through the high street of Gylingden and was soon in the audience chamber of the serious gentleman attorney The attorney rose with a gaunt and sad smile of welcome begged mister Wylder with a wave of his long hand to be seated and then seating himself and crossing one long thigh over the other he threw his arm over the back of his chair and leaning back with what he conceived to be a graceful and gentlemanly negligence with his visitor full in the light of the window and his own countenance in shadow the light coming from behind a diplomatic arrangement which he affected he fixed his small pink eyes observantly upon him and asked if he could do anything for mister William Wylder Have you heard anything since mister Larkin Can you conjecture where his address may now be asked the vicar a little abruptly Oh mister Mark Wylder perhaps you refer to Yes my brother Mark mister Larkin smiled a sad and simple smile and shook his head No indeed not a word it is very sad and involves quite a world of trouble and utterly inexplicable for I need not tell you in my position it can t be pleasant to be denied all access to the client who has appointed me to act for him nor conducive to the apprehension of his wishes upon many points which I should much prefer not being left to my discretion It is really as I say inexplicable for mister Mark Wylder must thoroughly see all this he is endowed with eminent talents for business and must perfectly appreciate the embarrassment in which the mystery with which he surrounds the place of his abode must involve those whom he has appointed to conduct his business I have heard from him this morning resumed the lawyer he was pleased to direct a power of attorney to me to receive his rents and sign receipts and he proposes making Lord Viscount Chelford and Captain Lake trustees to fund his money or otherwise invest it for his use and Has he I beg pardon but did he mention a little matter in which I am deeply indeed vitally interested The vicar paused I don t quite apprehend perhaps if you were to frame your question a little differently I might possibly a you were saying I mean a matter of very deep interest to me said the poor vicar colouring a little though no very considerable sum viewed absolutely but under my unfortunate circumstances of the most urgent importance a loan of three hundred pounds did he mention it Again mister Larkin shook his head with the same sad smile But though we do not know how to find him he knows very well where to find us and as you are aware we hear from him constantly and no doubt he recollects his promise and will transmit the necessary directions all in good time I earnestly hope he may and the poor cleric lifted up his eyes unconsciously and threw his hope into the form of a prayer For to speak frankly mister Larkin my circumstances are very pressing I have just heard from Cambridge and find that my good friend mister Mountain the bookseller has been dead two months and his wife he was a widower when I knew him but it would seem has married since is his sole executrix and has sold the business and directed two gentlemen attorneys to call in all the debts due to him peremptorily and they say I must pay before the fifteenth and I have absolutely but five pounds in the world until March when my half year will be paid And indeed only that the tradespeople here are so very kind we should often find it very difficult to manage Perhaps said mister Larkin blandly you would permit me to look at the letter you mention having received from the solicitors at Cambridge Oh thank you certainly here it is said William Wylder eagerly and he gazed with his kind truthful eyes upon the attorney s countenance as he glanced over it trying to read something of futurity therein Foukes and Mauley said mister Larkin I have never had but one transaction with them they are not always pleasant people to deal with Mind I don t say anything affecting their integrity Heaven forbid but they certainly did take rather what I would call a short turn with us on the occasion to which I refer You must be cautious indeed my dear Sir very cautious The fifteenth just ten clear days Well you know you have till then to look about you and you know we may any day hear from your brother directing the loan to be paid over to you And now my dear and reverend friend you know me I hope continued mister Larkin very kindly as he handed back the letter and you won t attribute what I say to impertinent curiosity but your brother s intended advance of three hundred pounds can hardly have had relation only to this trifling claim upon you There are no doubt pardon me several little matters to be arranged and considerable circumspection will be needed pending your brother s absence in dealing with the persons who are in a position to press their claims unpleasantly You must not trifle with these things And let me recommend you seeing your legal adviser whoever he is immediately You mean said the vicar who was by this time very much flushed a gentleman of your profession mister Larkin Do you really think well it has frequently crossed my mind but the expense you know and although my affairs are in a most unpleasant and complicated state I am sure that everything would be perfectly smooth if only I had received the loan my kind brother intends and which to be sure as you say any day I may receive But my dear Sir do you really mean to say that you would pay claims from various quarters how old is this for instance without examination The vicar looked very blank I this well this I certainly do owe it has increased a little with interest though good mister Mountain never charged more than six per cent It was I think about fifteen pounds books I am ashamed to say how long ago about a work which I began then and laid aside on Eusebius but which is now complete and will I hope eventually repay me Were you of age my dear Sir when he gave you these books on credit Were you twenty one years of age Oh no not twenty but then I owe it and I could not as s a Christian man you know evade my debts Of course but you can t pay it at present and it may be highly important to enable you to treat this as a debt of honour you perceive Suppose my dear Sir they should proceed to arrest you or to sequestrate the revenue of your vicarage Now see my dear Sir I am I humbly hope a Christian man but you will meet with men in every profession and mine is no exception disposed to extract the last farthing which the law by its extremest process will give them And I really must tell you frankly that if you dream of escaping the most serious consequences you must at once place yourself and your affairs in the hands of a competent man of business It will probably be found that you do not in reality owe sixty pounds of every hundred claimed against you Oh mister Larkin if I could induce you mister Larkin smiled a melancholy smile and shook his head My dear Sir I only wish I could but my hands are so awfully full and he lifted them up and shook them and shook his tall bald head at the same time and smiled a weary smile Just look there and he waved his fingers in the direction of the Cyclopean wall of tin boxes tier above tier each bearing in yellow italics the name of some country gentleman and two baronets among the number everyone of them laden with deeds and papers You can t have a notion no one has what it is I see indeed murmured the honest vicar in a compassionating tone and quite entering into the spirit of mister Larkin s mournful appeal as if the being in large business was the most distressing situation in which an attorney could well find himself It was very unreasonable of me to think of troubling you with my wretched affairs but really I do not know very well where to turn or whom to speak to Maybe my dear Sir you can think of some conscientious and Christian practitioner who is not so laden with other people s cares and troubles as you are I am a very poor client and indeed more trouble than I could possibly be gain to anyone But there may be some one pray think ten days is so short a time and I can do nothing mister Larkin stood at the window ruminating with his left hand in his breeches pocket and his right with finger and thumb pinching his under lip after his wont and the despairing accents of the poor vicar s last sentence still in his ear Well he said hesitatingly it is not easy at a moment s notice to point out a suitable solicitor there are many of course very desirable gentlemen but I feel it my dear Sir a very serious responsibility naming one for so peculiar a matter But you shall not in the meantime go to the wall for want of advice Rely upon it we ll do the best we can for you he continued in a patronising way with his chin raised and extending his hand kindly to shake that of the parson Yes I certainly will you must have advice Can you give me two hours to morrow evening say to tea if you will do me the honour My friend Captain Lake dines at Brandon to morrow He s staying here with me you are aware on a visit but we shall be quite by ourselves say at seven o clock Bring all your papers and I ll get at the root of the business and see if possible in each particular case what line is best to be adopted How can I thank you my dear Sir cried gentle William Wylder his countenance actually beaming with delight and gratitude a brighter look than it had worn for many weeks Oh don t pray don t mention it I assure you it is a happiness to me to be of any little use and really I don t see how you could possibly hold your own among the parties who are pressing you without professional advice I feel said the poor vicar and his eyes filled as he smiled and his lip quivered a little I feel as if my prayer for direction and deliverance were answered at last Oh my dear Sir I have suffered a great deal but something assures me I am rescued and shall have a quiet mind once more I am now in safe and able hands And he shook the safe and able and rather large hands of the amiable attorney in both his You make too much of it my dear Sir I should at any time be most happy to advise you said mister Larkin with a lofty and pleased benevolence and with great pleasure provisionally until we can hit upon a satisfactory solicitor with a little more time at his disposal I undertake the management of your case Thank Heaven again said the vicar who had not let go his hands And it is so delightful to have for my guide a Christian man who even were I so disposed would not lend himself to an unworthy or questionable defence and although at this moment it is not in my power to reward your invaluable assistance Now really my dear Sir I must insist no more of this I beseech you I do most earnestly insist that you promise me you will never mention the matter of professional remuneration more until at least I press it which rely upon it will not be for a good while The attorney s smile plainly said that his good while meant in fact never This is indeed unimaginable kindness How have I deserved so wonderful a blessing And I have no doubt said the attorney fondling the vicar s arm in his large hand that these claims will ultimately be reduced fully thirty per cent I had once a good deal of professional experience in this sort of business and oh my dear Sir it is really melancholy and up went his small pink eyes in a pure horror and his hands were lifted at the same time but we will bring them to particulars and you may rely upon it you will have a much longer time at all events than they are disposed to allow you CHAPTER XXXIII THE LADIES ON GYLINGDEN HEATH Just at this moment they became aware of a timid little tapping which had been going on at the window during the latter part of this conference and looking up the attorney and the vicar saw little Fairy s violet eyes peering under his light hair with its mild golden shadow and the odd sensitive smile at once shy and arch his cheeks were wet with tears and his pretty little nose red though he was smiling and he drew his face aside among the jessamine when he saw the gaunt attorney directing his patronising smile upon him I beg pardon said the vicar rising with a sudden smile and going to the window It is my little man Fairy Fairy What has brought you here my little man Fairy glanced still smiling but very shamefacedly at the grand attorney and in his little fist he held a pair of rather seedy gloves to the window pane So I did I protest I forgot my gloves Thank you little man Who is with you Oh I see That is right The maid ducked a short courtesy Indeed Sir please Master Fairy was raising the roof a nursery phrase which implied indescribable bellowing and as naughty as could be until missis allowed him to come after you Oh my little man you must not do that Ask nicely you know always quietly like a little gentleman But oh Wapsie your hands would be cold and he held the gloves to him against the glass Well darling thank you you are a kind little man and I ll be with you in a moment said the vicar smiling very lovingly on his naughty little man mister Larkin said he turning very gratefully to the attorney you can lay this Christian comfort to your kind heart that you have made mine a hundredfold lighter since I entered this blessed room indeed you have lifted a mountain from it by the timely proffer of your invaluable assistance Again the attorney waved off with a benignant and humble smile rather oppressive to see all idea of obligation and accompanied his grateful client to the glass door of his little porch where Fairy was already awaiting him with the gloves in his hand I do believe said the good vicar as he walked down what mister Larkin called the approach and looking up with irrepressible gratitude to the blue sky and the white clouds sailing over his head if it be not presumption I must believe that I have been directed hither yes darling yes my hands are warm this was addressed to little Fairy who was clamouring for information on the point and clinging to his arm as he capered by his side What immense relief and he murmured another thanksgiving and then quite hilariously If little man would like to come with his Wapsie we ll take such a nice little walk together and we ll go and see poor Widow Maddock and we ll buy three muffins on our way home for a feast this evening and we ll look at the pictures in the old French Josephus and Mamma and I will tell stories and I have a halfpenny to buy apples for little Fairy The attorney stood at his window with a shadow on his face and his small eyes a little contracted and snakelike following the slim figure of the threadbare vicar and his golden haired dancing little comrade and then he mounted a chair and took down successively four of his japanned boxes two of them in yellow letters bore respectively the label Brandon No one and No two the other Wylder No one and No two He opened the Wylder box first and glanced through a neat little statement of title prepared for counsel when draughting the deed of settlement for the marriage which was never to take place The limitations let me see is not there something that one might be safe in advancing a trifle upon eh h m yes And with his lip in his finger and thumb he conned over those remainders and reversions with a skilled and rapid eye Rachel Lake was glad to see the slender and slightly stooped figure of the vicar standing that morning his bright little boy by the hand in the wicket of the tiny flower garden of Redman s Farm She went out quickly to greet him The sick man likes the sound of his kind doctor s step on the stairs and be his skill much or little trusts in him and will even joke a little asthmatic joke and smile a feeble hectic smile about his ailments when he is present So they fell into discourse among the autumnal flowers and withered leaves and as the day was still and genial they remained standing in the garden and away went busy little Fairy smiling and chatting with Margery to see the hens and chickens in the yard The physician after a while finds the leading features of most cases pretty much alike He knows when inflammation may be expected and fever will supervene he is not surprised if the patient s mind wanders a little at times expects the period of prostration and the return of appetite and has his measures and his palliatives ready for each successive phase of sickness and recovery In like manner too the good and skilful parson comes by experience to know the signs and stages of the moral ailments and recoveries which some of them know how so tenderly and so wisely to care for They too have ready having often proved their consolatory efficacy their febrifuges and their tonics culled from that tree of life whose leaves are for the healing of the nations Poor Rachel s hours were dark and life had grown in some sort terrible and death seemed now so real and near aye quite a fact and somehow not unfriendly But oh the immense futurity beyond that could not be shirked to which she was certainly going Death and sleep so welcome But oh that stupendous LIFE EVERLASTING now first unveiled She could only close her eyes and wring her hands Oh for some friendly voice and hand to stay her through the Valley of the Shadow of Death They talked a long while Rachel chiefly a listener and often quietly weeping and at last a very kindly parting and a promise from the simple and gentle vicar that he would often look in at Redman s Farm She watched his retreating figure as he and little Fairy walked down the tenebrose road to Gylingden following them with a dismal gaze as a benighted and wounded wayfarer in that Valley would the pale lamp s disappearing that had for a few minutes in a friendly hand shone over his dreadful darkness And when in fitful reveries fancy turned for a moment to an earthly past and future all there was a blank the past saddened the future bleak She did not know or even suspect that she had been living in an aerial castle and worshipping an unreal image until on a sudden all was revealed in that chance gleam of cruel lightning the line in that letter which she read so often spelled over and puzzled over so industriously though it was clear enough How noble how good how bright and true was that hero of her unconscious romance Well no one else suspected that incipient madness that was something and brave Rachel would quite master it Happy she had discovered it so soon Besides it was even if Chelford were at her feet a wild impossibility now and it was well though despair were in the pang that she had at last quite explained this to herself As Rachel stood in her little garden on the spot where she had bidden farewell to the vicar she was roused from her vague and dismal reverie by the sound of a carriage close at hand She had just time to see that it was a brougham and to recognise the Brandon liveries when it drew up at the garden wicket and Dorcas called to her from the open window I m come Rachel expressly to take you with me and I won t be denied You are very good Dorcas thank you dear very much but I am not very well and a very dull companion to day You think I am going to bore you with visits No such thing I assure you I have taken a fancy to walk on the common that is all a kind of longing and you must come with me quite to ourselves you and I You won t refuse me darling I know you ll come Well Rachel did go And away they drove through the quiet town of Gylingden together and through the short street on the right and so upon the still quieter common This plain of green turf broke gradually into a heath and an irregular screen of timber and underwood divided the common of Gylingden in sylvan fashion from the moor The wood passed Dorcas stopped the carriage and the two young ladies descended It was a sunny day and the air still and the open heath contrasted pleasantly with the sombre and confined scenery of Redman s Dell and altogether Rachel was glad now that she had made the effort and come with her cousin It was good of you to come Rachel said Miss Brandon and you look tired but you sha n t speak more than you like and I ll tell you all the news Chelford is just returned from Brighton he arrived this morning and he and Lady Chelford will stay for the Hunt Ball I made it a point And he called at Hockley on his way back to see Sir Julius Do you know him Sir Julius Hockley No I ve heard of him only Well they say he is wasting his property very fast and I think him every way very nearly a fool but Chelford wanted to see him about mister Wylder Mark Wylder you know of course has turned up again in England His letter to Chelford six weeks ago was from Boulogne but his last was from Brighton and Sir Julius Hockley witnessed I think they call it that letter of attorney which Mark sent about a week since to mister Larkin and Chelford who is most anxious to trace Mark Wylder having to surrender I think they call it a trust is not it or something I really don t understand these things to him and not being able to find out his address mister Larkin wrote to Sir Julius whom Chelford did not find at home to ask him for a description of Mark to ascertain whether he had disguised himself and Sir Julius wrote to Chelford such an absurd description of poor Mark in doggrel rhyme so like his odd walk his great whiskers and everything Chelford does not like personalities but he could not help laughing Are you ill darling Though she was walking on beside her companion Rachel looked on the point of fainting My darling you must sit down you do look very ill I forgot my promise about Mark Wylder How stupid I have been and perhaps I have distressed you No Dorcas I am pretty well but I have been ill and I am a little tired and Dorcas I don t deny it I am amazed you tell me such things That letter of attorney or whatever it is must not be acted upon It is incredible It is all horrible wickedness Mark Wylder s fate is dreadful and Stanley is the mover of all this Oh Dorcas darling I wish I could tell you everything Some day I may be I am sick and terrified They had sat down by this time side by side on the crisp bank Each lady looked down the one in suffering the other in thought You are better darling are not you better said Dorcas laying her hand on Rachel s and looking on her with a melancholy gaze Yes dear better very well answered Rachel looking up but without an answering glance at her cousin You blame your brother Rachel in this affair Did I Well maybe yes he is to blame the miserable man whom I hate to think of and yet am always thinking of Stanley well knows is not in a state to do it Don t you think Rachel remembering what I have confided to you that you might be franker with me in this Oh Dorcas don t misunderstand me If the secret were all my own Heaven knows hateful as it is how boldly I would risk all and throw myself on your fidelity or your mercy I know not how you might view it but it is different Dorcas at least for the present You know me you know how I hate secrets but this is not mine only in part that is I dare not tell it but may be soon free and to us all dear Dorcas a woful woful day will it be I made you a promise Rachel said her beautiful cousin gravely and a little coldly and sadly too I will never break it again it was thoughtless Let us each try to forget that there is anything hidden between us If ever the time comes dear Dorcas when I may tell it to you I don t know whether you will bless or hate me for having kept it so well at all events I think you ll pity me and at last understand your miserable cousin I said before Rachel that I liked you You are one of us Rachel You are beautiful wayward and daring and one way or another misfortune always waylays us and I have I know it calamity before me Death comes to other women in its accustomed way but we have a double death There is not a beautiful portrait in Brandon that has not a sad and true story Early death of the frail and fair tenement of clay but a still earlier death of happiness Come Rachel shall we escape from the spell and the destiny into solitude What do you think of my old plan of the valleys and lakes of Wales a pretty foreign tongue spoken round us and no one but ourselves to commune with and books and music It is not Radie altogether jest I sometimes yearn for it as they say foreign girls do for convent life Poor Dorcas said Rachel very softly fixing her eyes upon her with a look of inexpressible sadness and pity Rachel said Dorcas I am a changeable being violent self willed My fate may be quite a different one from that which I suppose or you imagine I may yet have to retract my secret Oh would it were so would to Heaven it were so Suppose Rachel that I had been deceiving you perhaps deceiving myself time will show There was a wild smile on beautiful Dorcas s face as she said this which faded soon into the proud serenity that was its usual character Oh Dorcas if your good angel is near listen to his warnings We have no good angels my poor Rachel what modern necromancers conversing with tables call mocking spirits have always usurped their place with us singing in our drowsy ears like Ariel visiting our reveries like angels of light being really our evil genii ah yes Dorcas dear said Rachel after both had been silent for a time speaking suddenly and with a look of pale and keen entreaty Beware of Stanley oh beware beware I think I am beginning to grow afraid of him myself Dorcas was not given to sighing but she sighed gazing sadly across the wide bleak moor with her proud apathetic look which seemed passively to defy futurity and then for awhile they were silent She turned and caressingly smoothed the golden tresses over Rachel s frank white forehead and kissed them as she did so You are better darling you are rested she said Yes dear Dorcas and she kissed the slender hand that smoothed her hair Each understood that the conversation on that theme was ended and somehow each was relieved CHAPTER XXXIV SIR JULIUS HOCKLEY S LETTER Jos Larkin mentioned in his conversation with the vicar just related that he had received a power of attorney from Mark Wylder Connected with this document there came to light a circumstance so very odd that the reader must at once be apprised of it This legal instrument was attested by two witnesses and bore date about a week before the interview just related between the vicar and mister Larkin Here then was a fact established Mark Wylder had returned from Boulogne for the power of attorney had been executed at Brighton Who were the witnesses One was Thomas Tupton of the Travellers Hotel Brighton This Thomas Tupton was something of a sporting celebrity and a likely man enough to be of Mark s acquaintance The other witness was Sir Julius Hockley of Hockley an unexceptionable evidence though a good deal on the turf Now our friend Jos Larkin had something of the Red Indian s faculty for tracking his game by hardly perceptible signs and tokens through the wilderness and this mystery of Mark Wylder s flight and seclusion was the present object of his keen and patient pursuit On receipt of the instrument therefore he wrote by return of post presenting his respectful compliments to Sir Julius Hockley and deeply regretting that as solicitor of the Wylder family and the gentleman sic empowered to act under the letter of attorney it was imperative upon him to trouble him Sir Julius H with a few interrogatories which he trusted he would have no difficulty in answering The first was whether he had been acquainted with mister Mark Wylder s personal appearance before seeing him sign so as to be able to identify him The second was whether he mister M W was accompanied at the time of executing the instrument by any friend and if so what were the name and address of such friend And the third was whether he could communicate any information whatsoever respecting mister M W s present place of abode The same queries were put in a somewhat haughty and peremptory way to the sporting hotel keeper who answered that mister Mark Wylder had been staying for a week at his house about five months ago and that he had seen him twice once backing Jonathan when he beat the great American billiard player and another time when he lent him his copy of Bell s Life in the coffee room and thus he was enabled to identify him For the rest he could say nothing Sir Julius s reply was of the hoity toity and rollicking sort bordering in parts very nearly on nonsense and generally impertinent It reached mister Larkin as he sat at breakfast with his friend Stanley Lake Pray read your letters and don t mind me I entreat Perhaps you will allow me to look at the Times and I ll trouble you for the sardines The postmark Hockley stared the lawyer in the face and longing to break the seal he availed himself of the captain s permission So Lake opened the Times and as he studied its columns I think he stole a glance or two over its margin at the attorney now deep in the letter of Sir Julius Hockley He Sir J H presented his respects to mister Lark ens or Lark ins or Lark me or Lark us Sir J H is not able to read which or what but he is happy to observe at all events that end how he may the gentleman begins with a lark which Sir J H always does when he can Not being able to discover his terminal syllable he will take the liberty of styling him by his sprightly beginning and calling him shortly Lark As Sir J never objected to a lark the gentleman so designated introduces himself with a strong prejudice in Sir J s mind in his favour so much so that by way of a lark Sir J will answer Lark s questions which are not he thinks very impertinent The wildest of all Lark s questions refers to Wylder s place of abode which Sir J was never wild enough to think of asking after and does not know and so little was he acquainted with the gentleman that he forgot he was an evangelist doing good under the style and title of Mark Lark may therefore tell Mark if he sees him or his friends Matthew Luke and John that Sir Julius saw Mark only on two successive days at the cricket match played between Paul s Eleven the coincidence is remarkable and the Ishmaelites these I am bound to observe were literally the designations of the opposing sides and that he had the honour of being presented to Mark saint or sinner as he may be on the ground by his Sir J H s friend Captain Stanley Lake of the Guards Here was an astounding fact Stanley Lake had been in Mark Wylder s company only ten days ago when that great match was played at Brighton What a deep gentleman was that Stanley Lake who sat at the other end of the table with the Times before him What a varnished rascal what a matchless liar He had returned to Gylingden direct in all likelihood from his conferences with Mark Wylder to tell all concerned that it was vain endeavouring to trace him and still offering his disinterested services in the pursuit No matter We must take things coolly and cautiously All this chicanery will yet break down and the conspiracy be it what it may will be thoroughly exposed Mystery is the shadow of guilt and most assuredly thought mister Larkin there is some infernal secret well worth knowing at the bottom of all this You little think I have you here and he slid Sir Julius Hockley s piece of rubbishy banter into his waistcoat pocket and then opened and glanced at half a dozen other letters in a cool quick official way endorsing a little note on the back of each with his gold patent pencil All mister Jos Larkin s properties were handsome and imposing and he never played with children without producing his gold repeater and making it strike and exhibiting its wonders for their amusement and the edification of the adults whose presence of course he forgot Paul s Eleven have challenged the Gipsies said Lake languidly lifting his eyes from the paper By the bye are you anything of a cricketer And they are to play at Hockley Sir Julius Hockley s ground You know Sir Julius don t you Very slightly I may say I have that honour but we have never been thrown together a mere a the slightest thing in the world Not schoolfellows you are not an Eton man eh said Lake Oh no My dear father the organist would not send a boy of his to what he called an idle school But my acquaintance with Sir Julius was a trifling matter Hockley is a very pretty place is not it A sweet place A great match was played between those fellows at Brighton Paul s Eleven beat fifteen of the Ishmaelites about a fortnight since but they have no chance with the Gipsies It will be quite a hollow thing a one innings affair Have you ever seen Paul s Eleven play asked the lawyer carelessly taking up the newspaper which Lake had laid down I saw them play that match at Brighton I mentioned just now a few days ago Ah did you Did not you know I was there said Lake in rather a changed tone Larkin looked up and Lake laughed in his face quietly the most impertinent laugh he had ever seen or heard with his yellow eyes fixed on the lawyer s pink little optics I was there and Hockley was there and Mark Wylder was there was not he and Lake stared and laughed and the attorney stared and Lake added What a d d cunning fellow you are ha ha ha Larkin was not easily put out but he was disconcerted now and his cheeks and forehead grew suddenly pink and he coughed a little and tried to throw a look of mild surprise into his face Why you have this moment had a letter from Hockley Don t you think I knew his hand and the post mark and your look said quite plainly Here s news of my friend Stanley Lake and Mark Wylder I had an uncle in the Foreign Office and they said he would have been quite a distinguished diplomatist if he had lived and I was said to have a good deal of his talent and I really think I have brought my little evidences very prettily together and jumped to a right conclusion eh A flicker of that sinister shadow I have sometimes mentioned crossed Larkin s face and contracted his eyes as he said a little sternly I have nothing on earth to conceal Sir I never had All my conduct has been as open as the light there s not a letter Sir I ever write or receive that might not so far as I am concerned with my good will lie open on that table for every visitor that comes in to read open as the day Sir and the attorney waved his hand grandly Hear hear hear said Lake languidly and tapping a little applause on the table while he watched the solicitor s rhetoric with his sly disconcerting smile It was but conscientious Captain Lake that I should make particular enquiry respecting the genuineness of a legal instrument conferring such very considerable powers How on earth Sir could I have the slightest suspicion that you had seen my client mister Wylder considering the tenor of your letters and conversation And I venture to say Captain Lake that Lord Chelford will be just as much surprised as I when he hears it Jos Larkin esquire delivered this peroration from a moral elevation all the loftier that he had a peer of the realm on his side But peers did not in the least overawe Stanley Lake who had been all his days familiar with those idols and the moral altitudes of the attorney amused him vastly But he ll not hear it I won t tell him and you sha n t because I don t think it would be prudent of us do you to quarrel with Mark Wylder and he does not wish our meeting known It is nothing on earth to me on the contrary it rather places me in an awkward position keeping other people s secrets The attorney made one of his slight gentlemanlike bows and threw back his head with a lofty and reserved look I don t know Captain Lake that I would be quite justified in withholding the substance of Sir Julius Hockley s letter from Lord Chelford consulted as I have had the honour to be by that nobleman I shall however turn it over in my mind Don t the least mind me In fact I would rather tell it than not And I can explain to Chelford why I could not mention the circumstance Wylder in fact tied me down by a promise and he ll be devilish angry with you but it seems you don t very much mind that He knew that mister Larkin did very much mind it and the quick glance of the attorney could read nothing whatever in the captain s pallid face and downcast eyes smiling on the points of his varnished boots Of course you know Captain Lake in alluding to the possibility of my making any communication to Lord Chelford I limit myself strictly to the letter of Sir Julius Hockley and do not by any means my dear Captain Lake include the conversation which has just occurred and the communication which you have volunteered to make me Oh quite so said the captain looking up suddenly as was his way with a momentary glare like a man newly waked from a narcotic doze CHAPTER XXXV THE HUNT BALL By this time your humble servant the chronicler of these Gylingden annals had taken his leave of magnificent old Brandon and of its strangely interesting young mistress and was carrying away with him as he flew along the London rails the broken imagery of that grand and shivered dream He was destined however before very long to revisit these scenes and in the meantime heard in rude outline the tenor of what was happening the minute incidents and colouring of which were afterwards faithfully communicated I can therefore without break or blur continue my description and to say truth at this distance of time I have some difficulty so well acquainted was I with the actors and the scenery in determining without consulting my diary what portions of the narrative I relate from hearsay and what as a spectator But that I am so far from understanding myself I should often be amazed at the sayings and doings of other people As it is I behold in myself an abyss I gaze down and listen and discover neither light nor harmony but thunderings and lightnings and voices and laughter and a medley that dismays me There rage the elements which God only can control Forgive us our trespasses lead us not into temptation deliver us from the Evil One How helpless and appalled we shut our eyes over that awful chasm I have long ceased then to wonder why any living soul does anything that is incongruous and unanticipated And therefore I cannot say how Miss Brandon persuaded her handsome Cousin Rachel to go with her party under the wing of Old Lady Chelford to the Hunt Ball of Gylingden And knowing now all that then hung heavy at the heart of the fair tenant of Redman s Farm I should indeed wonder inexpressibly were it not as I have just said that I have long ceased to wonder at any vagaries of myself or my fellow creatures The Hunt Ball is the great annual event of Gylingden The critical process of coming out is here consummated by the young ladies of that town and vicinage It is looked back upon for one half of the year and forward to for the other People date by it The battle of Inkerman was fought immediately before the Hunt Ball It was so many weeks after the Hunt Ball that the Czar Nicholas died The Carnival of Venice was nothing like so grand an event Its solemn and universal importance in Gylingden and the country round gave me I fancied some notion of what the feast of unleavened bread must have been to the Hebrews and Jerusalem The connubial capabilities of Gylingden are positively wretched When I knew it there were but three single men according even to the modest measure of Gylingden housekeeping capable of supporting wives and these were difficult to please set a high price on themselves looked the country round at long ranges and were only wistfully and meekly glanced after by the frugal vestals of Gylingden as they strutted round the corners or smoked the pipe of apathy at the reading room windows Old Major Jackson kept the young ladies in practice between whiles with his barren gallantries and graces and was just so far better than nothing But as it had been for years well ascertained that he either could not or would not afford to marry and that his love passages like the passages in Gothic piles that lead to nothing were not designed to terminate advantageously he had long ceased to excite even in that desolate region the smallest interest Think then what it was when mister Pummice of Copal and Pummice the splendid house painters at Dollington arrived with his artists and charwomen to give the Assembly Room its annual touching up and bedizenment preparatory to the Hunt Ball The Gylingden young ladies used to peep in and from the lobby observe the wenches dry rubbing and waxing the floor and the great mister Pummice with his myrmidons in aprons and paper caps retouching the gilding It was a tremendous crisis for honest missus Page the confectioner over the way who in legal phrase had the carriage of the supper and refreshments though largely assisted by mister Battersby of Dollington During the few days agony of preparation that immediately preceded this notable orgie the good lady s countenance bespoke the magnitude of her cares Though the weather was usually cold I don t think she ever was cool during that period I am sure she never slept I don t think she ate and I am afraid her religious exercises were neglected Equally distracting emaciating and godless was the condition to which the mere advent of this festival reduced worthy Miss Williams the dressmaker who had more white muslin and young ladies on her hands than she and her choir of needle women knew what to do with During this tremendous period Miss Williams hardly resembled herself her eyes dilated her lips were pale and her brow corrugated with deep and inflexible lines of fear and perplexity She lived on bad tea sat up all night and every now and then burst into helpless floods of tears But somehow generally things came pretty right in the end One way or another the gay belles and elderly spinsters and fat village chaperones were invested in suitable costume by the appointed hour and in a few weeks Miss Williams mind recovered its wonted tone and her countenance its natural expression The great night had now arrived Gylingden was quite in an uproar Rural families of eminence came in Some in old fashioned coaches others the wealthier more in London style The stables of the Brandon Arms of the George Inn of the Silver Lion even of the White House though a good way off and generally every vacant standing for horses in or about the town were crowded and the places of entertainment we have named and minor houses of refection were vocal with the talk of flunkeys patrician with powdered heads and splendent in variegated liveries The front of the Town Hall resounded with the ring of horse hoofs the crack of whips the bawling of coachmen the clank of carriage steps and clang of coach doors A promiscuous mob of the plebs and profanum vulgus of Gylingden beset the door to see the ladies the slim and the young in white muslins and artificial flowers and their stout guardian angels of maturer years in satins and velvets and jewels some real and some just as good of paste In the cloak room such a fuss unfurling of fans and last looks and hurried adjustments When the Crutchleighs of Clay Manor a good old formal family were mounting the stairs in solemn procession they were always among the early arrivals they heard a piano and a tenor performing in the supper room Now old Lady Chelford chose to patronise mister Page the Dollington professor and partly I fancy to show that she could turn things topsy turvy in this town of Gylingden had made a point with the rulers of the feast that her client should sing half a dozen songs in the supper room before dancing commenced missus Crutchleigh stayed her step upon the stairs abruptly and turned with a look of fierce surprise upon her lean white headed lord arresting thereby the upward march of Corfe Crutchleigh esquire the hope of his house who was pulling on his gloves with his eldest spinster sister on his lank arm There appears to be a concert going on we came here to a ball Had you not better enquire mister Crutchleigh it would seem we have made a mistake missus Crutchleigh was sensitive about the dignity of the family of Clay Manor and her cheeks flushed above the rouge and her eyes flashed severely That s singing particularly loud singing Either we have mistaken the night or somebody has taken upon him to upset all the arrangements You ll be good enough to enquire whether there will be dancing to night I and Anastasia will remain in the cloak room and we ll all leave if you please mister Crutchleigh if this goes on The fact is missus Crutchleigh had got an inkling of this performance and had affected to believe it impossible and detesting old Lady Chelford for sundry slights and small impertinences and envying Brandon and its belongings was resolved not to be put down by presumption in that quarter Old Lady Chelford sat in an arm chair in the supper room where a considerable audience was collected She had a splendid shawl or two about her and a certain air of demi toilette which gave the Gylingden people to understand that her ladyship did not look on this gala in the light of a real ball but only as a sort of rustic imitation curious possibly amusing and like other rural sports deserving of encouragement for the sake of the people who made innocent holiday there mister Page the performer was a plump young man with black whiskers and his hair in oily ringlets such as may be seen in the model wigs presented on smiling waxen dandies in mister Rose s front window at Dollington He bowed and smiled in the most unexceptionable of white chokers and the dapperest of dress coats and drew off the whitest imaginable pair of kid gloves when he sat down to the piano subsiding in a sort of bow upon the music stool and striking those few brisk and noisy chords with which such artists proclaim silence and reassure themselves Stanley Lake that eminent London swell had attached himself as gentleman in waiting to Lady Chelford s household and was perpetually gliding with little messages between her ladyship and the dapper vocalist of Dollington who varied his programme and submitted to an occasional encore on the private order thus communicated I told you Chelford would be here said Miss Brandon to Rachel in a low tone glancing at the young peer I thought he had returned to Brighton I fancied he might be you know the Dulhamptons are at Brighton and Lady Constance of course has a claim on his time and thoughts Rachel smiled as she spoke and was adjusting her bouquet as Dorcas made answer Lady Constance my dear Radie That you know was never more than a mere whisper it was only Lady Chelford and the marchioness who talked it over they would have liked it very well But Chelford won t be managed or scolded into anything of the kind and will choose I think for himself and I fancy not altogether according to their ideas when the time comes And I assure you dear Radie there is not the least truth in that story about Lady Constance Why should Dorcas be so earnest to convince her handsome cousin that there was nothing in this rumour Rachel made no remark and there was a little silence I m so glad I succeeded in bringing you here said Dorcas Chelford made such a point of it and he thinks you are losing your spirits among the great trees and shadows of Redman s Dell and he made it quite a little cousinly duty that I should succeed At this moment mister Page interposed with the energetic prelude of his concluding ditty It was one of Tom Moore s melodies Rachel leaned back and seemed to enjoy it very much But when it was over I think she would have found it difficult to say what the song was about mister Page had now completed his programme and warned by the disrespectful violins from the gallery of the ball room whence a considerable caterwauling was already announcing the approach of the dance he made his farewell flourish and bow and smiling withdrew CHAPTER XXXVI THE BALL ROOM Rachel Lake standing by the piano turned over the leaves of the volume of Moore s Melodies from which the artist in black whiskers and white waistcoat 
5661-32891-0001	train-other-500	had just entertained his noble patroness and his audience Everyone has experienced I suppose for a few wonderful moments now and then a glow of seemingly causeless happiness
none	none	 in which the earth and its people 
5661-32891-0002	train-other-500	are glorified peace and sunlight rest on everything the spirit of music and love is in the air and the heart itself sings for joy In the light of this celestial illusion she stood now by the piano
5661-32891-0003	train-other-500	turning over the pages of poor Tom Moore as I have said when a low pleasant voice near her said I was so glad to see that Dorcas had prevailed and that you were here
5661-32891-0004	train-other-500	We both agreed that you are too much a recluse in that Der Frieschutz Glen at least for your friends pleasure and owe it to us all to appear now and then in this upper world
5661-32891-0005	train-other-500	Excelsior Miss Lake interposed dapper little mister Buttle with a smirk I think this little bit of music it was got up you know by that old quiz Dowager Lady Chelford
none	none	 was really not so bad a rather good idea after all 
5661-32891-0006	train-other-500	Miss Lake Don t you Poor mister Buttle did not know Lord Chelford
none	none	 and thus shooting his arrow o er the house 
5661-32891-0007	train-other-500	he hurt his brother Chelford turned away and bowed and smiled to one or two friends at the other side of the room Yes the music was very pretty and some of the songs were quite charmingly sung I agree with you
5661-32891-0008	train-other-500	we are very much obliged to Lady Chelford that is her son Lord Chelford Oh said Buttle whose smirk vanished on the instant in a very red and dismal vacancy I
none	none	 I m afraid 
5661-32891-0009	train-other-500	he ll think me shockingly rude And in a minute more Buttle was gone Miss Lake again looked down upon the page and as she did so Lord Chelford turned and said You are a worshipper of Tom Moore Miss Lake
5661-32891-0010	train-other-500	An admirer perhaps certainly no worshipper Yet I can t say Perhaps I do worship but if so it is a worship strangely mixed with contempt And she laughed a little
none	none	 A kind of adoring which I fancy belongs properly 
5661-32891-0011	train-other-500	to the lords of creation and which we of the weaker sex have no right to practise
none	none	 Miss Lake is pleased to be ironical to night he said with a smile Am I 
5661-32891-0012	train-other-500	I dare say All women are Irony is the weapon of cowardice and cowardice the vice of weakness
none	none	 Yet I think I was naturally bold and true I hate cowardice and deception even in myself I hate perfidy I hate fraud She tapped a little emphasis upon the floor with her white satin shoe 
5661-32891-0013	train-other-500	and her eyes flashed with a dark and angry meaning among the crowd at the other end of the room as if for a second or two following an object to whom in some way the statement applied
5661-32891-0014	train-other-500	The strange bitterness of her tone though it was low enough and something wild suffering and revengeful in her look though but momentary and hardly definable did not escape Lord Chelford
none	none	 and he followed unconsciously the direction of her glance but there was nothing there to guide him to a conclusion and the good people who formed that polite and animated mob were in his eyes one and all quite below the level of tragedy or even of melodrama And yet Miss Lake we are all more or less cowards or deceivers at least to the extent of suppression Who would speak the whole truth or like to hear it not I I know Nor I she said quietly 
5661-32891-0015	train-other-500	And I do think if people had no reserves they would be very uninteresting he added She was looking with a strange light upon her face a smile perhaps
none	none	 upon the open pages of Moore s Melodies as he spoke I like a little puzzle and mystery they surround our future and our past and the present would be insipid I think without them 
5661-32891-0016	train-other-500	Now I can t tell Miss Lake as you look on Tom Moore there and I try to read your smile whether you happen at this particular moment to adore or despise him Moore s is a daring morality
5661-32891-0017	train-other-500	what do you think for instance of these lines she said touching the verse with her bouquet Lord Chelford read I ask not I know not if guilt s in thy heart I but know that I love thee
5661-32891-0018	train-other-500	whatever thou art He laughed Very passionate but hardly respectable I once knew he continued a little more gravely a marriage made upon that principle and not very audaciously either
none	none	 which turned out very unhappily So I should conjecture she said rising from her chair rather drearily and abstractedly and there is good old Lady Sarah I must go and ask her how she does 
5661-32891-0019	train-other-500	She paused for a moment holding her bouquet drooping towards the floor and looking with her clouded eyes down down through it and then she looked up suddenly with an odd fierce smile and she said bitterly enough
none	none	 and yet if I were a man and capable of loving 
5661-32891-0020	train-other-500	I could love no other way because I suppose love to be a madness
none	none	 and the sublimest and the most despicable of states 
5661-32891-0021	train-other-500	And I admire Moore for that flash of the fallen angelic it is the sentiment of a hero and a madman too base and too noble for this cool wise world She was already moving away
5661-32891-0022	train-other-500	nebulous in hovering folds of snowy muslin And she floated down like a cloud upon the ottoman beside old Lady Sarah and smiled and leaned towards her and talked in her sweet low distinct accents
none	none	 And Lord Chelford followed her with a sad sort of smile admiring her greatly Of course non cuivis contigit it was not every man s privilege to dance with the splendid Lady of Brandon It was only the demigods who ventured within the circle Her kinsman Lord Chelford did so and now handsome Sir Harry Bracton six feet high so broad shouldered and slim waisted his fine but not very wise face irradiated with 
5661-32891-0023	train-other-500	indefatigable smiles stood and conversed with her with that jaunty swagger of his his weight now on this side now on that squaring his elbows like a crack whip with four in hand and wagging his perfumed tresses
5661-32891-0024	train-other-500	boisterous rollicking beaming with immeasurable self complacency Stanley Lake left old Lady Chelford s side and glided to that of Dorcas Brandon Will you dance this set
5661-32891-0025	train-other-500	are you engaged Miss Brandon he said in low eager tones Yes to both questions answered she with the faintest gleam of the conventional smile and looking now gravely again at her bouquet
5661-32891-0026	train-other-500	Well the next possibly I hope I never do that said the apathetic beauty serenely Stanley looked as if he did not quite understand and there was a little silence I mean
5661-32891-0027	train-other-500	I never engage myself beyond one dance I hope you do not think it rude but I never do Miss Brandon can make what laws she pleases for all here and for some of us everywhere he replied
5661-32891-0028	train-other-500	with a mortified smile and a bow At that moment Sir Harry Bracton arrived to claim her
none	none	 and Miss Kybes 
5661-32891-0029	train-other-500	elderly and sentimental and in no great request timidly said in a gobbling confidential whisper What a handsome couple they do make Does not it quite realise your conception Captain Lake
none	none	 of young Lochinvar you know 
5661-32891-0030	train-other-500	and his fair Helen So stately his form and so lovely her face You remember That never a hall such a galliard did grace Is not it So it is really
5661-32891-0031	train-other-500	it did not strike me And that one cup of wine you recollect which the hero drank and I dare say it made young Lochinvar a little noisy and swaggering when he proposed treading the measure is not that the phrase Yes really
none	none	 it is a very pretty poetical parallel And Miss Kybes was pleased to think that Captain Lake 
5661-32891-0032	train-other-500	would be sure to report her elegant little compliment in the proper quarters and that her incense had not missed fire
5661-32891-0033	train-other-500	When Miss Brandon returned Lake was unfortunately on duty beside old Lady Chelford whom it was important to propitiate and who was in the middle of a story an extraordinary favour from her ladyship
5661-32891-0034	train-other-500	and he had the vexation to see Lord Chelford palpably engaging Miss Brandon for the next dance When she returned she was a little tired and doubtful whether she would dance any more certainly not the next dance
none	none	 So he resolved to lie in wait and anticipate any new suitor who might appear His eyes however happened to wander in an unlucky moment to old Lady Chelford who instantaneously signalled to him with her fan the woman mentally exclaimed Lake telegraphing at the same time with a bow and a smile of deferential alacrity and making his way through the crowd as deftly as he could what a fool I was to go near her 
5661-32891-0035	train-other-500	So the captain had to assist at the dowager lady s supper and not only so but in some sort at her digestion also which she chose should take place for some ten minutes in the chair that she occupied at the supper table
5661-32891-0036	train-other-500	When he escaped Miss Brandon was engaged once more and to Sir Harry Bracton for a second time And moreover when he again essayed his suit
5661-32891-0037	train-other-500	the young lady had peremptorily made up her mind to dance no more that night How can Dorcas endure that man thought Rachel
none	none	 as she saw Sir Harry lead her to her seat after a second dance Handsome but so noisy and foolish and wicked 
5661-32891-0038	train-other-500	and is not he vulgar too But Dorcas was not demonstrative Her likings and dislikings were always more or less enigmatical Still Rachel Lake fancied that she detected signs
5661-32891-0039	train-other-500	not only of tolerance but of positive liking in her haughty cousin s demeanour and wondered after all whether Dorcas was beginning to like Sir Harry Bracton Dorcas had always puzzled her
5661-32891-0040	train-other-500	not indeed so much latterly but this night the mystery began to darken once more Twice for a moment their eyes met but only for a moment Rachel knew that a tragedy might be at that instant
5661-32891-0041	train-other-500	and under the influence of that very spectacle gathering its thunders silently in another part of the room where she saw Stanley s pale peculiar face
none	none	 and although he appeared in nowise occupied by what was passing between Dorcas Brandon and Sir Harry 
5661-32891-0042	train-other-500	she perfectly well knew that nothing of it escaped him The sight of that pale face was a cold pang at her heart a face prophetic of evil at sight of which the dark curtain which hid futurity
5661-32891-0043	train-other-500	seemed to sway and tremble as if a hand from behind was on the point of drawing it Rachel sighed profoundly and her eyes looked sadly through her bouquet on the floor
5661-32891-0044	train-other-500	I m very glad you came Radie said a sweet voice which somehow made her shiver close to her ear This kind of thing will do you good and you really wanted a little fillip
5661-32891-0045	train-other-500	Shall I take you to the supper room No Stanley thank you I prefer remaining Have you observed how Dorcas has treated me this evening No Stanley nothing unusual is there
none	none	 answered Rachel 
5661-32891-0046	train-other-500	glancing uneasily round lest they should be overheard
none	none	 Well I think she has been more than usually repulsive quite marked 
5661-32891-0047	train-other-500	I almost fancy these Gylingden people dull as they are
none	none	 must observe it I have a notion 
5661-32891-0048	train-other-500	I sha n t trouble Gylingden or her after to morrow Rachel glanced quickly at him He was deadly pale with his faint unpleasant smile and he returned her glance for a second wildly
5661-32891-0049	train-other-500	and then dropped his eyes to the ground I told you he resumed again after a short pause and commencing with a gentle laugh that she liked that fellow Bracton You did say something I think of that
5661-32891-0050	train-other-500	some time since said Rachel
none	none	 but really But really Radie dear you can t need any confirmation more than this evening affords 
5661-32891-0051	train-other-500	We both know Dorcas very well she is not like other girls She does not encourage fellows as they do but if she did not like Bracton very well indeed she would send him about his business She has danced with him twice
5661-32891-0052	train-other-500	on the contrary and has suffered his agreeable conversation all the evening and that from Dorcas Brandon means you know everything I don t know that it means anything
5661-32891-0053	train-other-500	I don t see why it should but I am very certain said Rachel who in the midst of this crowded gossiping ball room was talking much more freely to Stanley and also strange to say in more sisterly fashion
5661-32891-0054	train-other-500	than she would have done in the little parlour of Redman s Farm
none	none	 I am very certain Stanley that if this supposed preference leads you to abandon your wild pursuit of Dorcas 
5661-32891-0055	train-other-500	it will prevent more ruin than perhaps either of us anticipates and Stanley she added in a whisper looking full in his eyes which were raised for a moment to hers it is hardly credible
none	none	 that you dare still to persist in so desperate and cruel a project Thank you said Stanley quietly but the yellow lights glared fiercely from their sockets 
5661-32891-0056	train-other-500	and were then lowered instantly to the floor She has been very rude to me to night and you have not been or tried to be of any earthly use to me
none	none	 and I will take a decided course 
5661-32891-0057	train-other-500	I perfectly know what I m about You don t seem to be dancing I have not either we have both got something more serious I fancy to think of And Stanley Lake glided slowly away
none	none	 and was lost in the crowd He went into the supper room and had a glass of seltzer water and sherry He loitered at the table His ruminations were dreary I fancy and his temper by no means pleasant and it needed a good deal of that artificial command of countenance which he cultivated to prevent his betraying something of the latter when Sir Harry Bracton talking loud and volubly as usual swaggered into the supper room with Dorcas Brandon on his arm CHAPTER XXXVII THE SUPPER ROOM It was rather trying in this state of things to receive from the triumphant baronet with only a parenthetical Dear Lake I beg your pardon a rough knock on the elbow of the hand that held his glass and to be then summarily hustled out of his place It was no mitigation of the rudeness in Lake s estimate that Sir Harry was so engrossed and elated as to seem hardly conscious of any existence but Miss Brandon s and his own Lake was subject to transient paroxysms of exasperation but even in these be knew how to command himself pretty well before witnesses 
5661-32892-0001	train-other-500	His smile grew a little stranger and his face a degree whiter as he set down his glass quietly glided a little away and brushed off with his handkerchief the aspersion which his coat had suffered
5661-32892-0002	train-other-500	In a few minutes more Miss Brandon had left the supper room leaning upon Lord Chelford s arm and Sir Harry remained with a glass of pink champagne such as young fellows drink with a faith and comfort so wonderful
5661-32892-0003	train-other-500	at balls and fetes champetres Sir Harry Bracton was already chaffing a bit as he expressed it with the young lady who assisted in dispensing the good things across the supper table
5661-32892-0004	train-other-500	and was just calling up her blushes by a pretty parallel between her eyes and the sparkling quality of his glass and telling her her mamma must have been sweetly pretty
none	none	 Now Sir Harry s rudeness to Lake had not been I am afraid altogether accidental The baronet was sudden and vehement in his affairs of the heart but curable on short absences and easily transferable He had been vehemently enamoured of the heiress of Brandon a year ago and more 
5661-32892-0005	train-other-500	but during an absence Mark Wylder s suit grew up and prospered and Sir Harry Bracton acquiesced and to say truth the matter troubled his manly breast but little He had hardly expected to see her here in this rollicking rustic gathering
5661-32892-0006	train-other-500	She was he thought even more lovely than he remembered her Beauty sometimes seen again does excel our recollections of it Wylder had gone off the scene as mister Carlyle says into infinite space
none	none	 Who could tell exactly the cause of his dismissal and why the young lady had asserted her capricious resolve to be free There were pleasant theories adaptable to the circumstances and Sir Harry cherished an agreeable opinion of himself 
5661-32892-0007	train-other-500	and so all things favouring the old flame blazed up wildly and the young gentleman was more in love then and for some weeks after the ball than perhaps he had ever been before
none	none	 Now some men and Sir Harry was of them 
5661-32892-0008	train-other-500	are churlish and ferocious over their loves as certain brutes are over their victuals In one of these tender paroxysms when in the presence of his Dulcinea
5661-32892-0009	train-other-500	the young baronet was always hot short and saucy with his own sex and when his jealousy was ever so little touched positively impertinent He perceived what other people did not
none	none	 that Miss Brandon s eye once on that evening rested for a moment on Captain Lake with a peculiar expression of interest This look was but once and momentary but the young gentleman resented it 
5661-32892-0010	train-other-500	and brooded over it every now and then when the pale face of the captain crossed his eye and two or three times when the beautiful young lady s attention seemed unaccountably to wander from his agreeable conversation
5661-32892-0011	train-other-500	he thought he detected her haughty eye moving in the same direction So he looked that way too and although he could see nothing noticeable in Stanley s demeanour he could have felt it in his heart to box his ears
5661-32892-0012	train-other-500	Therefore I don t think he was quite so careful as he might have been to spare Lake that jolt upon the elbow which coming from a rival in a moment of public triumph was not altogether easy to bear like a Christian
none	none	 Some grapes please said Lake to the young lady behind the table Oh uncle Is that you Lake beg pardon but you are so like my poor dear uncle Langton I wish you d let me adopt you for an uncle He was such a pretty fellow with his fat white cheeks and long nose 
5661-32892-0013	train-other-500	and he looked half asleep Do pray Uncle Lake I should like it so and the baronet who was I am afraid what some people would term perhaps vulgar winked over his glass at the blooming confectioner
none	none	 who turned away and tittered over her shoulder at the handsome baronet s charming banter The girl having turned away to titter forgot Lake s grapes so he helped himself and leaning against the table 
5661-32892-0014	train-other-500	looked superciliously upon Sir Harry who was not to be deterred by the drowsy gaze of contempt with which the captain retorted his angry chaff Poor uncle died of love or chicken pox or something at forty
5661-32892-0015	train-other-500	You re not ailing Nunkie are you You do look wofully sick though too bad to lose a second uncle at the same early age
none	none	 You re near forty eh Nunkie and such a pretty fellow You ll take care of me in your will Nunkie won t you Come what will you leave me not much tin I m afraid No not much tin answered Lake but I ll leave you what you want more 
5661-32892-0016	train-other-500	my sense and decency with a request that you will use them for my sake You re a devilish witty fellow Lake take care your wit don t get you into trouble said the baronet chuckling and growing angrier
none	none	 for he saw the Hebe laughing and not being a ready man though given to banter he sometimes descended to menace in his jocularity I was just thinking your dulness might do the same for you drawled Lake When do you mean to pay Dawlings that bet on the Derby 
5661-32892-0017	train-other-500	demanded Sir Harry his face very red and only the ghost of his smile grinning there I think you d better of course it is quite easy The baronet was smiling his best with a very red face
5661-32892-0018	train-other-500	and that unpleasant uncertainty in his contracted eyes which accompanies suppressed rage As easy as that said Lake chucking a little bunch of grapes full into Sir Harry Bracton s handsome face
5661-32892-0019	train-other-500	Lake recoiled a step his face blanched as white as the cloth his left arm lifted and his right hand grasping the haft of a table knife There was just a second in which the athletic baronet stood as it were breathless and incredulous
5661-32892-0020	train-other-500	and then his Herculean fist whirled in the air with a most unseemly oath the girl screamed and a crash of glass and crockery whisked away by their coats resounded on the ground A chair between Lake and Sir Harry
5661-32892-0021	train-other-500	impeded the baronet s stride and his uplifted arm was caught by a gentleman in moustache who held so fast that there was no chance of shaking it loose D it Bracton d you
none	none	 what the devil don t be a fool and other soothing expressions escaped this peacemaker as he clung fast to the young baronet s arm The people hang it you ll have all the people about you Quiet quiet can t you 
5661-32892-0022	train-other-500	I say Settle it quietly Here I am
none	none	 Well let me go that will do said he 
5661-32892-0023	train-other-500	glowering furiously at Lake who confronted him in the same attitude a couple of yards away You ll hear and he turned away
5661-32892-0024	train-other-500	I am at the Brandon Arms till to morrow said Lake with white lips very quietly to the gentleman in moustaches who bowed slightly and walked out of the room with Sir Harry
5661-32892-0025	train-other-500	Lake poured out some sherry in a tumbler and drank it off He was a little bit stunned I think in his new situation Except for the waiters and the actors in it
none	none	 it so happened that the supper room was empty during this sudden fracas 
5661-32892-0026	train-other-500	Lake stared at the frightened girl in his fierce abstraction Then with his wild gaze he followed the line of his adversary s retreat and shook his ears slightly like a man at whose hair a wasp has buzzed
5661-32892-0027	train-other-500	Thank you said he to the maid suddenly recollecting himself with a sort of smile that will do What confounded nonsense He ll be quite cool again in five minutes Never mind
5661-32892-0028	train-other-500	And Lake pulled on his white glove glancing down the file of silent waiters some looking frightened and some reserved in white ties and waistcoats and he glided out of the room his mind somewhere else
5661-32892-0029	train-other-500	like a somnambulist It was not perfectly clear to the gentlemen and ladies in charge of the ices chickens and champagne between which of the three swells who had just left the room the quarrel was it had come so suddenly
5661-32892-0030	train-other-500	and was over so quickly like a clap of thunder Some had not seen any and others only a bit of it
none	none	 being busy with plates and ice tubs and the few who had seen it all did not clearly comprehend it only it was certain that the row had originated in jealousy about Miss Jones the pretty apprentice who was judiciously withdrawn forthwith by missus Page the properest of confectioners CHAPTER XXXVIII AFTER THE BALL Lake glided from the feast with a sense of a tremendous liability upon him There was no retreat The morning yes the morning what then Should he live to see the evening Sir Harry Bracton was the crack shot of Swivel s gallery He could hit a walking cane at fifteen yards at the word There he was talking to old Lady Chelford Very well and there was that fellow with the twisted moustache plainly an officer and a gentleman twisting the end of one of them and thinking profoundly with his back to the wall evidently considering his coming diplomacy with Lake s friend Aye by the bye and Lake s eye wandered in bewilderment among village dons and elderly country gentlemen in search of that inestimable treasure These thoughts went whisking and whirling round in Captain Lake s brain to the roar and clatter of the Joinville Polka to which fifty pair of dancing feet were hopping and skimming over the floor Monstrous hot Sir hey ha ha by Jove said Major Jackson who had just returned from the supper room where he had heard several narratives of the occurrence Don t think I was so hot since the ball at Government House by Jove Sir in eighteen twenty eight awful summer that The major was jerking his handkerchief under his florid nose and chin by way of ventilation and eyeing the young man shrewdly the while to read what he might of the story in his face Been in Calcutta Lake No very hot indeed Could I say just a word with you this way a little So glad I met you And they edged into a little nook of the lobby where they had a few minutes confidential talk during which the major looked grave and consequential and carried his head high nodding now and then with military decision Major Jackson whispered an abrupt word or two in his ear and threw back his head eyeing Lake with grave and sly defiance Then came another whisper and a wink and the major shook his hand briefly but hard and the gentlemen parted Lake strolled into the ball room and on to the upper end where the best people are and suddenly he was in Miss Brandon s presence I ve been very presumptuous I fear to night Miss Brandon he said in his peculiar low tones I ve been very importunate I prized the honour I sought so very much I forgot how little I deserved it And I do not think it likely you ll see me for a good while possibly for a very long time I ve therefore ventured to come merely to say good bye only that just good bye And and to beg that flower and he plucked it resolutely from her bouquet which I will keep while I live Good bye Miss Brandon And Captain Stanley Lake that pale apparition was gone I do not know at all how Miss Brandon felt at this instant for I never could quite understand that strange lady But I believe she looked a little pale as she gravely adjusted the flowers so audaciously violated by the touch of the cool young gentleman I can t say whether Miss Brandon deigned to follow him with her dark dreamy gaze I rather think not And three minutes afterwards he had left the Town Hall The Brandon party did not stay very late And they dropped Rachel at her little dwelling How very silent Dorcas was thought Rachel as they drove from Gylingden Perhaps others were thinking the same of Rachel Next morning at half past seven o clock a dozen or so of rustics under command of Major Jackson arrived at the back entrance of Brandon Hall bearing Stanley Lake upon a shutter with glassy eyes that did not seem to see sunken face and a very blue tinge about his mouth The major fussed into the house and saw and talked with Larcom who was solemn and bland upon the subject and went out first to make personal inspection of the captain who seemed to him to be dying He was shot somewhere in the shoulder or breast they could not see exactly where nor disturb him as he lay A good deal of blood had flowed from him upon the arm and side of one of the men who supported his head Lake said nothing he only whispered rather indistinctly one word water and was not able to lift his head when it came and when they poured it into and over his lips he sighed and closed his eyes It is not a bad sign bleeding so freely but he looks devilish shaky you see I ve seen lots of our fellows hit you know and I don t like his looks poor fellow You d better see Lord Chelford this minute He could not stand being brought all the way to the town I ll run down and send up the doctor and he ll take him on if he can bear it Major Jackson did not run Though I have seen with an astonishment that has never subsided fellows just as old and as fat and braced up besides in the inflexibilities of regimentals keeping up at double quick at the heads of their companies for a good quarter of a mile before the colonel on horseback mercifully called a halt He walked at his best pace however and indeed was confoundedly uneasy about his own personal liabilities The major surprised Doctor Buddle shaving He popped in unceremoniously The fat little doctor received him in drawers and a very tight web worsted shirt standing by the window at which dangled a small looking glass By George Sir they ve been at mischief burst forth the major and the doctor razor in hand listened with wide open eyes and half his face lathered to the story Before it was over the doctor shaved the unshorn side and the major still in the room completed his toilet in hot haste Honest Major Jackson was very uncomfortable Of course Buddle could not give any sort of opinion upon a case which he had not seen but it described uglily and the major consulted in broken hints with an uneasy wink or two about a flight to Boulogne Well it will be no harm to be ready but take no step till I come back said the doctor who had stuffed a great roll of lint and plaister and some other medicinals into one pocket and his leather case of instruments forceps probe scissors and all the other steel and silver horrors into the other so he strutted forth in his great coat unnaturally broad about the hips and the major devilish uncomfortable accompanied him at a smart pace to the great gate of Brandon He did not care to enter feeling a little guilty although he explained on the way all about the matter How devilish stiff Bracton s man was about it And by Jove Sir you know what was to be said for Lake like a fool chucked a lot of grapes in his face for nothing by George The doctor short and broad was now stumping up the straight avenue under the noble trees that roofed it over and Major Jackson sauntered about in the vicinity of the gate more interested in Lake s safety than he would have believed possible a day or two before Lord Chelford being an early man was notwithstanding the ball of the preceding night dressing when saint Ange his Swiss servant knocked at his door with a dozen pockethandkerchiefs a bottle of eau de cologne and some other properties of his metier saint Ange could not wait until he had laid them down but broke out with Oh mi Lor qu est il arrive le pauvre capitaine il est tue il se meurt he dies d un coup de pistolet He comes de se battre from beating himself in duel il a ete atteint dans la poitrine le pauvre gentil homme of a blow of the pistol And so on the young nobleman gathering the facts as best he might Is Larcom there In the gallery mi lor Ask him to come in So Monsieur Larcom entered and bowed ominously You ve seen him Larcom Is he very much hurt He appears my lord to me I regret to say almost a dying like Very weak Does he speak to you Not a word my lord Since he got a little water he s quite quiet Poor fellow Where have you put him In the housekeeper s lobby my lord I rather think he s a dying He looks uncommon bad and I and missus Esterbroke the housekeeper my lord thought you would not like he should die out of doors Has she got your mistress s directions Miss Brandon is not called up my lord and missus Esterbroke is unwillin to halarm her so she thought it better I should come for orders to your lordship which she thinks also the poor young gentleman is certainly a dying Is there any vacant bed room near where you have placed him What does missus the housekeeper say She thinks my lord the room hopposit where mister Sledd the architeck slep when ere would answer very nice It is roomy and hairy and no steps Major Jackson who is gone to the town to fetch the doctor my lord says mister Lake won t a bear carriage and so the room on the level my lord would perhaps be more convenient Certainly tell her so I will speak to Miss Brandon when she comes down How soon will the doctor be here From a quarter to half an hour my lord Then tell the housekeeper to arrange as she proposes and don t remove his clothes until the doctor comes Everyone must assist I know saint Ange you ll like to assist So Larcom withdrew ceremoniously and Lord Chelford hastened his toilet and was down stairs and in the room assigned by the housekeeper to the ill starred Captain Lake before Doctor Buddle had arrived It had already the dismal character of a sick chamber Its light was darkened its talk was in whispers and its to ings and fro ings on tip toe An obsolete chambermaid had been already installed as nurse Little missus Esterbroke the housekeeper was fussing hither and thither about the room noiselessly So this gay astute man of fashion had fallen into the dungeon of sudden darkness and the custody of old women and lay helpless in the stocks awaiting the judgment of Buddle Ridiculous little pudgy Buddle how awful on a sudden are you grown the interpreter of death in this very case My case thought that seemingly listless figure on the bed my case I suppose it is fatal I am to go out of this room in a long cloth covered box I am going to try alone and for ever the value of those theories of futurity and the unseen which I have quietly scouted all my days Oh that the prophet Buddle were here to end my tremendous suspense and to announce a reprieve from Heaven While the wounded captain lay on the bed with his clothes on and the coverlet over him and that clay coloured apathetic face with closed eyes upon the pillow without sigh or motion not a whispered word escaped him but his brain was appalled and his heart died within him in the unspeakable horror of death Lord Chelford too having looked on Lake with silent but awful misgivings longed for the arrival of the doctor and was listening and silent when Buddle s short step and short respiration were heard in the passage So Larcom came to the door to announce the doctor in a whisper and Buddle fussed into the room and made his bow to Lord Chelford and his brief compliments and condolences Not asleep he enquired standing by the bed The captain s lips moved a disclaimer I suppose but no sound came So the doctor threw open the window shutters and clipped Stanley Lake s exquisite coat ruthlessly through with his scissors and having cleared the room of all useless hands he made his examination It was a long visit Buddle in the hall afterwards declined breakfast he had a board to attend He told Lord Chelford that the case was a very nasty one In fact the chances were against the captain and he Buddle would wish a consultation with a London surgeon whoever Lord Chelford lead most confidence in Sir Francis Seddley he thought would be very desirable but of course it was for the family to decide If the messenger caught the quarter to eleven up train at Dollington he would be in London at six and could return with the doctor by the down mail train and so reach Dollington at ten minutes past four next morning which would answer as he would not operate sooner As the doctor toddled towards Gylingden with sympathetic Major Tackson by his side before they entered the town they were passed by one of the Brandon men riding at a hard canter for Dollington London shouted the doctor as the man touched his hat in passing Yes Sir Glad o that said the major looking after him So am I said the learned Buddle I don t see how we re to get the bullet out of him without mischief Poor devil I m afraid he ll do no good The ladies that morning had tea in their rooms It was near twelve o clock when Lord Chelford saw Miss Brandon She was in the conservatory amongst her flowers and on seeing him stepped into the drawing room I hope Dorcas you are not angry with me I ve been I m afraid very impertinent but I was called on to decide for you in your absence and they all thought poor Lake could not be moved on to Gylingden without danger You did quite rightly Chelford and I thank you said Miss Brandon coldly and she seated herself and continued Pray what does the doctor really say He speaks very seriously Does he think there is danger Very great danger Miss Brandon looked down and then with a pale gaze suddenly in Chelford s face He thinks he may die said she Yes said Lord Chelford in a very low tone returning her gaze solemnly And nobody to advise but that village doctor Buddle that s hardly credible I think Pardon me At his suggestion I have sent for Sir Francis Seddley from town and I hope he may arrive early to morrow morning Why Stanley Lake may die to day He does not apprehend that But it is necessary to remove the bullet and the operation will be critical and it is for that specially that Sir Francis is coming down It is to take place to morrow and he ll die in that operation You know he ll die said Dorcas pale and fierce I assure you Dorcas I have been perfectly frank He looks upon poor Lake as in very great danger but that is all What brutes you men are said Dorcas with a wild scorn in her look and accent and her cheeks flushed with passion You knew quite well last night there was to be this wicked duel in the morning and you a magistrate a lord lieutenant what are you you connived at this bloody conspiracy and he your own cousin Chelford your cousin Chelford looked at her very much amazed Yes you are worse than Sir Harry Bracton for you re no fool and worse than that wicked old man Major Jackson who shall never enter these doors again for he was employed trusted in their brutal plans but you had no excuse and every opportunity and you have allowed your Cousin Stanley to be murdered You do me great injustice Dorcas I did not know or even suspect that a hostile meeting between poor Lake and Bracton was thought of I merely heard that there had been some trifling altercation in the supper room and when intending to make peace between them I alluded to it just before we left and Bracton said it was really nothing quite blown over and that he could not recollect what either had said I was entirely deceived you know I speak truth quite deceived They think it fair you know to dupe other people in such affairs and I will also say he continued a little haughtily that you might have spared your censure until at least you had heard what I had to say I do believe you Chelford you are not vexed with me Won t you shake hands He took her hand with a smile And now said she Chelford ought not we to send for poor Rachel her only brother Is not it sad Certainly shall I ask my mother or will you write I will write she said CHAPTER XXXIX IN WHICH MISS RACHEL LAKE COMES TO BRANDON AND DOCTOR BUDDLE CALLS AGAIN In about an hour afterwards Rachel Lake arrived in the carriage which had been despatched for her with Dorcas s note She was a good deal muffled up and looked very pale and asked whether Miss Brandon was in her room whither she glided rapidly up stairs It was a sort of boudoir or dressing room with a few pretty old portraits and miniatures and a number of Louis Quatorze looking glasses hung round and such pretty quaint cabriole gilt and pale green furniture Dorcas met her at the door and they kissed silently How is he Dorcas Very ill dear I m afraid sit down darling Rachel was relieved for in her panic she almost feared to ask if he were living Is there immediate danger The doctor says not but he is very much alarmed for to morrow Oh Dorcas darling he ll die I know it Oh merciful Heaven how tremendous You will not be so frightened in a little time You have only just heard it Rachel dearest and you are startled I was so myself I d like to see him Dorcas Sit here a little and rest dear The doctor will make his visit immediately and then we can ask him He s a good natured little creature poor old Buddle and I am certain if it can safely be he won t prevent it Where is he darling where is Stanley So Dorcas described as well as she could Oh poor Stanley Oh Stanley poor Stanley gasped Rachel with white lips You have no idea Dorcas no one can how terrific it is Oh poor Stanley poor Stanley Drink this water darling you must not be so excited Dorcas say what the doctor may see him I must There is time to think of that darling Has he spoken to anyone Very little I believe He whispers a few words now and then that is all Nothing to Chelford nothing particular I mean No nothing at least that I have heard of Did he wish to see no one No one dear Not poor William Wylder No dear I don t suppose he cares more for a clergyman than for any other man none of his family ever did when they came to lie on a bed of sickness or of death either No no said Rachel wildly I did not mean to pray I was not thinking of that but William Wylder was different and he did not mention me either Dorcas shook her head I knew it continued Rachel with a kind of shudder And tell me Dorcas does he know that he is in danger such imminent danger That I cannot say Rachel dear I don t believe doctors like to tell their patients so There was a silence of some minutes and Rachel clasping her hands in an agony said Oh yes he s gone he s certainly gone and I remain alone under that dreadful burden Please Miss Brandon the doctor s down stairs with Captain Lake said the maid opening the door Is Lord Chelford with him Yes Miss please Then tell him I will be so obliged if he will come here for a moment when the doctor is gone and ask the doctor now from me how he thinks Captain Lake In a little while the maid returned Captain Lake was not so low and rather better than this morning the doctor said and Rachel raised her eyes and whispered an agitated thanksgiving Was Lord Chelford coming His lordship had left the room when she returned and mister Larcom said he was with Lawyer Larkin in the library mister Larkin can wait Tell Lord Chelford I wish very much to see him here So away went the maid again A message in that great house was a journey and there was a little space before they heard a knock at the door of Dorcas s pretty room and Lord Chelford duly invited came in Lord Chelford was surprised to see Rachel and held her hand while he congratulated her on the more favourable opinion of the physician this afternoon and then he gave them as fully and exactly as he could all the lights emitted by doctor Buddle and endeavoured to give his narrative as cheerful and confident an air as he could Then at length he recollected that mister Larkin was waiting in the study I quite forgot mister Larkin said he I left him in the library and I am so very glad we have had a pleasanter report upon poor Lake this evening and I am sure we shall all feel more comfortable on seeing Sir Francis Seddley He is such an admirable surgeon and I feel sure he ll strike out something for our poor patient I ve known him hit upon such original expedients and make such wonderful successes So with a kind smile he left the room Then there was a long pause Does he really think that Stanley will recover said Rachel I don t know I suppose he hopes it I don t know Rachel what to think of anyone or anything What wild beasts they are How swift to shed blood as poor William Wylder said last Sunday Have you any idea what they quarrelled about None in the world It was that odious Sir Harry Bracton was not it Why so odious Rachel How can you tell which was in the wrong I only know he seems to be a better marksman than your poor brother Rachel looked at her with something of haughty and surprised displeasure but said nothing You look at me Radie as if I were a monster or monstress I should say whereas I am only a Brandon Don t you remember how our great ancestor who fought for the House of York changed suddenly to Lancaster and how Sir Richard left the King and took part with Cromwell not for any particular advantage I believe or for any particular reason even but for wickedness and wounded pride perhaps I don t quite see your meaning Dorcas I can t understand how your pride has been hurt but if Stanley had any I can well imagine what torture it must have endured wretched wicked punished fool You suspect what they fought about Radie Rachel made no answer You do Radie and why do you dissemble with me I don t dissemble I don t care to speak but if you will have me say so I do suspect I think it must have originated in jealousy of you You look Radie as if you thought I had managed it whereas I really did not care I do not understand you Dorcas but you appear to me very cruel and you smile as I say so I smile because I sometimes think so myself With a fixed and wrathful stare Rachel returned the enigmatical gaze of her beautiful cousin If Stanley dies Dorcas Sir Harry Bracton shall hear of it I ll lose my life but he shall pay the forfeit of his crime So saying Rachel left the room and gliding through passages and down stairs she knocked at Stanley s door The old woman opened it Ah Dorothy I m so glad to see you here and she put a present in her hard crumpled hand So noiselessly Rachel Lake without more parley stepped into the room and closed the door She was alone with Stanley With a beating heart and a kind of chill stealing over her by her brother s bed The room was not so dark that she could not see distinctly enough There lay her brother such as he was still her brother on the bleak neutral ground between life and death His features peaked and earthy and that look so new and peculiar which does not savour of life upon them He did not move but his strange eyes gazed cold and earnest from their deep sockets upon her face in awful silence Perhaps he thought he saw a phantom Are you better dear whispered Rachel His lips stirred and his throat but he did not speak until a second effort brought utterance and he murmured Is that you Radie Yes dear Are you better No I m shot I shall die to night Is it night yet Don t despair Stanley dear The great London doctor Sir Francis Seddley will be with you early in the morning and Chelford has great confidence in him I m sure he will relieve you This is Brandon murmured Lake Yes dear She thought he was going to say more but he remained silent and she recollected that he ought not to speak and also that she had that to say which must be said Sharp dark and strange lay that familiar face upon the white pillow The faintest indication of something like a peevish sneer it might be only the lines of pain and fatigue still it had that unpleasant character remaining fixed on its features Oh Stanley you say you think you are dying Won t you send for William Wylder and Chelford and tell all you know of Mark She saw he was about to say something and she leaned her head near his lips and she heard him whisper It won t serve Mark I m thinking of you Stanley I m thinking of you To which he said either Yes or So She could not distinguish I view it now quite differently You said you know in the park you would tell Chelford and I resisted I believe but I don t now I had rather you did Yes Stanley I conjure you to tell it all The cold lips with a livid halo round them murmured Thank you It was a sneer very shocking just then perhaps but unquestionably a sneer Poor Stanley she murmured with a kind of agony looking down upon that changed face One word more Stanley Remember it s I the only one on earth who stands near you in kindred your sister Stanley who implores of you to take this step before it is too late at least to consider He said something She thought it was I ll think and then he closed his eyes It was the only motion she had observed his face lay just as it had done on the pillow He had not stirred all the time she was there and now that his eyelids closed it seemed to say our interview is over the curtain has dropped and so understanding it with that one awful look that may be the last she glided from the bed side told old Dorothy that he seemed disposed to sleep and left the room There is something awful always in the spectacle of such a sick bed as that beside which Rachel had just stood But not quite so dreadful is the sight as are the imaginings and the despair of absence So reassuring is the familiar spectacle of life even in its subsidence so long as bodily torture and mental aberration are absent In the meanwhile on his return to the library Lord Chelford found his dowager mother in high chat with the attorney whom she afterwards pronounced a very gentlemanlike man for his line of life The conversation indeed was chiefly that of Lady Chelford the exemplary attorney contributing for the most part a polite acquiescence and those reflections which most appositely pointed the moral of her ladyship s tale which concerned altogether the vagaries of Mark Wylder a subject which piqued her curiosity and irritated her passions It was a great day for Jos Larkin for by the time Lord Chelford returned the old lady had asked him to stay for dinner which he did notwithstanding his morning dress to his great inward satisfaction because he could henceforward mention the other day when I dined at Brandon or old Lady Chelford assured me when last I dined at Brandon and he could more intimately speak of our friends at Brandon and the Brandon people and in short this dinner was very serviceable to the excellent attorney It was not very amusing this interchange of thought and feeling between Larkin and the dowager upon a theme already so well ventilated as Mark Wylder s absconding and therefore I let it pass After dinner when the dowager s place knew her no more Lord Chelford resumed his talk with Larkin I am quite confirmed in the view I took at first he said Wylder has no claim upon me There are others on whom much more naturally the care of his money would devolve and I think that my undertaking the office he proposes under his present strange circumstances might appear like an acquiescence in the extraordinary course he has taken and a sanction generally of his conduct which I certainly can t approve So mister Larkin I have quite made up my mind I have no business to undertake this trust simple as it is I have only my lord to bow to your lordship s decision at the same time I cannot but feel my lord how peculiar and painful is the position in which it places me There are rents to be received by me and sums handed over to a considerable I may say indeed a very large amount and my friend Lake Captain Lake now unhappily in so very precarious a state appears to dislike the office also and to anticipate annoyance in the event of his consenting to act Altogether your lordship will perceive that the situation is one of considerable indeed very great embarrassment as respects me There is however one satisfactory circumstance disclosed in his last letter His return he says cannot be delayed beyond a very few months perhaps weeks and he states in his own rough way that he will then explain the motives of his conduct to the entire satisfaction of all those who are cognizant of the measures which he has adopted no more claret thanks no more a delicious wine and he adds it will then be quite understood that he has acted neither from caprice nor from any motive other than self preservation I assure you my lord that is the identical phrase he employs self preservation I all along suspected or rather I mean supposed that mister Wylder had been placed in this matter under coercion a a threat A little more wine asked Lord Chelford after another interval No no more I thank you Your lordship s very good and the wine I may say excellent delicious claret indeed quite so ninety shillings a dozen I should venture to say and hardly to be had at that figure but it grows late I rather think and the trustees of our little Wesleyan chapel we ve got a little into debt in that quarter I am sorry to say and I promised to advise with them this evening at nine o clock They have called me to counsel more than once poor fellows and so with your lordship s permission I ll withdraw Lord Chelford walked with him to the steps It was a beautiful night very little moon but that and the stars wonderfully clear and bright and all things looking so soft and airy Try one of these said the peer presenting his cigar case Larkin with a glow of satisfaction took one of these noble cigars and rolled it in his fingers and smelt it Fragrant wonderfully fragrant he observed meekly with a connoisseur s shake of the head The night was altogether so charming that Lord Chelford was tempted So he took his cap and lighted his cigar too and strolled a little way with the attorney He walked under the solemn trees the same under whose airy groyning Wylder and Lake had walked away together on that noteworthy night on which Mark had last turned his back upon the grand old gables and twisted chimneys of Brandon Hall This way was rather a round it must be confessed to the Lodge Jos Larkin s peaceful retreat But a stroll with a lord was worth more than that sacrifice and every incident which helped to make a colourable case of confidential relations at Brandon a point in which the good attorney had been rather weak hitherto was justly prized by that virtuous man If the trustees Smith the pork butcher old Captain Snoggles the Town Clerk and the rest had to wait some twenty minutes in the drawing room at the Lodge so much the better An apology was perhaps the best and most modest shape into which he could throw the advertisement of his dinner at Brandon his confidential talk with the proud old dowager and his after dinner ramble with that rising young peer Lord Chelford It would lead him gracefully into detail and altogether the idea the situation the scene and prospect were so soothing and charming that the good attorney felt a silent exaltation as he listened to Lord Chelford s two or three delighted sentences upon the illimitable wonders and mysteries glimmering in the heavens above them The cigar was delicious the air balmy and pleasant his digestion happy the society unexceptionably aristocratic a step had just been gained and his consideration in the town and the country round improved by the occurrences of the evening and his whole system in consequence in a state so serene sweet and satisfactory that I really believe there was genuine moisture in his pink dove like eyes as he lifted them to the heavens and murmured Beautiful beautiful And he mistook his sensations for a holy rapture and silent worship Cigars like other pleasures are transitory Lord Chelford threw away his stump tendered his case again to mister Larkin and then took his leave walking slowly homewards CHAPTER XL THE ATTORNEY S ADVENTURES ON THE WAY HOME mister Jos Larkin was now moving alone under the limbs of the Brandon trees He knew the path as he had boasted to Lord Chelford from his boyhood and as he pursued his way his mind got upon the accustomed groove and amused itself with speculations respecting the vagaries of Mark Wylder I wonder what his lordship thinks He was very close very ruminated Larkin no distinct ideas about it possibly and did not seem to wish to lead me to the subject Can he know anything Eh can he possibly Those high fellows are very knowing often so much on the turf and all that very sharp and very deep He was thinking of a certain noble lord in difficulties who had hit a client of his rather hard and whose affairs did not reflect much credit upon their noble conductor Aye I dare say deep enough and intimate with the Lakes He expects to be home in two months time He s a deep fellow too he does not like to let people know what he s about I should not be surprised if he came to morrow Lake and Lord Chelford may both know more than they say Why should they both object merely to receive and fund his money They think he wants to get them into a fix hey If I m to conduct his business I ought to know it if he keeps a secret from me affecting all his business relations like this and driving him about the world like an absconding bankrupt how can I advise him All this drifted slowly through his mind and each suggestion had its collateral speculations and so it carried him pleasantly a good way on his walk and he was now in the shadow of the dense copsewood that mantles the deep ravine which debouches into Redman s Dell The road was hardly two yards wide and the wood walled it in and overhung it occasionally in thick irregular masses As the attorney marched leisurely onward he saw or fancied that he saw now and then in uncertain glimpses something white in motion among the trees beside him At first he did not mind but it continued and grew gradually unpleasant It might be a goat a white goat but no it was too tall for that Had he seen it at all Aye there it was no mistake now A poacher maybe But their poachers were not of the dangerous sort and there had not been a robber about Gylingden within the memory of man Besides why on earth should either show himself in that absurd way He stopped he listened he stared suspiciously into the profound darkness Then he thought he heard a rustling of the leaves near him and he hallooed Who s there But no answer came So taking heart of grace he marched on still zealously peering among the trees until coming to an opening in the pathway he more distinctly saw a tall white figure standing in an ape like attitude with its arms extended grasping two boughs and stooping as if peeping cautiously as he approached The good attorney drew up and stared at this gray phantasm saying to himself Yes in a sort of quiet hiss He stopped in a horror and as he gazed the figure suddenly drew back and disappeared Very pleasant this said the attorney after a pause recovering a little What on earth can it be Jos Larkin could not tell which way it had gone He had already passed the midway point where this dark path begins to descend through the ravine into Redman s Dell He did not like going forward but to turn back might bring him again beside the mysterious figure And though he was not of course afraid of ghosts nor in this part of the world of robbers yet somehow he did not know what to make of this gigantic gray monkey So not caring to stay longer and seeing nothing to be gained by turning back the attorney buttoned the top button of his coat and holding his head very erect and placing as much as he could of the path between himself and the side where the figure had disappeared marched on steadily It was too dark and the way not quite regular enough to render any greater speed practicable From the thicket as he proceeded he heard a voice he had often shot woodcocks in that cover calling in a tone that sounded in his ears like banter Mark Mark Mark Mark He stopped holding his breath and the sound ceased Well this certainly is not usual murmured mister Larkin who was a little more perturbed than perhaps he quite cared to acknowledge even to himself Some fellow perhaps watching for a friend or tricks maybe Then the attorney trying his supercilious smile in the dark listened again for a good while but nothing was heard except those whisperings of the wind which poets speak of He looked before him with his eyebrows screwed in a vain effort to pierce the darkness and the same behind him and then after another pause he began uncomfortably to move down the path once more In a short time the same voice with the same uncertain echo among the trees cried faintly Mark Mark and then a pause then again Mark Mark Mark and then it grew more distant and sounded among the trees and reverberations of the glen like laughter Mark ha ha hark ha ha ha hark Mark Mark ha ha hark Who s there cried the attorney in a tone rather ferocious from fright and stamping on the path But his summons and the provocation died away together in the profoundest silence mister Jos Larkin did not repeat his challenge This cry of Mark was beginning to connect itself uncomfortably in his mind with his speculations about his wealthy client which in that solitude and darkness began to seem not so entirely pure and disinterested as he was in the habit of regarding them and a sort of wood demon such as a queer little schoolfellow used long ago to read a tale about in an old German story book was now dogging his darksome steps and hanging upon his flank with a vindictive design Jos Larkin was not given to fancy nor troubled with superstition His religion was of a comfortable punctual business like cast which according with his genius denied him indeed some things for which in truth he had no taste but in no respect interfered with his main mission upon earth which was getting money He had found no difficulty hitherto in serving God and Mammon The joint business prospered Let us suppose it was one of those falterings of faith which try the best men that just now made him feel a little queer and gave his thoughts about Mark Wylder now grown habitual that new and ghastly complexion which made the situation so unpleasant He wished himself more than once well out of this confounded pass and listened nervously for a good while and stared once more half frightened in various directions into the darkness If I thought there could be anything the least wrong or reprehensible we are all fallible in my allowing my mind to turn so much upon my client I can certainly say I should be very far from allowing it I shall certainly consider it and I may promise myself to decide in a Christian spirit and if there be a doubt to give it against myself This resolution which was he trusted that of a righteous man was I am afraid the effect rather of fright than reflection and employed in that sense somewhat in the manner of an exorcism whispered rather to the ghost than to his conscience I am sure Larkin did not himself suppose this On the contrary he really believed I am convinced that he scouted the ghost and had merely volunteered this salutary self examination as an exercise of conscience He could not however have doubted that he was very nervous and that he would have been glad of the companionship even of one of the Gylingden shopkeepers through this infested bit of wood Having again addressed himself to his journey he was now approaching that part of the path where the trees recede a little leaving a considerable space unoccupied at either side of his line of march Here there was faint moonlight and starlight very welcome but a little in advance of him where the copsewood closed in again just above those stone steps which Lake and his sister Rachel had mounted together upon the night of the memorable rendezvous he fancied that he again saw the gray figure cowering among the foremost stems of the wood It was a great shock He stopped short and as he stared upon the object he felt that electric chill and rising of the hair which accompany supernatural panic As he gazed however it was gone Yes At all events he could see it no more Had he seen it there at all He was in such an odd state he could not quite trust himself He looked back hesitatingly But he remembered how very long and dark the path that way was and how unpleasant his adventures there had been And although there was a chance that the gray monkey was lurking somewhere near the path still there was now but a short space between him and the broad carriage track down Redman s Dell and once upon that he considered himself almost in the street of Gylingden So he made up his mind and marched resolutely onward and had nearly reached that point at which the converging screen of thicket again overshadows the pathway when close at his side he saw the tall white figure push itself forward among the branches and in a startling under tone of enquiry like a conspirator challenging his brother a voice the same which he had so often heard during this walk cried over his shoulder Mark Wylder Larkin sprung back a pace or two turning his face full upon the challenger who in his turn was perhaps affrighted for the same voice uttered a sort of strangled shriek and he heard the branches crack and rustle as he pushed his sudden retreat through them leaving the attorney more horrified than ever No other sound but the melancholy soughing of the night breeze and the hoarse murmur of the stream rising from the stony channel of Redman s Dell were now or during the remainder of his walk through these haunted grounds again audible So with rapid strides passing the dim gables of Redman s Farm he at length found himself with a sense of indescribable relief upon the Gylingden road and could see the twinkling lights in the windows of the main street CHAPTER XLI IN WHICH SIR FRANCIS SEDDLEY MANIPULATES At about two o clock Buddle was called up and spirited away to Brandon in a dog cart A haemorrhage perhaps a sudden shivering and inflammation a sinking maybe or delirium some awful change probably for Buddle did not return Old Major Jackson heard of it in his early walk at Buddle s door He had begun to grow more hopeful But hearing this he walked home and replaced the dress coat and silk stockings he had ventured to remove promptly in his valise which he buckled down and locked swallowed with agitated voracity some fragments of breakfast got on his easy boots and gaiters brushed his best hat and locked it into its leather case placed his rug great coat and umbrella and a rough walking stick for service and a gold tipped exquisite cane for duty on promenades of fashion neatly on top of his valise and with his old white hat and shooting coat on looking and whistling as much as possible as usual he popped carelessly into John Hobbs s stable where he was glad to see three horses standing and he mentally chose the black cob for his flight to Dollington A bloodthirsty rascal that Bracton muttered the major The expenses were likely to be awful and some allowance was to be made for his state of mind He was under Doctor Buddle s porch and made a flimsy rattle with his thin brass knocker Maybe he has returned He did not believe it though Major Jackson was very nervous indeed The up trains from Dollington were few and far between and that diddled Crutchleigh would be down on him the moment the breath was out of poor Lake It was plain yesterday at the sessions that infernal woman his wife had been at him She hates Bracton like poison because he likes the Brandon people and by Jove he ll have up every soul concerned The Devil and his wife I call them If poor Lake goes off anywhere between eleven and four o clock I m nabbed by George The door was opened The doctor peeped out of his parlour Well enquired the major confoundedly frightened Pretty well thank ye but awfully fagged up all night and no use But how is he asked the major with a dreadful qualm of dismay Same as yesterday no change only a little bleeding last night not arterial venous you know only venous The major thought he spoke of the goddess and though he did not well comprehend said he was glad of it Think he ll do then He may very unlikely though A nasty case as you can imagine He ll certainly not go poor fellow before four o clock P M I dare say eh The major s soul was at the Dollington station and was regulating poor Lake s departure by Bradshaw s Guide Who knows We expect Sir Francis this morning Glad to have a share of the responsibility off my shoulders I can tell you Come in and have a chop will you No thank you I ve had my breakfast You have have you Well I haven t cried the doctor with an agreeable chuckle shaking the major s hand and disappearing again into his parlour I found in my lodgings in London on my return from Doncaster some two months later a copy of the county paper of this date with a cross scrawled beside the piece of intelligence which follows I knew that tremulous cross It was traced by the hand of poor old Miss Kybes with her many faults always kind to me It bore the Brandon postmark and altogether had the impress of authenticity It said We have much pleasure in stating that the severe injury sustained four days since by Captain Stanley Lake at the time a visitor at the Lodge the picturesque residence of Josiah Larkin esquire in the vicinity of Gylingden is not likely to prove so difficult of treatment or so imminently dangerous as was at first apprehended The gallant gentleman was removed from the scene of his misadventure to Brandon Hall close to which the accident occurred and at which mansion his noble relatives Lord Chelford and the Dowager Lady Chelford are at present staying on a visit Sir Francis Seddley came down express from London and assisted by our skilful county practitioner Humphrey Buddle esquire M D of Gylingden operated most successfully on Saturday last and we are happy to say the gallant patient has since been going on as favourably as could possibly have been anticipated Sir Francis Seddley returned to London on Sunday afternoon Within a week after the operation Buddle began to talk so confidently about his patient that the funereal cloud that overhung Brandon had almost totally disappeared and Major Jackson had quite unpacked his portmanteau About a week after the accident there came one of mister Mark Wylder s strange letters to mister Jos Larkin This time it was from Marseilles and bore date the twenty seventh November It was much the longest he had yet received and was in the nature of a despatch rather than of those short notes in which he had hitherto for the most part communicated Like the rest of his letters it was odd but written as it seemed in better spirits Dear Larkin You will be surprised to find me in this port but I think my secret cruise is nearly over now and you will say the plan was a master stroke and well executed by a poor devil with nobody to advise him I am coiling such a web round them and making it fast as you may see a spider first to this point and then to the other that I won t leave my persecutors one solitary chance of escape I ll draw it quietly round and round closer and closer till they can neither blow nor budge and then up to the yardarm they go with what breath is left in them You don t know yet how I am dodging or why my measures are taken but I ll shorten your long face a good inch with a genuine broad grin when you learn how it all was I may see you to tell the story in four weeks time but keep this close Don t mention where I write from nor even so much as my name I have reasons for everything which you may guess I dare say being a sharp chap and it is not for nothing be very sure that I am running this queer rig masquerading hiding and dodging like a runaway forger which is not pleasant anyway and if you doubt it only try but needs must when the old boy drives He is a clever fellow no doubt but has been sometimes out witted before now You must arrange about Chelford and Lake I don t know where Lake is staying I don t suppose at Brandon but he won t stay in the country nor spend his money to please you or I Therefore you must have him at your house be sure and I will square it with you I think three pounds a week ought to do it very handsome Don t be a muff and give him expensive wines a pint of sherry is plenty between you and when he dines at his club half a pint does him I know but if he costs you more I hereby promise to pay it Won t that do Well about Chelford I have been thinking he takes airs and maybe he is on his high horse about that awkward business about Miss Brandon But there is no reason why Captain Lake should object He has only to hand you a receipt in my name for the amount of cheques you may give him and to lodge a portion of it where I told him and the rest to buy Consols and I suppose he will expect payment for his no trouble Every fellow particularly these gentlemanlike fellows they have a pluck at you when they can If he is at that give him at the rate of a hundred a year or a hundred and fifty if you think he won t do for less though one hundred l ought to be a good deal to Lake and tell him I have a promise of the adjutancy of the county militia if he likes that and I am sure of a seat in Parliament either for the county or for Dollington as you know and can do better for him then and I rely on you one way or another to make him undertake it And now for myself I think my vexation is very near ended I have not fired a gun yet and they little think what a raking broadside I ll give them Any of the county people you meet tell them I m making a little excursion on the Continent and if they go to particularise you may say the places I have been at Don t let anyone know more I wish there was any way of stopping that old she it looked like dragon or devil but was traced over with a cloud of flourishes and only Lady Chelford s mouth was left untouched Don t expect to hear from me so long a yarn for some time again and don t write I don t stay long anywhere and don t carry my own name and never ask for letters at the post I ve a good glass and can see pretty far and make a fair guess enough what s going on aboard the enemy I remain always Dear Larkin Ever yours truly MARK WYLDER He hardly trusts Lake more than he does me I presume murmured mister Larkin elevating his tall bald head with an offended and supercilious air and letting the thin open letter fall or rather throwing it with a slight whisk upon the table No I take leave to think he certainly does not Lake has got private directions about the disposition of a portion of the money Of course if there are persons to be dealt with who are not pleasantly approachable by respectable professional people in fact it would not suit me It is really rather a compliment and relieves me of the unpleasant necessity of saying no Yet mister Larkin was very sore and curious and in a measure hated both Lake and Wylder for their secret confidences and was more than ever resolved to get at the heart of Mark s mystery CHAPTER XLII A PARAGRAPH IN THE COUNTY PAPER The nature of his injury considered Captain Lake recovered with wonderful regularity and rapidity In four weeks he was out rather pale and languid but still able to walk without difficulty leaning on a stick for ten or fifteen minutes at a time In another fortnight he had made another great advance had thrown away his crutch handled stick and recovered flesh and vigour In a fortnight more he had grown quite like himself again and in a very few weeks more I read in the same county paper transmitted to me by the same fair hands but this time not with a cross but three distinct notes of admiration standing tremulously at the margin of the paragraph the following to me for a time incredible and very nearly to this day amazing announcement MARRIAGE IN HIGH LIFE The auspicious event so interesting to our county which we have this day to announce though for some time upon the tapis has been attended with as little publicity as possible The contemplated union between Captain Stanley Lake late of the Guards sole surviving son of the late General Williams Stanley Stanley Lake of Plasrhwyn and the beautiful and accomplished Miss Brandon of Brandon Hall in this county was celebrated in the ancestral chapel of Brandon situated within the manorial boundaries in the immediate vicinity of the town of Gylingden on yesterday Although the marriage was understood to be strictly private none but the immediate relations of the bride and bridegroom being present the bells of Gylingden rang out merry peals throughout the day and the town was tastefully decorated with flags and brilliantly illuminated at night A deputation of the tenantry of the Gylingden and the Longmoor estates together with those of the Brandon estate went in procession to Brandon Hall in the afternoon and read a well conceived and affectionate address which was responded to in appropriate terms by Captain Lake who received them with his beautiful bride at his side in the great gallery perhaps the noblest apartment in that noble ancestral mansion The tenantry were afterwards handsomely entertained under the immediate direction of Josiah Larkin esquire of the Lodge the respected manager of the Brandon estates at the Brandon Arms in the town of Gylingden It is understood that the great territorial influence of the Brandon family will obtain a considerable accession in the estates of the bridegroom in the south of England There was some more which I need not copy being very like what we usually see on such occasions I read this piece of intelligence half a dozen times over during breakfast How that beautiful girl has thrown herself away I thought Surely the Chelfords who have an influence there ought to have exerted it to prevent her doing anything so mad His estates in the south of England indeed Why he can t have Lthree hundred a year clear from that little property in Devon He is such a liar and so absurd as if he could succeed in deceiving anyone upon the subject So I read the paragraph over again and laid down the paper simply saying Well certainly that is disgusting I had heard of his duel It was also said that it had in some way had reference to Miss Brandon But this was the only rumoured incident which would at all have prepared one for the occurrence I tried to recollect anything particular in his manner there was nothing and she positively seemed to dislike him I had been utterly mystified and so I presume had all the other lookers on Well after all twas no particular business of mine At the club I saw it in the Morning Post and an hour after old Joe Gabloss that prosy Argus who knows everything recounted the details with patient precision and in legal phrase put in letters from two or three country houses proving his statement So there was no doubting it longer and Captain Stanley Lake late of Her Majesty s Regiment of Guards idler scamp coxcomb and the beautiful Dorcas Brandon heiress of Brandon were man and wife I wrote to my fair friend Miss Kybes and had an answer confirming if that were needed the public announcement and mentioning enigmatically that it had caused a great deal of conversation The posture of affairs in the small world of Gylingden except in the matter of the alliance just referred to was not much changed Since the voluminous despatch from Marseilles promising his return so soon not a line had been received from Mark Wylder He might arrive any day or night He might possibly have received some unexpected check if not checkmate in that dark and deep game on which he seemed to have staked so awfully mister Jos Larkin sometimes thought one thing sometimes another In the meantime Captain Lake accepted the trust Larkin at times thought there was a constant and secret correspondence going on between him and Mark Wylder and that he was his agent in adjusting some complicated and villainous piece of diplomacy by means of the fund secret service money which Mark had placed at his disposal He mister Larkin was treated like a child in this matter and his advice never so much as asked nor his professional honour accredited by the smallest act of confidence Sometimes his suspicions took a different turn and he thought that Lake might be one of those persecutors of whom Mark spoke with such mysterious hatred and that the topic of their correspondence was perhaps some compromise the subject or the terms of which would not bear the light Lake certainly made two visits to London one of them of a week s duration The attorney being a sharp long headed fellow who knew very well what business was knew perfectly well too that two or three short letters might have settled any legitimate business which his gallant friend had in the capital But Lake was now married and under the incantation whistled over him by the toothless Archdeacon of Mundlebury had sprung up into a county magnate and was worth cultivating and to be treated tenderly So the attorney s business was to smile and watch to watch and of course to pray as heretofore but specially to watch He himself hardly knew all that was passing in his own brain There are operations of physical nature which go on actively without your being aware of them and the moral respiration circulation insensible perspiration and all the rest of that peculiar moral system which exhibited its type in Jos Larkin proceeded automatically in the immortal structure of that gentleman Being very gentlemanlike in externals with a certain grace amounting very nearly to elegance and having applied himself diligently to please the county people that proud fraternity remembering his father s estates condoned his poverty and took Captain Lake by the hand and lifted him into their superb though not very entertaining order There were solemn festivities at Brandon and festive solemnities at the principal county houses in return Though not much of a sportsman Lake lent himself handsomely to all the sporting proceedings of the county and subscribed in a way worthy of the old renown of Brandon Hall to all sorts of charities and galas So he was getting on very pleasantly with his new neighbours and was likely to stand very fairly in that dull but not unfriendly society About three weeks after this great county marriage there arrived this time from Frankfort a sharp letter addressed to Jos Larkin esquire It said My Dear Sir I think I have reason to complain I have just seen by accident the announcement of the marriage at Brandon I think as my friend and a friend to the Brandon family you ought to have done something to delay if you could not stop it Of course you had the settlements and devil s in it if you could not have beat about a while it was not so quick with me and not doubled the point in a single tack and you know the beggar has next to nothing Any way it was your duty to have printed some notice that the thing was thought of If you had put it like a bit of news in Galignani I would have seen it and known what to do Well that ship s blew up But I won t let all go The cur will begin to try for the county or for Dollington You must quietly stop that mind and if he persists just you put an advertisement in Galignani saying Mr Smith will take notice that the other party is desirous to purchase and becoming very pressing Just you hoist that signal and somebody will bear down and blaze into him at all hazards you ll see how Things have not gone quite smooth with me since but it won t be long till I run up my flag again and take the command Be perfectly civil with Stanley Lake till I come on board that is indispensable and keep this letter as close from every eye as sealed orders You may want a trifle to balk S L s electioneering and there s an order on Lake for two hundred l Don t trifle about the county and borough He must have no footing in either till I return Yours dear Larkin Very truly but look after my business better M WYLDER The order on Lake a little note was enclosed Dear Lake I wish you joy and all the good wishes going as I could not make the prize myself Be so good to hand my lawyer mister Jos Larkin of the Lodge Gylingden two hundred l sterling on my account Yours dear Lake Very faithfully M WYLDER two hundred l twenty third Feb c c When Jos Larkin presented this little order it was in the handsome square room in which Captain Lake transacted business a lofty apartment wainscoted in carved oak and with a great stone mantelpiece with the Wylder arms projecting in bold relief in the centre and a florid scroll with RESURGAM standing forth as sharp as the day it was chiselled nearly three hundred years before There was some other business Brandon business to be talked over first and that exhausted mister Larkin sat as usual with one long thigh crossed upon the other his arm thrown over the back of his chair and his tall bald head a little back and his small mild eyes twinkling through their pink lids on the enigmatical captain who had entered upon the march of ambition in a spirit so audacious and conquering I had a line from mister Mark Wylder yesterday afternoon as usual without any address but the postmark and good mister Larkin laughed a mild little patient laugh and lifted his open hand and shook his head It really is growing too absurd a mere order upon you to hand me two hundred l How I m to dispose of it I have not the faintest notion And he laughed again at the same time he gracefully poked the little note between two fingers to Captain Lake who glanced full on him for a second as he took it And how is Mark enquired Lake with his odd sly smile as he scrawled a little endorsement on the order Does he say anything No absolutely nothing he s a very strange client said Larkin laughing again There can be no objection of course to your reading it and he thinks he thinks he ll be here soon again oh here it is mister Larkin had been fumbling first in his deep waistcoat and then in his breast pocket as if for the letter which was locked fast into the iron safe with Chubb s patent lock in his office at the Lodge But it would not have done to have kept a secret from Captain Lake of Brandon and therefore his not seeing the note was a mere accident Oh no stupid that s Mullett and Hock s I have not got it with me but it does not signify for there s nothing in it I hope I shall soon be favoured with his directions as to what to do with the money He s an odd fellow and I don t know how he feels towards me but on my part there is no feeling I do assure you but the natural desire to live on the friendly terms which our ties of family and our position in the county Stanley Lake was writing the cheque for two hundred l meanwhile and handed it to Larkin and as that gentleman penned a receipt the captain continued his eyes lowered to the little vellum bound book in which he was now making an entry You have handed me a large sum mister Larkin three thousand two hundred seventy six l eleven s four d I undertook this you know on the understanding that it was not to go on very long and I find my own business pretty nearly as much as I can manage Is Wylder at all definite as to when we may expect his return Oh dear no quite as usual he expects to be here soon but that is all I so wish I had brought his note with me but I m positive that is all So this little matter settled the lawyer took his leave CHAPTER XLIII AN EVIL EYE LOOKS ON THE VICAR There were influences of a wholly unsuspected kind already gathering round the poor vicar William Wylder as worlds first begin in thinnest vapour and whirl themselves in time into consistency and form so do these dark machinations which at times gather round unsuspecting mortals as points of revolution begin nebulously and intangibly and grow in volume and in density till a colossal system with its inexorable tendencies and forces crushes into eternal darkness the centre it has enveloped Thou shalt not covet thou shalt not cast an eye of desire out of the heart proceed murders these dreadful realities shape themselves from so filmy a medium as thought Ever since his conference with the vicar good mister Larkin had been dimly thinking of a thing The good attorney s weakness was money It was a speck at first a metaphysical microscope of no conceivable power could have developed its exact shape and colour a mere speck floating as it were in a transparent kyst in his soul a mere germ by and by to be an impish embryo and ripe for action When lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death The vicar s troubles grew and gathered as such troubles will and the attorney gave him his advice and the business of the reverend William Wylder gradually came to occupy a good deal of his time Here was a new reason for wishing to know really how Mark Wylder stood William had undoubtedly the reversion of the estate but the attorney suspected sometimes just from a faint phrase which had once escaped Stanley Lake as the likeliest solution that Mark Wylder had made a left handed marriage somehow and somewhere and that a subterranean wife and family would emerge at an unlucky moment and squat upon that remainder and defy the world to disturb them This gave to his plans and dealings in relation to the vicar a character of irresolution and caprice foreign to his character which was grim and decided enough when his data were clear and his object in sight William Wylder meanwhile was troubled and his mind clouded by more sorrows than one Poor William Wylder had those special troubles which haunt nervous temperaments and speculative minds when under the solemn influence of religion What the great Luther called without describing them his tribulations those dreadful doubts and apathies which at times menace and darken the radiant fabric of faith and fill the soul with nameless horrors The worst of these is that unlike other troubles they are not always safely to be communicated to those who love us best These terrors and dubitations are infectious Other spiritual troubles too there are and I suppose our good vicar was not exempt from them any more than other Christians The best man the simplest man that ever lived has his reserves The conscious frailty of mortality owes that sad reverence to itself and to the esteem of others You can t be too frank and humble when you have wronged your neighbour but keep your offences against God to yourself and let your battle with your own heart be waged under the eye of Him alone The frankness of the sentimental Jean Jacques Rousseau and of my coarse friend Mark Wylder is but a damnable form of vicious egotism A miserable sinner have I been my friend but details profit neither thee nor me The inner man had best be known only to himself and his Maker I like that good and simple Welsh parson of Beaumaris near two hundred years ago who with a sad sort of humour placed for motto under his portrait done in stained glass nunc primum transparui But the spiritual tribulation which came and went was probably connected with the dreadful and incessant horrors of his money trouble The gigantic Brocken spectre projected from himself upon the wide horizon of his futurity The poor vicar He felt his powers forsaking him Hope the life of action was gone Despair is fatalism and can t help itself The inevitable mountain was always on his shoulders He could not rise he could not stir He could scarcely turn his head and look up beseechingly from the corners of his eyes Why is that fellow so supine Why is his work so ill done when he ought most to exert himself He disgusts the world with his hang dog looks Alas with the need for action the power of action is gone Despair distraction the Furies sit with him Stunned stupid and wild always agitated it is not easy to compose his sermons as finely as heretofore He is always jotting down little sums in addition and subtraction The cares of the world the miseries of what the world calls difficulties and a struggle these were for the poor vicar the worst torture for aught we know which an average soul out of hell can endure Other sorrows bear healing on their wings this one is the Promethean vulture It is a falling into the hands of men not of God The worst is that its tendencies are so godless It makes men bitter its promptings are blasphemous Wherefore He who knew all things in describing the thorns which choke the word places the cares of this world first and after them the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things So if money is a root of evil the want of it with debt is root and stem and branches But all human pain has its intervals of relief The pain is suspended and the system recruits itself to endure the coming paroxysm An hour of illusion an hour of sleep an hour s respite of any sort to six hours of pain and so the soul in anguish finds strength for its long labour abridged by neither death nor madness The vicar with his little boy Fairy by the hand used twice at least in the week to make sometimes an hour s sometimes only half an hours visit at Redman s Farm Poor Rachel Lake made old Tamar sit at her worsteds in the window of the little drawing room while these conversations proceeded The young lady was so intelligent that William Wylder was obliged to exert himself in controversy with her eloquent despair and this combat with the doubts and terrors of a mind of much more than ordinary vigour and resource though altogether feminine compelled him to bestir himself and so for the time found him entire occupation and thus memory and forecast and suspense were superseded for the moment by absorbing mental action Rachel s position had not been altered by her brother s marriage Dorcas had urged her earnestly to give up Redman s Farm and take up her abode permanently at Brandon This kindness however she declined She was grateful but no nothing could move her The truth was she recoiled from it with a species of horror The marriage had been after all as great a surprise to Rachel as to any of the Gylingden gossips Dorcas knowing how Rachel thought upon it had grown reserved and impenetrable upon the subject indeed at one time I think she had half made up her mind to fight the old battle over again and resolutely exercise this fatal passion She had certainly mystified Rachel perhaps was mystifying herself Rachel grew more sad and strange than ever after this marriage I think that Stanley was right and that living in that solitary and darksome dell helped to make her hypochondriac One evening Stanley Lake stood at her door I was just thinking dear Radie he said in his sweet low tones which to her ear always bore a suspicion of mockery in them how pretty you contrive to make this bright little garden at all times of the year you have such lots of those evergreens and ivy and those odd flowers They call them immortelles in France said Rachel in a cold strange tone and make chaplets of them to lay upon the coffin lids and the graves Ah yes to be sure I have seen them there and in Pere la Chaise so they do they have them in all the cemeteries I forgot that How cheerful how very sensible Don t you think it would be a good plan to stick up a death s head and cross bones here and there and to split up old coffin lids for your setting sticks and get old Mowlders the sexton to bury your roots and cover them in with a dust to dust and so forth and plant a yew tree in the middle and stick those bits of painted board that look so woefully like gravestones all round it and then let old Tamar prowl about for a ghost I assure you Radie I think you all to nothing the perversest fool I ever encountered or heard of in the course of my life Well Stanley suppose you do I ll not dispute it Perhaps you are right said Rachel still standing at the door of her little porch Perhaps he repeated with a sneer I venture to say most positively I can t conceive any sane reason for your refusing Dorcas s entreaty to live with us at Brandon and leave this triste and unwholesome and everyway objectionable place She was very kind but I can t do it Yes you can t do it simply because it would be precisely the most sensible prudent and comfortable arrangement you could possibly make you won t do it but you can and will practise all the airs and fooleries of a bad melodrama You have succeeded already in filling Dorcas s mind with surmise and speculation and do you think the Gylingden people are either blind or dumb You are taking I ve told you again and again the very way to excite attention and gossip What good can it possibly do you You ll not believe until it happens and when it does you d give your eyes you could undo it It is so like you I have said how very kind I thought it of Dorcas to propose it I can t explain to her all my reasons for declining and to you I need not But I cannot overcome my repugnance and I won t try I wonder said Stanley with a sly look of enquiry that you who read the Bible and a very good book it is no doubt and believe in all sorts of things That will do Stanley I m not so weak as you suppose You know Radie I m a Sadducee and that sort of thing does not trouble me the least in the world It is a little cold here May we go into the drawing room You can t think how I hate this house We are always unpleasant in it This auspicious remark he made taking off his hat and placing it and his cane on her work table But this was not a tempestuous conference by any means I don t know precisely what they talked about I think it was probably the pros and cons of that migration to Brandon against which Rachel had pronounced so firmly I can t do it Stanley My motives are unintelligible to you I know and you think me obstinate and stupid but be I what I may my objections are insurmountable And does it not strike you that my staying here on the contrary would would tend to prevent the kind of conversation you speak of Not the least dear Radie that is I mean it could have no possible effect unless the circumstances were first supposed and then it could be of no appreciable use And your way of life and your looks for both are changed are likely in a little prating village where every human being is watched and discussed incessantly to excite conjecture that is all and that is every thing It had grown dark while Stanley sat in the little drawing room and Rachel stood on her doorstep and saw his figure glide away slowly into the thin mist and shadow and turn upward to return to Brandon by that narrow ravine where they had held rendezvous with Mark Wylder on that ill omened night when trouble began for all To Rachel s eyes that disappearing form looked like the moping spirit of guilt and regret haunting the scene of the irrevocable When Stanley took his leave after one of these visits stolen visits somehow they always seemed to her the solitary mistress of Redman s Farm invariably experienced the nervous reaction which follows the artificial calm of suppressed excitement Something of panic or horror relieved sometimes by a gush of tears sometimes more slowly and painfully subsiding without that hysterical escape She went in and shut the door and called Tamar But Tamar was out of the way She hated that little drawing room in her present mood its associations were odious and even ghastly so she sat herself down by the kitchen fire and placed her pretty feet cold now upon the high steel fender and extended her cold hands towards the embers leaning back in her rude chair And so she got the girl to light candles and asked her a great many questions and obliged her in fact to speak constantly though she seemed to listen but little And when at last the girl herself growing interested in her own narrative about a kidnapper grew voluble and animated and looked round upon the young lady at the crisis of the tale she was surprised to remark on a sudden that she was gazing vacantly into the bars and when Margery struck by her fixed and melancholy countenance stopped in the midst of a sentence the young lady turned and gazed on her wistfully with large eyes and pale face and sighed heavily CHAPTER XLIV IN WHICH OLD TAMAR LIFTS UP HER VOICE IN PROPHECY Certainly Stanley Lake was right about Redman s Dell Once the sun had gone down behind the distant hills it was the darkest the most silent and the most solitary of nooks It was not indeed quite dark yet The upper sky had still a faint gray twilight halo and the stars looked wan and faint But the narrow walk that turned from Redman s Dell was always dark in Stanley s memory and Sadducees although they believe neither in the resurrection nor the judgment are no more proof than other men against the resurrections of memory and the penalties of association and of fear Captain Lake had many things to think of Some pleasant enough as he measured pleasure others troublesome But as he mounted the stone steps that conducted the passenger up the steep acclivity to the upper level of the dark and narrow walk he was pursuing one black sorrow met him and blotted out all the rest Captain Lake knew very well and gracefully practised the art of not seeing inconvenient acquaintances in the street But here in this narrow way there met him full a hated shadow whom he would fain have cut by looking to right or left or up or down but which was not to be evaded would not only have his salutation but his arm and walked a horror of great darkness by his side through this solitude Committed to a dreadful game in which the stakes had come to exceed anything his wildest fears could have anticipated from which he could not according to his own canons by any imaginable means recede here was the spot where the dreadful battle had been joined and his covenant with futurity sealed The young captain stood for a moment still on reaching the upper platform A tiny brook that makes its way among briars and shingle to the more considerable mill stream of Redman s Dell sent up a hoarse babbling from the darkness beneath Why exactly he halted there he could not have said He glanced over his shoulder down the steps he had just scaled Had there been light his pale face would have shown just then a malign anxiety such as the face of an ill conditioned man might wear who apprehends danger of treading on a snake He walked on however without quickening his pace waving very slightly from side to side his ebony walking cane thin as a pencil as if it were a wand to beckon away the unseen things that haunt the darkness and now he came upon the wider plateau from which the close copse receding admitted something more of the light faint as it was that lingered in the heavens A tall gray stone stands in the centre of this space There had once been a boundary and a stile there Stanley knew it very well and was not startled as the attorney was the other night when he saw it As he approached this some one said close in his ear I beg your pardon Master Stanley He cowered down with a spring as I can fancy a man ducking under a round shot and glanced speechlessly and still in his attitude of recoil upon the speaker It s only me Master Stanley your poor old Tamar Don t be afraid dear I m not afraid woman Tamar to be sure why of course I know you but what the devil brings you here he said Tamar was dressed just as she used to be when sitting in the open air at her knitting except that over her shoulders she had a thin gray shawl On her head was the same close linen nightcap borderless and skull like and she laid her shrivelled freckled hand upon his arm and looking with an earnest and fearful gaze in his face she said It has been on my mind this many a day to speak to you Master Stanley but whenever I meant to summat came over me and I couldn t Well well well said Lake uneasily I mean to call to morrow or next day or some day soon at Redman s Farm I ll hear it then this is no place you know Tamar to talk in besides I m pressed for time and can t stay now to listen There s no place like this Master Stanley it s so awful secret she said with her hand still upon his arm Secret Why one place is as well as another and what the devil have I to do with secrets I tell you Tamar I m in haste and can t stay I won t stay There Master Stanley for the love of Heaven you know what I m going to speak of my old bones have carried me here tis years since I walked so far I d walk till I dropped to reach you but I d say what s on my mind tis like a message from heaven and I must speak aye dear I must But I say I can t stay Who made you a prophet You used not to be a fool Tamar when I tell you I can t that s enough Tamar did not move her fingers from the sleeve of his coat on which they rested and that thin pressure mysteriously detained him See Master Stanley if I don t say it to you I must to another she said You mean to threaten me woman said he with a pale malevolent look I m threatening nothing but the wrath of God who hears us Unless you mean to do me an injury Tamar I don t know what else you mean he answered in a changed tone Old Tamar will soon be in her coffin and this night far in the past like many another and twill be everything to you one day for weal or woe to hearken to her words now Master Stanley Why Tamar haven t I told you I m ready to listen to you I ll go and see you upon my honour I will to morrow or next day at the Dell what s the good of stopping me here Because Master Stanley something told me tis the best place we re quiet and you re more like to weigh my words here and you ll be alone for a while after you leave me and can ponder my advice as you walk home by the path Well whatever it is I suppose it won t take very long to say let us walk on to the stone there and then I ll stop and hear it but you must not keep me all night he said very peevishly It was only twenty steps further on and the woods receded round it so as to leave an irregular amphitheatre of some sixty yards across and Captain Lake glancing from the corners of his eyes this way and that without raising or turning his face stopped listlessly at the time worn white stone and turning to the old crone who was by his side he said Well then you have your way but speak low please if you have anything unpleasant to say Tamar laid her hand upon his arm again and the old woman s face afforded Stanley Lake no clue to the coming theme Its expression was quite as usual not actually discontent or peevishness but crimped and puckered all over with unchanging lines of anxiety and suffering Neither was there any flurry in her manner her bony arm and discoloured hand once her fingers lay upon his sleeve did not move only she looked very earnestly in his face as she spoke You ll not be angry Master Stanley dear though if you be I can t help it for I must speak I ve heard it all I heard you and Miss Radie speak on the night you first came to see her after your sickness and I heard you speak again by my room door only a week before your marriage when you thought I was asleep So I ve heard it all and though I mayn t understand all the ins and outs on t I know it well in the main Oh Master Stanley Master Stanley How can you go on with it Come Tamar what do you want of me What do you mean What the d is it all about Oh well you know Master Stanley what it s about Well there is something unpleasant and I suppose you have heard a smattering of it in your muddled way but it is quite plain you don t in the least understand it when you fancy I can do anything to serve anyone in the smallest degree connected with that disagreeable business or that I am personally in the least to blame in it and I can t conceive what business you had listening at the keyhole to your mistress and me nor why I am wasting my time talking to an old woman about my affairs which she can neither understand nor take part in Master Stanley it won t do I heard it I could not help hearing I little thought you had any such matter to speak and you spoke so sudden like I could not help it You were angry and raised your voice What could old Tamar do I heard it all before I knew where I was I really think Tamar you ve taken leave of your wits you are quite in the clouds Come Tamar tell me once for all only drop your voice a little if you please what the plague has got into your old head Come I say what is it He stooped and leaned his ear to Tamar and when she had done he laughed The laugh though low sounded wild and hollow in that dark solitude Really dear Tamar you must excuse my laughing You dear old witch how the plague could you take any such frightful nonsense into your head I do assure you upon my honour I never heard of so ridiculous a blunder Only that I know you are really fond of us I should never speak to you again I forgive you But listen no more to other people s conversation I could tell you how it really stands now only I have not time but you ll take my word of honour for it you have made the most absurd mistake that ever an old fool tumbled into No Tamar I can t stay any longer now but I ll tell you the whole truth when next I go down to Redman s Farm In the meantime you must not plague poor Miss Radie with your nonsense She has too much already to trouble her though of quite another sort Good night foolish old Tamar Oh Master Stanley it will take a deal to shake my mind and if it be so as I say what s to be done next what s to be done oh what is to be done I say good night old Tamar and hold your tongue do you see Oh Master Stanley Master Stanley my poor child my child that I nursed anything would be better than this Sooner or later judgment will overtake you so sure as you persist in it I heard what Miss Radie said and is not it true is not it cruel is not it frightful to go on You don t seem to be aware my good Tamar that you have been talking slander all this while and might be sent to gaol for it There I m not angry only you re a fool Good night He shook her hand and jerked it from him with suppressed fury passing on with a quickened pace And as he glided through the dark towards splendid old Brandon he ground his teeth and uttered two or three sentences which no respectable publisher would like to print CHAPTER XLV DEEP AND SHALLOW Lawyer Larkin s mind was working more diligently than anyone suspected upon this puzzle of Mark Wylder The investigation was a sort of scientific recreation to him and something more His sure instinct told him it was a secret well worth mastering He had a growing belief that Lake and perhaps he only except Wylder himself knew the meaning of all this mysterious marching and counter marching Of course all sorts of theories were floating in his mind but there was none that would quite fit all the circumstances The attorney had he asked himself the question what was his object in these inquisitions would have answered I am doing what few other men would I am Heaven knows giving to this affair of my absent client s gratuitously as much thought and vigilance as ever I did to any case in which I was duly remunerated This is self sacrificing and noble and just the conscientious conduct I should expect from myself But there was also this consideration which you failed to define Yes my respected client mister Mark Wylder is suffering under some acute pressure applied perhaps by my friend Captain Lake Why should not I share in the profit if such there be by getting my hand too upon the instrument of compression It is worth trying Let us try The Reverend William Wylder was often at the Lodge now Larkin had struck out a masterly plan The vicar s reversion a very chimerical contingency he would by no means consent to sell His little man little Fairy oh no he could not The attorney only touched on this remarking in a friendly way But then you know it is so mere a shadow This indeed poor William knew very well But though he spoke quite meekly the attorney looked rather black and his converse grew somewhat dry and short This sinister change was sudden and immediately followed the suggestion about the reversion and the poor vicar was a little puzzled and began to consider whether he had said anything gauche or offensive it would be so very painful to appear ungrateful The attorney had the statement of title in one hand and leaning back in his chair read it demurely in silence with the other tapping the seal end of his gold pencil case between his lips Yes said mister Larkin mildly it is so very shadowy and that feeling too in the way I suppose we had better perhaps put it aside and maybe something else may turn up And the attorney rose grandly to replace the statement of title in its tin box intimating thereby that the audience was ended But the poor vicar was in rather urgent circumstances just then and his troubles had closed in recently with a noiseless but tremendous contraction like that iron shroud in mister Mudford s fine tale and to have gone away into outer darkness with no project on the stocks and the attorney s countenance averted would have been simply despair To speak frankly said the poor vicar with that hectic in his cheek that came with agitation I never fancied that my reversionary interest could be saleable Neither is it in all probability answered the attorney As you are so seriously pressed and your brother s return delayed it merely crossed my mind as a thing worth trying It was very kind and thoughtful but that feeling the my poor little man However I may be only nervous and foolish and I think I ll speak to Lord Chelford about it The attorney looked down and took his nether lip gently between his finger and thumb I rather think he had no particular wish to take Lord Chelford into council I think before troubling his lordship upon the subject if indeed on reflection you should not think it would be a little odd to trouble him at all in reference to it I had better look a little more carefully into the papers and see whether anything in that direction is really practicable at all Do you think mister Larkin you can write that strong letter to stay proceedings which you intended yesterday The attorney shook his head and said with a sad sort of dryness I can t see my way to it The vicar s heart sank with a flutter and then swelled and sank another bit and his forehead flushed There was a silence You see mister Wylder I relied in fact altogether upon this a arrangement and I don t see that any thing is likely to come of it The attorney spoke in the same dry and reserved way and there was a shadow on his long face I have forfeited his good will somehow he has ceased to take any interest in my wretched affairs I am abandoned and must be ruined These dreadful thoughts filled in another silence and then the vicar said I am afraid I have quite unintentionally offended you mister Larkin perhaps in my ignorance of business and I feel that I should be quite ruined if I were to forfeit your good offices and pray tell me if I have said anything I ought not Oh no nothing I assure you replied mister Larkin with a lofty and gentle dryness Only I think I have perhaps a little mistaken the relation in which I stood and fancied wrongly it was in the light somewhat of a friend as well as of a professional adviser and I thought perhaps I had rather more of your confidence than I had any right to and did not at first see the necessity of calling in Lord Chelford whose experience of business is necessarily very limited to direct you You remember my dear mister Wylder that I did not at all invite these relations and I don t think you will charge me with want of zeal in your business Oh my dear mister Larkin my dear Sir you have been my preserver my benefactor in fact under Heaven very nearly my last and only hope Well I had hoped I was not remiss or wanting in diligence And mister Larkin took his seat in his most gentlemanlike fashion crossing his long legs and throwing his tall head back raising his eyebrows and letting his mouth languidly drop a little open My idea was that Lord Chelford would see more clearly what was best for little Fairy I am so very slow and so silly about business and you so much my friend I have found you so that you might think only of me I should of course consider the little boy said mister Larkin condescendingly a most interesting child I m very fond of children myself and should of course put the entire case as respected him as well as yourself to the best of my humble powers before you Is there any thing else just now you think of for time presses and really we have ground to apprehend something unpleasant to morrow You ought not my dear Sir pray permit me to say you really ought not to have allowed it to come to this The poor vicar sighed profoundly and shook his head a contrite man They both forgot that it was arithmetically impossible for him to have prevented it unless he had got some money Perhaps said the vicar brightening up suddenly and looking in the attorney s eyes for answer Perhaps something might be done with the reversion as a security to borrow a sufficient sum without selling The attorney shook his high head and whiskers gray and foxy and meditated with the seal of his pencil case between his lips I don t see it said he with another shake of that long head I don t know that any lender in fact would entertain such a security If you wish it I will write to Burlington Smith and Company about it they are largely in policies and post obits It is very sad very sad indeed I wish so much my dear Sir I could be of use to you but you know the fact is we solicitors seldom have the command of our own money always in advance always drained to the uttermost shilling and I am myself in the predicament you will see there And he threw a little note from the Dollington Bank to Jos Larkin esquire The Lodge Gylingden announcing the fact that he had overdrawn his account certain pounds shillings and pence and inviting him forthwith to restore the balance The vicar read it with a vague comprehension and in his cold fingers shook the hand of his fellow sufferer Less than fifty pounds would not do Oh where was he to turn It was quite hopeless and poor Larkin pressed too Now there was this consolation in poor Larkin s case that although he was quite run aground and a defaulter in the Dollington Bank to the extent of seven l twelve s four d yet in that similar institution which flourished at Naunton only nine miles away there stood to his name the satisfactory credit of five hundred sixty four l eleven s seven d One advantage which the good attorney derived from his double account with the rival institutions was that whenever convenient he could throw one of these certificates of destitution and impotence sadly under the eyes of a client in want of money like poor Will Wylder The attorney had no pleasure in doing people ill turns But he had come to hear the distresses of his clients as tranquilly as doctors do the pangs of their patients As he stood meditating near his window he saw the poor vicar with slow limbs and downcast countenance walk under his laburnums and laurustinuses towards his little gate and suddenly stop and turn round and make about a dozen quick steps like a man who has found a bright idea towards the house and then come to a thoughtful halt and so turn and recommence his slow march of despair homeward At five o clock it was dark now there was a tread on the door steps and a double tattoo at the tiny knocker It was the lawyer mister Larkin entered the vicar s study where he was supposed to be busy about his sermon My dear Sir thinking about you and I have just heard from an old humble friend who wants high interest and of course is content to take security somewhat personal in its nature I have written already He s in the hands of Burlington Smith and Company I have got exactly fifty five l since I saw you which makes me all right at Dollington and here s my check for fifty l which you can send or perhaps I had better send by this night s post to those Cambridge people It settles that and you give me a line on this stamp acknowledging the fifty l on account of money to be raised on your reversion So that s off your mind my dear Sir Oh mister Larkin my my you don t know Sir what you have done for me the agony oh thank God what a friend is raised up And he clasped and wrung the long hands of the attorney and I really think there was a little moisture in that gentleman s pink eyes for a moment or two When he was gone the vicar returned from the door step radiant not to the study but to the parlour Oh Willie darling you look so happy you were uneasy this evening said his little ugly wife with a beautiful smile jumping up and clasping him Yes darling I was very uneasy but thank God it is over And they cried and smiled together in that delightful embrace while all the time little Fairy with a paper cap on his head was telling them half a dozen things together and pulling Wapsie by the skirts Then he was lifted up and kissed and smiled on by that sunshine only remembered in the sad old days parental love And there was high festival kept in the parlour that night I am told six crumpets and a new egg apiece besides at tea to make merry with and stories and little songs for Fairy Willie was in his old college spirits It was quite delightful and little Fairy was up a great deal too late and the vicar and his wife had quite a cheery chat over the fire and he and she both agreed he would make a handsome sum by Eusebius Thus if there are afflictions there are also comforts great consolations great chastisements There is a comforter and there is a chastener Every man must taste of death every man must taste of life It shall not be all bitter nor all sweet for any It shall be life The unseen ministers of a stupendous equity have their eyes and their hands about every man s portion as it is written he that had gathered much had nothing over and he that had gathered little had no lack It is the same earth for all the same earth for the dead great and small dust to dust The same earth for the living Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth and God provides the flowers too CHAPTER XLVI DEBATE AND INTERRUPTION 
5661-32901-0000	train-other-500	Rachel beheld the things which were coming to pass like an awful dream She had begun to think and not without evidence that Dorcas for some cause or caprice had ceased to think of Stanley as she once did
5661-32901-0001	train-other-500	And the announcement without preparation or apparent courtship that her brother had actually won this great and beautiful heiress and that just emerged from the shades of death
none	none	 he a half ruined scapegrace 
5661-32901-0002	train-other-500	was about to take his place among the magnates of the county and no doubt to enter himself for the bold and splendid game of ambition the stakes of which were now in his hand towered before her like an incredible and disastrous
5661-32901-0003	train-other-500	illusion of magic Stanley s uneasiness lest Rachel s conduct should compromise them increased He grew more nervous about the relations between him and Mark Wylder
5661-32901-0004	train-other-500	in proportion as the world grew more splendid and prosperous for him Where is the woman who will patiently acquiesce in the reserve of her husband who shares his confidence with another
5661-32901-0005	train-other-500	How often had Stanley Lake sworn to her there was no secret that he knew nothing of Mark Wylder beyond the charge of his money and making a small payment to an old missus Dutton in London by his direction
5661-32901-0006	train-other-500	and that beyond this he was as absolutely in the dark as she or Chelford What then did Rachel mean by all that escaped her when he was in danger How the could he tell
none	none	 He really believed she was a little ever so little crazed He supposed she like Dorcas fancied he knew everything about Wylder She was constantly hinting something of the kind and begging of him to make a disclosure disclosure of what It was enough to drive one mad and would make a capital farce Rachel has a ridiculous way of talking like an oracle and treating as settled fact every absurdity she fancies 
5661-32901-0007	train-other-500	She is very charming and clever of course so long as she speaks of the kind of thing she understands But when she tries to talk of serious business
none	none	 poor Radie 
5661-32901-0008	train-other-500	she certainly does talk such nonsense She can t reason she runs away with things It is the most tiresome thing you can conceive But you have not said Stanley that she does not suspect the truth
5661-32901-0009	train-other-500	Of course I say it I have said it I swear it if you like
none	none	 I ve said plainly and I m ready to swear it 
5661-32901-0010	train-other-500	Upon my honour and soul I know no more of his movements plans or motives than you do If you reflect you must see it
none	none	 We were never good friends Mark and I It was no fault of mine but I never liked him and he consequently I suppose never liked me There was no intimacy or confidence between us I was the last man on earth he would have consulted with 
5661-32901-0011	train-other-500	Even Larkin his own lawyer is in the dark Rachel knows all this I have told her fifty times over and she seems to give way at the moment Indeed the thing is too plain to be resisted
none	none	 But as I said poor Radie she can t reason 
5661-32901-0012	train-other-500	and by the time I see her next her old fancy possesses her I can t help it because with more reluctance than I can tell I at length consent at Larkin s entreaty I may say to bank and fund his money
5661-32901-0013	train-other-500	But Dorcas s mind retained its first impression Sometimes his plausibilities his vehemence and his vows disturbed it for a time but there it remained like the picture of a camera obscura
5661-32901-0014	train-other-500	into which a momentary light has been admitted unseen for a second but the images return with the darkness and group themselves in their old colours and places again Whatever it was Rachel probably knew it
5661-32901-0015	train-other-500	There was a painful confidence between them and there was growing in Dorcas s mind a feeling towards Rachel which her pride forbade her to define She did not like Stanley s stealthy visits to Redman s Farm
5661-32901-0016	train-other-500	she did not like his moods or looks after those visits of which he thought she knew nothing She did not know whether to be pleased or sorry that Rachel had refused to reside at Brandon
none	none	 neither did she like the stern gloom that overcast Rachel s countenance when Stanley was in the room nor those occasional walks together up and down the short yew walk in which Lake looked so cold and angry 
5661-32901-0017	train-other-500	and Rachel so earnest What was this secret How dared her husband mask from her what he confided to another How dared Rachel confer with him influence him perhaps under her very eye
5661-32901-0018	train-other-500	walking before the windows of Brandon that Brandon which was hers and to which she had taken Stanley passing her gate a poor and tired wayfarer of the world and made him what Oh mad caprice
5661-32901-0019	train-other-500	Oh fit retribution A wild voice was talking this way to and fro and up and down in the chambers of memory But she would not let it speak from her proud lips
5661-32901-0020	train-other-500	She smiled and to outward seeming was the same but Rachel felt that the fashion of her countenance towards her was changed Since her marriage she had not hinted to Rachel the subject of their old conversations
5661-32901-0021	train-other-500	burning beneath her feeling about it was now a deep rooted anger and jealousy Still she was Stanley s sister and to be treated accordingly The whole household greeted her with proper respect and Dorcas met her graciously
5661-32901-0022	train-other-500	and with all the externals of kindness The change was so little that I do not think any but she and Rachel saw it and yet it was immense There was a dark room a sort of ante room to the library
5661-32901-0023	train-other-500	with only two tall and narrow windows and hung with old Dutch tapestries representing the battles and sieges of men in periwigs pikemen dragoons in buff coats and musketeers with matchlocks
none	none	 all the grim faces of soldiers generals drummers and the rest grown pale and dusky by time like armies of ghosts Rachel had come one morning to see Dorcas and awaiting her appearance sat down in this room 
5661-32901-0024	train-other-500	The door of the library opened and she was a little surprised to see Stanley enter Why Stanley they told me you were gone to Naunton
none	none	 Oh did they Well you see I m here Radie 
5661-32901-0025	train-other-500	Somehow he was not very well pleased to see her I think you ll find Dorcas in the drawing room or else in the conservatory he added I am glad Stanley I happened to meet you
none	none	 Something must be done in the matter I spoke of immediately Have you considered it Most carefully said Stanley quietly But you have done nothing It is not a thing to be done in a moment 
5661-32901-0026	train-other-500	You can if you please do a great deal in a moment Certainly but I may repent it afterwards Stanley you may regret postponing it much more You have no idea Rachel how very tiresome you ve grown
5661-32901-0027	train-other-500	Yes Stanley I can quite understand it It would have been better for you perhaps for myself I had died long ago Well that is another thing but in the meantime I assure you Rachel you
none	none	 are disposed to be very impertinent Very impertinent yes indeed Stanley and so I shall continue to be until Pray how does it concern you I say it is no business on earth of yours 
5661-32901-0028	train-other-500	Stanley Lake was growing angry Yes Stanley
none	none	 it does concern me That is false True true Sir Oh Stanley it is a load upon my conscience a mountain a mountain between me and my hopes I can t endure the misery to which you would consign me you shall do it immediately too she stamped wildly as she said it and if you hesitate Stanley I shall be compelled to speak though the thought of it makes me almost mad with terror 
5661-32901-0029	train-other-500	What is he to do Rachel said Dorcas standing near the door It was a very awkward pause The splendid young bride was the only person on the stage who looked very much as usual
5661-32901-0030	train-other-500	Stanley turned his pale glare of fury from Rachel to Dorcas and Dorcas said again What is it Rachel darling Rachel with a bright blush on her cheeks stepped quickly up to her put her arms about her neck and kissed her
5661-32901-0031	train-other-500	and over her shoulder she cried to her brother Tell her Stanley And so she quickly left the room and was gone Well Dorkie love what s the matter said Stanley sharply at last breaking the silence
none	none	 I really don t know 
5661-32901-0032	train-other-500	you perhaps can tell answered she coldly You have frightened Rachel out of the room for one thing answered he with a sneer I simply asked her what she urged you to do I think I have a claim to know
none	none	 It is strange so reasonable a question from a wife should scare your sister from the room I don t quite see that for my part I don t think anything strange in a woman Rachel has been talking the rankest nonsense in the most unreasonable temper conceivable 
5661-32901-0033	train-other-500	and because she can t persuade me to accept her views of what is Christian and sensible she threatens to go mad I think that is her phrase I don t think Rachel is a fool said Dorcas quietly her eye still upon Stanley
none	none	 Neither do I 
5661-32901-0034	train-other-500	when she pleases to exert her good sense but she can when she pleases both talk and act like a fool And pray what does she want you to do Stanley The merest nonsense But what is it
none	none	 I really can hardly undertake to say I very well understand it myself 
5661-32901-0035	train-other-500	and I have half a dozen letters to write and really if I were to stay here and try to explain I very much doubt whether I could Why don t you ask her If she has any clear ideas on the subject I don t see why she should not tell you
5661-32901-0036	train-other-500	For my part I doubt if she understands herself I certainly don t Dorcas smiled bitterly Mystery already mystery from the first I am to know nothing of your secrets
none	none	 You confer and consult in my house you debate and decide upon matters most nearly concerning for aught I know my interests and my happiness certainly deeply affecting you 
5661-32901-0037	train-other-500	and therefore which I have a right to know and my entering the room is the signal for silence a guilty silence for departure and for equivocation
none	none	 Stanley you are isolating me 
5661-32901-0038	train-other-500	Beware I may entrench myself in that isolation You are choosing your confidant and excluding me rest assured you shall have no confidence of mine while you do so
5661-32901-0039	train-other-500	Stanley Lake looked at her with a gaze at once peevish and inquisitive You take a wonderfully serious view of Rachel s nonsense I do
5661-32901-0040	train-other-500	Certainly you women have a marvellous talent for making mountains of molehills you and Radie are adepts in the art
none	none	 Never was a poor devil so lectured about nothing as I between you 
5661-32901-0041	train-other-500	Come now Dorkie be a good girl you must not look so vexed I m not vexed What then I m only thinking She said this with the same bitter smile
5661-32901-0042	train-other-500	Stanley Lake looked for a moment disposed to break into one of his furies but instead he only laughed his unpleasant laugh Well I m thinking too and I find it quite possible to be vexed at the same time I assure you Dorcas
5661-32901-0043	train-other-500	I really am busy and it is too bad to have one s time wasted in solemn lectures about stuff and nonsense Do make Rachel explain herself if she can I have no objection I assure you
5661-32901-0044	train-other-500	but I must be permitted to decline undertaking to interpret that oracle And so saying Stanley Lake glided into the library and shut the door with an angry clap Dorcas did not deign to look after him
5661-32901-0045	train-other-500	She had heard his farewell address looking from the window at the towering and sombre clumps of her ancestral trees pale proud with perhaps a peculiar gleam of resentment or malignity
5661-32901-0046	train-other-500	in her exquisite features So she stood looking forth on her noble possessions on terraces
none	none	 long rows of urns noble timber all seen in slanting sunlight and long shadows and seeing nothing but the great word FOOL in letters of flame in the air before her CHAPTER XLVII A THREATENING NOTICE Stanley Lake was not a man to let the grass grow under his feet when an object was to be gained It was with a sure prescience that Mark Wylder s letter had inferred that Stanley Lake would aspire to the representation either of the county or of the borough of Dollington His mind was already full of these projects Electioneering schemes are conducted particularly at their initiation like conspiracies in fact they are conspiracies and therefore there was nothing remarkable in the intense caution with which Stanley Lake set about his He was not yet feeling his way He was only preparing to feel his way All the data except the muster roll of electors were in nubibus who would retire who would step forward as yet altogether in the region of conjecture There are men to whom the business of elections a life of secrecy excitement speculation and combat has all but irresistible charms and Tom Wealdon the Town Clerk was such a spirit A bold frank good humoured fellow he played at elections as he would at cricket Every faculty of eye hand and thought his whole heart and soul in the game But no ill will no malevolence in victory no sourness in defeat A successful coup made Tom Wealdon split with laughing A ridiculous failure amused him nearly as much He celebrated his last great defeat with a pic nic in the romantic scenery of Nolton where he and his comrades in disaster had a roaring evening and no end of chaff When he and Jos Larkin carried the last close contest at Dollington by a majority of two he kicked the crown out of the grave attorney s chimney pot and flung his own wide awake into the river He did not show much his official station precluded prominence He kept in the background and did his spiriting gently But Tom Wealdon it was known as things are known without evidence was at the bottom of all the clever dodges and long headed manoeuvres When therefore mister Larkin heard from the portly and veracious mister Larcom who was on very happy relations with the proprietor of the Lodge that Tom Wealdon had been twice quietly to Brandon to lunch and had talked an hour alone with the captain in the library each time and that they seemed very hernest like and stopped of talking directly he mister Larcom entered the room with the post bag the attorney knew very well what was in the wind Now it was not quite clear what was right by which the good attorney meant prudent under the circumstances He was in confidential which meant lucrative relations with Mark Wylder Ditto ditto with Captain Lake of Brandon He did not wish to lose either Was it possible to hold to both or must he cleave only to one and despise the other Wylder might return any day and Tom Wealdon would probably be one of the first men whom he would see He must hang out the signal in Galignani Lake could never suspect its meaning even were he to see it There was but one risk in it which was in the coarse perfidy of Mark Welder himself who would desire no better fun in some of his moods than boasting to Lake of the whole arrangement in Jos Larkin s presence However on the whole it was best to obey Mark Wylder s orders and accordingly Galignani said Mr Smith will take notice that the other party is desirous to purchase and becoming very pressing In the meantime Lake was pushing his popularity among the gentry with remarkable industry and with tolerable success Wealdon s two little visits explained perfectly the active urbanities of Captain Stanley Lake About three weeks after the appearance of the advertisement in Galignani one of Mark Wylder s letters reached Larkin It was dated from Geneva and said DEAR LARKIN I saw my friend Smith here in the cafe who has kept a bright look out I dare say and tells me that Captain Stanley Lake is thinking of standing either for the county or for Dollington I will thank you to apprise him that I mean to take my choice first and please hand him the enclosed notice open as you get it and if you please to let him run his eye also over this note to you as I have my own reasons for wishing him to know that you have seen it This is all I will probably trouble you about elections for some months to come or at least weeks It being time enough when I go back and no squalls a head just now at home though foreign politics look muggy enough I have nothing particular at present about tenants or timber except the three acres of oak behind Farmer Tanby s have it took down Thomas Jones and me went over it last September and it ought to bring near three thousand l I must have a good handful of money by May next Yours my dear Larkin Very truly MARK WYLDER Folded in this was a thin slip of foreign paper on which were traced these lines Private DEAR LARKIN Don t funk the interview with the beast Lake a hyaena has no pluck in him When he reads what I send him by your hand he ll be as mild as you please Parkes must act for me as usual no bluster about giving up Lake s afraid of yours M W Within was what he called his notice to Stanley Lake and it was thus conceived Private DEAR LAKE I understand you are trying to make all safe for next election in Dollington or the county Now understand at once that I won t permit that There is not a country gentleman on the grand jury who is not your superior and there is no extremity I will not make you feel and you know what I mean if you dare despise this first and not unfriendly warning Yours truly MARK WYLDER Now there certainly was need of Wylder s assurance that nothing unpleasant should happen to the conscious bearer of such a message to an officer and a gentleman Jos Larkin did not like it Still there was a confidence in his own conciliatory manners and exquisite tact Something too might be learned by noting Lake s looks demeanour and language under this direct communication from the man to whom his relations were so mysterious Larkin looked at his watch it was about the hour when he was likely to find Lake in his study The attorney withdrew the little private enclosure and slipt it with a brief endorsement into the neat sheaf of Wylder s letters all similarly noted and so locked it up in the iron safe He intended being perfectly ingenuous with Lake and showing him that he had no secrets no concealments all open as the day by producing the letter in which the notice was enclosed and submitting it for Captain Lake s perusal When Lawyer Larkin reached the dim chamber with the Dutch tapestries where he had for a little while to await Captain Lake s leisure he began to anticipate the scene now so immediately impending more uncomfortably than before The notice was indeed so outrageous in its spirit and so intolerable in its language that knowing something of Stanley s wild and truculent temper he began to feel a little nervous about the explosion he was about to provoke The Brandon connection one way or other was worth to the attorney in hard cash between five and six hundred a year In influence and what is termed position it was of course worth a great deal more It would be a very serious blow to lose this He did not he hoped care for money more than a good man ought but such a loss he would say he could not afford Precisely the same however was to be said of his connection with Mark Wylder and in fact of late years mister Jos Larkin of the Lodge had begun to put by money so fast that he was growing rapidly to be a very considerable man indeed Everything as he said was doing very nicely and it would be a deplorable thing to mar by any untoward act this pilgrim s quiet and prosperous progress In this stage of his reverie he was interrupted by a tall powdered footman in the Brandon livery who came respectfully to announce that his master desired to see mister Larkin Larkin s soul sneered at this piece of state Why could he not put his head in at the door and call him But still I think it impressed him and that diplomatically Captain Lake was in the right to environ himself with the ceremonial of a lord of Brandon Well Larkin how d ye do Anything about Raikes s lease said the great Captain Lake rising from behind his desk with his accustomed smile and extending his gentlemanlike hand No Sir nothing Captain Lake He has not come and I don t think we should show any anxiety about it replied the attorney taking the captain s thin hand rather deferentially I ve had a such a letter from my my client mister Mark Wylder He writes in a violent passion and I m really placed in a most disagreeable position Won t you sit down A thanks a well I thought on the whole having received the letter and the enclosure which I must say very much surprises me very much indeed And Larkin looked reprovingly on an imaginary Mark Wylder and shook his head a good deal He has not appointed another man of business Oh dear no said Larkin quickly with a faint supercilious smile No nothing of that kind The thing in fact there has been some gossiping fellow Do you happen to know a person at all versed in Gylingden matters or perhaps a member of your club named Smith Smith I don t I think recollect any particular Smith just at this moment And what is Smith doing or saying Why he has been talking over election matters It seems Wylder mister Wylder has met him in Geneva from whence he dates and he says he says oh here s the letter and you ll see it all there He handed it to Lake and kept his eye on him while he read it When he saw that Lake who bit his lip during the perusal had come to the end by his glancing up again at the date Larkin murmured Something you see has gone wrong with him I can t account for the temper otherwise so violent Quite so said Lake quietly and where is the notice he speaks of here Why really Captain Lake I did not very well know it is such a production I could not say whether you would wish it presented and in any case you will do me the justice to understand that I for my part I really don t know how to speak of it Quite so repeated Lake softly taking the thin neatly folded piece of paper which Larkin with a sad inclination of his body handed to him Lake under the lawyer s small vigilant eyes quietly read Mark Wylder s awful threatenings through twice over and Larkin was not quite sure whether there was any change of countenance to speak of as he did so This is dated the twenty ninth said Lake in the same quiet tone perhaps you will be so good as to write a line across it stating the date of your handing it to me I of course I can see no objection I may mention I suppose that I do so at your request And Larkin made a neat little endorsement to that effect and he felt relieved The hyaena certainly was not showing fight And now mister Larkin you ll admit I think that I ve exhibited no ill temper much less violence under the provocation of that note Certainly none whatever Captain Lake And you will therefore perceive that whatever I now say speaking in cool blood I am not likely to recede from Lawyer Larkin bowed And may I particularly ask that you will so attend to what I am about to say as to be able to make a note of it for mister Welder s consideration Certainly if you desire but I wish to say that in this particular matter I beg it may be clearly understood that mister Wylder is in no respect more my client than you Captain Lake and that I merely act as a most reluctant messenger in the matter Just so said Captain Lake Now as to my thinking of representing either county or borough he resumed after a little pause holding Mark Wylder s notice between his finger and thumb and glancing at it from time to time as a speaker might at his notes I am just as well qualified as he in every respect and if it lies between him and me I will undoubtedly offer myself and accompany my address with the publication of this precious document which he calls his notice the composition in all respects of a ruffian and which will inspire every gentleman who reads it with disgust abhorrence and contempt His threat I don t understand I despise his machinations I defy him utterly and the time is coming when in spite of his manoeuvring I ll drive him into a corner and pin him to the wall He very well knows that flitting and skulking from place to place like an escaped convict he is safe in writing what insults he pleases through the post I can t tell how or where to find him He is not only no gentleman but no man a coward as well as a ruffian But his game of hide and seek cannot go on for ever and when next I can lay my hand upon him I ll make him eat that paper on his knees and place my heel upon his neck The peroration of this peculiar invective was emphasised by an oath at which the half dozen short grizzled hairs that surmounted the top of mister Jos Larkin s shining bald head no doubt stood up in silent appeal The attorney was standing during this sample of Lake s parliamentary rhetoric a little flushed for he did not know the moment when a blue flicker from the rhetorical thunder storm might splinter his own bald head and for ever end his connection with Brandon There was a silence during which pale Captain Lake locked up Mark Wylder s warning and the attorney twice cleared his voice I need hardly say Captain Lake how I feel in this business I Quite so said the captain in his soft low tones I assure you I altogether acquit you of sympathy with any thing so utterly ruffianly and he took the hand of the relieved attorney with a friendly condescension The only compensation I exact for your involuntary part in the matter is that you distinctly convey the tenor of my language to mister Wylder on the first occasion on which he affords you an opportunity of communicating with him And as to my ever again acting as his trustee though yes I forgot he made a sudden pause and was lost for a minute in annoyed reflection yes I must for a while It can t last very long he must return soon and I can t well refuse to act until at least some other arrangement is made There are quite other persons and I can t allow them to starve So saying he rose with his peculiar smile and extended his hand to signify that the conference was at an end And I suppose he said we are to regard this little conversation for the present as confidential Certainly Captain Lake and permit me to say that I fully appreciate the just and liberal construction which you have placed upon my conduct a construction which a party less candid and honourably minded than yourself might have failed to favour me with And with this pretty speech Larkin took his hat and gracefully withdrew CHAPTER XLVIII IN WHICH I GO TO BRANDON AND SEE AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE IN THE TAPESTRY ROOM To my surprise a large letter bearing the Gylingden postmark and with a seal as large as a florin showing had I examined the heraldry the Brandon arms with the Lake bearings quartered thereon and proving to be a very earnest invitation from Stanley Lake found me in London just about this time I paused I was doubtful about accepting it for the business of the season was just about to commence in earnest and the country had not yet assumed its charms But I now know very well that from the first it was quite settled that down I should go I was too curious to see the bride in her new relations and to observe something of the conjugal administration of Lake to allow anything seriously to stand in the way of my proposed trip There was a postscript to Lake s letter which might have opened my eyes as to the motives of this pressing invitation which I pleased myself by thinking though penned by Captain Lake came in reality from his beautiful young bride This small appendix was thus conceived P S Tom Wealdon as usual deep in elections under the rose begs you kindly to bring down whatever you think to be the best book or books on the subject and he will remit to your bookseller Order them in his name but bring them down with you So I was a second time going down to Brandon as honorary counsel without knowing it My invitations I fear were obtained if not under false pretences at least upon false estimates and the laity rated my legal lore too highly I reached Brandon rather late The bride had retired for the night I had a very late dinner in fact a supper in the parlour Lake sat with me chatting rather cleverly not pleasantly Wealdon was at Brandon about sessions business and as usual full of election stratagems and calculations Stanley volunteered to assure me he had not the faintest idea of looking for a constituency I really believe and at this distance of time I may use strong language in a historical sense that Captain Lake was the greatest liar I ever encountered with He seemed to do it without a purpose by instinct or on principle and would contradict himself solemnly twice or thrice in a week without seeming to perceive it I dare say he lied always and about everything But it was in matters of some moment that one perceived it What object could he gain for instance by the fib he had just told me On second thoughts this night he coolly apprised me that he had some idea of sounding the electors So my meal ended we went into the tapestry room where the night being sharp a pleasant bit of fire burned in the grate and Wealdon greeted me My journey though by rail and as easy as that of the Persian gentleman who skimmed the air seated on a piece of carpet predisposed me to sleep Such volumes of fine and various country air and such an eight hours procession of all sorts of natural pictures are not traversed without effect Sitting in my well stuffed chair my elbows on the cushioned arms the conversation of Lake and the Town Clerk now and then grew faint and their faces faded away and little fyttes and fragments of those light and pleasant dreams like fairy tales which visit such stolen naps superseded with their picturesque and musical illusions the realities and recollections of life Once or twice a nod a little too deep or sudden called me up But Lake was busy about the Dollington constituency and the Town Clerk s bluff face was serious and thoughtful It was the old question about Rogers the brewer and whether Lord Adleston and Sir William could not get him or else it had gone on to the great railway contractor Dobbs and the question how many votes his influence was really worth and somehow I never got very far into the pros and cons of these discussions which soon subsided into the fairy tale I have mentioned and that sweet perpendicular sleep all the sweeter like everything else for being contraband and irregular For one bout I fancy a good deal longer than the others my nap was much sounder than before and I opened my eyes at last with the shudder and half horror that accompany an awakening from a general chill a dismal and frightened sensation I was facing a door about twenty feet distant which exactly as I opened my eyes turned slowly on its hinges and the figure of Uncle Lorne in his loose flannel habiliments ineffaceably traced upon my memory like every other detail of that ill omened apparition glided into the room and crossing the thick carpet with long soft steps passed near me looking upon me with a malign sort of curiosity for some two or three seconds and sat down by the declining fire with a side long glance still fixed upon me I continued gazing on this figure with a dreadful incredulity and the indistinct feeling that it must be an illusion and that if I could only wake up completely it would vanish The fascination was disturbed by a noise at the other end of the room and I saw Lake standing close to him and looking both angry and frightened Tom Wealdon looking odd too was close at his elbow and had his hand on Lake s arm like a man who would prevent violence I do not know in the least what had passed before but Lake said How the devil did he come in Hush was all that Tom Wealdon said looking at the gaunt spectre with less of fear than inquisitiveness What are you doing here Sir demanded Lake in his most unpleasant tones Prophesying answered the phantom You had better write your prophecies in your room Sir had not you and give them to the Archbishop of Canterbury to proclaim when they are finished we are busy here just now and don t require revelations if you please The old man lifted up his long lean finger and turned on him with a smile which I hate even to remember Let him alone whispered the Town Clerk in a significant whisper don t cross him and he ll not stay long You re here a scribe murmured Uncle Lorne looking upon Tom Wealdon Aye Sir a scribe and a Pharisee a Sadducee and a publican and a priest and a Levite said the functionary with a wink at Lake Thomas Wealdon Sir happy to see you Sir so well and strong and likely to enlighten the religious world for many a day to come It s a long time Sir since I had the honour of seeing you and I m always of course at your command Pshaw said Lake angrily The Town Clerk pressed his arm with a significant side nod and a wink which seemed to say I understand him can t you let me manage him The old man did not seem to hear what they said but his tall figure rose up and he extended the fingers of his left hand close to the candle for a few seconds and then held them up to his eyes gazing on his finger tips with a horrified sort of scrutiny as if he saw signs and portents gathered there like Thomas Aquinas angels at the needles points and then the same cadaverous grin broke out over his features Mark Wylder is in an evil plight said he Is he said Lake with a sly scoff though he seemed to me a good deal scared We hear no complaints however and fancy he must be tolerably comfortable notwithstanding You know where he is said Uncle Lorne Aye in Italy everyone knows that answered Lake In Italy said the old man reflectively as if trying to gather up his ideas Italy Oh yes Vallombrosa aye Italy I know it well So do we Sir thank you for the information said Lake who nevertheless appeared strangely uneasy He has had a great tour to make It is nearly accomplished now when it is done he will be like me humano major He has seen the places which you are yet to see Nothing I should like better particularly Italy said Lake Yes said Uncle Lorne lifting up slowly a different finger at each name in his catalogue First Lucus Mortis then Terra Tenebrosa next Tartarus after that Terra Oblivionis then Herebus then Barathrum then Gehenna and then Stagium Ignis Of course acquiesced Lake with an ugly sneer and a mock bow And to think that all the white citizens were once men and women murmured Uncle Lorne with a scowl Quite so whispered Lake I know where he is resumed the old man with his finger on his long chin and looking down upon the carpet It would be very convenient if you would favour us with his address said Stanley with a gracious sneer I know what became of him continued the oracle You are more in his confidence than we are said Lake Don t be frightened but he s alive I think they ll make him mad It is a frightful plight Two angels buried him alive in Vallombrosa by night I saw it standing among the lotus and hemlock A negro came to me a black clergyman with white eyes and remained beside me and the angels imprisoned Mark they put him on duty forty days and forty nights with his ear to the river listening for voices and when it was over we blessed them and the clergyman walked with me a long while to and fro to and fro upon the earth telling me the wonders of the abyss And is it from the abyss Sir he writes his letters enquired the Town Clerk with a wink at Lake Yes yes very diligent it behoves him and his hair is always standing straight on his head for fear But he ll be sent up again at last a thousand a hundred ten and one black marble steps and then it will be the other one s turn So it was prophesied by the black magician I thought Sir you mentioned just now he was a clergyman suggested mister Wealdon who evidently enjoyed this wonderful yarn Clergyman and magician both and the chief of the lying prophets with thick lips He ll come here some night and see you said Uncle Lorne looking with a cadaverous apathy on Lake who was gazing at him in return with a sinister smile Maybe it was a vision Sir suggested the Town Clerk Yes Sir a vision maybe echoed the cavernous tones of the old man but in the flesh or out of the flesh I saw it You have had revelations Sir I ve heard said Stanley s mocking voice Many said the seer but a prophet is never honoured We live in solitude and privations the world hates us they stone us they cut us asunder even when we are dead Feel me I m cold and white all over I died too soon I d have had wings now only for that pistol I m as white as Gehazi except on my head when that blood comes Saying which he rose abruptly and with long jerking steps limped to the door at which I saw in the shade the face of a dark featured man looking gloomily in When he reached the door Uncle Lorne suddenly stopped and faced us with a countenance of wrath and fear and threw up his arms in an attitude of denunciation but said nothing I thought for a moment the gigantic spectre was about to rush upon us in an access of frenzy but whatever the impulse it subsided or was diverted by some new idea his countenance changed and he beckoned as if to some one in the corner of the room behind us and smiled his dreadful smile and so left the apartment That d d old madman is madder than ever said Lake in his fellest tones looking steadfastly with his peculiar gaze upon the closed door Jermyn is with him but he ll burn the house or murder some one yet It s all d d nonsense keeping him here did you see him at the door he was on the point of assailing some of us He ought to be in a madhouse He used to be very quiet said the Town Clerk who knew all about him Oh very quiet yes of course very quiet and quite harmless to people who don t live in the house with him and see him but once in half a dozen years but you can t persuade me it is quite so pleasant for those who happen to live under the same roof and are liable to be intruded upon as we have been to night every hour of their existence Well certainly it is not pleasant especially for ladies admitted the Town Clerk No not pleasant and I ve quite made up my mind it sha n t go on It is too absurd really that such a monstrous thing should be enforced I ll get a private Act next Session and regulate those absurd conditions in the will The old fellow ought to be under restraint and I rather think it would be better for himself that he were Who is he I asked speaking for the first time I thought you had seen him before now said Lake So I have but quite alone and without ever learning who he was I answered Oh He is the gentleman Julius for whom in the will under which we take those very odd provisions are made such as I believe no one but a Wylder or a Brandon would have dreamed of It is an odd state of things to hold one s estate under condition of letting a madman wander about your house and place making everybody in it uncomfortable and insecure and exposing him to the imminent risk of making away with himself either by accident or design I happen to know what Mark Wylder would have done for he spoke very fiercely on the subject perhaps he consulted you No No well he intended locking him quietly into the suite of three apartments you know at the far end of the old gallery and giving him full command of the mulberry garden by the little private stair and putting a good iron door to it so that my beloved brother Julius at present afflicted in mind Lake quoted the words of the will with an unpleasant sneer should have had his apartments and his pleasure grounds quite to himself And would that arrangement of mister Wylder s have satisfied the conditions of the will said the Town Clerk I rather think with proper precautions it would Mark Wylder was very shrewd and would not have run himself into a fix answered Lake I don t know any man shrewder he is certainly And Lake looked at us as he added these last words in turn with a quick suspicious glance as if he had said something rash and doubted whether we had observed it After a little more talk Lake and the Town Clerk resumed their electioneering conference and the lists of electors were passed under their scrutiny name by name like slides under the miscroscope There is a great deal in nature physical and moral that had as well not be ascertained It is better to take things on trust with something of distance and indistinctness What we gain in knowledge by scrutiny is sometimes paid for in a ghastly sort of disgust It is marvellous in a small constituency of three hundred average souls what a queer moral result one of these business like and narrow investigations which precede an election will furnish How you find them rated and classified what odd notes you make to them in the margin and after the trenchant and rapid vivisection what sinister scars and seams remain and how gaunt and repulsive old acquaintances stand up from it The Town Clerk knew the constituency of Dollington at his fingers ends and Stanley Lake quietly enjoyed as certain minds will the nefarious and shabby metamorphosis which every now and then some familiar and respectable burgess underwent in the spell of half a dozen dry sentences whispered in his ear and all this minute information is trustworthy and quite without malice I went to my bed room and secured the door lest Uncle Lorne or Julius should make me another midnight visit So that mystery was cleared up Neither ghost nor spectral illusion but flesh and blood though in my mind there has always been a horror of a madman akin to the ghostly or demoniac I do not know how late Tom Wealdon and Stanley Lake sat up over their lists but I dare say they were in no hurry to leave them for a dissolution was just then expected and no time was to be lost When I saw Tom Wealdon alone next day in the street of Gylingden he walked a little way with me and said Tom with a grave wink Don t let the captain up there be hard on the poor old gentleman He s quite harmless he would not hurt a fly I know all about him for Jack Ford and I spent five weeks in the Hall about twelve years ago when the family were away and thought the keeper was not kind to him He s quite gentle and sometimes he d make you die o laughing He fancies you know he s a prophet and says he s that old Sir Lorne Brandon that shot himself in his bed room Well he is a rum one and we used to draw him out poor Jack and me I never laughed so much I don t think in the same time before or since But he s as innocent as a child and you know them directions in the will is very strong and they say Jos Larkin does not like the captain a bit too well and he has the will off every word of it and I think if Captain Lake does not take care he may get into trouble and maybe it would not be amiss if you gave him a hint Tom Wealdon indeed was a good natured fellow and if he had had his way I think the world would have gone smoothly enough with most people CHAPTER XLIX LARCOM THE BUTLER VISITS THE ATTORNEY Now I may as well mention here an occurrence which seeming very insignificant has yet a bearing upon the current of this tale and it is this About four days after the receipt of the despatches to which the conference of Captain Lake and the attorney referred there came a letter from the same prolific correspondent dated twentieth March from Genoa which altogether puzzled mister Larkin 
6014_32904_000003_000002	train-clean-360	It commenced thus 
none	none	Genoa twentieth march
6014_32904_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 DEAR LARKIN I hope you did the three commissions all right 
none	none	Wealdon won t refuse I reckon but don t let Lake guess what the one hundred fifty l is for Pay Martin for the job when finished it is under sixty l mind and get it looked at first 
6014_32904_000006_000000	train-clean-360	There was a great deal more but these were the passages which perplexed Larkin 
6014_32904_000006_000001	train-clean-360	He unlocked the iron safe and took out the sheaf of Wylder s letters and conned the last one over very carefully 
none	none	Why said he holding the text before his eyes in one hand and with the fingers of the other touching the top of his bald forehead Tom Wealdon is not once mentioned in this nor in any of them and this palpably refers to some direction And one hundred fifty l no such sum has been mentioned And what is this job of Martin s 
6014_32904_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Is it Martin of the China Kilns or Martin of the bank 
6014_32904_000007_000003	train-clean-360	That too plainly refers to a former letter not a word of the sort 
none	none	This is very odd indeed Larkin s finger tips descended over his eyebrow and scratched in a miniature way there for a few seconds and then his large long hand descended further to his chin and his under lip was as usual in deep thought fondled and pinched between his finger and thumb
6014_32904_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 There has plainly been a letter lost manifestly 
none	none	I never knew anything wrong in this Gylingden office Driver has been always correct but it is hard to know any man for certain in this world 
6014_32904_000009_000003	train-clean-360	I don t think the captain would venture anything so awfully hazardous 
none	none	I really can t suspect so monstrous a thing but unquestionably a letter has been lost and who s to take it Larkin made a fuller endorsement than usual on this particular letter and ruminated over the correspondence a good while with his lip between his finger and thumb and a shadow on his face before he replaced it in its iron drawer
6014_32904_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 It is not a thing to be passed over murmured the attorney who had come to a decision as to the first step to be taken and he thought with a qualm of the effect of one of Wylder s confidential notes getting into Captain Lake s hands 
6014_32904_000012_000000	train-clean-360	While he was buttoning his walking boots with his foot on the chair before the fire a tap at his study door surprised him 
none	none	A hurried glance on the table satisfying him that no secret paper or despatch lay there he called Come in And mister Larcom the grave butler of Brandon wearing outside his portly person a black garment then known as a zephyr a white choker and black trousers and well polished but rather splay shoes and on the whole his fat and serious aspect considered being capable of being mistaken for a church dignitary or at least for an eminent undertaker entered the room with a solemn and gentlemanlike reverence Oh mister Larcom a message or business said mister Larkin urbanely Not a message Sir only an enquiry about them few shares answered mister Larcom with another serene reverence and remaining standing hat in hand at the door
6014_32904_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes and how do you do mister Larcom 
none	none	Quite well I trust Yes about the Naunton Junction Well I m happy to tell you but pray take a chair that I have succeeded and the directors have allotted you five shares and it s your own fault if you don t make two ten and six a share The Chowsleys are up to six and a half I see here and he pointed to the Times mister Larcom s fat face smiled in spite of his endeavour to keep it under It was part of his business to look always grave and he coughed and recovered his gravity I m very thankful Sir said mister Larcom very
6014_32904_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 But do sit down mister Larcom pray do said the attorney who was very gracious to Larcom You ll get the scrip you know on executing but the shares are allotted 
none	none	They sent the notice for you here And and how are the family at Brandon all well I trust mister Larcom blew his nose All Sir well And and let me give you a glass of sherry mister Larcom after your walk I can t compete with the Brandon sherry mister Larcom Wonderful fine wine that but still I m told this is not a bad wine notwithstanding 
6014_32904_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Larcom received it with grave gratitude and sipped it and spoke respectfully of it 
none	none	And and any news in that quarter of mister Mark Wylder any any surmise 
6014_32904_000024_000001	train-clean-360	I you know I m interested for all parties 
none	none	Well Sir of mister Wylder I can t say as I know no more than he s been a subjek of much unpleasant feelin which I should say there has been a great deal of angry talk since I last saw you Sir between Miss Lake and the capting Ah yes you mentioned something of the kind and your own impression that Captain Lake which I trust may turn out to be so knows where mister Mark Wylder is at present staying I much misdoubt Sir it won t turn out to be no good story for no one said mister Larcom in a low and sad tone and with a long shake of his head No good story hey How do you mean Larcom Well Sir I know you won t mention me mister Larkin Certainly not go on When people gets hot a talking they won t mind a body comin in and that s how the capting and Miss Rachel Lake they carried on their dispute like though me coming into the room Just so and what do you found your opinion about mister Mark Wylder on Well Sir I could not hear more than a word now and a sentince again and pickin what meaning I could out of what Miss Lake said and the capting could not deny I do suspeck Sir most serious as how they have put mister Mark Wylder into a mad house and that s how I think it s gone with him an you ll never see him out again if the capting has his will Do you mean to say you actually think he s shut up in a madhouse at this moment demanded the attorney his little pink eyes opened quite round and his lank cheeks and tall forehead flushed at the rush of wild ideas that whirred round him like a covey of birds at the startling suggestion 
6014_32904_000035_000000	train-clean-360	The butler nodded gloomily 
6014_32904_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Larkin continued to stare on him in silence with his round eyes for some seconds after 
none	none	In a mad house Pooh pooh incredible Pooh impossible 
6014_32904_000047_000000	train-clean-360	quite impossible 
none	none	Did either Miss Lake or the captain use the word mad house Well no Or any other word lunatic asylum or a bedlam or or any other word meaning the same thing Well I can t say Sir as I remember but I rayther think not I only know for certain I took it so and I do believe as how mister Mark Wylder is confined in a mad house and the captain knows all about it and won t do nothing to get him out H m very odd very strange but it is only from the general tenor of what passed by a sort of guess work you have arrived at that conclusion Larcom assented
6014_32904_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Well mister Larcom I think you have been led into an erroneous conclusion 
none	none	Indeed I may mention I have reason to think so in fact to know that such is the case What you mention to me you know as a friend of the family and holding as I do a confidential position in fact a very confidential one alike in relation to mister Wylder and to the family of Brandon Hall is of course sacred and anything that comes from you mister Larcom is never heard in connection with your name beyond these walls And let me add it strikes me as highly important both in the interests of the leading individuals in this unpleasant business and also as pertaining to your own comfort and security that you should carefully avoid communicating what you have just mentioned to any other party You understand 
6014_32904_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Larcom did understand perfectly and so this little visit ended 
none	none	mister Larkin took a turn or two up and down the room thinking He stopped with his fingertips to his eyebrow and thought more Then he took another turn and stopped again and threw back his head and gazed for a while on the ceiling and then he stood for a time at the window with his lip between his finger and thumb 
6014_32904_000045_000000	train-clean-360	No it was a mistake it could not be 
6014_32904_000045_000001	train-clean-360	It was Mark Wylder s penmanship he could swear to it 
none	none	There was no trace of madness in his letters nor of restraint It was not possible even that he was wandering from place to place under the coercion of a couple of keepers No Wylder was an energetic and somewhat violent person with high animal courage and would be sure to blow up and break through any such machination 
6014_32904_000045_000005	train-clean-360	No no with Mark Wylder it was quite out of the question altogether visionary and impracticable 
none	none	Persons like Larcom do make such absurd blunders and so misapprehend the conversation of educated people Nothwithstanding all which there remained in his mind an image of Mark Wylder in the straw and darkness of a solitary continental mad house squalid neglected and becoming gradually that which he was said to be And he always shaped him somehow after the outlines of a grizzly print he remembered in his boyish days of a maniac chained in a Sicilian cell grovelling under the lash of a half seen gaoler and with his teeth buried in his own arm Quite impossible Mark Wylder was the last man in the world to submit to physical coercion The idea besides could not be reconciled with the facts of the case It was all a blundering chimera mister Larkin walked down direct to Gylingden and paid a rather awful visit to mister Driver of the post office A foreign letter addressed to him had most positively been lost 
6014_32904_000048_000002	train-clean-360	He had called to mention the circumstance lest mister Driver should be taken by surprise by official investigation Was it possible that the letter had been sent by mistake to Brandon to Captain Lake 
none	none	Lake and Larkin you know might be mistaken 
6014_32904_000048_000004	train-clean-360	At all events it would be well to make your clerks recollect themselves mister Larkin knew that Driver s clerks were his daughters It is not easy to meet with a young fellow that is quite honest 
none	none	But if they knew that they would be subjected to a sifting examination on oath on the arrival of the commissioner they might possibly prefer finding the letter in which case there would be no more about it mister Driver knew him mister Larkin and he might tell his young men if they got the letter for him they should hear no more of it The people of Gylingden knew very well that when the rat like glitter twinkled in mister Larkin s eyes and the shadow came over his long face there was mischief brewing CHAPTER L NEW LIGHTS A few days later Jos Larkin esquire The Lodge Gylingden received from London a printed form duly filled in and with the official signature attached informing him that enquiry having been instituted in consequence of his letter no result had been obtained The hiatus in his correspondence caused mister Larkin extreme uneasiness He had a profound distrust of Captain Lake In fact he thought him capable of everything And if there should turn out to be anything not quite straight going on at the post office of Gylingden hitherto an unimpeached institution he had no doubt whatsoever that that dark and sinuous spirit was at the bottom of it Still it was too prodigious and too hazardous to be probable but the captain had no sort of principle and a desperately strong head There was not indeed when they met yesterday the least change or consciousness in the captain s manner That in another man would have indicated something but Stanley Lake was so deep such a mask in him it meant nothing mister Larkin s next step was to apply for a commissioner to come down and investigate But before he had time to take this step an occurrence took place to arrest his proceedings It was the receipt of a foreign letter of which the following is an exact copy VENICE March twenty eight DEAR LARKIN I read a rumour of a dissolution during the recess Keep a bright look out Here s three things for you one Try and get Tom Wealdon He is a sina que non Mark s Latin was sailor like two Cash the enclosed order for one hundred fifty l more for the same stake three Tell Martin the tiles I saw in August last will answer for the cow house and let him put them down at once In haste Yours truly M WYLDER Enclosed was an order on Lake for one hundred fifty l When Larkin got this he was in his study Why why this positively this is the letter How s this And mister Larkin looked as much scared and astonished as if a spirit rose up before him This is the letter aye this is the letter He repeated this from time to time as he turned it over and looked at the postmark and back again at the letter and looked up at the date and down at the signature and read the note through Yes this is it here it is this is it There s no doubt whatever this is the letter referred to in the last Wealdon Martin and the one hundred fifty l And the attorney took out his keys looking pale and stern like a man about to open the door upon a horror and unlocked his safe and took out the oft consulted and familiar series letters tied up and bearing the label Mark Wylder esquire Aye here it is Genoa twentieth and this Venice twenty eighth Yes the postmarks correspond yet the letter from Genoa dated twentieth refers back to the letter from Venice written eight days later the Well I can t comprehend how in the name of how in the name He placed the two letters on his desk and read them over and up and down and pondered darkly over them It is Mark Wylder s writing I ll swear to it What on earth can he mean He can t possibly want to confuse us upon dates as well as places because that would simply render his letters for purposes of business nugatory and there are many things he wishes attended to Jos Larkin rose from his desk ruminating and went to the window and placed the letter against the pane I don t think he had any definite motive in doing this but something struck him that he had not remarked before There was something different in the quality of the ink that wrote the number of the date twenty eighth from that used in the rest of the letter What can that mean muttered Larkin with a sort of gasp at his discovery and shading his eyes with his hand he scrutinised the numerals twenty eighth again a totally different ink He took the previous letter frowned on it fiercely from his rat like eyes and then with an ejaculation as like an oath as so good a man could utter he exclaimed I have it Then came a pause and he said Both alike blanks left when the letters were written and the dates filled in afterward not the same hand I think no not the same positively a different hand Then Jos Larkin examined these mysterious epistles once more There may be something in what Larcom said a very great deal possibly If he was shut up somewhere they could make him write a set of these letters off at a sitting and send them from place to place to be posted to make us think he was travelling and prevent our finding where they keep him Here it is plain there was a slip in posting the wrong one first Trepanned kidnapped hid away in the crypts of some remote mad house reduced to submission by privation and misery a case as desperate as that of a prisoner in the Inquisition What could be the motive for this elaborate and hideous fraud Would it not be a more convenient course as well as more merciful to put him to death The crime would hardly be greater Why should he be retained in that ghastly existence Well if Stanley Lake were at the bottom of this horrid conspiracy he certainly had a motive in clearing the field of his rival And then for the attorney had all the family settlements present to his mind there was this clear motive for prolonging his life that by the slip in the will under which Dorcas Brandon inherited the bulk of her estate would terminate with the life of Mark Wylder and this other motive too existed for retaining him in the house of bondage that by preventing his marriage and his having a family to succeed him the reversion of his brother William was reduced to a certainty and would become a magnificent investment for Stanley Lake whenever he might choose to purchase Upon that purchase however the good attorney had cast his eye He thought he now began to discern the outlines of a gigantic and symmetrical villainy emerging through the fog If this theory were right William Wylder s reversion was certain to take effect and it was exasperating that the native craft and daring of this inexperienced captain should forestall so accomplished a man of business as Jos Larkin The attorney began to hate Stanley Lake as none but a man of that stamp can hate the person who mars a scheme of aggrandisement But what was he to do exactly If the captain had his eye on the reversion it would require nice navigation to carry his plan successfully through On the other hand it was quite possible that Wylder was a free agent and yet for purposes of secrecy employing another person to post his letters at various continental towns and this blunder might just as well have happened in this case as in any other that supposed the same machinery On the whole then it was a difficult question But there were Larcom s conclusions about the mad house to throw into the balance And though as respected Mark Wylder they were grisly the attorney would not have been sorry to be quite sure that they were sound What he most needed were ascertained data With these his opportunities were immense mister Larkin eyed the Wylder correspondence now with a sort of reverence that was new to him There was something supernatural and talismanic in the mystery The sheaf of letters lay before him on the table like Cornelius Agrippa s bloody book a thing to conjure with What prodigies might it not accomplish for its happy possessor if only he could read it aright and command the spirits which its spells might call up before him Yes it was a stupendous secret Who knew to what it might conduct There was a shade of guilt in his tamperings with it akin to the black art which he felt without acknowledging This little parcel of letters was in its evil way a holy thing While it lay on the table the room became the holy of holies in his dark religion and the lank attorney with tall bald head shaded face and hungry dangerous eyes a priest or a magician The attorney quietly bolted his study door and stood erect with his hands in his pockets looking sternly down on the letters Then he took a little gazetteer off a tiny shelf near the bell rope where was a railway guide an English dictionary a French ditto and a Bible and with his sharp penknife he deftly sliced from its place in the work of reference the folded map of Europe It was destined to illustrate the correspondence and Larkin sat down before it and surveyed with a solemn stare the wide scene of Mark Wylder s operations as a general would the theatre of his rival s strategy Referring to the letters as he proceeded with a sharp pen in red ink he made his natty little note upon each town or capital in succession from which Wylder had dated a despatch Boulogne for instance a neat little red cross over the town and beneath twelfth October eighteen fifty four Brighton ditto twentieth October eighteen fifty four Paris ditto seventeenth November eighteen fifty four Marseilles ditto twenty sixth November eighteen fifty four Frankfurt ditto twenty second February eighteen fifty five Geneva ditto tenth March eighteen fifty five Genoa ditto twentieth March eighteen fifty five Venice ditto twenty eighth March eighteen fifty five I may here mention that in the preceding notation I have marked the days and months exactly but the years fancifully I don t think that mister Larkin had read the Wandering Jew He had no great taste for works of fancy If he had he might have been reminded as he looked down upon the wild field of tactics just noted by his pen of that globe similarly starred all over with little red crosses which M Rodin was wont to consult Now he was going into this business as he did into others methodically He therefore read what his gazetteer had to say about these towns and cities standing for better light at the window But though the type being small his eyes were more pink than before he was nothing wiser the information being of that niggardly historical and statistical kind which availed nothing in his present scrutiny He would get Murray s handbooks and all sorts of works he was determined to read it up He was going into this as into a great speculative case in which he had a heavy stake with all his activity craft and unscrupulousness It might be the making of him His treasure his oracle his book of power the labelled parcel of Wylder s letters with the annotated map folded beside them he replaced in their red taped ligature in his iron safe and with Chubb s key in his pocket took his hat and cane the day was fine and walked forth for Brandon and the captain s study A pleasant day a light air a frosty sun On the green the vicar with his pretty boy by the hand passed him not a hundred yards off like a ship at sea There was a waving of hands and smiles and a shouted beautiful day What a position that poor fellow has got himself into good mister Larkin thought with a shrug of compassion to himself That reversion Why it s nothing I really don t know why I think about it at all If it were offered me this moment positively I would not have it Anything certain any thing would be better Little Fairy grew grave in spite of the attorney s smiles whenever he saw him He was now saying as holding his Wapsie s hand he capered round in front looking up in his face Why has mister Larkin no teeth when he laughs Is he ever angry when he laughs is he Wapsie oh Wapsie is he Would you let him whip me if I was naughty I don t like him Why does mamma say he is a good man Wapsie Because little man he is a good man said the vicar recalled by the impiety of the question The best friend that Wapsie ever met with in his life But you would not give me to him Wapsie Give you darling no to no one but to God my little man for richer for poorer you re my own your Wapsie s little man And he lifted him up and carried him in his arms against his loving heart and the water stood in his eyes as he laughed fondly into that pretty face But little man by this time was struggling to get down and give chase to a crow grubbing near them for dainties with a muddy beak and Wapsie s eyes followed smiling the wild vagaries of his little Fairy In the mean time mister Larkin had got among the noble trees of Brandon and was approaching the lordly front of the Hall His mind was busy He had not very much fact to go upon His theories were built chiefly of vapour and every changing light or breath therefore altered their colouring and outlines Maybe Mark Wylder is mad and wandering in charge of a keeper maybe he is in some mad doctor s house and not mad maybe in England and there writes these letters which are sent from one continental town to another to be posted and thus the appearance of locomotion is kept up Perhaps he has been inveigled into the hands of ruffians and is living as it were under the vault of an Inquisition and compelled to write what ever his gaolers dictate Maybe he writes not under physical but moral coercion Be the fact how it may those Lakes brother and sister have a guilty knowledge of the affair I will be firm it is my duty to clear this matter up if I can we must do as we would be done by CHAPTER LI A FRACAS IN THE LIBRARY It was still early in the day Larcom received him gravely in the hall Captain Lake was at home as usual up to one o clock in the library the most diligent administrator that Brandon had perhaps ever known Well Larkin letters letters perpetually you see Quite well I hope Won t you sit down no bad news You look rather melancholy Your other client is not ill nothing sad about Mark Wylder I hope No nothing sad Captain Lake nothing but a good deal that is strange Oh is there said Lake in his soft tones leaning forward in his easy chair and looking on the shining points of his boots I have found out a thing Captain Lake which will no doubt interest you as much as it does me It will lead I think to a much more exact guess about mister Mark Wylder There was a sturdy emphasis in the attorney s speech which was far from usual and indicated something Oh you have May one hear it said Lake in the same silken tone and looking down as before on his boots I ve discovered something about his letters said the attorney and paused Satisfactory I hope said Lake as before Foul play Sir Foul play is there What is he doing now said Lake in the same languid way his elbows on the arms of his chair stooping forward and looking serenely on the floor like a man who is tired of his work and enjoys his respite Why Captain Lake the matter is this it amounts in fact to fraud It is plain that the letters are written in batches several at a time and committed to some one to carry from town to town and post having previously filled in dates to make them correspond with the exact period of posting them The attorney s searching gaze was fixed on the captain as he said this with all the significance consistent with civility but he could not observe the slightest indication of change I dare say the captain felt his gaze upon him and he undoubtedly heard his emphasis but he plainly did not take either to himself Indeed that is very odd said Captain Lake Very odd echoed the attorney It struck mister Larkin that his gallant friend was a little overacting and showing perhaps less interest in the discovery than was strictly natural But how can you show it said Lake with a slight yawn Wylder is such a fellow I don t the least pretend to understand him It may be a freak of his I don t think Captain Lake that is exactly a possible solution here I don t think Sir he would write two letters one referring back to the other at the same time and post and date the latter more than a week before the other Oh said Lake quietly for the first time exhibiting a slight change of countenance and looking peevish and excited yes that certainly does look very oddly And I think Captain Lake it behoves us to leave no stone unturned to sift this matter to the bottom With what particular purpose I don t quite see said Lake Don t you think possibly Mark Wylder might think us very impertinent I think Captain Lake on the contrary we might be doing that gentleman the only service he is capable of receiving and I know we should be doing something toward tracing and exposing the machinations of a conspiracy A conspiracy I did not quite see your meaning Then you really think there is a conspiracy formed by him or against him which Against him Captain Lake Did the same idea never strike you Not I think that I can recollect In none of your conversations upon the subject with with members of your family continued the attorney with a grave significance I say Sir I don t recollect said Lake glaring for an instant in his face very savagely And it seems to me that sitting here you fancy yourself examining some vagrant or poacher at Gylingden sessions And pray Sir have you no evidence in the letters you speak of but the insertion of dates and the posting them in inverse order to lead you to that strong conclusion None as supplied by the letters themselves answered Larkin a little doggedly and I venture to think that is rather strong Quite so to a mind like yours said Lake with a faint gleam of his unpleasant smile thrown upon the floor but other men don t see it and I hope at all events there s a likelihood that Mark Wylder will soon return and look after his own business I m quite tired of it and of he was going to say you of everything connected with it This delay is attended with more serious mischief The vicar his brother had a promise of money from him and is disappointed in very great embarrassments and in fact were it not for some temporary assistance which I may mention although I don t speak of such things I afforded him myself he must have been ruined It is very sad said Lake but he ought not to have married without an income Very true Captain Lake there s no defending that it was wrong but the retribution is terrible and the righteous man shook his tall head Don t you think he might take steps to relieve himself considerably I don t see it Captain Lake said the attorney sadly and drily Well you know best but are not there resources I don t see Captain Lake what you point at I ll give him something for his reversion if he chooses and make him comfortable for his life The attorney somehow didn t seem to take kindly to this proposition We know he had imagined for himself some little flirtation on this behalf and cherished a secret tendre for the same reversion Perhaps he had other plans too At all events it flashed the same suspicion of Lake upon his mind again and he said I don t know Sir that the Reverend mister Wylder would entertain anything in the nature of a sale of his reversion I rather think the contrary I don t think his friends would advise it And why not It was never more than a contingency and now they say Mark Wylder is married and has children they tell me he was seen at Ancona said Lake tranquilly They tell you who are they said the attorney and his dove s eyes were gone again and the rat s eyes unequivocally looking out of the small pink lids They they repeated Captain Lake Why of course Sir I use the word in its usual sense that is there was a rumour when I was last in town and I really forget who told me Some one two or three perhaps Do you think it s true Sir persisted mister Larkin No Sir I don t said Captain Lake fixing his eyes for a moment with a frank stare on the attorney s face but it is quite possible it may be true If it is you know Sir said Jos Larkin the reversion would be a bad purchase at a halfpenny I don t believe it either Sir resumed the attorney after a little interval and I could not advise the party you named Sir to sell his remainder for a song You ll advise as you please Sir and no doubt not without sufficient reason retorted Captain Lake There was a suspicion of a sneer not in his countenance not in his tone not necessarily in his words but somehow a suspicion which stung the attorney like a certainty and a pinkish flush tinged his forehead Perhaps mister Larkin had not yet formed any distinct plans and was really in considerable dubitation But as we know perceiving that the situation of affairs like all uncertain conjunctures offered manifestly an opportunity for speculation he was perhaps desirous like our old friend Sindbad of that gleam of light which might show him the gold and precious stones with which the floor of the catacomb was strewn You see Captain Lake to speak quite frankly there s nothing like being perfectly frank and open although you have not treated me with confidence which of course was not called for in this particular instance I may as well say in passing that I have no doubt on my mind you know a great deal more than you care to tell about the fate of mister Mark Wylder I look upon it Sir that that party has been made away with Old villain exclaimed Lake starting up with a sudden access of energy and his face looked whiter still than usual perhaps it was only the light It won t do Sir said Larkin with a sinister quietude I say there s been foul play I think Sir you ve got him into some foreign mad house or place of confinement and I won t stop till it s sifted to the bottom It is my duty Sir Captain Lake s slender hand sprang on the attorney s collar coat and waistcoat together and his knuckles hard and sharp were screwed against mister Larkin s jaw bone as he shook him and his face was like a drift of snow with two yellow fires glaring in it It was ferine and spectral and so tremendously violent that the long attorney expecting nothing of the sort was thrown out of his balance against the chimneypiece You d d old miscreant I ll pitch you out of the window I I say let go You re mad Sir said the attorney disengaging himself with a sudden and violent effort and standing with the back of a tall chair grasped in both hands and the seat interposed between himself and Captain Lake He was twisting his neck uncomfortably in his shirt collar and for some seconds was more agitated in a different way than his patron was The fact was that mister Larkin had a little mistaken his man He had never happened before to see him in one of his violent moods and fancied that his apathetic manner indicated a person more easily bullied There was something too in the tone and look of Captain Lake which went a good way to confound and perplex his suspicions and he half fancied that the masterstroke he had hazarded was a rank and irreparable blunder Something of this I am sure appeared in his countenance and Captain Lake looked awfully savage and each gentleman stared the other full in the face with more frankness than became two such diplomatists Allow me to speak a word Captain Lake You d d old miscreant repeated the candescent captain Allow me to say you misapprehend You infernal old cur I mean no imputation upon you Sir I thought you might have committed a mistake any man may perhaps you have I have acted Captain Lake with fidelity in all respects to you and to every client for whom I ve been concerned mister Wylder is my client and I was bound to say I was not satisfied about his present position which seems to me unaccountable except on the supposition that he is under restraint of some sort I never said you were to blame but you may be in error respecting mister Wylder You may have taken steps Captain Lake under a mistake I never went further than that On reflection you ll say so I didn t upon my honour Then you did not mean to insult me Sir said Lake Upon my honour and conscience and soul Captain Lake said the attorney stringing together in his vindication all the articles he was assumed most to respect I am perfectly frank I do assure you I never supposed for an instant more than I say I could not imagine I am amazed you have so taken it But you think I exercise some control or coercion over my cousin mister Mark Wylder He s not a man I can tell you wherever he is to be bullied no more than I am I don t correspond with him I have nothing to do with him or his affairs I wash my hands of him Captain Lake turned and walked quickly to the door but came back as suddenly Shake hands Sir We ll forget it I accept what you say but don t talk that way to me again I can t imagine what the devil put such stuff in your head I don t care twopence No one s to blame but Wylder himself I say I don t care a farthing Upon my honour I quite see I now acquit you You could not mean what you seemed to say and I can t understand how a sensible man like you knowing Mark Wylder and knowing me Sir could use such such ambiguous language I have no more influence with him and can no more affect his doings or what you call his fate and to say the truth care about them no more than the child unborn He s his own master of course What the devil can you have been dreaming of I don t even get a letter from him He s nothing to me You have misunderstood me but that s over Sir I may have spoken with warmth fearing that you might be acting under some cruel misapprehension that s all and you don t think worse of me I m very sure Captain Lake for a little indiscreet zeal on behalf of a gentleman who has treated me with such unlimited confidence as mister Wylder I d do the same for you Sir it s my character The two gentlemen you perceive though still agitated were becoming reasonable and more or less complimentary and conciliatory and the masks which an electric gust had displaced for a moment revealing gross and somewhat repulsive features were being readjusted while each looked over his shoulder I am sorry to say that when that good man mister Larkin left his presence Captain Lake indulged in a perfectly blasphemous monologue His fury was excited to a pitch that was very nearly ungovernable and after it had exhibited itself in the way I have said Captain Lake opened a little despatch box and took therefrom a foreign letter but three days received He read it through his ill omened smile expanded to a grin that was undisguisedly diabolical With a scissors he clipt his own name where it occurred from the thin sheet and then in red ink and Roman capitals he scrawled a line or two across the interior of the letter enclosed it in an envelope directed it and then rang the bell He ordered the tax cart and two horses to drive tandem The captain was rather a good whip and he drove at a great pace to Dollington took the train on to Charteris there posted his letter and so returned his temper continuing savage all that evening and in a modified degree in the same state for several days after CHAPTER LII AN OLD FRIEND LOOKS INTO THE GARDEN AT REDMAN S FARM Lady Chelford with one of those sudden changes of front which occur in female strategy on hearing that Stanley Lake was actually accepted by Dorcas had assailed both him and his sister whom heretofore she had a good deal petted and distinguished with a fury that was startling As respects Rachel we know how unjust was the attack And when the dowager opened her fire on Rachel the young lady replied with a spirit and dignity to which she was not at all accustomed So soon as Dorcas obtained a hearing which was not for sometime for she as a miserable and ridiculous victim and idiot was nearly as deep in disgrace as those shameless harpies the Lakes she told the whole truth as respected all parties with her superb and tranquil frankness Lady Chelford ordered her horses and was about to leave Brandon next morning But rheumatism arrested her indignant flight and during her week s confinement to her room her son contrived so that she consented to stay for the odious ceremony and was even sourly civil to Miss Lake who received her advances quite as coldly as they were made To Miss Lake Lord Chelford though not in set terms yet in many pleasant ways apologised for his mother s impertinence Dorcas had told him also the story of Rachel s decided opposition to the marriage He was so particularly respectful to her he showed her by the very form into which he shaped his good wishes that he knew how frankly she had opposed the marriage how true she had been to her friend Dorcas and she understood him and was grateful In fact Lord Chelford whatever might be his opinion of the motives of Captain Lake and the prudence of Dorcas was clearly disposed to make the best of the inevitable and to stamp the new Brandon alliance with what ever respectability his frank recognition could give it Old Lady Chelford s bitter and ominous acquiescence also came and the presence of mother and son at the solemnity averted the family scandal which the old lady s first access of frenzy threatened This duty discharged she insisted in the interest of her rheumatism upon change of air and on arriving at Duxley was quite surprised to find Lady Dulhampton and her daughters there upon a similar quest About the matrimonial likelihoods of gentlemen with titles and estates Fame that most tuft hunting of divinities is always distending her cheeks and blowing the very finest flourishes her old trumpet affords Lord Chelford was not long away when the story of Lady Constance was again alive and vocal It reached old Jackson through his sister who was married to the brother of the Marquis of Dulhampton s solicitor It reached Lake from Tom Twitters of his club who kept the Brandon Captain au courant of the town talk and it came to Dorcas in a more authentic fashion though mysteriously and rather in the guise of a conundrum than of a distinct bit of family intelligence from no less a person than the old Dowager Lady Chelford herself Stanley Lake who had begun to entertain hopes for Rachel in that direction went down to Redman s Farm and after his bleak and bitter fashion rated the young lady for having perversely neglected her opportunities and repulsed that most desirable parti In this he was intensely in earnest for the connection would have done wonders for Captain Lake in the county Rachel met this coarse attack with quiet contempt told him that Lord Chelford had she supposed no idea of marrying out of his own rank and further that he Captain Lake must perfectly comprehend if he could not appreciate the reasons which would for ever bar any such relation But Rachel though she treated the subject serenely in this interview was sadder and more forlorn than ever and lay awake at night and perhaps if we knew all shed some secret tears and then with time came healing of these sorrows It was a fallacy a mere chimera that was gone an impracticability too She had smiled at it as such when Dorcas used to hint at it but are there no castles in the clouds which we like to inhabit although we know them altogether air built and whose evaporation desolates us Rachel s talks with the vicar were frequent and poor little missus William Wylder who knew not the reason of his visits fell slowly and to the good man s entire bewilderment into a chronic jealousy It expressed itself enigmatically it was circumlocutory sad and mysterious Little Fairy was so pleased with his visit to Redman s Farm to day He told me all about it did not you little man But still you love poor old mamma best of all you would not like to have a new mamma Ah no you d rather have your poor old ugly Mussie I wish I was handsome my little man and clever but wishing is vain Ah Willie there was a time when you could not see how ugly and dull your poor foolish little wife was but it could not last for ever How did it happen oh how you such a scholar so clever so handsome my beautiful Willie how did you ever look down on poor wretched me I think it will be fine Willie and Miss Lake will expect you at Redman s Farm and little Fairy will go too yes you d like to go and mamma will stay at home and try to be useful in her poor miserable way and so on The vicar thinking of other things never seeing the reproachful irony in all this would take it quite literally assent sadly and with little Fairy by the hand set forth for Redman s Farm and the good little body to the amazement of her two maids would be heard passionately weeping in the parlour in her forsaken state At last there came a great upbraiding a great eclaircissement and laughter and crying and hugging and the poor little woman quite relieved went off immediately in her gratitude to Rachel and paid her quite an affectionate little visit Jealousy is very unreasonable But have we no compensation in this that the love which begets it is often as unreasonable Look in the glass and then into your own heart and ask your conscience next Am I really quite a hero or altogether so lovely as I am beloved Keep the answer to yourself but be tender with the vehement follies of your jealous wife Poor mortals It is but a short time we have to love and be jealous and love again One night after a long talk in the morning with good William Wylder and great dejection following all on a sudden Rachel sat up in her bed and in a pleasant voice and looking more like herself than she had for many months she said I think I have found the true way out of my troubles Tamar At every sacrifice to be quite honest and to that Tamar I have made up my mind at last thank God Come Tamar and kiss me for I am free once more So that night passed peacefully Rachel a changed Rachel still though more like her early self was now in the tiny garden of Redman s Farm The early spring was already showing its bright green through the brown of winter and sun and shower alternating and the gay gossiping of sweet birds among the branches were calling the young creation from its slumbers The air was so sharp so clear so sunny the mysterious sense of coming life so invigorating and the sounds and aspect of nature so rejoicing that Rachel with her gauntlets on her white basket of flower seeds her trowel and all her garden implements beside her felt her own spring of life return and rejoiced in the glad hour that shone round her Lifting up her eyes she saw Lord Chelford looking over the little gate What a charming day said he with his pleasant smile raising his hat and how very pleasant to see you at your pretty industry again As Rachel came forward in her faded gardening costume an old silk shawl about her shoulders and hoodwise over her head somehow very becoming there was a blush he could not help seeing it on her young face and for a moment her fine eyes dropped and she looked up smiling a more thoughtful and a sadder smile than in old days The picture of that smile so gay and fearless and yet so feminine rose up beside the sadder smile that greeted him now and he thought of Ondine without and Ondine with a soul I am afraid I am a very impertinent at least a very inquisitive wayfarer but I could not pass by without a word even at the risk of interrupting you And the truth is I believe if it had not been for that chance of seeing and interrupting you I should not have passed through Redman s Dell to day He laughed a little as he said this and held her hands some seconds longer than is strictly usual in such a greeting You are staying at Brandon said Rachel not knowing exactly what to say Yes Dorcas who is always very good to me made me promise to come whenever I was at Drackley I arrived yesterday and they tell me you stay so much at home that possibly you might not appear in the upper world for two or three days so I had not patience you see It was now Rachel s turn to laugh a musical little roulade but somehow her talk was neither so gay nor so voluble as it used to be She liked to listen she would not for the world their little conversation ended before its time but there was an unwonted difficulty in finding anything to say It is quite true I am more a stay at home than I used to be I believe we learn to prize home more the longer we live What a wise old lady I did not think of that I have only learned that whatever is most prized is hardest to find And spring is come again continued Rachel passing by this little speech and my labours recommence And though the day is longer there is more to do in it you see I don t wonder at your being a stay at home for to my eyes it is the prettiest spot of earth in all the world and if you find it half as hard to leave it as I do your staying here is quite accounted for This little speech also Rachel understood quite well though she went on as if she did not And this little garden costs I assure you a great deal of wise thought In sowing my annuals I have so much to forecast and arrange suitability of climate for we have sun and shade here succession of bloom and contrast of colour and ever so many other important things I can quite imagine it though it did not strike me before he said looking on her with a smile of pleasant and peculiar interest which somehow gave a reality to this playful talk It is quite true and I should not have thought of it it is very pretty and he laughed a gentle little laugh glancing over the tiny garden But after all there is no picture of flowers or still life or even of landscape that will interest long You must be very solitary here at times that is you must have a great deal more resource than I or indeed almost anyone I know or this solitude must at times be oppressive I hope so at least for that would force you to appear among us sometimes No I am not lonely that is not lonelier than is good for me I have such a treasure of an old nurse poor old Tamar who tells me stories and reads to me and listens to my follies and temper and sometimes says very wise things too and the good vicar comes often this is one of his days with his beautiful little boy and talks so well and answers my follies and explains all my perplexities and is really a great help and comfort Yes said Lord Chelford with the same pleasant smile he told me so and seems so pleased to have met with so clever a pupil Are you coming to Brandon this evening Lake asked William Wylder perhaps he will be with us I do hope you will come Dorcas says there is no use in writing but that you know you are always welcome May I say you ll come Rachel smiled sadly on the snow drops at her feet and shook her head a little No I must stay at home this evening I mean I have not spirits to go to Brandon Thank Dorcas very much from me that is if you really mean that she asked me I am so sorry I am so disappointed said Lord Chelford looking gravely and enquiringly at her He began I think to fancy some estrangement there But perhaps to morrow perhaps even to day you may relent you know Don t say it is impossible Rachel smiled on the ground as before and then with a little sigh and a shake of her head said No Well I must tell Dorcas she was right you are very inexorable and cruel I am very cruel to keep you here so long and I too am forgetting the vicar who will be here immediately and I must meet him in a costume less like the Woman of Endor Lord Chelford leaning on the little wicket put his arm over and she gave him her hand again Good bye said Rachel Well I suppose I too must say good bye and I ll say a great deal more said he in a peculiar odd tone that was very firm and yet indescribably tender And he held her slender hand from which she had drawn the gauntlet in his Yes Rachel I will I ll say everything We are old friends now you ll forgive me calling you Rachel it may be perhaps the last time Rachel was standing there with such a beautiful blush and downcast eyes and her hand in his I liked you always Rachel from the first moment I saw you I liked you better and better indescribably indeed I do and I ve grown to like you so that if I lose you I think I shall never be the same again There was a very little pause the blush was deeper her eyes lower still I admire you Rachel I like your character I have grown to love you with all my heart and mind quite desperately I think I know there are things against me there are better looking fellows than I and and a great many things and I know very well that you will judge for yourself quite differently from other girls and I can t say with what fear and hope I await what you may say but this you may be sure of you will never find anyone to love you better Rachel I think so well and and now that is all Do you think you could ever like me But Rachel s hand on a sudden with a slight quiver was drawn from his Lord Chelford I can t describe how grateful I am and how astonished but it could never be no never Rachel perhaps you mean my mother I have told her everything she will receive you with all the respect you so well deserve and with all her faults she loves me and will love you still more No Lord Chelford no She was pale now and looking very sadly in his eyes It is not that but only that you must never never speak of it again Oh Rachel darling you must not say that I love you so so desperately you don t know I can say nothing else Lord Chelford My mind is quite made up I am inexpressibly grateful you will never know how grateful but except as a friend and won t you still be my friend I never can regard you Rachel was so pale that her very lips were white as she spoke this in a melancholy but very firm way Oh Rachel it is a great blow maybe if you thought it over I ll wait any time No Lord Chelford I m quite unworthy of your preference but time cannot change me and I am speaking not from impulse but conviction This is our secret yours and mine and we ll forget it and I could not bear to lose your friendship you ll be my friend still won t you Good bye God bless you Rachel And he hurriedly kissed the hand she had placed in his and without a word more or looking back he walked swiftly down the wooded road towards Gylingden So then it had come and gone gone for ever Margery bring the basket in I think a shower is coming And she picked up her trowel and other implements and placed them in the porch and glanced up towards the clouds as if she saw them and had nothing to think of but her gardening and the weather and as if her heart was not breaking CHAPTER LIII THE VICAR S COMPLICATIONS WHICH LIVELY PEOPLE HAD BETTER NOT READ William Wylder s reversion was very tempting But Lawyer Larkin knew the value of the precious metals and waited for more data The more he thought over his foreign correspondence and his interview with Lake the more steadily returned upon his mind the old conviction that the gallant captain was deep in the secret whatever it might be Whatever his motive and he always had a distinct motive though sometimes not easily discoverable he was a good deal addicted now to commenting in his confidential talk with religious gossips and others upon the awful state of the poor vicar s affairs his inconceivable prodigality the unaccountable sums he had made away with and his own anxiety to hand over the direction of such a hopeless complication of debt and abdicate in favour of any competent skipper the command of the water logged and foundering ship Why his Brother Mark could get him cleverly out of it could not he wheezed the pork butcher More serious than you suppose answered Larkin with a shake of his head It can t go beyond five hundred or say nine hundred eh at the outside Nine hundred say double as many thousand and I m afraid you ll be nearer the mark You ll not mention of course and I m only feeling my way just now and speaking conjecturally altogether but I m afraid it is enormous I need not remind you not to mention I cannot of course say how mister Larkin s conjectures reached so prodigious an elevation but I can now comprehend why it was desirable that this surprising estimate of the vicar s liabilities should prevail mister Jos Larkin had a weakness for enveloping much of what he said and wrote in an honourable mystery He liked writing private or confidential at top of his notes without apparent right or even reason to impose either privacy or confidence upon the persons to whom he wrote There was in fact often in the good attorney s mode of transacting business just a soupcon or flavour of an arriere pensee of a remote and unseen plan which was a little unsatisfactory Now with the vicar he was imperative that the matter of the reversion should be strictly confidential altogether sacred in fact You see the fact is my dear mister Wylder I never meddle in speculative things It is not a class of business that I like or would touch with one of my fingers so to speak and he shook his head gently and I may say if I were supposed to be ever so slightly engaged in these risky things it would be the ruin of me I don t like however sending you into the jaws of the City sharks I use the term my dear mister Wylder advisedly and I make a solitary exception in your case but the fact is if I thought you would mention the matter I could not touch it even for you There s Captain Lake of Brandon for instance I should not be surprised if I lost the Brandon business the day after the matter reached his ears All men are not like you and me my dear mister Wylder The sad experience of my profession has taught me that a suspicious man of the world without religion my dear mister Wylder and he lifted his pink eyes and shook his long head and long hands in unison without religion will imagine anything They can t understand us Now the fifty pounds which good mister Larkin had procured for the improvident vicar bore interest I am almost ashamed to say at thirty per cent per annum and ten per cent more the first year But you are to remember that the security was altogether speculative and mister Larkin of course made the best terms he could Annual premium on a policy for Lone hundred double insurance L s d being insisted upon by lender to cover contingent ex ten zero zero penses and life not insurable a delicacy of the lungs being admitted on the ordinary scale Annuity payable to lender clear of premium the seven ten zero security being unsatisfactory Lseventeen ten zero Ten pounds of which the premium together with four pounds ten shillings for expenses c were payable in advance So that thirty two pounds out of his borrowed fifty were forfeit for these items within a year and a month In the meantime the fifty pounds had gone as we know direct to Cambridge and he was called upon to pay forthwith ten pounds for premium and four pounds ten shillings for expenses Quod impossibile The attorney had nothing for it but to try to induce the lender to let him have another fifty pounds pending the investigation of title another fifty of which he was to get in fact eighteen pounds Somehow the racking off of this bitter vintage from one vessel into another did not seem to improve its quality On the contrary things were growing decidedly more awful Now there came from Messrs Burlington and Smith a peremptory demand for the fourteen pounds ten shillings and an equally summary one for twenty eight pounds fourteen shillings and eight pence their costs in this matter When the poor vicar received this latter blow he laid the palm of his hand on the top of his head as if to prevent his brain from boiling over Twenty eight pounds fourteen shillings and eight pence Quod impossibile again When he saw Larkin that conscientious guardian of his client s interests scrutinised the bill of costs very jealously and struck out between four and five pounds He explained to the vicar the folly of borrowing insignificant and insufficient sums the trouble and consequently the cost of which were just as great as of an adequate one He was determined if he could to pull him through this But he must raise a sufficient sum for the expense of going into title would be something and he would write sharply to Burlington Smith and company and had no doubt the costs would be settled for twenty three pounds And mister Jos Larkin s opinion upon the matter was worthy of respect inasmuch as he was himself under the rose the company of that firm and ministered its capital The fact is you must my dear mister Wylder make an effort It won t do peddling and tinkering in such a case You will be in a worse position than ever unless you boldly raise a thousand pounds if I can manage such a transaction upon a security of the kind Consolidate all your liabilities and keep a sum in hand You are well connected powerful relatives your brother has Huxton four hundred a year whenever old the the present incumbent goes and there are other things beside but you must not allow yourself to be ruined through timidity and if you go to the wall without an effort and allow yourself to be slurred in public what becomes of your chance of preferment And now title went up to Burlington Smith and company to examine and approve and from that firm I am sorry to say a bill of costs was coming when deeds were prepared and all done exceeding three hundred and fifty pounds and there was a little reminder from good Jos Larkin for two hundred and fifty pounds more This of course was to await mister Wylder s perfect convenience The vicar knew him he never pressed any man Then there would be insurances in proportion and interest as we see was not trifling And altogether I am afraid our friend the vicar was being extricated in a rather embarrassing fashion Now I have known cases in which good natured debauchees have interested themselves charitably in the difficulties of forlorn families and I think I knew almost before they suspected it that their generous interference was altogether due to one fine pair of eyes and a pretty tournure in the distressed family circle Under a like half delusion mister Jos Larkin in the guise of charity was prosecuting his designs upon the vicar s reversion and often most cruelly and most artfully when he frankly fancied his conduct most praiseworthy And really I do not myself know that considering poor William s liabilities and his means and how many chances there were against that reversion ever becoming a fact that I would not myself have advised his selling it if a reasonable price were obtainable All this power will I give thee said the Devil and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever I will I give it The world belongs to the rascals It is like the turf where everyone admits an honest man can hardly hold his own Jos Larkin looked down on the seedy and distracted vicar from an immense moral elevation He heard him talk of religion with disgust He owed him costs and beside costs also to Burlington Smith and company Was there not Talkative in Pilgrim s Progress I believe there are few things more provoking than that a man who owes you money and can t pay the interest should pretend to religion to your face except perhaps his giving sixpence in charity The attorney was prosperous He accounted for it by his attributes and the blessing that waits on industry and integrity He did not see that luck and selfishness had anything to do with it No man ever failed but through his own fault none ever succeeded but by his deservings The attorney was in a position to lecture the reverend mister Wylder In his presence religion in the vicar s mouth was an impertinence The vicar on the other hand was all that we know Perhaps in comparison his trial is in some sort a blessing and that there is no greater snare than the state of the man with whom all goes smoothly and who mistakes his circumstances for his virtues The poor vicar and his little following were got pretty well into the Furcae Caudinae mister Jos Larkin if he did not march him out to do him justice had had no hand in primarily bringing him there There was no reason however why the respectable lawyer should not make whatever was to be fairly made of the situation The best thing for both was perhaps that the one should sell and the other buy the reversion Larkin had no apprehensions about the nature of the dealing He was furnished with an excellent character his cheques were always honoured his tots always unexceptionable his vouchers never anything but exact He had twice been publicly complimented in this sense when managing Lord Hedgerow s estate No man had I believe a higher reputation in his walk few men were more formidable I think it was Lawyer Larkin s private canon in his dealings with men that everything was moral that was not contrary to an Act of Parliament CHAPTER LIV BRANDON CHAPEL ON SUNDAY For a month and three days mister Jos Larkin was left to ruminate without any new light upon the dusky landscape now constantly before his eyes At the end of that time a foreign letter came for him to the Lodge It was not addressed in Mark Wylder s hand not the least like it Mark s was a bold free hand and if there was nothing particularly elegant neither was there anything that could be called vulgar in it But this was a decidedly villainous scrawl in fact it was written as a self educated butcher might pen a bill There was nothing impressed on the wafer but a poke of something like the ferrule of a stick The interior corresponded with the address and the lines slanted confoundedly It was however on the whole better spelled and expressed than the penmanship would have led one to expect It said MISTER LARKINS Respeckted Sir I write you Sir to let you know has how there is no more Chance you shud ear of poor mister Mark Wylder of hose orrible Death I make bold to acquainte you by this writing which is Secret has yet from all he bing Hid and made away with in the dark It is only Right is family shud know all and his sad ending wich I will tell before you Sir in full accorden to my Best guess as bin the family Lawyer and Sir you will find it usful to Tell this in secret to Capten Lake of Brandon Hall But not on No account to any other It is orrible Sir to think a young gentleman with everything the world can give shud be made away with so crewel in the dark Though you do not rekelect me Sir I know you well mister Larkins haven seen you hoffen when a boy I wud not wish Sir no noise made till I cum which I am returning hoame and will then travel to Gylingden strateways to see you Sir your obedient servant JAMES DUTTON This epistle disturbed mister Jos Larkin profoundly He could recollect no such name as James Dutton He did not know whether to believe this letter or not He could not decide what present use to make of it nor whether to mention it to Captain Lake nor if he did so how it was best to open the matter Captain Lake he was confident knew James Dutton why otherwise should that person have desired his intelligence communicated to him At least it proved that Dutton assumed the captain to be specially interested in what concerned Mark Wylder s fate and in so far it confirmed his suspicions of Lake Was it better to wait until he had seen Dutton and heard his story before hinting at his intelligence and his name or was it wiser to do that at once and watch its effect upon the gallant captain narrowly and trust to inspiration and the moment for striking out the right course If this letter was true there was not a moment to be lost in bringing the purchase of the vicar s reversion to a point The possibilities were positively dazzling They were worth risking something I am not sure that mister Larkin s hand did not shake a little as he took the statement of title again out of the Wylder tin box No two Now under the pressure of this enquiry a thing struck mister Larkin strangely enough which he had quite overlooked before There were certain phrases in the will of the late mister Wylder which limited a large portion of the great estate in strict settlement Of course an attorney s opinion upon a question of real property is not conclusive Still they can t help knowing something of the barrister s special province and these words were very distinct in fact they stunted down the vicar s reversion in the greater part of the property to a strict life estate Long did the attorney pore over his copy of the will with his finger and thumb closed on his under lip The language was quite explicit there was no way out of it It was strictly a life estate How could he have overlooked that His boy indeed would take an estate tail and could disentail whenever if ever he came of age But that was in the clouds Mackleston on the Moor however and the Great Barnford estate were unaffected by these limitations and the rental which he now carefully consulted told him these jointly were in round numbers worth twenty three hundred l a year and improvable This letter of Dutton s to be sure may turn out to be all a lie or a blunder But it may prove to be strictly true and in that case it will be every thing that the deeds should be executed and the purchase completed before the arrival of this person and the public notification of Mark Wylder s death What a world it is to be sure thought mister Larkin as he shook his long head over Dutton s letter How smoothly and simply everything would go if only men would stick to truth Here s this letter how much time and trouble it costs me how much opportunity possibly sacrificed simply by reason of the incurable mendacity of men And he knocked the back of his finger bitterly on the open page Another thought now struck him for the first time Was there no mode of hedging so that whether Mark Wylder were living or dead the attorney should stand to win Down came the Brandon boxes The prudent attorney turned the key in the door and forth came the voluminous marriage settlement of Stanley Williams Lake of Slobberligh in the county of Devon late captain c c of the second part and Dorcas Adderley Brandon of Brandon Hall in the county of c c of the second part and so forth And as he read this pleasant composition through he two or three times murmured approvingly Yes yes yes His recollection had served him quite rightly There was the Five Oaks estate specially excluded from settlement worth fourteen hundred l a year but it was conditioned that the said Stanley Williams Lake was not to deal with the said lands except with the consent in writing of the said Dorcas c who was to be a consenting party to the deed If there was really something unsound in the state of Lake s relations and that he could be got to consider Lawyer Larkin as a friend worth keeping that estate might be had a bargain yes a great bargain Larkin walked off to Brandon but there he learned that Captain Brandon Lake as he now chose to call himself had gone that morning to London Business I venture to say and he went into that electioneering without ever mentioning it either So thought Larkin and he did not like this It looked ominous and like an incipient sliding away of the Brandon business Well no matter all things worked together for good It was probably well that he should not be too much shackled with considerations of that particular kind in the important negotiation about Five Oaks That night he posted a note to Burlington Smith and company and by Saturday night s post there came down to the sheriff an execution for one hundred twenty three l and some odd shillings upon a judgment on a warrant to confess at the suit of that firm for costs and money advanced against the poor vicar who never dreamed as he conned over his next day s sermon with his solitary candle that the blow had virtually descended and that his homely furniture the silver spoons his wife had brought him and the two shelves half full of old books which he had brought her and all the rest of their little frugal trumpery together with his own thin person had passed into the hands of Messrs Burlington Smith and company The vicar on his way to the chapel passed mister Jos Larkin on the green not near enough to speak only to smile and wave his hand kindly and look after the good attorney with one of those yearning grateful looks which cling to straws upon the drowning stream of life The sweet chapel bell was just ceasing to toll as mister Jos Larkin stalked under the antique ribbed arches of the little aisle Slim and tall he glided a chastened dignity in his long upturned countenance and a faint halo of saint hood round his tall bald head Having whispered his orisons into his well brushed hat and taken his seat his dove like eyes rested for a moment upon the Brandon seat There was but one figure in it slender light haired with his yellow moustache and pale face grown of late a little fatter Captain Brandon Lake was a very punctual church goer since the idea of trying the county at the next election had entered his mind Dorcas was not very well Lord Chelford had taken his departure and your humble servant who pens these pages had gone for a few days to Malwich There was no guest just then at Brandon and the captain sat alone on that devotional dais the elevated floor of the great oaken Brandon seat There were old Brandon and Wylder monuments built up against the walls Figures cut in stone and painted and gilded in tarnished splendour according to the gorgeous barbarism of Elizabeth s and the first James s age tablets in brass marble pillared monuments and a couple of life sized knights armed cap a pie on their backs in the aisle There is a stained window in the east which connoisseurs in that branch of mediaeval art admire There is another very fine one over the Brandon pew a freak perhaps of some of those old Brandons or Wylders who had a strange spirit of cynicism mingling in their profligacy and violence Reader you have looked on Hans Holbein s Dance of Death that grim phantasmal pageant symbolic as a dream of Pharaoh and perhaps you bear in mind that design called The Elector in which the Prince emerging from his palace gate with a cloud of courtiers behind is met by a poor woman her little child by the hand appealing to his compassion despising whom he turns away with a serene disdain Beneath in black letter is inscribed the text Princeps induetur maerore et quiescere faciam superbiam potentium and gigantic Death lays his fingers on the great man s ermine tippet It is a copy of this which in very splendid colouring fills the window that lights the Brandon state seat in the chapel The gules and gold were reflected on the young man s head and with a vain augury the attorney read again the solemn words from Holy Writ Princeps induetur maerore The golden glare rested like a glory on his head but there was also a gorgeous stain of blood that bathed his ear and temple His head was busy enough at that moment though it was quite still and his sly eyes rested on his Prayer book for Sparks the millionaire clothier who had purchased Beverley and was a potent voice in the Dollington Bank and whose politics were doubtful and relations amphibious was sitting in the pew nearly opposite and showed his red fat face and white whiskers over the oak wainscoting Jos Larkin like the rest of the congregation was by this time praying his elbows on the edge of the pew his hands clasped his thumbs under his chin and his long face and pink eyes raised heavenward with now and then a gentle downward dropping of the latter He was thinking of Captain Lake who was opposite and like him praying He was thinking how aristocratic he looked and how well in externals he became the Brandon seat and there were one or two trifles in the captain s attitude and costume of which the attorney who as we know was not only good but elegant made a note He respected his audacity and his mystery and he wondered intensely what was going on in that small skull under the light and glossy hair and anxiously guessed how vitally it might possibly affect him and wondered what his schemes were after the election quiescere faciam superbiam potentium and more darkly about his relations with Mark Wylder Princeps induetur maerore His eye was on the window now and then it dropped with a vague presage upon the sleek head of the daring and enigmatical captain reading the Litany from battle murder and sudden death good Lord deliver us and he almost fancied he saw a yellow skull over his shoulder glowering cynically on the Prayer book So the good attorney prayed on to the edification of all who saw and mothers in the neighbouring seats were specially careful to prevent their children from whispering or fidgeting When the service was over Captain Lake went across to mister Sparks and asked him to come to Brandon to lunch But the clothier could not and his brougham whirled him away to Naunton Friars So Stanley Lake walked up the little aisle toward the communion table thinking and took hold of the railing that surrounded the brass monument of Sir William de Braundon and seemed to gaze intently on the effigy but was really thinking profoundly of other matters and once or twice his sly sidelong glance stole ominously to Jos Larkin who was talking at the church door with the good vicar In fact he was then and there fully apprising him of his awful situation and poor William Wylder looking straight at him with white face and damp forehead was listening stunned and hardly understanding a word he said and only the dreadful questions rising to his mouth Can anything be done Will the people come to day mister Larkin explained the constitutional respect for the Sabbath It would be better Sir the publicity of an arrest it was a hard word to utter in the town would be very painful it would be better I think that I should walk over to the prison it is only six miles and see the authorities there and give myself up And his lip quivered he was thinking of the leave taking of poor Dolly and little Fairy I ve a great objection to speak of business to day said mister Larkin holily but I may mention that Burlington and Smith have written very sternly and the fact is my dear Sir we must look the thing straight in the face they are determined to go through with it and you know my opinion all along about the fallacy you must excuse me seeing all the trouble it has involved you in the infatuation of hesitating about the sale of that miserable reversion which they could have disposed of on fair terms In fact Sir they look upon it that you don t want to pay them and of course they are very angry I m sure I was wrong I m such a fool I must only go to the Sheriff the first thing the morning and beg of him to hold over that thing you know until I have heard from Burlington and Smith and I suppose I may say to them that you see the necessity of disposing of the reversion and agree to sell it if it be not too late The vicar assented indeed he had grown under this urgent pressure as nervously anxious to sell as he had been to retain it And they can t come to day Certainly not And poor William Wylder breathed again in the delightful sense of even momentary escape and felt he could have embraced his preserver I ll be very happy to see you to morrow if you can conveniently look in say at twelve or half past to report progress So that was arranged and again in the illusive sense of deliverance the poor vicar s hopes brightened and expanded Hitherto his escapes had not led to safety and he was only raised from the pit to be sold to the Ishmaelites CHAPTER LV THE CAPTAIN AND THE ATTORNEY CONVERSE AMONG THE TOMBS I cannot tell whether that slender silken machinator Captain Lake loitered in the chapel for the purpose of talking to or avoiding Jos Larkin who was standing at the doorway in sad but gracious converse with the vicar He was certainly observing him from among the tombs in his sly way And the attorney who had a way like him of noting things without appearing to see them was conscious of it and was perhaps decided by this trifle to accost the gallant captain So he glided up the short aisle with a sad religious smile suited to the place and inclined his lank back and his tall bald head toward the captain in ceremonious greeting as he approached How d ye do Larkin The fog makes one cough a little this evening Larkin s answer thanks and enquiries came gravely in return And with the same sad smile he looked round on the figures some marble some painted stone of departed Brandons and Wylders with garrulous epitaphs who surrounded them in various costumes quite a family group in which the attorney was gratified to mingle Ancestry Captain Lake your ancestry noble assemblage monuments and timber Timber like the Brandon oaks and monuments like these these are things which whatever else he may acquire the novus homo Captain Brandon Lake the parvenu can never command mister Jos Larkin had a smattering of school Latin and knew half a dozen French words which he took out on occasion Certainly our good people do occupy some space here more regular attendants in church than I fear they formerly were and their virtues more remarked perhaps than before the stone cutter was instructed to publish them with his chisel answered Lake with one of his quiet sneers Beautiful chapel this Captain Lake beautiful chapel Sir said the attorney again looking round with a dreary smile of admiration But though his accents were engaging and he smiled of course a Sabbath day smile yet Captain Lake perceived that it was not the dove s but the rat s eyes that were doing duty under that tall bald brow Solemn thoughts Sir solemn thoughts Captain Lake silent mentors eloquent monitors And he waved his long lank hand toward the monumental groups Yes said Lake in the same mocking tone that was low and sweet and easily mistaken for something more amiable You and they go capitally together so solemn and eloquent and godly capital fellows I m not half good enough for such company and the place is growing rather cold is not it A great many Wylders Sir a great many Wylders And the attorney dropped his voice and paused at this emphasis pointing a long finger toward the surrounding effigies Captain Lake after his custom glared a single full look upon the attorney sudden as the flash of a pair of guns from their embrasures in the dark and he said quietly with a wave of his cane in the same direction Yes a precious lot of Wylders Is there a Wylder vault here Captain Brandon Lake Hanged if I know what the devil s that to you or me Sir answered the captain with a peevish sullenness I was thinking Captain Lake whether in the event of its turning out that mister Mark Wylder was dead it would be thought proper to lay his body here Dead Sir and what the plague puts that in your head You are corresponding with him aren t you I ll tell you exactly how that is Captain Lake May I take the liberty to ask you for one moment to look up As between these two gentlemen this it must be allowed was an impertinent request But Captain Lake did look up and there was something extraordinarily unpleasant in his yellow eyes as he fixed them upon the contracted pupils of the attorney who nothing daunted went on Pray excuse me thank you Captain Lake they say one is better heard when looked at than when not seen and I wish to speak rather low for reasons Each looked the other in the eyes with that uncertain and sinister gaze which has a character both of fear and menace I have received those letters Captain Lake of which I spoke to you when I last had the honour of seeing you as furnishing in certain circumstances connected with them grave matter of suspicion since when I have not received one with mister Wylder s signature But I have received only the other day a letter from a new correspondent a person signing himself James Dutton announcing his belief that mister Mark Wylder is dead is dead and has been made away with by foul means and I have arranged immediately on his arrival at his desire to meet him professionally and to hear the entire narrative both of what he knows and of what he suspects As Jos Larkin delivered this with stern features and emphasis the captain s countenance underwent such a change as convinced the attorney that some indescribable evil had befallen Mark Wylder and that Captain Brandon Lake had a guilty knowledge thereof With this conviction came a sense of superiority and a pleasant confidence in his position which betrayed itself in a slight frown and a pallid smile as he looked steadily in the young man s face with his small crafty hungry eyes Lake knew that his face had betrayed him He had felt the livid change of colour and that twitching at his mouth and cheek which he could not control The mean tyrannical triumphant gaze of the attorney was upon him and his own countenance was his accuser Lake ground his teeth and returned Jos Larkin s intimidating smirk with a look of fury which for he now believed he held the winning cards did not appal him Lake cleared his throat twice but did not find his voice and turned away and read half through the epitaph on Lady Mary Brandon which is a pious and somewhat puritanical composition I hope it did him good You know Sir said Captain Lake but a little huskily turning about and smiling at last that Mark Wylder is nothing to me We don t correspond we have not corresponded I know upon my honour and soul Sir nothing on earth about him what he s doing where he is or what s become of him But I can t hear a man of business like you assert upon what he conceives to be reliable information situated as the Brandon title is depending I mean in some measure upon his life that Mark Wylder is no more without being a good deal shocked I quite understand Sir quite Captain Lake It is very serious Sir very but I can t believe it has gone that length quite I shall know more of course when I ve seen James Dutton I can t think I mean he s been made away with in that sense nor how that could benefit anyone and I d much rather Captain Lake move in this matter since move I must in your interest I mean as your friend and man of business than in any way Captain Lake that might possibly involve you in trouble You are my man of business aren t you and have no grounds for ill will eh said the captain drily No ill will certainly quite the reverse Thank Heaven I think I may truly say I bear ill will to no man living and wish you Captain Lake nothing but good Sir nothing but good Except a hasty word or two I know no reason you should not said the captain in the same tone Quite so But Captain Brandon Lake there is nothing like being completely above board it has been my rule through life and I will say it would not be frank and candid to say anything else that I have of late been anything but satisfied with the position which ostensibly your professional adviser and confidential man of business I have occupied Have I been consulted I put it to you have I been trusted Has there been any real confidence Captain Lake upon your part You have certainly had relations with mister Mark Wylder correspondence for anything I know You have entertained the project of purchasing the Reverend William Wylder s reversion and you have gone into electioneering business and formed connections of that sort without once doing me the honour to confer with me on the subject Now the plain question is do you wish to retain my services Certainly said Captain Lake biting his lip with a sinister little frown Then Captain Lake upon the same principle and speaking quite above board you must dismiss at once from your mind the idea that you can do so upon the terms you have of late seen fit to impose I am speaking frankly when I say there must be a total change I must be in reality what I am held out to the world as being your trusted and responsible and sole adviser I don t aspire to the position I am willing at this moment to retire from it but I never yet knew a divided direction come to good It is an office of great responsibility and I for one will not consent to touch it on any other conditions than those I have taken the liberty to mention These are easily complied with in fact I undertake to show you they have never been disturbed answered Lake rather sullenly So that being understood eh I suppose we have nothing particular to add And Captain Lake extended his gloved hand to take leave But the attorney looked down and then up with a shadow on his face and his lip in his finger and thumb and he said That s all very well and a sine qua non so far as it goes but my dear Captain Lake let us be plain You must see my dear Sir with such rumours possibly about to get afloat and such persons about to appear as this James Dutton that matters are really growing critical and there s no lack of able solicitors who would on speculation undertake a suit upon less evidence perhaps than may be forthcoming to upset your title under the will through missus Dorcas Brandon Lake your joint title in favour of the reversioner Lake only bit his lip and shook his head The attorney knew however that the danger was quite appreciated and went on You will therefore want a competent man who has the papers at his fingers ends and knows how to deal ably ably Sir with a fellow of James Dutton s stamp at your elbow The fact is to carry you safely through you will need pretty nearly the undivided attention of a well qualified able and confidential practitioner and I need not say such a man is not to be had for nothing Lake nodded a seeming assent which seemed to say I have found it so Now my dear Captain Lake I just mention this I put it before you that is because you know the county is not to be contested for nothing and you ll want a very serious sum of money for the purpose and possibly a petition and I can one way or another make up with an effort about Lfifteen thousand l Now it strikes me that it would be a wise thing for you the wisest thing perhaps my dear Captain Lake you ever did to place me in the same boat with yourself I don t exactly see I ll make it quite clear The attorney s tall forehead had a little pink flush over it at this moment and he was looking down a little and poking the base of Sir William de Braundon s monument with the point of his umbrella I wish Captain Lake to be perfectly frank and as I said above board You ll want the money and you must make up your mind to sell Five Oaks Captain Lake shifted his foot as if he had found it on a sudden on a hot flag Sell Five Oaks that s fourteen hundred a year said he Hardly so much but nearly perhaps Forty three thousand pounds were offered for it Old Chudworth offered that about ten years ago Of course Captain Lake if you are looking for a fancy price from me I must abandon the idea I was merely supposing a dealing between friends and in that sense I ventured to name the extreme limit to which I could go Little more than five per cent for my money if I insure and possibly to defend an action before I ve been six months in possession I think my offer will strike you as a great one considering the posture of affairs Indeed I apprehend my friends will hardly think me justified in offering so much The sexton was walking back and forward near the door making the best clatter he decently could and wondering the Captain and Lawyer Larkin could find no better place to talk in than the church In a moment in a moment said the lawyer signalling to him to be quiet as loftily as if chapel hall and sexton were his private property It was one of those moments into which a good deal of talk is fitted and which seem somewhat of the longest to those who await its expiration The chapel was growing dark and its stone and marble company of bygone Wylders and Brandons were losing themselves in shadow Part of the periwig and cheek of Sir Marcus Brandon still glimmered whitish as at a little distance did also the dim marble face and arm of the young Countess of Lydingworth mourning these hundred and thirty years over her dead baby Sir William Wylder in ruff rosettes and full dress of James I s fashion on his back defunct with children in cloaks kneeling at head and foot was hardly distinguishable and the dusky crimson and tarnished gold had gone out of view till morning The learned Archbishop Brandon a cadet who filled the see of York in his day and was the only unexceptionably godly personage of that long line was praying as usual at his desk perhaps to the saints and Virgin for I believe he was before the Reformation in beard and skull cap as was evident from the black profile of head and uplifted hands against the dim sky seen through the chapel window A dusky glow from the west still faintly showed Hans Holbein s proud Elector in the Brandon window fading with Death himself and the dread inscription Princeps induetur maerore into utter darkness The ice once broken Jos Larkin urged his point with all sorts of arguments always placing the proposed transaction in the most plausible lights and attitudes and handling his subject in round and flowing sentences This master of persuasion was not aware that Captain Lake was arguing the question for himself on totally different grounds and that it was fixed in his mind pretty much in these terms That old villain wants an exorbitant bribe is he worth it He knew what the lawyer thought he did not know that Five Oaks was held by the lawyers to be possibly without those unfortunate limitations which affected all the rest of the estate It was only a moot point but the doubt had led mister Jos Larkin to the selection I ll look in upon you between eight and nine in the morning and I ll say yes or no then said the captain as they parted under the old stone porch the attorney with a graceful inclination a sad smile and a wave of his hand the captain with his hands in the pockets of his loose coat and a sidelong glance from his yellow eyes The sky as he looked toward Brandon was draped in black cloud intensely black meeting a black horizon except for one little rent of deep crimson which showed westward behind those antique gables and lordly trees like a lake of blood CHAPTER LVI THE BRANDON CONSERVATORY Captain Lake did look in at the Lodge in the morning and remained an hour in conference with mister Jos Larkin I suppose everything went off pleasantly For although Stanley Lake looked very pale and vicious as he walked down to the iron gate of the Lodge among the evergreens and bass mats the good attorney s countenance shone with a serene and heavenly light so pure and bright indeed that I almost wonder his dazzled servants sitting along the wall while he read and expounded that morning did not respectfully petition that a veil after the manner of Moses might be suspended over the seraphic effulgence Somehow his Times did not interest him at breakfast these parliamentary wrangles commercial speculations and foreign disputes are they not after all but melancholy and dreary records of the merest worldliness and are there not moments when they become almost insipid Jos Larkin tossed the paper upon the sofa French politics relations with Russia commercial treaties party combinations how men can so wrap themselves up in these things And he smiled ineffable pity over the crumpled newspaper on the poor souls in that sort of worldly limbo In which frame of mind he took from his coat pocket a copy of Captain Lake s marriage settlement and read over again a covenant on the captain s part that with respect to this particular estate of Five Oaks he would do no act and execute no agreement deed or other instrument whatsoever in any wise affecting the same without the consent in writing of the said Dorcas Brandon and a second covenant binding him and the trustees of the settlement against executing any deed c without a similar consent and especially directing that in the event of alienating the estate the said Dorcas must be made an assenting party to the deed He folded the deed and replaced it in his pocket with a peaceful smile and closed eyes murmuring I m much mistaken if the gray mare s the better horse in that stud He laughed gently thinking of the captain s formidable and unscrupulous nature exhibitions of which he could not fail to remember No no Miss Dorkie won t give us much trouble He used to call her Miss Dorkie playfully to his clerks It gave him consideration he fancied And now with this Five Oaks to begin with Lfourteen hundred a year a great capability immensely improvable he would stake half he s worth on making it more than Ltwo thousand within five years and with other things at his back an able man like him might before long look as high as she And visions of the grand jury rose dim and splendid an heiress and a seat for the county perhaps he and Lake might go in together though he d rather be associated with the honorable James Cluttworth or young Lord Griddlestone Lake you see wanted weight and nothwithstanding his connections was it could not be denied a new man in the county So Wylder Lake and Jos Larkin had each projected for himself pretty much the same career and probably each saw glimmering in the horizon the golden round of a coronet And I suppose other modest men are not always proof against similar flatteries of imagination Jos Larkin had also the vicar s business and reversion to attend to The reverend William Wylder had a letter containing three lines from him at eight o clock to which he sent an answer whereupon the solicitor despatched a special messenger one of his clerks to Dollington with a letter to the sheriff s deputy from whom he received duly a reply which necessitated a second letter with a formal undertaking to which came another reply whereupon he wrote to Burlington Smith and company acquainting them respectfully in diplomatic fashion with the attitude which affairs had assumed With this went a private and confidential non official note to Smith desiring him to answer stiffly and press for an immediate settlement and to charge costs fairly as mister William Wylder would have ample funds to liquidate them Smith knew what fairly meant and his entries went down accordingly By the same post went up to the same firm a proposition an afterthought sanctioned by a second miniature correspondence with his client now sailing before the wind to guarantee them against loss consequent against staying the execution in the sheriff s hands for a fortnight which if they agreed to they were further requested to send a draft of the proposed undertaking by return at foot of which in pencil he wrote N B Yes This arrangement necessitated his providing himself with a guarantee from the vicar and so the little account as between the vicar and Jos Larkin solicitor and the vicar and Messrs Burlington Smith and company solicitors grew up and expanded with a tropical luxuriance About the same time while mister Jos Larkin I mean was thinking over Miss Dorkie s share in the deed with a complacent sort of interest anticipating a struggle but sure of victory that beautiful young lady was walking slowly from flower to flower in the splendid conservatory which projects southward from the house and rears itself in glacial arches high over the short sward and flowery patterns of the outer garden of Brandon The unspeakable sadness of wounded pride was on her beautiful features and there was a fondness in the gesture with which she laid her fingers on these exotics and stooped over them which gave to her solitude a sentiment of the pathetic From the high glass doorway communicating with the drawing rooms at the far end among towering ranks of rare and gorgeous flowers over the encaustic tiles and through this atmosphere of perfume did Captain Stanley Lake in his shooting coat glide smiling toward his beautiful young wife She heard the door close and looking half over her shoulder in a low tone indicating surprise she merely said Oh receiving him with a proud sad look Yes Dorkie I m here at last I ve been for some weeks so insufferably busy and he laid his white hand lightly over his eyes as if they and the brain within were alike weary How charming this place is the temple of Flora and you the divinity And he kissed her cheek I m now emancipated for I hope a week or two I ve been so stupid and inattentive I m sure Dorkie you must think me a brute I ve been shut up so in the library and keeping such tiresome company you ve no idea but I think you ll say it was time well spent at least I m sure you ll approve the result and now that I have collected the facts and can show you darling exactly what the chances are you must consent to hear the long story and when you have heard give me your advice Dorcas smiled and only plucked a little flowery tendril from a plant that hung in a natural festoon above her I assure you darling I am serious you must not look so incredulous and it is the more provoking because I love you so I think I have a right to your advice Dorkie Why don t you ask Rachel she s cleverer than I and you are more in the habit of consulting her Now Dorkie is going to talk her wicked nonsense over again as if I had never answered it What about Radie I do assure you so far from taking her advice and thinking her an oracle as you suppose I believe her in some respects very little removed from a fool I think her very clever on the contrary said Dorcas enigmatically Well she is clever in some respects she is gay at least she used to be before she fell into that transcendental parson s hands I mean poor dear William Wylder and she can be amusing and talks very well but she has no sense she is utterly Quixotic she is no more capable of advising than a child I should not have fancied that although you say so Stanley she answered carelessly adding a geranium to her bouquet You are thinking I know because you have seen us once or twice talking together Stanley paused not knowing exactly how to construct the remainder of his sentence Dorcas added another blossom I think that blue improves it wonderfully Don t you The blue Oh yes certainly And now that little star of yellow will make it perfect said Dorcas Yes yellow quite perfect said Stanley But when you saw Rachel and me talking together or rather Rachel talking to me I do assure you Dorcas upon my sacred honour one half of what she said I do not to this moment comprehend and the whole was based on the most preposterous blunder and I will tell you in a little time everything about it I would this moment I d be delighted only just until I have got a letter which I expect a letter I assure you nothing more and until I have got it it would be simply to waste your time and patience to weary you with any such any such Secret said Dorcas Secret then if you will have it so retorted Stanley suddenly with one of those glares that lasted for just one fell moment but he instantly recovered himself Secret yes but no secret in the evil sense a secret only awaiting the evidence which I daily expect and then to be stated fully and frankly to you my only darling and as completely blown to the winds Dorcas looked in his strange face with her proud sad gaze like one guessing at a funereal allegory He kissed her cheek again placing one arm round her slender waist and with his other hand taking hers Yes Dorcas my beloved my only darling you will yet know all it has cost me to retain from you even this folly and when you have heard all which upon my soul and honour you shall the moment I am enabled to prove all you will thank me for having braved your momentary displeasure to spare you a great deal of useless and miserable suspense I trust you Dorcas in everything implicitly Why won t you credit what I say I don t urge you I never have to reveal that which you describe so strangely as a concealment yet no secret as an absurdity and yet fraught with miserable suspense Ah Dorcas why will you misconstrue me Why will you not believe me I long to tell you this which after all is an utter absurdity a thousand times more than you can desire to hear it but my doing so now unfortified by the evidence I shall have in a very few days would be attended with a danger which you will then understand Won t you trust me And now for my advice said Dorcas smiling down in her mysterious way upon a crimson exotic near her feet Yes darling thank you In sober earnest your advice answered Lake and you must advise me Several of our neighbours the Hillyards the Ledwiches the Wyndermeres and ever so many more have spoken to me very strongly about contesting the county on the old Whig principles at the election which is now imminent There is not a man with a chance of acceptance to come forward if I refuse Now you know what even moderate success in the House when family and property go together may accomplish There are the Dodminsters Do you think they would ever have got their title by any other means There are the Forresters I know it all Stanley and at once I say go on I thought you must have formed some political project mister Wealdon has been with you so often but you tell me nothing Stanley Not darling till I know it myself This plan for instance until you spoke this moment was but a question and one which I could not submit until I had seen Wealdon and heard how matters stood and what chances of success I should really have So darling you have it all and I am so glad you advise me to go on It is five and thirty years since anyone connected with Brandon came forward But it will cost a great deal of money Dorkie Yes I know I ve always heard it cost my uncle and Sir William Camden fifteen thousand pounds Yes it will be expensive Wealdon thinks very this time The other side will spend a great deal of money It often struck me as a great mistake that where there is a good income and a position to be maintained there is not a little put by every year to meet cases like this what they call a reserve fund in trading companies I do not think there is much money You know Stanley Whatever there is is under settlement and we cannot apply it Dorkie The only thing to be done it strikes me is to sell a part of Five Oaks I ll not sell any property Stanley And what do you propose then I don t know I don t understand these things But there are ways of getting money by mortgages and loans and paying them off without losing the property I ve the greatest possible objection to raising money in that way It is in fact the first step towards ruin and nobody has ever done it who has not regretted that he did not sell instead I won t sell Five Oaks Stanley said the young lady seriously I only said a part replied Stanley I won t sell at all Oh And I won t mortgage said Stanley Then the thing can t go on I can t help it But I m resolved it shall answered Stanley I tell you Stanley plainly I will not sell The Brandon estate shall not be diminished in my time Why you perverse idiot don t you perceive you impair the estate as much by mortgaging as by selling with ten times the ultimate danger I tell you I won t mortgage and you shall sell This Sir is the first time I have been spoken to in such terms And why do you contradict and thwart me upon business of which I know something and you nothing What object on earth can I have in impairing the estate I ve as deep an interest in it as you It is perfectly plain we should sell and I am determined we shall Come now Dorcas I m sorry I m such a brute you know when I m vexed You mustn t be angry and if you ll be a good girl and trust me in matters of business Stanley I tell you plainly once more I never will consent to sell one acre of the Brandon estates Then we ll see what I can do without you Dorkie he said in a pleasant musing way He was now looking down with his sly malign smile and Dorcas could almost fancy two yellow lights reflected upon the floor I shall protect the property of my family Sir from your folly or your machinations and I shall write to Chelford as my trustee to come here to advise me And I snap my fingers at you both and meet you with defiance and Stanley s singular eyes glared upon her for a few seconds Dorcas turned in her grand way and walked slowly toward the door Stay a moment I m going said Stanley overtaking and confronting her near the door I ve only one word I don t think you quite know me It will be an evil day for you Dorkie when you quarrel with me He looked steadily on her smiling for a second or two more and then glided from the conservatory It was the first time Dorcas had seen Stanley Lake s features in that translated state which indicated the action of his evil nature and the apparition haunted her for many a day and night CHAPTER LVII CONCERNING A NEW DANGER WHICH THREATENED CAPTAIN STANLEY LAKE The ambitious captain walked out sniffing white and incensed There was an air of immovable resolution in the few words which Dorcas had spoken which rather took him by surprise The captain was a terrorist He acted instinctively on the theory that any good that was to be got from human beings was to be extracted from their fears He had so operated on Mark Wylder and so sought to coerce his sister Rachel He had hopes too of ultimately catching the good attorney napping and leading him too bound and docile into his ergastulum although he was himself just now in jeopardy from that quarter James Dutton too Sooner or later he would get Master Jim into a fix and hold him also spell bound in the same sort of nightmare It was not from malice The worthy attorney had much more of that leaven than he Stanley Lake did not care to smash any man except such as stood in his way He had a mercantile genius and never exercised his craft violence and ferocity on men or objects when no advantage was obtainable by so doing When however fortune so placed them that one or other must go to the wall Captain Stanley Lake was awfully unscrupulous But having disabled and struck him down and won the stakes he would have given what remained of him his cold white hand to shake or sipped claret with him at his own table and told him stories and entertained him with sly sarcastic sallies and thought how he could make use of him in an amicable way But Stanley Lake s cold commercial genius his craft and egotism were frustrated occasionally by his temper which I am afraid with all its external varnish was of the sort which is styled diabolical People said also what is true of most terrorists that he was himself quite capable of being frightened and also that he lied with too fertile an audacity and like a man with too many bills afloat forgot his endorsements occasionally and did not recognise his own acceptances when presented after an interval Such were some of this dangerous fellow s weak points But on the whole it was by no means a safe thing to cross his path and few who did so came off altogether scathless He pursued his way with a vague feeling of danger and rage having encountered an opposition of so much more alarming a character than he had anticipated and found his wife not only competent ferre aspectum to endure his maniacal glare and scowl but serenely to defy his violence and his wrath He had abundance of matter for thought and perturbation and felt himself when the images of Larcom Larkin and Jim Dutton crossed the retina of his memory some thrill of the fear which hath torment the fear of a terrible coercion which he liked so well to practise in the case of others In this mood he paced without minding in what direction he went under those great rows of timber which over arch the pathway leading toward Redman s Dell the path that he and Mark Wylder had trod in that misty moonlight walk on which I had seen them set out together Before he had walked five minutes in this direction he was encountered by a little girl in a cloak who stopped and dropped a courtesy The captain stopped also and looked at her with a stare which I suppose had something forbidding in it for the child was frightened But the wild and menacing look was unconscious and only the reflection of the dark speculations and passions which were tumbling and breaking in his soul Well child said he gently I think I know your face but I forget your name Little Margery please Sir from Miss Lake at Redman s Farm she replied with a courtesy Oh to be sure yes And how is Miss Rachel Very bad with a headache please Sir Is she at home Yes Sir please Any message Yes Sir please a note for you Sir and she produced a note rather indeed a letter She desired me Sir please to give it into your own hand if I could and not to leave it please Sir unless you were at home when I reached He read the direction and dropped it unopened into the pocket of his shooting coat The peevish glance with which he eyed it betrayed a presentiment of something unpleasant Any answer required No Sir please only to leave it And Miss Lake is quite well No Sir please a bad headache to day Oh I m very sorry indeed Tell her so She is at home is she Yes Sir Very well that s all Say I am very sorry to hear she is suffering and if I can find time I hope to see her to day and remember to say I have not read her letter but if I find it requires an answer it shall have one He looked round like a man newly awakened and up among the great boughs and interlacing foliage of the noble trees and the child made him two courtesies and departed towards Redman s Farm Lake sauntered back slowly toward the Hall On his way a rustic seat under the shadow invited him and he sat down drawing Rachel s letter from his pocket What a genius they have for teasing How women do contrive to waste our time and patience over nonsense How ingeniously perverse their whimsies are I do believe Beelzebub employs them still as he did in Eden for the special plague of us poor devils Here s a lecture or an exhortation from Miss Radie and a quantity of infinitely absurd advice all which I am to read and inwardly digest and discuss with her whenever she pleases I ve a great mind to burn it quietly But he applied his match instead to his cigar and having got it well lighted he leaned back and broke the seal and read this letter which I suspect notwithstanding his preliminary thoughts he fancied might contain matter of more practical import I write to you my beloved and only brother Stanley in an altered state of mind and with clearer views of duty than I think I have ever had before Just as I conjectured muttered Stanley with a bitter smile as he shook the ashes off the top of his cigar a woman s homily He read on and a livid frown gradually contracted his forehead as he did so I do not know Stanley what your feelings may be Mine have been the same ever since that night in which I was taken into a confidence so dreadful The circumstances are fearful but far more dreadful to me the mystery in which I have lived ever since I sometimes think I have only myself to blame But you know my poor brother why I consented and with what agony Ever since I have lived in terror and worse in degradation I did not know until it was too late how great was my guilt Heaven knows when I consented to that journey I did not comprehend its full purpose though I knew enough to have warned me of my danger and undertook it in great fear and anguish of mind I can never cease to mourn over my madness Oh Stanley you do not know what it is to feel as I do the shame and treachery of my situation to try to answer the smiles of those who at least once loved me and to take their hands to kiss Dorcas and good Dolly and feel that all the time I am a vile impostor stained incredibly from whom if they knew me they would turn in horror and disgust Now Stanley I can bear anything but this baseness anything but the life long practice of perfidy that I will not and cannot endure Dorcas must know the truth That there is a secret jealously guarded from her she does know no woman could fail to perceive that and there are few Stanley who would not prefer the certainty of the worst to the anguish of such relations of mystery and reserve with a husband She is clever she is generous and has many noble qualities She will see what is right and do it Me she may hate and must despise but that were to me more endurable than friendship gained on false pretences I repeat therefore Stanley that Dorcas must know the whole truth Do not suppose my poor brother that I write from impulse I have deeply thought on the subject Deeply repeated Stanley with a sneer And the more I reflect the more am I convinced if you will not tell her Stanley that I must But it will be wiser and better terrible as it may be that the revelation should come from you whom she has made her husband The dreadful confidence would be more terrible from any other Be courageous then Stanley you will be happier when you have disclosed the truth and released at all events one of your victims Your sorrowful and only sister RACHEL On finishing the letter Stanley rose quickly to his feet He had become gradually so absorbed in reading it that he laid his cigar unconsciously beside him and suffered it to go out With downcast look and an angry contortion he tore the sheets of note paper across and was on the point of reducing them to a thousand little snow flakes and giving them to the wind when on second thoughts he crumpled them together and thrust them into his breast pocket His excitement was too intense for foul terms or even blasphemy With the edge of his nether lip nipped in his teeth and his clenched hands in his pockets he walked through the forest trees to the park and in his solitudes hurried onward as if his life depended on his speed Gradually he recovered his self possession He sat down under the shade of a knot of beech trees overlooking that ill omened tarn which we have often mentioned upon a lichen stained rock his chin resting on his clenched hand his elbow on his knee and the heel of his other foot stamping out bits of the short green sod That d d girl deserves to be shot for her treachery was the first sentence that broke from his white lips It certainly was an amazing outrage upon his self esteem that the secret which was the weapon of terror by which he meant to rule his sister Rachel should by her slender hand be taken so easily from his grasp and lifted to crush him The captain s plans were not working by any means so smoothly as he had expected That sudden stab from Jos Larkin whom he always despised and now hated whom he believed to be a fifth rate pluckless rogue without audacity without invention whom he was on the point of tripping up that he should have turned short and garotted the gallant captain was a provoking turn of fortune That when a dire necessity subjugated his will his contempt his rage and he inwardly decided that the attorney s extortion must be submitted to his wife whom he never made any account of in the transaction whom he reckoned carelessly on turning about as he pleased by a few compliments and cajoleries should have started up cold and inflexible as marble in his path to forbid the payment of the black mail and expose him to the unascertained and formidable consequences of Dutton s story and the disappointed attorney s vengeance was another stroke of luck which took him altogether by surprise And to crown all Miss Radie had grown tired of keeping her own secret and must needs bring to light the buried disgraces which all concerned were equally interested in hiding away for ever Stanley Lake s position if all were known was at this moment formidable enough But he had been fifty times over during his brief career in scrapes of a very menacing kind once or twice indeed of the most alarming nature His temper his craft his impetus were always driving him into projects and situations more or less critical Sometimes he won sometimes he failed but his audacious energy hitherto had extricated him The difficulties of his present situation were however appalling and almost daunted his semi diabolical energies From Rachel to Dorcas from Dorcas to the attorney and from him to Dutton and back again he rambled in the infernal litany he muttered over the inauspicious tarn among the enclosing banks and undulations and solitary and lonely woods Lake Avernus said a hollow voice behind him and a long grisly hand was laid on his shoulder A cold breath of horror crept from his brain to his heel as he turned about and saw the large blanched features and glassy eyes of Uncle Lorne bent over him Oh Lake Avernus is it said Lake with an angry sneer and raising his hat with a mock reverence Ay it is the window of hell and the spirits in prison come up to see the light of it Did you see him looking up said Uncle Lorne with his pallid smile Oh of course Napoleon Bonaparte leaning on old doctor Simcock s arm answered Lake It was odd in the sort of ghastly banter in which he played off this old man how much hatred was perceptible No not he It is Mark Wylder said Uncle Lorne his face comes up like a white fish within a fathom of the top it makes me laugh That s the way they keep holiday Can you tell by the sky when it is holiday in hell I can And he laughed and rubbed his long fingers together softly Look ha ha Look ha ha ha Look he resumed pointing with his cadaverous forefinger towards the middle of the pool I told you this morning it was a holiday and he laughed very quietly to himself Look how his nostrils go like a fish s gills It is a funny way for a gentleman and he s a gentleman Every fool knows the Wylders are gentlemen all gentlemen in misfortune He has a brother that is walking about in his coffin Mark has no coffin it is all marble steps and a wicked seraph received him and blessed him till his hair stood up Let me whisper you No not just at this moment please said Lake drawing away disgusted from the maniacal leer and titter of the gigantic old man Aye aye another time some night there s aurora borealis in the sky You know this goes under ground all the way to Vallambrosa Thank you I was not aware that s very convenient Had you not better go down and speak to your friend in the water Young man I bless you for remembering said Uncle Lorne solemnly What was Mark Wylder s religion that I may speak to him comfortably An Anabaptist I conjecture from his present situation replied Lake No that s in the lake of fire where the wicked seraphim and cherubim baptise and anabaptise and hold them under with a great stone laid across their breasts I only know two of their clergy the African vicar quite a gentleman and speaks through his nose and the archbishop with wings his face is so burnt he s all eyes and mouth and on one hand has only one finger and he tickles me with it till I almost give up the ghost The ghost of Miss Baily is a lie he said by my soul and he likes you he loves you Shall I write it all in a book and give it you I meet Mark Wylder in three places sometimes Don t move till I go down he s as easily frightened as a fish And Uncle Lorne crept down the bank tacking and dodging and all the time laughing softly to himself and sometimes winking with a horrid wily grimace at Stanley who fervently wished him at the bottom of the tarn I say said Stanley addressing the keeper whom by a beck he had brought to his side you don t allow him surely to go alone now No Sir since your order Sir said the stern reserved official Nor to come into any place but this the park I mean No Sir And do you mind try and get him home always before nightfall It is easy to frighten him Find out what frightens him and do it or say it It is dangerous don t you see and he might break his d d neck any time among those rocks and gullies or get away altogether from you in the dark So the keeper at the water s brink joined Uncle Lorne who was talking after his fashion into the dark pool And Stanley Lake a general in difficulties retraced his steps toward the park gate through which he had come ruminating on his situation and resources CHAPTER LVIII MISS RACHEL LAKE BECOMES VIOLENT So soon as the letter which had so surprised and incensed Stanley Lake was despatched and beyond recall Rachel who had been indescribably agitated before grew all at once calm She knew that she had done right She was glad the die was cast and that it was out of her power to retract She kneeled at her bedside and wept and prayed and then went down and talked with old Tamar who was knitting in the shade by the porch Then the young lady put on her bonnet and cloak and walked down to Gylingden with an anxious but still a lighter heart to see her friend Dolly Wylder Dolly received her in a glad sort of fuss I m so glad to see you Miss Lake Call me Rachel and won t you let me call you Dolly Well Rachel dear replied Dolly laughing I m delighted you re come I have such good news but I can t tell it till I think for a minute I must begin at the beginning Anywhere everywhere only if it is good news let me hear it at once I ll be sure to understand Well Miss I mean Rachel dear you know I may tell you now the vicar my dear Willie he and I we ve been in great trouble oh such trouble Heaven only knows and she dried her eyes quickly money my dear and she smiled with a bewildered shrug some debts at Cambridge no fault of his you can t imagine what a saving darling he is but these were a few old things that mounted up with interest my dear you understand and law costs oh you can t think and indeed dear Miss well Rachel I forgot I sometimes thought we must be quite ruined Oh Dolly dear said Rachel very pale I feared it I thought you might be troubled about money I was not sure but I was afraid and to say truth it was partly to try your friendship with a question on that very point that I came here and not indeed Dolly dear from impertinent curiosity but in the hope that maybe you might allow me to be of some use How wonderfully good you are How friends are raised up and with a smile that shone like an April sun through her tears she stood on tiptoe and kissed the tall young lady who not smiling but with a pale and very troubled face bowed down and returned her kiss You know dear before he went Mark promised to lend dear Willie a large sum of money Well he went away in such a hurry that he never thought of it and though he constantly wrote to mister Larkin you have no idea my dear Miss Lake what a blessed angel that man is oh such a friend as has been raised up to us in that holy and wise man words cannot express but what was I saying oh yes Mark you know it was very kind but he has so many things on his mind it quite escaped him and he keeps you know wandering about on the Continent and never gives his address so he can t you see be written to and the delay but Rachel darling are you ill She rang the bell and opened the window and got some water My darling you walked too fast here You were very near fainting No dear nothing I am quite well now go on But she did not go on immediately for Rachel was trembling in a kind of shivering fit which did not pass away till after poor Dolly who had no other stimulant at command made her drink a cup of very hot milk Thank you darling You are too good to me Dolly Oh Dolly you are too good to me Rachel s eyes were looking into hers with a careworn entreating gaze and her cold hand was pressed on the back of Dolly s Nearly ten minutes passed before the talk was renewed Well now what do you think that good man mister Larkin just as things were at the worst found a way to make everything oh blessed mercy the hand of Heaven my dear quite right again and we ll be so happy Like a bird I could sing and fly almost a foolish old thing ha ha ha such an old goose and she wiped her eyes again Hush is that Fairy Oh no it is only Anne singing Little man has not been well yesterday and to day He won t eat and looks pale but he slept very well my darling man and Doctor Buddle I met him this morning so kindly took him into his room and examined him and says it may be nothing at all please Heaven and she sighed smiling still Dear little Fairy where is he asked Rachel her sad eyes looking toward the door In the study with his Wapsie missus Woolaston she is such a kind soul lent him such a beautiful old picture book Woodward s Eccentricities it is called and he s quite happy little Fairy on his little stool at the window No headache or fever asked Miss Lake cheerfully though she knew not why there seemed something ominous in this little ailment None at all oh none thank you none in the world I d be so frightened if there was But thank Heaven Doctor Buddle says there s nothing to make us at all uneasy My blessed little man And he has his canary in the cage in the window and his kitten to play with in the study He s quite happy Please Heaven he ll be quite well to morrow the darling little man said Rachel all the more fondly for that vague omen that seemed to say He s gone Here s mister Larkin cried Dolly jumping up and smiling and nodding at the window to that long and natty apparition who glided to the hall door with a sad smile raising his well brushed hat as he passed and with one grim glance beyond missus Wylder for his sharp eye half detected another presence in the room He was followed not accompanied for mister Larkin knew what a gentleman he was by a young and bilious clerk with black hair and a melancholy countenance and by old Buggs his conducting man always grinning whose red face glared in the little garden like a great bunch of hollyhocks He was sober as a judge all the morning and proceeded strictly on the principle of business first and pleasure afterward But his orgies when off duty were such as to cause the good attorney when complaints reached him to shake his head and sigh profoundly and sometimes to lift up his mild eyes and long hands and indeed so scandalous an appendage was Buggs that if he had been less useful I believe the pure attorney who in the uncomfortable words of John Bunyan had found a cleaner road to hell would have cashiered him long ago There is that awful mister Buggs said Dolly with a look of honest alarm I often wonder so Christian a man as mister Larkin can countenance him He is hardly ever without a black eye He has been three nights together without once putting off his clothes think of that and my dear on Friday week he fell through the window of the Fancy Emporium at two o clock in the morning and Doctor Buddle says if the cut on his jaw had been half an inch lower he would have cut some artery and lost his life wretched man They have come about law business Dolly enquired the young lady who had a profound instinctive dread of mister Larkin Yes my dear a most important windfall Only for mister Larkin it never could have been accomplished and indeed I don t think it would ever have been thought of I hope he has some one to advise him said Miss Lake anxiously I I think mister Larkin a very cunning person and you know your husband does not understand business Is it mister Larkin my dear mister Larkin Why my dear if you knew him as we do you d trust your life in his hands But there are people who know him still better and I think they fancy he is a very crafty man I do not like him myself and Dorcas Brandon dislikes him too and though I don t think we could either give a reason I don t know Dolly but I should not like to trust him But my dear he is an excellent man and such a friend and he has managed all this most troublesome business so delightfully It is what they call a reversion William Wylder is not selling his reversion said Rachel fixing a wild and startled look on her companion Yes reversion I am sure is the name And why not dear It is most unlikely we should ever get a farthing of it any other way and it will give us enough to make us quite happy But my darling don t you know the reversion under the will is a great fortune He must not think of it and up started Rachel and before Dolly could interpose or remonstrate she had crossed the little hall and entered the homely study where the gentlemen were conferring William Wylder was sitting at his desk and a large sheet of law scrivenery on thick paper with a stamp in the corner was before him The bald head of the attorney as he leaned over him and indicated an imaginary line with his gold pencil case was presented toward Miss Lake as she entered The attorney had just said there please in reply to the vicar s question Where do I write my name and red Buggs grinning with his mouth open like an over heated dog and the sad and bilious young gentleman stood by to witness the execution of the cleric s autograph Tall Jos Larkin looked up smiling with his mouth also a little open as was his wont when he was particularly affable But the rat s eyes were looking at her with a hungry suspicion and smiled not William Wylder I am so glad I m in time said Rachel rustling across the room There said the attorney very peremptorily and making a little furrow in the thick paper with the seal end of his pencil Stop William Wylder don t sign I ve a word to say you must pause If it affects our business Miss Lake I do request that you address yourself to me if not may I beg Miss Lake that you will defer it for a moment William Wylder lay down that pen as you love your little boy lay it down and hear me continued Miss Lake The vicar looked at her with his eyes wide open puzzled like a man who is not quite sure whether he may not be doing something wrong I really Miss Lake pardon me but this is very irregular and in fact unprecedented said Jos Larkin I think I suppose you can hardly be aware Ma am that I am here as the reverend mister Wylder s confidential solicitor acting solely for him in a matter of a strictly private nature The attorney stood erect a little flushed with that peculiar contraction mean and dangerous in his eyes Of course mister Wylder if you Sir desire me to leave I shall instantaneously do so and indeed unless you proceed to sign I had better go as my time is generally I may say a little pressed upon and I have in fact some business elsewhere to attend to What is this law paper demanded Rachel laying the tips of her slender fingers upon it Am I to conclude that you withdraw from your engagement asked mister Larkin I had better then communicate with Burlington and Smith by this post as also with the sheriff who has been very kind Oh no oh no mister Larkin pray I m quite ready to sign Now William Wylder you sha n t sign until you tell me whether this is a sale of your reversion The young lady had her white hand firmly pressed upon the spot where he was to sign and the ring that glittered on her finger looked like a talisman interposing between the poor vicar and the momentous act he was meditating I think Miss Lake it is pretty plain you are not acting for yourself here you have been sent Ma am said the attorney looking very vicious and speaking a little huskily and hurriedly I quite conceive by whom I don t know what you mean Sir replied Miss Lake with grave disdain You have been commissioned Ma am I venture to think to come here to watch the interests of another party I say Sir I don t in the least comprehend you I think it is pretty obvious Ma am Miss Lake I beg pardon you have had some conversation with your brother answered the attorney with a significant sneer I don t know what you mean Sir I repeat I ve just heard in the other room from your wife William Wylder that you were about selling your reversion in the estates and I want to know whether that is so for if it be it is the act of a madman and I ll prevent it if I possibly can Upon my word possibly said the vicar his eyes very wide open and looking with a hesitating gaze from Rachel to the attorney there may be something in it which neither you nor I know does it not strike you had we not better consider Consider what Sir said the attorney with a snap and losing his temper somewhat It is simply Sir that this young lady represents Captain Lake who wishes to get the reversion for himself That is utterly false Sir said Miss Lake flashing and blushing with indignation You William are a gentleman and such inconceivable meanness cannot enter your mind The attorney with what he meant to be a polished sarcasm bowed and smiled toward Miss Lake Pale little Fairy sitting before his picture book was watching the scene with round eyes and round mouth and that mixture of interest awe and distress with which children witness the uncomprehended excitement and collision of their elders My dear Miss Lake I respect and esteem you you quite mistake I am persuaded my good friend mister Larkin and indeed I don t quite comprehend but if it were so and that your brother really wished do you think he does mister Larkin to buy the reversion he might think it more valuable perhaps I can say with certainty Sir that from that quarter you would get nothing like what you have agreed to take and I must say once for all Sir that quite setting aside every consideration of honour and of conscience and of the highly prejudicial position in which you would place me as a man of business by taking the very short turn which this young lady Miss Lake suggests your letters amount to an equitable agreement to sell which on petition the court would compel you to do So you see my dear Miss Lake there is no more to be said said the vicar with a careworn smile looking upon Rachel s handsome face Now now we are all friends aren t we said poor Dolly who could not make anything of the debate and was staring with open mouth from one speaker to another We are all agreed are not we You are all so good and fond of Willie that you are actually ready almost to quarrel for him But her little laugh produced no echo except a very joyless and flushed effort from the attorney as he looked up from consulting his watch Eleven minutes past three said he and I ve a meeting at my house at half past so unless you complete that instrument now I regret to say I must take it back unfinished and the result may be to defeat the arrangement altogether and if the consequences should prove serious I at least am not to blame Don t sign I entreat I implore of you William Wylder you shan t But my dear Miss Lake we have considered everything and mister Larkin and I agree that my circumstances are such as to make it inevitable Really this is child s play there if you please said the attorney once more Rachel Lake during the discussion had removed her hand The faintly traced line on which the vicar was to sign was now fairly presented to him Just in your usual way murmured mister Larkin So the vicar s pen was applied but before he had time to trace the first letter of his name Rachel Lake resolutely snatched the thick bluish sheet of scrivenery with its handsome margins and red ink lines from before him and tore it across and across with the quickness of terror and in fewer seconds than one could fancy it lay about the floor and grate in pieces little bigger than dominoes The attorney made a hungry snatch at the paper over William Wylder s shoulder nearly bearing that gentleman down on his face but his clutch fell short Hallo Miss Lake Ma am the paper But wild words were of no avail The whole party except Rachel were aghast The attorney s small eye glanced over the ground and hearthstone where the bits were strewn like Ladies smocks all silver white That paint the meadows with delight He had nothing for it but to submit to fortune with his best air He stood erect a slanting beam from the window glimmered on his tall bald head and his face was black and menacing as the summit of a thunder crowned peak You are not aware Miss Lake of the nature of your act and of the consequences to which you have exposed yourself Madam But that is a view of the occurrence in which except as a matter of deep regret I cannot be supposed to be immediately interested I will mention however that your interference your violent interference Madam may be attended with most serious consequences to my reverend client for which of course you constituted yourself fully responsible when you entered on the course of unauthorised interference which has resulted in destroying the articles of agreement prepared with great care and labour for his protection and retarding the transmission of the document by at least four and twenty hours to London You may Madam I regret to observe have ruined my client Saved him I hope And run yourself Madam into a very serious scrape Upon that point you have said quite enough Sir Dolly William don t look so frightened you ll both live to thank me for this All this time little Fairy unheeded was bawling in great anguish of soul clinging to Rachel s dress and crying Oh he ll hurt her he ll hurt her he ll hurt her Don t let him don t let him Wapsie don t let him Oh the frightle man don t let him he ll hurt her the frightle man And little man s cheeks were drenched in tears and his wee feet danced in an agony of terror on the floor as bawling he tried to pull his friend Rachel into a corner Nonsense little man cried his father with quick reproof on hearing this sacrilegious uproar mister Larkin never hurt anyone tut tut sit down and look at your book But Rachel with a smile of love and gratification lifted the little man up in her arms and kissed him and his thin little legs were clasped about her waist and his arms round her neck and he kissed her with his wet face devouringly blubbering the frightle man you doatie the frightle man Then mister Wylder I shall have the document prepared again from the draft You ll see to that mister Buggs please and perhaps it will be better that you should look in at the Lodge When he mentioned the Lodge it was in so lofty a way that a stranger would have supposed it something very handsome indeed and one of the sights of the county Say about nine o clock to morrow morning Farewell mister Wylder farewell I regret the enhanced expense I regret the delay I regret the risk I regret in fact the whole scene Farewell missus Wylder And with a silent bow to Rachel perfectly polished perfectly terrible he withdrew followed by the sallow clerk and by that radiant scamp old Buggs who made them several obeisances at the door Oh dear Miss Lake Rachel I mean Rachel dear I hope it won t be all off Oh you don t know Heaven only knows the danger we are in Oh Rachel dear if this is broken off I don t know what is to become of us I don t know Dolly spoke quite wildly with her hands on Rachel s shoulders It was the first time she had broken down the first time at least the vicar had seen her anything but cheery and his head sank and it seemed as if his last light had gone out and he was quite benighted Do you think said he there is much danger of that Do you really think so Now don t blame me said Miss Lake and don t be frightened till you have heard me Let us sit down here we shan t be interrupted and just answer your wretched friend Rachel two or three questions and hear what she has to say Rachel was flushed and excited and sat with the little boy still in her arms So in reply to her questions the vicar told her frankly how he stood and Rachel said Well you must not think of selling your reversion Oh think of your little boy think of Dolly if you were taken away from her But said Dolly mister Larkin heard from Captain Lake that Mark is privately married and actually has he says a large family and he you know has letters from him and mister Larkin thinks knows more than anyone else about him and if that were so none of us would ever inherit the property So Do they say that Mark is married Nothing can be more false I know it is altogether a falsehood He neither is nor ever will be married If my brother dared say that in my presence I would make him confess before you that he knows it cannot be Oh my poor little Fairy my poor Dolly my poor good friend William What shall I say I am in great distraction of mind And she hugged and kissed the pale little boy she herself paler Listen to me good and kind as you are You are never to call me your friend mind that I am a most unhappy creature forced by circumstances to be your enemy for a time not always You have no conception how and may never even suspect Don t ask me but listen Wonder stricken and pained was the countenance with which the vicar gazed upon her and Dolly looked both frightened and perplexed I have a little more than three hundred a year There is a little annuity charged on Sir Hugh Landon s estate and his solicitor has written offering me six hundred pounds for it I will write to night accepting that offer and you shall have the money to pay those debts which have been pressing so miserably upon you Don t thank not a word but listen I would so like Dolly to come and live with you We could unite our incomes I need only bring poor old Tamar with me and I can give up Redman s Farm in September next I should be so much happier and I think my income and yours joined would enable us to live without any danger of getting into debt Will you agree to this Dolly dear and promise me William Wylder that you will think no more of selling that reversion which may be the splendid provision of your dear little boy Don t thank me don t say anything now and oh don t reject my poor entreaty Your refusal would almost make me mad I would try Dolly to be of use I think I could Only try me She fancied she saw in Dolly s face under all her gratitude some perplexity and hesitation and feared to accept a decision then So she hurried away with a hasty and kind good bye A fortnight before I think during Dolly s jealous fit this magnificent offer of Rachel s would notwithstanding the dreadful necessities of the case have been coldly received by the poor little woman But that delusion was quite cured now no reserve or doubt or coldness left behind And Dolly and the vicar felt that Rachel s noble proposal was the making of them CHAPTER LIX AN ENEMY IN REDMAN S DELL Jos Larkin grew more and more uncomfortable about the unexpected interposition of Rachel Lake as the day wore on He felt with an unerring intuition that the young lady both despised and suspected him He also knew that she was impetuous and clever and he feared from that small white hand a fatal mischief he could not tell exactly how to his plans Jim Dutton s letter had somehow an air of sobriety and earnestness which made way with his convictions His doubts and suspicions had subsided and he now believed with a profound moral certainty that Mark Wylder was actually dead within the precincts of a mad house or of some lawless place of detention abroad What was that to the purpose Dutton might arrive at any moment Low fellows are always talking and the story might get abroad before the assignment of the vicar s interest Of course there was something speculative in the whole transaction but he had made his book well and by his arrangement with Captain Lake whichever way the truth lay he stood to win So the attorney had no notion of allowing this highly satisfactory arithmetic to be thrown into confusion by the fillip of a small gloved finger On the whole he was not altogether sorry for the delay Everything worked together he knew One or two covenants and modifications in the articles had struck him as desirable on reading the instrument over with William Wylder He also thought a larger consideration should be stated and acknowledged as paid say twenty two thousand l The vicar would really receive just twenty two hundred l Costs would do something to reduce the balance for Jos Larkin was one of those oxen who when treading out corn decline to be muzzled The remainder was the vicar would clearly understand one of those ridiculous pedantries of law upon which our system of crotchets and fictions insisted And William Wylder whose character simply and sensitively honourable mister Larkin appreciated was to write to Burlington and Smith a letter for the satisfaction of their speculative and nervous client pledging his honour as a gentleman and his conscience as a Christian that in the event of the sale being completed he would never do countenance or permit any act or proceeding whatsoever tending on any ground to impeach or invalidate the transaction I ve no objection have I to write such a letter asked the vicar of his adviser Why I suppose you have no intention of trying to defeat your own act and that is all the letter would go to I look on it as wholly unimportant and it is really not a point worth standing upon for a second So that also was agreed to Now while the improved instrument was in preparation the attorney strolled down in the evening to look after his clerical client and keep him straight for the meeting at which he was to sign the articles next day It was by the drowsy faded light of a late summer s evening that he arrived at the quaint little parsonage He maintained his character as a nice spoken gentleman by enquiring of the maid who opened the door how the little boy was Not so well gone to bed but would be better everyone was sure in the morning So he went in and saw the vicar who had just returned with Dolly from a little ramble Everything promised fairly the quiet mind was returning the good time coming all the pleasanter for the storms and snows of the night that was over Well my good invaluable friend you will be glad you will rejoice with us I know to learn that after all the sale of our reversion is unnecessary The attorney allowed his client to shake him by both hands and he smiled a sinister congratulation as well as he could grinning in reply to the vicar s pleasant smile as cheerfully as was feasible and wofully puzzled in the meantime Had James Dutton arrived and announced the death of Mark no it could hardly be that decency had not yet quite taken leave of the earth and stupid as the vicar was he would hardly announce the death of his brother to a Christian gentleman in a fashion so outrageous Had Lord Chelford been invoked and answered satisfactorily Or Dorcas or had Lake the diabolical sneak interposed with his long purse and a plausible hypocrisy of kindness to spoil Larkin s plans All these fanciful queries flitted through his brain as the vicar s hands shook both his and he laboured hard to maintain the cheerful grin with which he received the news and his guileful rapacious little eyes searched narrowly the countenance of his client So after a while Dolly assisting and sometimes both talking together the story was told Rachel blessed and panegyrised and the attorney s congratulations challenged and yielded once more But there was something not altogether joyous in Jos Larkin s countenance which struck the vicar and he said You don t see any objection and paused Objection Why objection my dear Sir is a strong word but I fear I do see a difficulty in fact several difficulties Perhaps you would take a little turn on the green I must call for a moment at the reading room and I ll explain You ll forgive me I hope missus Wylder he added with a playful condescension for running away with your husband but only for a few minutes ha ha The shadow was upon Jos Larkin s face and he was plainly meditating a little uncomfortably as they approached the quiet green of Gylingden What a charming evening said the vicar making an effort at cheerfulness Delicious evening yes said the attorney throwing back his long head and letting his mouth drop But though his face was turned up towards the sky there was a contraction and a darkness upon it not altogether heavenly The offer said the attorney beginning rather abruptly is no doubt a handsome offer at the first glance and it may be well meant But the fact is my dear mister Wylder six hundred pounds would leave little more than a hundred remaining after Burlington and Smith have had their costs You have no idea of the expense and trouble of title and the inevitable costliness my dear Sir of all conveyancing operations The deeds I have little doubt in consequence of the letter you directed me to write have been prepared that is in draft of course and then my dear Sir I need not remind you that there remain the costs to me those of course await your entire convenience but still it would not be either for your or my advantage that they should be forgotten in the general adjustment of your affairs which I understand you to propose The vicar s countenance fell In fact it is idle to say that being unaccustomed to the grand scale on which law costs present themselves on occasion he was unspeakably shocked and he grew very pale and silent on hearing these impressive sentences And as to Miss Lake s residing with you I speak now you will understand in the strictest confidence because the subject is a painful one as to her residing with you as she proposes Miss Lake is well aware that I am cognizant of circumstances which render any such arrangement absolutely impracticable I need not my dear Sir be more particular at present at least In a little time you will probably be made acquainted with them by the inevitable disclosures of time which as the wise man says discovers all things But but what stammered the pale vicar altogether shocked and giddy You will not press me my dear Sir you ll understand that just now I really cannot satisfy any particular enquiry Miss Lake has spoken in charity I will hope and trust without thought But I am much mistaken or she will herself on half an hour s calm consideration see the moral impossibilities which interpose between her to me most amazing plan and its realisation There was a little pause here during which the tread of their feet on the soft grass alone was audible You will quite understand resumed the attorney the degree of confidence with which I make this communication and you will please specially not to mention it to any person whatsoever I do not except in fact any You will find on consideration that Miss Lake will not press her residence upon you No I ve no doubt Miss Lake is a very intelligent person and when not excited will see it clearly The attorney s manner had something of that reserve and grim sort of dryness which supervened whenever he fancied a friend or client on whom he had formed designs was becoming impracticable Nothing affected him so much as that kind of unkindness Jos Larkin took his leave a little abruptly He did not condescend to ask the vicar whether he still entertained Miss Lake s proposal He had not naturally a pleasant temper somewhat short dark and dangerous but by no means noisy This temper an intense reluctance ever to say thank you and a profound and quiet egotism were the ingredients of that pride on which a little inconsistently perhaps in so eminent a Christian he piqued himself It must be admitted however that his pride was not of that stamp which would prevent him from listening to other men s private talk or reading their letters if anything were to be got by it or from prosecuting his small spites with a patient and virulent industry or from stripping a man of his possessions and transferring them to himself by processes from which most men would shrink Well thought the vicar that munificent offer is unavailing it seems The sum insufficient great as it is and other difficulties in the way He was walking homewards slowly and dejectedly and was now beginning to feel alarm lest the purchase of the reversion should fail The agreement was to have gone up to London by this day s mail and now could not reach till the day after to morrow four and twenty hours later than was promised The attorney had told him it was a touch and go affair and the whole thing might be off in a moment and if it should miscarry what inevitable ruin yawned before him Oh the fatigue of these monotonous agitations this never ending suspense Oh the yearning unimaginable for quiet and rest How awfully he comprehended the reasonableness of the thanksgiving which he had read that day in the churchyard We give Thee hearty thanks for that it hath pleased Thee to deliver this our brother out of the miseries of this sinful world With the attorney it was different Making the most of his height which he fancied added much to the aristocratic effect of his presence with his head thrown back and swinging his walking cane easily between his finger and thumb by his side he strode languidly through the main street of Gylingden in the happy belief that he was making a sensation among the denizens of the town And so he moved on to the mill road on which he entered and was soon deep in the shadows of Redman s Dell He opened the tiny garden gate of Redman s Farm looking about him with a supercilious benevolence like a man conscious of bestowing a distinction He was inwardly sensible of a sort of condescension in entering so diminutive and homely a place a kind of half amusing disproportion between Jos Larkin esquire of the Lodge worth already Ltwenty seven thousand and on the high road to greatness and the trumpery little place in which he found himself Old Tamar was sitting in the porch with her closed Bible upon her knees there was no longer light to read by She rose up like the grim white woman who haunts yon wood before him Her young lady had walked up to Brandon taking the little girl with her and she supposed would be back again early mister Larkin eyed her for a second to ascertain whether she was telling lies He always thought everyone might be lying It was his primary impression here But there was a recluse and unearthly character in the face of the crone which satisfied him that she would never think of fencing with such weapons with him Very good mister Larkin would take a short walk and as his business was pressing he would take the liberty of looking in again in about half an hour if she thought her mistress would be at home then So although the weird white woman who leered after him so strangely as he walked with his most lordly air out of the little garden and down the darkening road towards Gylingden could not say he resolved to make trial again In the meantime Rachel had arrived at Brandon Hall Dorcas whom if the truth were spoken she would rather not have met encountered her on the steps She was going out for a lonely twilight walk upon the terrace where many a beautiful Brandon of other days the sunshine of whose smile glimmered only on the canvas that hung upon those ancestral walls and whose sorrows were hid in the grave and forgotten by the world had walked in other days in the pride of beauty or in the sadness of desertion Dorcas paused upon the door steps and received her sister in law upon that elevation Have you really come all this way Rachel to see me this evening she said and something of sarcasm thrilled in the cold musical tones No Dorcas said Rachel taking her proffered hand in the spirit in which it was given and with the air rather of a defiance than of a greeting I came to see my brother You are frank at all events Rachel and truth is better than courtesy but you forget that your brother could not have returned so soon Returned said Rachel I did not know he had left home It s strange he should not have consulted you I of course knew nothing of it until he had been more than an hour upon his journey Rachel Lake made no answer but a little laugh He ll return to morrow and perhaps your meeting may still be in time I was thinking of a few minutes walk upon the terrace but you are fatigued you had better come in and rest No Dorcas I won t go in But Rachel you are tired you must come in with me and drink tea and then you can go home in the brougham said Dorcas more kindly No Dorcas no I will not drink tea nor go in but I am tired and as you are so kind I will accept your offer of the carriage Larcom had that moment appeared in the vestibule and received the order I ll sit in the porch if you will allow me Dorcas you must not lose your walk Then you won t come into the house you won t drink tea with me and you won t join me in my little walk and why not any of these Dorcas smiled coldly and continued Well I shall hear the carriage coming to the door and I ll return and bid you good night It is plain Rachel you do not like my company True Dorcas I do not like your company You are unjust you have no confidence in me you prejudge me without proof and you have quite ceased to love me Why should I like your company Dorcas smiled a proud and rather sad smile at this sudden change from the conventional to the passionate and the direct and fiery charge of her kinswoman was unanswered She stood meditating for a minute You think I no longer love you Rachel as I did Perhaps young ladies friendships are never very enduring but if it be so the fault is not mine No Dorcas the fault is not yours nor mine The fault is in circumstances The time is coming Dorcas when you will know all and maybe judge me mercifully In the meantime Dorcas you cannot like my company because you do not like me and I do not like yours just because in spite of all I do love you still and in yours I only see the image of a lost friend You may be restored to me soon maybe never but till then I have lost you Well said Dorcas it may be there is a wild kind of truth in what you say Rachel and no matter time as you say and light I don t understand you Rachel but there is this in you that resembles me we both hate hypocrisy and we are both in our own ways proud I ll come back when I hear the carriage and see you for a moment as you won t stay or come with me and bid you good bye So Dorcas went her way and alone on the terrace looking over the stone balustrade over the rich and sombre landscape dim and vaporous in the twilight she still saw the pale face of Rachel paler than she liked to see it Was she ill and she thought how lonely she would be if Rachel were to die how lonely she was now There was a sting of compunction a yearning and then started a few bitter and solitary tears In one of the great stone vases that are ranged along the terrace there flourished a beautiful and rare rose I forget its name Some of my readers will remember It is first to bloom first to wither Its fragrant petals were now strewn upon the terrace underneath One blossom only remained untarnished and Dorcas plucked it and with it in her fingers she returned to the porch where Rachel remained You see I have come back a little before my time said Dorcas I have just been looking at the plant you used to admire so much and the leaves are shed already and it reminded me of our friendship Radie but I am sure you are right it will all bloom again after the winter you know and I thought I would come back and say that and give you this relic of the bloom that is gone the last token and she kissed Rachel as she placed it in her fingers a token of remembrance and of hope I will keep it Dorkie It was kind of you and their eyes met regretfully And and I think I do trust you Radie said the heiress of Brandon and I hope you will try to like me on till till spring comes you know And I wish she sighed softly I wish we were as we used to be I am not very happy and here s the carriage And it drew up close to the steps and Rachel entered and her little handmaid of up in the seat behind and Dorcas and Rachel kissed their hands and smiled and away the carriage glided and Dorcas standing on the steps looked after it very sadly And when it disappeared she sighed again heavily still looking in its track and I think she said Darling CHAPTER LX RACHEL LAKE BEFORE THE ACCUSER Twilight was darker in Redman s Dell than anywhere else But dark as it was there was still light enough to enable Rachel as she hurried across the little garden on her return from Brandon to see a long white face and some dim outline of the figure to which it belonged looking out upon her from the window of her little drawing room But no it could not be who was there to call at so odd an hour She must have left something a bag or a white basket upon the window sash She was almost startled however as she approached the porch to see it nod and a hand dimly waved in token of greeting Tamar was in the kitchen Could it be Stanley But faint as the outline was she saw she fancied that it was a taller person than he She felt a sort of alarm in which there was some little mixture of the superstitious and she pushed open the door not entering the room but staring in toward the window where against the dim external light she clearly saw without recognising it a tall figure greeting her with mop and moe Who is that cried Miss Lake a little sharply It is I Miss Lake mister Josiah Larkin of the Lodge said that gentleman with what he meant to be an air of dignified firmness and looking very like a tall constable in possession I have taken the liberty of presenting myself although I fear at a somewhat unseasonable hour but in reference to a little business which unfortunately will not I think bear to be deferred No bad news mister Larkin I hope nothing has happened The Wylders are all well I hope Quite well so far as I am aware answered the attorney with a grim politeness perfectly Nothing has occurred as yet at least affecting the interests of that family but something is I will not say threatened but I may say mooted which were any attempt seriously made to carry it into execution would I regret to say involve very serious consequences to a party whom for I may say many reasons I should regret being called upon to affect unpleasantly And pray mister Larkin can I be of any use Every use Miss Lake and it is precisely for that reason that I have taken the liberty of waiting upon you at what I am well aware is a somewhat unusual hour Perhaps mister Larkin you would be so good as to call in the morning any hour you appoint will answer me said the young lady a little stiffly She was still standing at the door with her hand upon the brass handle Pardon me Miss Lake the business to which I refer is really urgent Very urgent Sir if it cannot wait till to morrow morning Very true quite true very urgent indeed replied the attorney calmly I presume Miss Lake I may take a chair Certainly Sir if you insist on my listening to night which I should certainly decline if I had the power Thank you Miss Lake And the attorney took a chair crossing one leg over the other and throwing his head back as he reclined in it with his long arm over the back the express image as he fancied of a polished gentleman conducting a diplomatic interview with a clever and high bred lady Then it is plain Sir I must hear you to night said Miss Lake haughtily Not that exactly Miss Lake but only that I must speak to night in fact I have no choice The subject of our conference really is as you will find an urgent one and to morrow morning which we should each equally prefer would be possibly too late too late at least to obviate a very painful situation You will make it I am sure as short as you can Sir said the young lady in the same tone Exactly my wish Miss Lake replied mister Jos Larkin Bring candles Margery And so the little drawing room was illuminated and the bald head of the tall attorney and the gloss on his easy black frock coat and his gold watch chain and the long and large gloved hand depending near the carpet with the glove of the other in it And mister Jos Larkin rose with a negligent and lordly case and placed a chair for Miss Lake so that the light might fall full upon her features in accordance with his usual diplomatic arrangement which he fancied complacently no one had ever detected he himself resuming his easy pose upon his chair with his back as much as was practicable presented to the candles and the long bony fingers of the arm which rested on the table negligently shading his observing little eyes and screening off the side light from his expressive features These arrangements however were disconcerted by Miss Lake s sitting down at the other side of the table and quietly requesting mister Larkin to open his case Why really it is hardly a five minutes matter Miss Lake It refers to the vicar the reverend William Wylder and his respectable family and a proposition which he as my client mentioned to me this evening He stated that you had offered to advance a sum of six hundred l for the liquidation of his liabilities It will perhaps conduce to clearness to dispose of this part of the matter first May I therefore ask at this stage whether the reverend William Wylder rightly conceived you when he so stated your meaning to me Yes certainly I am most anxious to assist them with that little sum which I have now an opportunity of procuring A exactly yes well Miss Lake that is of course very kind of you very kind indeed and creditable to your feelings but as mister William Wylder s solicitor and as I have already demonstrated to him I must now inform you that the sum of six hundred pounds would be absolutely useless in his position No party Miss Lake in his position ever quite apprehends even if he could bring himself fully to state the aggregate amount of his liabilities I may state however to you without betraying confidence that ten times that sum would not avail to extricate him even temporarily from his difficulties He sees the thing himself now but drowning men will grasp we know at straws However he does see the futility of this and thanking you most earnestly he through me begs most gratefully to decline it In fact my dear Miss Lake it is awful to contemplate he has been in the hands of sharks harpies my dear Madam but I ll beat about for the money in the way of loan if possible and one way or another I am resolved if the thing s to be done to get him straight There was here a little pause and mister Larkin finding that Miss Lake had nothing to say simply added And so for these reasons and with these views my dear Miss Lake we beg most respectfully and I will say gratefully to decline the proffered advance which I will say at the same time does honour to your feelings I am sorry said Miss Lake you have had so much trouble in explaining so simple a matter I will call early to morrow and see mister Wylder Pardon me said the attorney I have to address myself next to the second portion of your offer as stated to me by mister W Wylder that which contemplates a residence in his house and in the respectable bosom I may say of that in many respects unblemished family Miss Lake stared with a look of fierce enquiry at the attorney The fact is Miss Lake that that is an arrangement which under existing circumstances I could not think of advising I think on reflection you will see that mister Wylder the Reverend William Wylder and his lady could not for one moment seriously entertain it and that I who am bound to do the best I can for them could not dream of advising it I fancy it is a matter of total indifference Sir what you may and what you may not advise in a matter quite beyond your province I don t in the least understand or desire to understand you and thinking your manner impertinent and offensive I beg that you will now be so good as to leave my house Miss Rachel was very angry although nothing but her bright colour and the vexed flash of her eye showed it I were most unfortunate most unfortunate indeed Miss Lake if my manner could in the least justify the strong and undue language in which you have been pleased to characterise it But I do not resent it is not my way beareth all things Miss Lake beareth all things I hope I try to practise the precept but the fact of being misunderstood shall not deter me from the discharge of a simple duty If it is part of your duty Sir to make yourself intelligible may I beg that you will do it without further delay My principal object in calling here was to inform you Miss Lake that you must quite abandon the idea of residing in the vicar s house as you proposed unless you wish me to state explicitly to him and to missus Wylder the insurmountable objections which exist to any such arrangement Such a task Miss Lake would be most painful to me I hesitate to discuss the question even with you and if you give me your word of honour that you quite abandon that idea I shall on the instant take my leave and certainly for the present trouble you no further upon a most painful subject And now Sir as I have no intention whatever of tolerating your incomprehensibly impertinent interference and don t understand your meaning in the slightest degree and do not intend to withdraw the offer I have made to good missus Wylder you will I hope perceive the uselessness of prolonging your visit and be so good as to leave me in unmolested possession of my poor residence If I wished to do you an injury Miss Lake I should take you at your word I don t I wish to spare you Your countenance Miss Lake you must pardon my frankness it is my way your countenance tells only too plainly that you now comprehend my allusion There was a confidence and significance in the attorney s air and accent and a peculiar look of latent ferocity in his evil countenance which gradually excited her fears and fascinated her gaze Now Miss Lake we are sitting here in the presence of Him who is the searcher of hearts and before whom nothing is secret your eye is upon mine and mine on yours and I ask you do you remember the night of the twenty ninth of September last That mean pale taunting face the dreadful accents that vibrated within her How could that ill omened man have divined her connection with the incidents the unknown incidents of that direful night The lean figure in the black frock coat and black silk waistcoat with that great gleaming watch chain the long shabby withered face and flushed bald forehead and those paltry little eyes in their pink setting that nevertheless fascinated her like the gaze of a serpent How had that horrible figure come there why was this meeting whence his knowledge An evil spirit incarnate he seemed to her She blanched before it every vestige of colour fled from her features she stared she gaped at him with a strange look of imbecility and the long face seemed to enjoy and protract its triumph Without removing his gaze he was fumbling in his pocket for his note book which he displayed with a faint smile grim and pallid I see you do remember that night as well you may Miss Lake he ejaculated in formidable tones and with a shake of his bald head Now Miss Lake you see this book It contains Madam the skeleton of a case The bones and joints Ma am of a case I have it here noted and prepared There is not a fact in it without a note of the name and address of the witness who can prove it the witness observe me Then there was a pause of a few seconds during which he still kept her under his steady gaze On that night Miss Lake the twenty ninth September you drove in mister Mark Wylder s tax cart to the Dollington station where notwithstanding your veil and your caution you were seen and recognised The same occurred at Charteris You accompanied mister Mark Wylder in his midnight flight to London Miss Lake Of your stay in London I say nothing It was protracted to the second October when you arrived in the down train at Dollington at twelve o clock at night and took a cab to the White House where you were met by a gentleman answering the description of your brother Captain Lake Now Miss Lake I have stated no particulars but do you think that knowing all this and knowing the fraud by which your absence was covered and perfectly understanding as every man conversant with this sinful world must do the full significance of all this I could dream of permitting you Miss Lake to become domesticated as an inmate in the family of a pure minded though simple and unfortunate clergyman It may become my duty he resumed to prosecute a searching enquiry Madam into the circumstances of mister Mark Wylder s disappearance If you have the slightest regard for your own honour you will not precipitate that measure Miss Lake and so sure as you persist in your unwarrantable design of residing in that unsuspecting family I will publish what I shall then feel called upon by my position to make known for I will be no party to seeing an innocent family compromised by admitting an inmate of whose real character they have not the faintest suspicion and I shall at once set in motion a public enquiry into the circumstances of mister Mark Wylder s disappearance Looking straight in his face with the same expression of helplessness she uttered at last a horrible cry of anguish that almost thrilled that callous Christian I think I m going mad And she continued staring at him all the time Pray compose yourself Miss Lake there s no need to agitate yourself nothing of all this need occur if you do not force it upon me nothing I beg you ll collect yourself shall I call for water Miss Lake The fact is the attorney began to apprehend hysterics or something even worse and was himself rather frightened But Rachel was never long overwhelmed by any shock fear was not for her her brave spirit stood her in stead and nothing rallied her so surely as the sense that an attempt was being made to intimidate her What have I heard what have I endured Listen to me you cowardly libeller It is true that I was at Dollington and at Charteris on the night you name Also true that I went to London Your hideous slander is garnished with two or three bits of truth but only the more villainous for that All that you have dared to insinuate is utterly false Before Him who judges all and knows all things utterly and damnably false The attorney made a bow it was his best He did not imitate a gentleman happily and was never so vulgar as when he was finest One word of her wild protest he did not believe His bow was of that grave but mocking sort which was meant to convey it Perhaps if he had accepted what she said it might have led him to new and sounder conclusions Here was light but it glared and flashed in vain for him Miss Lake was naturally perfectly frank Pity it was she had ever had a secret to keep These frank people are a sore puzzle to gentlemen of Lawyer Larkin s quaint and sagacious turn of mind They can t believe that anybody ever speaks quite the truth when they hear it they don t recognise it and they wonder what the speaker is driving at The best method of hiding your opinion or your motives from such men is to tell it to them They are owls Their vision is formed for darkness and light blinds them Rachel Lake rang her bell sharply and old Tamar appeared Show mister mister show him to the door said Miss Lake The attorney rose made another bow and threw back his head and moved in a way that was oppressively gentlemanlike to the door and speedily vanished at the little wicket Old Tamar holding her candle to lighten his path as she stood white and cadaverous in the porch She s a little bit noisy to night thought the attorney as he descended the road to Gylingden but she ll be precious sober by to morrow morning and I venture to say we shall hear nothing more of that scheme of hers A reputable inmate truly and a pleasant eclaircissement this was one of his French words and pronounced by him with his usual accuracy precisely as it is spelt a pleasant eclaircissement whenever that London excursion and its creditable circumstances come to light CHAPTER LXI IN WHICH DAME DUTTON IS VISITED Duly next morning the rosy fingered Aurora drew the gold and crimson curtains of the east and the splendid Apollo stepping forth from his chamber took the reins of his unrivalled team and driving four in hand through the sky like a great swell as he is took small note of the staring hucksters and publicans by the road side and sublimely overlooked the footsore and ragged pedestrians that crawl below his level It was in fact one of those brisk and bright mornings which proclaim a universal cheerfulness and mock the miseries of those dismal wayfarers of life to whom returning light is a renewal of sorrow who bowing toward the earth resume their despairing march and limp and groan under heavy burdens until darkness welcome comes again and their eyelids drop and they lie down with their loads on looking up a silent supplication and wishing that death would touch their eyelids in their sleep and their journey end where they lie Captain Lake was in London this morning We know he came about electioneering matters but he had not yet seen Leverett Perhaps on second thoughts he rightly judged that Leverett knew no more than he did of the matter It depended on the issue of the great debate that was drawing nigh The Minister himself could not tell whether the dissolution was at hand and could no more postpone it when the time came than he could adjourn an eclipse Notwithstanding the late whist party of the previous night the gallant captain made a very early toilet With his little bag in his hand he went down stairs thinking unpleasantly I believe and jumped into the Hansom that awaited him at the door telling the man to go to the station They had hardly turned the corner however when he popped his head forward and changed the direction He looked at his watch He had quite time to make his visit and save the down train after He did not know the City well Many men who lived two hundred miles away and made a flying visit only once in three years knew it a great deal better than the London bred rake who had lived in the West end all his days Captain Lake looked peevish and dangerous as he always did when he was anxious In fact he did not know what the next ten minutes might bring him He was thinking what had best be done in any and every contingency Was he still abroad or had he arrived was he in Shive s Court or cursed luck had he crossed him yesterday by the down train and was he by this time closeted with Larkin in the Lodge Lake so to speak stood at his wicket and that accomplished bowler Fortune ball in hand at the other end will it be swift round hand or a slow twister or a shooter or a lob Eye and hand foot and bat he must stand tense yet flexible lithe and swift as lightning ready for everything cut block slip or hit to leg It was not altogether pleasant The stakes were enormous and the suspense by no means conducive to temper Lake fancied that the man was driving wrong once or twice and was on the point of cursing him to that effect from the window But at last with an anxious throb at his heart he recognised the dingy archway and the cracked brown marble tablet over the keystone and he recognised Shive s Court So forth jumped the captain so far relieved and glided into the dim quadrangle with its square of smoky sky overhead and the prattle of children playing on the flags and the scrape of a violin from a window were in his ears but as it were unheard He was looking up at a window with a couple of sooty scarlet geraniums in it This was the court where Dame Dutton dwelt He glided up her narrow stair and let himself in by the latch and with his cane made a smacking like a harlequin s sword upon the old woman s deal table crying missus Dutton missus Dutton Is missus Dutton at home The old lady who was a laundress entered in a short blue cotton wrapper wiping the suds from her shrunken but sinewy arms with her apron and on seeing the captain her countenance which was threatening became very reverential indeed How d ye do missus Dutton Quite well Have you heard lately from Jim No You ll see him soon however and give him this note d ye see and tell him I was here asking about you and him and very well and glad if I can serve him again don t forget that very glad Where will you keep that note Oh your tea caddy not a bad safe and see give him this it s ten pounds You won t forget and you want a new gown missus Dutton I d choose it thyself only I m such a bad judge but you ll choose it for me won t you and let me see it on you when next I come and with a courtesy and a great beaming smile on her hot face she accepted the five pound note which he placed in her hand In another moment the captain was gone He had just time to swallow a cup of coffee at the Terminus Hotel and was gliding away towards the distant walls of Brandon Hall He had a coupe all to himself But he did not care for the prospect He saw Lawyer Larkin as it were reflected in the plate glass with his hollow smile and hungry eyes before him knowing more than he should do paying him compliments and plotting his ruin Everything would have been quite smooth only for that d fellow The Devil fixed him precisely there for the express purpose of fleecing and watching and threatening him perhaps worse He hated that sly double dealing reptile of prey the arachnida of social nature the spiders with which also naturalists place the scorpions I dare say mister Larkin would have had as little difficulty in referring the gallant captain to the same family While Stanley Lake is thus scanning the shabby but dangerous image of the attorney in the magic mirror before him that eminent limb of the law was not inactive in the quiet town of Gylingden Under ordinary circumstances his pride would have condemned the vicar to a direful term of suspense and he certainly would not have knocked at the door of the pretty little gabled house at the Dollington end of the town for many days to come The vicar would have had to seek out the attorney to lie in wait for and to woo him But Jos Larkin s pride like all his other passions except his weakness for the precious metals was under proper regulation Jim Dutton might arrive at any moment and it would not do to risk his publishing the melancholy intelligence of Mark Wylder s death before the transfer of the vicar s reversion and to prevent that risk the utmost promptitude was indispensable At nine o clock therefore he presented himself attended by his legal henchmen as before Another man might not have come here mister Wylder until his presence had been specially invited after the the when he came to define the offence it was not very easy to do so inasmuch as it consisted in the vicar s having unconsciously very nearly escaped from his fangs but let that pass I have had I grieve to say by this morning s post a most serious letter from London the attorney shook his head while searching his pocket I ll read just a passage or two if you ll permit me it comes from Burlington and Smith I protest I have forgot it at home however I may mention that in consequence of the letter you authorised me to write and guaranteed by your bond on which they have entered judgment they have gone to the entire expense of drawing the deeds and investigating title and they say that the purchaser will positively be off unless the articles are in their office by twelve o clock to morrow and I grieve to say they add that in the event of the thing falling through they will issue execution for the amount of their costs which as I anticipated a good deal exceeds four hundred pounds I have therefore my dear mister Wylder casting aside all unpleasant feeling called to entreat you to end and determine any hesitation you may have felt and to execute without one moment s delay the articles which are prepared and which must be in the post office within half an hour Then mister Jos Larkin entered pointedly and briefly into Miss Lake s offer which he characterised as wholly nugatory illusory and chimerical told him he had spoken on the subject yesterday evening to the young lady who now saw plainly that there really was nothing in it and that she was not in a position to carry out that part of her proposition which contemplated a residence in the vicar s family This portion of his discourse he dismissed rather slightly and mysteriously but he contrived to leave upon the vicar s mind a very painful and awful sort of uncertainty respecting the young lady of whom he spoke Then he became eloquent on the madness of further indecision in a state of things so fearfully menacing freely admitting that it would have been incomparably better for the vicar never to have moved in the matter than having put his hand to the plough to look back as he had been doing If he declined his advice there was no more to be said but to bow his head to the storm and that ponderous execution would descend in wreck and desolation So the vicar very much flushed in panic and perplexity and trusting wildly to his protesting lawyer s guidance submitted Buggs and the bilious youngster entered with the deed and the articles were duly executed and the vicar signed also a receipt for the fanciful part of the consideration and upon it and the deed he endorsed a solemn promise in the terms I have mentioned before that he would never take any step to question set aside or disturb the purchase or any matter connected therewith Then the attorney now in his turn flushed and very much elated congratulated the poor vicar on his emancipation from his difficulties and now that it was all done and over told him what he had never told him before that considering the nature of the purchase he had got a splendid price for it The good man had also his agreement from Lake to sell Five Oaks The position of the good attorney therefore in a commercial point of view was eminently healthy and convenient For less than half the value of Five Oaks alone he was getting that estate and a vastly greater one beside to be succeeded to on Mark Wylder s death No wonder then that the good attorney was more than usually bland and happy that day He saw the pork butcher in his back parlour and had a few words to say about the chapel trust and his looks and talk were quite edifying He met two little children in the street and stopped and smiled as he stooped down to pat them on the heads and ask them whose children they were and gave one of them a halfpenny And he sat afterwards for nearly ten minutes with lean old missus Mullock in her little shop where toffey toys and penny books for young people were sold together with baskets tea cups straw mats and other adult ware and he was so friendly and talked so beautifully and although as he admitted in his lofty way there might be differences in fortune and position yet were we not all members of one body And he talked upon this theme till the good lady marvelling how so great a man could be so humble was called to the receipt of custom on the subject of paradise and lemon drops and the heavenly minded attorney with a celestial condescension recognised his two little acquaintances of the street and actually adding another halfpenny to his bounty escaped with a hasty farewell and a smile to the street as eager to evade the thanks of the little people and the admiration of missus Mullock It is not to be supposed that having got one momentous matter well off his mind the good attorney was to be long rid of anxieties The human mind is fertile in that sort of growth As well might the gentleman who shaves suppose as his fingers glide after the operation over the polished surface of his chin factus ad unguem that he may fling his brush and strop into the fire and bury his razor certain fathoms in the earth No One crop of cares will always succeed another not very oppressive nor in any wise grand perhaps worries simply no more but needing a modicum of lather the looking glass the strop the diligent razor delicate manipulation and stealing a portion of our precious time every day we live and this must go on so long as the state of man is imperfect and plenty of possible evil in futurity The attorney must run up to London for a day or two What if that mysterious and almost illegible brute James Dutton should arrive while he was away Very unpleasant possibly For the attorney intended to keep that gentleman very quiet Sufficient time must be allowed to intervene to disconnect the purchase of the vicar s remainder from the news of Mark Wylder s demise A year and a half maybe or possibly a year might do For if the good attorney was cautious he was also greedy and would take possession as early as was safe Therefore arrangements were carefully adjusted to detain that important person in the event of his arriving and a note in the good attorney s hand inviting him to remain at the Lodge till his return and particularly requesting that he would kindly abstain from mentioning to anyone during his absence any matter he might intend to communicate to him in his professional capacity or otherwise This of course was a little critical and made his to morrow s journey to London a rather anxious prospect In the meantime our friend Captain Lake arrived in a hired fly with his light baggage at the door of stately Brandon So soon as the dust and ashes of railway travel were removed the pale captain in changed attire snowy cambric and with perfumed hair and handkerchief presented himself before Dorcas Now Dorkie darling your poor soldier has come back resolved to turn over a new leaf and never more to reserve another semblance of a secret from you said he so soon as his first greeting was over I long to have a good talk with you Dorkie I have no one on earth to confide in but you I think he said with a little sigh I would never have been so reserved with you darling if I had had anything pleasant to confide but all I have to say is triste and tiresome only a story of difficulties and petty vexations I want to talk to you Dorkie Where shall it be They were in the great drawing room where I had first seen Dorcas Brandon and Rachel Lake on the evening on which my acquaintance with the princely Hall was renewed after an interval of so many years This room Stanley dear Yes this room will answer very well he said looking round We can t be overheard it is so large Very well darling listen CHAPTER LXII THE CAPTAIN EXPLAINS WHY MARK WYLDER ABSCONDED How delicious these violets are said Stanley leaning for a moment over the fragrant purple dome that crowned a china stand on the marble table they were passing You love flowers Dorkie Every perfect woman is I think a sister of Flora s You are looking pale you have not been ill No I m very glad you say so Sit down for a moment and listen darling And first I ll tell you upon my honour what Rachel has been worrying me about Dorcas sate beside him on the sofa and he placed his slender arm affectionately round her waist You must know Dorkie that before his sudden departure Mark Wylder promised to lend William his brother a sum sufficient to relieve him of all his pressing debts Debts I never knew before that he had any exclaimed Dorcas Poor William I am so sorry Well he has like other fellows only he can t get away as easily and he has been very much pressed since Mark went for he has not yet lent him a guinea and in fact Rachel says she thinks he is in danger of being regularly sold out She does not say she knows it but only that she suspects they are in a great fix about money Well you must know that I was the sole cause of Mark Wylder s leaving the country You Stanley Yes I Dorkie I believe I thought I was doing a duty but really I was nearly mad with jealousy and simply doing my utmost to drive a rival from your presence And yet without hope for myself desperately in love Dorcas looked down and smiled oddly it was a sad and bitter smile and seemed to ask whither has that desperate love in so short a time flown I know I was right He was a stained man and was liable at any moment to be branded It was villainous in him to seek to marry you I told him at last that unless he withdrew your friends should know all I expected he would show fight and that a meeting would follow and I really did not much care whether I were killed or not But he went on the contrary rather quietly threatening to pay me off however though he did not say how He s a cunning dog and not very soft hearted and has no more conscience than that and he touched his finger to the cold summit of a marble bust He is palpably machinating something to my destruction with an influential attorney on whom I keep a watch and he has got some fellow named Dutton into the conspiracy and not knowing how they mean to act and only knowing how utterly wicked cunning and bloody minded he is and that he hates me as he probably never hated anyone before I must be prepared to meet him and if possible to blow up that Satanic cabal which without money I can t It was partly a mystification about the election of course it will be expensive but nothing like the other Are you ill Dorkie He might well ask for she appeared on the point of fainting Dorcas had read and heard stories of men seemingly no worse than their neighbours nay highly esteemed and praised and liked who yet were haunted by evil men who encountered them in lonely places or by night and controlled them by the knowledge of some dreadful crime Was Stanley her husband whose character she had begun to discern whose habitual mystery was somehow tinged in her mind with a shade of horror one of this two faced diabolical order of heroes Why should he dread this cabal as he called it even though directed by the malignant energy of the absent and shadowy Mark Wylder What could all the world do to harm him in free England if he were innocent if he were what he seemed no worse than his social peers Why should it be necessary to buy off the conspirators whom a guiltless man would defy and punish The doubt did not come in these defined shapes As a halo surrounds a saint a shadow rose suddenly and enveloped pale scented smiling Stanley with the yellow eyes He stood in the centre of a dreadful medium through which she saw him ambiguous and awful and she sickened Are you ill Dorkie darling said the apparition in accents of tenderness Yes you are ill And he hastily threw open the window close to which they were sitting and she quickly revived in the cooling air She saw his yellow eyes fixed upon her features and his face wearing an odd expression was it interest or tenderness or only scrutiny to her there seemed a light of insincerity and cruelty in its pallor You are better darling thank Heaven you are better Yes yes a great deal better it is passing away Her colour was returning and with a shivering sigh she said Oh Stanley you must speak truth I am your wife Do they know anything very bad are you in their power Why my dearest what on earth could put such a wild fancy in your head said Lake with a strange laugh and as she fancied growing still paler Do you suppose I am a highwayman in disguise or a murderer like what s his name Eugene Aram I must have expressed myself very ill if I suggested anything so tragical I protest before Heaven my darling there is not one word or act of mine I need fear to submit to any court of justice or of honour on earth He took her hand and kissed it affectionately and still fondling it gently between his he resumed I don t mean to say of course that I have always been better than other young fellows I ve been foolish and wild and and I ve done wrong things occasionally as all young men will but for high crimes and misdemeanors or for melodramatic situations I never had the slightest taste There s no man on earth who can tell anything of me or put me under any sort of pressure thank Heaven and simply because I have never in the course of my life done a single act unworthy of a gentleman or in the most trifling way compromised myself I swear it my darling upon my honour and soul and I will swear it in any terms the most awful that can be prescribed in order totally and for ever to remove from your mind so amazing a fancy And with a little laugh and still holding her hand he passed his arm round her waist and kissed her affectionately But you are perfectly right Dorkie in supposing that I am under very considerable apprehension from their machinations Though they cannot slur our fair fame it is quite possible they may very seriously affect our property mister Larkin is in possession of all the family papers I don t like it but it is too late now The estates have been back and forward so often between the Brandons and Wylders I always fancy there may be a screw loose or a frangible link somewhere and he s deeply interested for Mark Wylder You are better darling I think you are better he said looking in her face after a little pause Yes dear Stanley much better but why should you suppose any plot against our title Mark Wylder is in constant correspondence with that fellow Larkin I wish we were quietly rid of him he is such an unscrupulous dog I assure you I doubt very much if the deeds are safe in his possession at all events he ought to choose between us and Mark Wylder It is monstrous his being solicitor for both The Wylders and Brandons have always been contesting the right to these estates and the same thing may arise again any day But tell me Stanley how do you want to apply money What particular good can it do us in this unpleasant uncertainty Well Dorkie believe me I have a sure instinct in matters of this kind Larkin is plotting treason against us Wylder is inciting him and will reap the benefit of it Larkin hesitates to strike but that won t last long In the meantime he has made a distinct offer to buy Five Oaks His doing so places him in the same interest with us and although he does not offer its full value still I should sleep sounder if it were concluded and the fact is I don t think we are safe until that sale is concluded Dorcas looked for a moment earnestly in his face and then down in thought Now Dorkie I have told you all Who is to advise you if not your husband Trust my sure conviction and promise me Dorcas that you will not hesitate to join me in averting by a sacrifice we shall hardly feel a really stupendous blow He kissed her hand and then her lips and he said You will Dorkie I know you will Give me your promise Stanley tell me once more are you really quite frank when you tell me that you apprehend no personal injury from these people apart I mean from the possibility of mister Larkin s conspiring to impeach our rights in favour of mister Wylder Personal injury None in life my darling And there is really no secret nothing tell your wife nothing you fear coming to light I swear again nothing Won t you believe me darling Then if it be so Stanley I think we should hesitate long before selling any part of the estate upon a mere conjecture of danger You or I may over estimate that danger being so nearly affected by it We must take advice and first we must consult Chelford Remember Stanley how long the estate has been preserved Whatever may have been their crimes and follies those who have gone before us never impaired the Brandon estate and without full consideration without urgent cause I Stanley will not begin Why it is only Five Oaks and we shall have the money you forget said Stanley Five Oaks is an estate in itself and the idea of dismembering the Brandon inheritance seems to me like taking a plank from a ship all will go down when that is done But you can t dismember it it is only a life estate Well perhaps so but Chelford told me that one of the London people said he thought Five Oaks belonged to me absolutely In that case the inheritance is dismembered already I will have no share in selling the old estate or any part of it to strangers Stanley except in a case of necessity and we must do nothing precipitately and I must insist Stanley on consulting Chelford before taking any step He will view the question more calmly than you or I can and we owe him that respect Stanley he has been so very kind to us Chelford is the very last man whom I would think of consulting answered Stanley with his malign and peevish look And why asked Dorcas Because he is quite sure to advise against it answered Stanley sharply He is one of those Quixotic fellows who get on very well in fair weather while living with a duke or duchess but are sure to run you into mischief when they come to the inns and highways of common life I know perfectly he would protest against a compromise Discharge Larkin fight him and see us valiantly stript of our property by some cursed law quibble and think we ought to be much more comfortable so than in this house on the terms of a compromise with a traitor like Larkin But I don t think so nor any man of sense nor anyone but a hairbrained conceited knight errant I think Chelford one of the most sensible as well as honourable men I know and I will take no step in selling a part of our estate to that odious mister Larkin without consulting him and at least hearing what he thinks of it Stanley s eyes were cast down and he was nipping the struggling hairs of his light moustache between his lips but he made no answer Only suddenly he looked up and said quietly Very well Good bye for a little Dorkie and he leaned over her and kissed her cheek and then passed into the hall where he took his hat and cane Larcom presented him with a note in a sealed envelope As he took it from the salver he recognised Larkin s very clear and large hand I suspect that grave mister Larcom had been making his observations and conjectures thereupon The captain took it with a little nod and a peevish side glance It said MY DEAR CAPTAIN BRANDON LAKE Imperative business calls me to London by the early train to morrow Will you therefore favour me if convenient by the bearer with the small note of consent which must accompany the articles agreeing to sell I remain c c c Larkin s groom was waiting for an answer Tell him I shall probably see mister Larkin myself said the captain snappishly and so he walked down to pretty little Gylingden On the steps of the reading room stood old Tom Ruddle who acted as marker in the billiard room treasurer and book keeper beside and swept out the premises every morning and went to and fro at the proper hours between that literary and sporting institution and the post office and who though seldom sober was always well instructed in the news of the town How do you do old Ruddle quite well asked the captain with a smile Who have you got in the rooms Well Jos Larkin was not there Indeed he seldom showed in those premises which he considered decidedly low dropping in only now and then like the great county gentlemen on sessions days to glance at the papers and gossip on their own high affairs But Ruddle had seen mister Jos Larkin on the green not five minutes since and thither the gallant captain bent his steps CHAPTER LXIII THE ACE OF HEARTS So you are going to London to morrow is not it said Captain Lake when on the green of Gylingden where visitors were promenading and the militia bands playing lusty polkas he met mister Jos Larkin in lavender trousers and kid gloves new hat metropolitan black frock coat and shining French boots the most elegant as well as the most Christian of provincial attorneys Ah yes I think should my engagements permit of starting early to morrow The fact is Captain Lake our poor friend the vicar you know the reverend William Wylder has pressing occasion for some money and I can t leave him absolutely in the hands of Burlington and Smith No of course quite so said Lake with that sly smile which made every fellow on whom it lighted somehow fancy that the captain had divined his secret Very honest fellows with good looking after eh The attorney laughed a little awkwardly with his pretty pink blush over his long face Well I m far from saying that but it is their business you know to take care of their client and it would not do to give them the handling of mine Can I do anything Captain Lake for you while in town Nothing on earth thank you very much But I am thinking of doing something for you You ve interested yourself a great deal about Mark Wylder s movements Not more than my duty clearly imposed Yes but notwithstanding it will operate I m afraid as you will presently see rather to his prejudice For to prevent your conjectural interference from doing him a more serious mischief I will now and here if you please divulge the true and only cause of his absconding It is fair to mention however that your knowing it will make you fully as odious to him as I am and that I assure you is very odious indeed There were four witnesses beside myself Lieutenant Colonel Jermyn Sir James Carter Lord George Vanbrugh and Ned Clinton Witnesses Captain Lake Do you allude to a legal matter enquired Larkin with his look of insinuating concern and enquiry Quite the contrary a very lawless matter indeed These four gentlemen beside myself were present at the occurrence But perhaps you ve heard of it said the captain though that s not likely Not that I recollect Captain Lake answered Jos Larkin Well it is not a thing you d forget easily and indeed it was a very well kept secret as well as an ugly one and Lake smiled in his sly quizzical way And where Captain Lake did it occur may I enquire said Larkin with his charming insinuation You may and you shall hear in fact I ll tell you the whole thing It was at Gray s Club in Pall Mall The whist party were old Jermyn Carter Vanbrugh and Wylder Clinton and I were at piquet and were disturbed by a precious row the old boys kicked up Jermyn and Carter were charging Mark Wylder in so many words with not playing fairly there was an ace of hearts on the table played by him and before three minutes they brought it home and in fact it was quite clear that poor dear Mark had helped himself to it in quite an irregular way Oh dear Captain Lake oh dear how shocking how inexpressibly shocking Is not it melancholy said Larkin in his finest and most pathetic horror Yes but don t cry till I ve done said Lake tranquilly Mark tried to bully but the cool old heads were too much for him and he threw himself at last entirely on our mercy and very abject he became poor thing How well the mountains look I am afraid we shall have rain to morrow Larkin uttered a short groan So they sent him into the small card room next that we were playing in I think we were about the last in the club it was past three o clock and so the old boys deliberated on their sentence To bring the matter before the committee were utter ruin to Mark and they let him off on these conditions he was to retire forthwith from the club he was never to play any game of cards again and lastly he was never more to address any one of the gentlemen who were present at his detection Poor dear devil how he did jump at the conditions and provided they were each and all strictly observed it was intimated that the occurrence should be kept secret Well you know that was letting poor old Mark off in a coach and I do assure you though we had never liked one another I really was very glad they did not move his expulsion which would have involved his quitting the service and I positively don t know how he could have lived if that had occurred I do solemnly assure you Captain Lake what you have told me has beyond expression amazed and I will say horrified me said the attorney with a slow and melancholy vehemence Better men might have suspected something of it I do solemnly pledge my honour that nothing of the kind so much as crossed my mind not naturally suspicious I believe but all the more shocked Captain Lake on that account He was poor then you see and a few pounds were everything to him and the temptation immense but clumsy fellows ought not to try that sort of thing There s the highway Mark would have made a capital garrotter The attorney groaned and turned up his eyes The band was playing Pop goes the weasel and old Jackson very well dressed and buckled up with a splendid smile upon his waggish military countenance cried as he passed with a wave of his hand How do Lake how do mister Larkin beautiful day I ve no wish to injure Mark but it is better that you should know at once than go about poking everywhere for information I do assure you And having really no wish to hurt him pursued the captain and also making it as I do a point that you shall repeat this conversation as little as possible I don t choose to appear singular as your sole informant and I ve given you here a line to Sir James Carter he s member you know for Huddlesbury I mention that Mark having broken his promise and played for heavy stakes too both on board his ship and at Plymouth and Naples which I happen to know and also by accosting me whom as one of the gentlemen agreeing to impose these conditions he was never to address I felt myself at liberty to mention it to you holding the relation you do to me as well as to him in consequence of the desirableness of placing you in possession of the true cause of his absconding which was simply my telling him that I would not permit him slurred as he was to marry a lady who was totally ignorant of his actual position and in fact that unless he withdrew I must acquaint the young lady s guardian of the circumstances There was quite enough probability in this story to warrant Jos Larkin in turning up his eyes and groaning But in the intervals his shrewd eyes searched the face of the captain not knowing whether to believe one syllable of what he related I may as well mention here that the attorney did present the note to Sir J Carter with which Captain Lake had furnished him indeed he never lost an opportunity of making the acquaintance of a person of rank and that the worthy baronet so appealed to and being a blunt sort of fellow and an old acquaintance of Stanley s did in a short and testy sort of way corroborate Captain Lake s story having previously conditioned that he was not to be referred to as the authority from whom mister Larkin had learned it The attorney and Captain Brandon Lake were now walking side by side over the more sequestered part of the green And so said the captain coming to a stand still I ll bid you good bye Larkin what stay I forgot to ask do you make in town Only a day or two You ll not wait for the division on Trawler s motion Oh dear no I calculate I ll be here again certainly in three days time And I suppose Captain Lake you received my note You mean just now Oh yes of course it is all right but one day is as good as another and you have got my agreement signed Pardon me Captain Brandon Lake the fact is one day in this case does not answer as well as another for I must have drafts of the deeds prepared by my conveyancer in town and the note is indispensable Perhaps if there is any difficulty you will be so good as to say so and I shall then be in a position to consider the case in its new aspect What the devil difficulty can there be Sir I can t see it any more than what hurry can possibly exist about it said Lake stung with a momentary fury It seemed as though everyone was conspiring to perplex and torment him and he like the poor vicar though for very different reasons had grown intensely anxious to sell He had grown to dread the attorney since the arrival of Dutton s letter He suspected that his journey to London had for its object a meeting with that person He could not tell what might be going on in the dark But the possibility of such a conjunction might well dismay him On the other hand the more mister Larkin relied upon the truth of Dutton s letter the cooler he became respecting the purchase of Five Oaks It was of course a very good thing but not his first object The vicar s reversion in that case was everything and of it he was now sure There is no difficulty about the note Sir it contains but four lines and I ve given you the form No difficulty can exist but in the one quarter and the fact is he added steadily unless I have that note before I leave to morrow morning I ll assume that you wish to be off Captain Lake and I will adapt myself to circumstances You may have it now said the captain with a fierce carelessness D d nonsense Who could have fancied any such stupid hurry Send in the morning and you shall have it And the captain rather savagely turned away skirting the crowd who hovered about the band in his leisurely and now solitary ramble The captain was sullen that evening at home He was very uncomfortable His heart was failing him for the things that were coming to pass One of his maniacal tempers which had often before thrown him as it were off the rails was at the bottom of his immediate troubles This proneness to sudden accesses of violence and fury was the compensation which abated the effect of his ordinary craft and self command He had done all he could to obviate the consequences of his folly in this case He hoped the attorney might not succeed in discovering Jim Dutton s whereabouts At all events he had been beforehand and taken measures to quiet that person s dangerous resentment But it was momentous in the critical state of things to give this dangerous attorney a handsome share in his stake to place him as he had himself said in the same boat and enlist all his unscrupulous astuteness in maintaining his title and if he went to London disappointed and that things turned out unluckily about Dutton it might be a very awful business indeed Dinner had been a very dull tete a tete Dorcas sat stately and sad looking from the window toward the distant sunset horizon piled in dusky gold and crimson clouds against the faded green sky a glory that is always melancholy and dreamy Stanley sipped his claret his eyes upon the cloth He raised them and looked out too and the ruddy light tinted his pale features A gleam of good humour seemed to come with it and he said I was just thinking Dorkie that for you and me alone these great rooms are a little dreary Suppose we have tea in the tapestry room The Dutch room Stanley I think so I should like it very well So I am certain would Rachel I ve written to her to come I hope she will I expect her at nine The brougham will be with her She wrote such an odd note to day addressed to you but I opened it Here it is She did not watch his countenance or look in his direction as he read it She addressed herself on the contrary altogether to her Liliputian white lap dog Snow and played with his silken ears and chatted with him as ladies will A sealed envelope broken That scoundrel Larcom knew perfectly it was meant for me He was on the point of speaking his mind which would hardly have been pleasant to hear upon this piece of detective impertinence of his wife s He could have smashed all the glass upon the table But he looked serene and leaned back with the corner of Rachel s note between two fingers It was a case in which he clearly saw he must command himself CHAPTER LXIV IN THE DUTCH ROOM His heart misgave him He felt that a crisis was coming and he read I cannot tell you my poor brother how miserable I am I have just learned that a very dangerous person has discovered more about that dreadful evening than we believed known to anybody in Gylingden I am subjected to the most agonising suspicions and insults Would to Heaven I were dead But living I cannot endure my present state of mind longer To morrow morning I will see Dorcas poor Dorcas and tell her all I am weary of urging you in vain to do so It would have been much better But although after that interview I shall perhaps never see her more I shall yet be happier and I think relieved from suspense and the torments of mystery So will she At all events it is her right to know all and she shall YOUR OUTCAST AND MISERABLE SISTER On Stanley s lips his serene unpleasant smile was gleaming as he closed the note carelessly He intended to speak but his voice caught He cleared it and sipped a little claret For a clever girl she certainly does write the most wonderful rubbish Such an effusion And she sends it tossing about from hand to hand among the servants I ve anticipated her however Dorkie And he took her hand and kissed it She does not know I ve told you all myself Stanley went to the library and Dorcas to the conservatory neither very happy each haunted by an evil augury and a sense of coming danger The deepening shadow warned Dorcas that it was time to repair to the Dutch room where she found lights and tea prepared In a few minutes more the library door opened and Stanley Lake peeped in Radie not come yet said he entering We certainly are much pleasanter in this room Dorkie more in proportion than we two should have been in the drawing room He seated himself beside her drawing his chair very close to hers and taking her hand in his He was more affectionate this evening than usual What did it portend she thought She had already begun to acquiesce in Rachel s estimate of Stanley and to fancy that whatever he did it was with an unacknowledged purpose Does little Dorkie love me said Lake in a sweet undertone There was reproach but love too in the deep soft glance she threw upon him You must promise me not to be frightened at what I am going to tell you said Lake She heard him with sudden panic and a sense of cold stole over her He looked like a ghost quite white smiling She knew something was coming the secret she had invoked so long and she was appalled Don t be frightened darling It is necessary to tell you but it is really not much when you hear me out You ll say so when you have quite heard me So you won t be frightened She was gazing straight into his wild yellow eyes fascinated with a look of expecting terror You are nervous darling he continued laying his hand on hers Shall we put it off for a little You are frightened Not much frightened Stanley she whispered Well we had better wait I see Dorcas you are frightened and nervous Don t keep looking at me look at something else can t you You make yourself nervous that way I promise upon my honour I ll not say a word about it till you bid me I know Stanley I know Then why won t you look down or look up or look any way you please only don t stare at me so Yes oh yes and she shut her eyes I m sorry I began he said pettishly You ll make a fuss You ve made yourself quite nervous and I ll wait a little Oh no Stanley now for Heaven s sake now I was only a little startled but I am quite well again Is it anything about marriage Oh Stanley in mercy tell me was there any other engagement Nothing darling nothing on earth of the sort and he spoke with an icy little laugh Your poor soldier is altogether yours Dorkie and he kissed her cheek Thank God for that said Dorcas hardly above her breath What I have to say is quite different and really nothing that need affect you but Rachel has made such a row about it Fifty fellows I know are in much worse fixes and though it is not of so much consequence still I think I should not have told you only without knowing it you were thwarting me and helping to get me into a serious difficulty by your obstinacy or what you will about Five Oaks Somehow trifling as the matter was Stanley seemed to grow more and more unwilling to disclose it and rather shrank from it now Now Dorcas mind there must be no trifling You must not treat me as Rachel has If you can t keep a secret for it is a secret say so Shall I tell you Yes Stanley yes I m your wife Well Dorcas I told you something of it but only a part and some circumstances I did intentionally colour a little but I could not help it unless I had told everything and no matter what you or Rachel may say it was kinder to withhold it as long as I could He glanced at the door and spoke in a lower tone And so with his eyes lowered to the table at which he sat glancing ever and anon sideways at the door and tracing little figures with the tip of his finger upon the shining rosewood he went on murmuring his strange and hateful story in the ear of his wife It was not until he had spoken some three or four minutes that Dorcas suddenly uttered a wild scream and started to her feet And Stanley also rose precipitately and caught her in his arms for she was falling As he supported her in her chair the library door opened and the sinister face of Uncle Lorne looked in and returned the captain s stare with one just as fixed and horrified Hush whispered Uncle Lorne and he limped softly into the room and stopped about three yards away she is not dead but sleepeth Hallo Larcom shouted Lake I tell you she s dreaming the same dream that I dreamt in the middle of the night Hallo Larcom Mark s on leave to night in uniform his face is flattened against the window This is his lady you know Hallo D you are you there shouted the captain very angry I saw Mark following you like an ape on all fours such nice white teeth grinning at your heels But he can t bite yet ha ha ha Poor Mark Will you be so good Sir as to touch the bell said Lake changing his tone He was afraid to remove his arm from Dorcas and he was splashing water from a glass upon her face and forehead No no No bell yet time enough ding dong You say dead and gone Captain Lake cursed him and his absent keeper between his teeth still in a rather flurried way prosecuting his conjugal attentions There was no bell for poor Mark and he s always listening and stares so A cat may look you know Can t you touch the bell Sir What are you standing there for snarled Lake with a glare at the old man He looked as if he could have murdered him Standing between the living and the dead Here Reuben here where the devil have you been take him away He has terrified her By he ought to be shot The keeper silently slid his arm into Uncle Lorne s and unresisting the old man talking to himself the while drew him from the room Larcom about to announce Miss Lake and closely followed by that young lady passed the grim old phantom on the lobby Be quick you are wanted there said the attendant as he passed Dorcas pale as marble sighing deeply again and again her rich black hair drenched in water which trickled over her cheeks like the tears and moisture of agony was recovering There was water spilt on the table and the fragments of a broken glass upon the floor The moment Rachel saw her she divined what had happened and gliding over she placed her arm round her You re better darling Open the window Stanley Send her maid Aye send her maid cried Captain Lake to Larcom This is your d d work A nice mess you have made of it among you Are you better Dorcas said Rachel Yes much better I m glad darling I understand you now Radie kiss me Next morning before early family prayers while mister Jos Larkin was locking the despatch box which was to accompany him to London mister Larcom arrived at the Lodge He had a note for mister Larkin s hand which he must himself deliver and so he was shown into that gentleman s official cabinet and received with the usual lofty kindness Well mister Larcom pray sit down And can I do anything for you mister Larcom said the good attorney waving his long hand toward a vacant chair A note Sir Oh yes very well And the tall attorney rose and facing the rural prospect at his window with his back to mister Larcom he read with a faint smile the few lines in a delicate hand consenting to the sale of Five Oaks He had to look for a time at the distant prospect to allow his smile to subside and to permit the conscious triumph which he knew beamed through his features to discharge itself and evaporate in the light and air before turning to mister Larcom which he did with an air of sudden recollection Ah all right I was forgetting I must give you a line So he did and hid away the note in his despatch box and said The family all quite well I hope whereat Larcom shook his head My mistress he always called her so and Lake the capting has been takin on hoffle last night whatever come betwixt em She was fainted outright in her chair in the Dutch room and he said it was the old gentleman Old Flannels we calls him for shortness but lor bless you she s too used to him to be frightened and that s only a make belief and Miss Dipples her maid she says as how she was worse up stairs and she s made up again with Miss Lake which she was very glad no doubt of the making friends I do suppose but it s a bin a bad row and I suspeck amost he s used vilins Compulsion I suppose you mean constraint suggested Larkin very curious Well that may be Sir but I amost suspeck she s been hurted somehow She got them crying fits up stairs you know and the capting he s hoffle bad tempered this morning and he never looked near her once after his sister came and he left them together talking and crying and he locked hisself into the library like one as knowed he d done something to be ashamed on half the night It s not happy Larcom I m much afraid it s not happy and the attorney rose shaking his tall bald head and his hands in his pockets and looked down in meditation In the Dutch room after tea I suppose said the attorney Before tea Sir just as Miss Lake harrived in the brougham And so on But there was no more to be learned and mister Larcom returned and attended the captain very reverentially at his solitary breakfast mister Jos Larkin was away for London And a very serene companion he was if not very brilliant Everything was going perfectly smoothly with him A celestial gratitude glowed and expanded within his breast His angling had been prosperous hitherto but just now he had made a miraculous draught and his nets and his heart were bursting Delightful sentiment the gratitude of a righteous man a man who knows that his heart is not set upon the things of the world who has like King Solomon made wisdom his first object and who finds riches added thereto There was no shadow of self reproach to slur the sunny landscape He had made a splendid purchase from Captain Lake it was true He drew his despatch box nearer to him affectionately as he thought on the precious records it contained But who in this wide awake world was better able to take care of himself than the gallant captain If it were not the best thing for the captain surely it would not have been done Whom have I defrauded My hands are clean He had made a still better purchase from the vicar but what would have become of the vicar if he had not been raised up to purchase And was it not speculative and was it not possible that he should lose all that money and was it not on the whole the wisest thing that the vicar under his difficulties could have been advised to do So reasoned the good attorney as with a languid smile and a sigh of content his long hand laid across the cover of the despatch box by his side he looked forth through the plate glass window upon the sunny fields and hedgerows that glided by him and felt the blessed assurance look whatsoever he doeth it shall prosper mingling in the hum of surrounding nature And as his eyes rested on the flying diorama of trees and farmsteads and standing crops and he felt already the pride of a great landed proprietor his long fingers fiddled pleasantly with the rough tooling of his morocco leather box and thinking of the signed articles within it seemed as though an angelic hand had placed them there while he slept so wondrous was it all and he fancied under the red tape a label traced in the neatest scrivenery with a pencil of light containing such gratifying testimonials to his deserts as well done good and faithful servant the saints shall inherit the earth and so following and he sighed again in the delicious luxury of having secured both heaven and mammon And in this happy state and volunteering all manner of courtesies opening and shutting windows lending his railway guide and his newspapers whenever he had an opportunity he at length reached the great London terminus and was rattling over the metropolitan pavement with his hand on his despatch box to his cheap hotel near the Strand CHAPTER LXV I REVISIT BRANDON HALL Rachel Lake was courageous and energetic and when once she had taken a clear view of her duty wonderfully persistent and impracticable Her dreadful interview with Jos Larkin was always in her mind The bleached face so meek so cruel of that shabby spectre in the small low parlour of Redman s Farm was always before her There he had spoken the sentences which made the earth tremble and showed her distinctly the cracking line beneath her feet which would gape at his word into the fathomless chasm that was to swallow her But come what might she would not abandon the vicar and his little boy and good Dolly to the arts of that abominable magician The more she thought the clearer her conviction She had no one to consult with she knew the risk of exasperating that tall man of God who lived at the Lodge But determined to brave all she went down to see Dolly and the vicar at home Poor Dolly was tired she had been sitting up all night with sick little Fairy He was better to day but last night he had frightened them so poor little man he began to rave about eleven o clock and more or less his little mind continued wandering until near six when he fell into a sound sleep and seemed better for it and it was such a blessing there certainly was neither scarlatina nor small pox both which enemies had appeared on the northern frontier of Gylingden and were picking down their two or three cases each in that quarter So Rachel first made her visit to little man sitting up in his bed very pale and thin and looking at her not with his pretty smile but a languid earnest wonder and not speaking How quickly and strikingly sickness tells upon children Little man s frugal store of toys chiefly the gifts of pleasant Rachel wild beasts Noah and his sons and part of a regiment of foot soldiers with the usual return of broken legs and missing arms stood peacefully mingled upon the board across his bed which served as a platform But little man was leaning back his fingers once so busy lay motionless on the coverlet and his tired eyes rested on the toys with a joyless earnest apathy Didn t play with them a minute said the maid I ll bring him a new box I m going into the town won t that be pretty said Rachel parting his golden locks over the young forehead and kissing him and she took his little hand in hers it was hot and dry He looks better a little better don t you think just a little better whispered his mamma looking as all the rest were on that wan sad little face But he really looked worse Well he can t look better you know dear till there s a decided change What does Doctor Buddle say He saw him yesterday morning He thinks it s all from his stomach and he s feverish no meat Indeed he won t eat anything and you see the light hurts his eyes There was only a chink of the shutter open But it is always so when he is ever so little ill my precious little man and I know if he thought it anything the least serious Doctor Buddle would have looked in before now he s so very kind I wish my darling could get a little sleep He s very tired nurse said Rachel Yes m very tired m would he like his precious head lower a bit No very well darling we ll leave it so Dolly darling you and nurse must be so tired sitting up I have a little wine at Redman s Farm I got it you remember more than a year ago when Stanley said he was coming to pay me a visit I never take any and a little would be so good for you and poor nurse I ll send some to you So coming down stairs Rachel said Is the vicar at home Yes he was in the study and there they found him brushing his seedy hat and making ready for his country calls in the neighbourhood of the town The hour was dull without little Fairy but he would soon be up and out again and he would steal up now and see him He could not go out without his little farewell at the bed side and he would bring him in some pretty flowers You ve seen little Fairy asked the good vicar with a very anxious smile and you think him better dear Miss Lake don t you Why I can t say that because you know so soon as he s better he ll be quite well they make their recoveries all in a moment But he does not look worse said the vicar lifting his eyes eagerly from his boot which he was buttoning on the chair Well he does look more tired but that must be till his recovery begins which will be please Heaven immediately Oh yes my little man has had two or three attacks much more serious than this and always shook them off so easily I was reminding Dolly always and good Doctor Buddle assures us it is none of those horrid complaints And so they talked over the case of the little man who with Noah and his sons and the battered soldiers and animals before him was fighting though they only dimly knew it silently in his little bed the great battle of life or death mister Larkin came to me the evening before last said Rachel and told me that the little sum I mentioned now don t say a word till you have heard me was not sufficient so I want to tell you what I have quite resolved on I have been long intending some time or other to change my place of residence perhaps I shall go to Switzerland and I have made up my mind to sell my rent charge on the Dulchester estate It will produce mister Young says a very large sum and I wish to lend it to you either all or as much as will make you quite comfortable you must not refuse I had intended leaving it to my dear little man up stairs and you must promise me solemnly that you will not listen to the advice of that bad cruel man mister Larkin My dear Miss Lake you misunderstood him But what can I say how can I thank you said the vicar clasping her hand A wicked and merciless man I say repeated Miss Lake From my observation of him I am certain of two things I am sure that he has some reason for thinking that your brother Mark Wylder is dead and secondly that he is himself deeply interested in the purchase of your reversion I feel a little ill Dolly open the window There was a silence for a little while and Rachel resumed Now William Wylder I am convinced that you and your wife and she kissed Dolly and your dear little boy are marked out for plunder the objects of a conspiracy and I ll lose my life but I ll prevent it Now maybe Willie upon my word perhaps she s quite right for you know if poor Mark is dead then would not he have the estate now is not that it Miss Lake and and you know that would be dreadful to sell it all for next to nothing is not that what you mean Miss Lake Rachel dear I mean Yes Dolly stripping yourselves of a splendid inheritance and robbing your poor little boy I protest in the name of Heaven against it and you have no excuse now William with my offer before you and Dolly it will be inexcusable wickedness in you if you allow it Now Willie dear do you hear that do you hear what she says But Dolly darling dear Miss Lake there is no reason whatever to suppose that poor Mark is dead said the vicar very pale I tell you again I am convinced the attorney believes it He did not say so indeed but cunning as he is I think I ve quite seen through his plot and even in what he said to me there was something that half betrayed him every moment And Dolly if you allow this sale you deserve the ruin you are inviting and the remorse that will follow you to your grave Do you hear that Willie said Dolly with her hand on his arm But dear it is too late I have signed this this instrument and it is too late I hope God help me I have not done wrong Indeed whatever happens dear Miss Lake may Heaven for ever bless you But respecting good mister Larkin you are indeed in error I am sure you have quite misunderstood him You don t know how kind how disinterestedly good he has been and now my dear Miss Lake it is too late quite too late No it is not too late Such wickedness as that cannot be lawful I won t believe the law allows it cried Rachel Lake It is all a fraud even if you have signed all a fraud You must procure able advice at once Your enemy is that dreadful mister Larkin Write to some good attorney in London I ll pay everything But dear Miss Lake I can t said the vicar dejectedly I am bound in honour and conscience not to disturb it I have written to Messrs Burlington and Smith to that effect I assure you dear Miss Lake we have not acted inconsiderately nothing has been done without careful and deep consideration You must employ an able attorney immediately You have been duped Your little boy must not be ruined But but I do assure you I have so pledged myself by the letter I have mentioned that I could not no it is quite impossible he added as he recollected the strong and pointed terms in which he had pledged his honour and conscience to the London firm to guarantee them against any such disturbance as Miss Lake was urging him to attempt I am going into the town Dolly and so are you said Rachel after a little pause Let us go together And to this Dolly readily assented and the vicar evidently much troubled in mind having run up to the nursery to see his little man the two ladies set out together Rachel saw that she had made an impression upon Dolly and was resolved to carry her point So in earnest terms again she conjured her at least to lay the whole matter before some friend on whom she could rely and Dolly alarmed and eager quite agreed with Rachel that the sale must be stopped and she would do whatever dear Rachel bid her But do you think mister Larkin really supposes that poor Mark is dead I do dear I suspect he knows it And what makes you think that Rachel darling I can t define I ve no proofs to give you One knows things sometimes I perceived it and I think I can t be mistaken and now I ve said all and pray ask me no more upon that point Rachel spoke with a hurried and fierce impatience that rather startled her companion It is wonderful that she showed her state of mind so little There was indeed something feverish and at times even fierce in her looks and words But few would have guessed her agony as she pleaded with the vicar and his wife or the awful sense of impending consequences that closed over her like the shadow of night the moment the excitement of her pleading was over Rachel are you mad Fly fly fly was always sounding in her ears The little street of Gylingden through which they were passing looked strange and dream like And as she listened to missus Crinkle s babble over the counter and chose his toys for poor little Fairy she felt like one trifling on the way to execution But her warnings and entreaties I have said were not quite thrown away for although the vicar was inflexible she had prevailed with his wife who at parting again promised Rachel that if she could do it the sale should be stopped When I returned to Brandon a few mornings later Captain Lake received me joyfully at his solitary breakfast He was in an intense electioneering excitement The evening papers for the day before lay on the breakfast table A move of some sort suspected the opposition prints all hinting at tricks and ambuscades They are whipping their men up awfully Old Wattles not half recovered went by the early train yesterday Wealdon tells me It will probably kill him Stower went up the day before Lee says he saw him at Charteris He never speaks only a vote and a fellow that never appears till the minute Brittle the member for Stoney Muckford was in the next carriage to me yesterday and he s a slow coach too I threw in It does look as if the division was nearer than they pretend Just so I heard from Gybes last evening what a hand that fellow writes only a dozen words Look out for squalls and keep your men in hand I ve sent for Wealdon I wish the morning papers were come I m a quarter past eleven what are you The post s in at Dollington fifty minutes before we get our letters here D d nonsense it s all that heavy bus of Driver s I ll change that They leave London at five and get to Dollington at half past ten and Driver never has them in sooner than twenty minutes past eleven D d humbug I d undertake to take a dog cart over the ground in twenty minutes Is Larkin here I asked Oh no run up to town I m so glad he s away the clumsiest dog in England nothing clever no invention only a bully the people hate him Wealdon s my man I wish he d give up that town clerkship it can t be worth much and it s in his way I d make it up to him somehow Will you just look at that it s the Globe only six lines and tell me what you make of it It does look like it certainly Wealdon and I have jotted down a few names here said Lake sliding a list of names before me you know some of them I think rather a strong committee don t you think so Those fellows with the red cross before have promised Yes it s very strong capital I said crunching my toast Is it thought the writs will follow the dissolution unusually quickly They must unless they want a very late session But it is quite possible the government may win a week ago they reckoned upon eleven And as we were talking the post arrived Here they are cried Lake and grasping the first morning paper he could seize on he tore it open with a greater display of energy than I had seen that languid gentleman exhibit on any former occasion CHAPTER LXVI LADY MACBETH Here it is said the captain Beaten then came an oath three votes how the devil was that there it is by Jove no mistake majority against ministers three Is that the Times What does it say A long leader no resignation immediate dissolution That is what I collect from it How on earth could they have miscalculated so Swivell I see voted in the majority that s very odd and by Jove there s Surplice too and he s good for seven votes Why his own paper was backing the ministers What a fellow that is That accounts for it all A difference of fourteen votes And thus we went on discussing this unexpected turn of luck and reading to one another snatches of the leading articles in different interests upon the subject Then Lake recollecting his letters opened a large sealed envelope with S C G in the corner This is from Gybes let us see Oh before the division It looks a little fishy he says well so it does We may take the division to night Should it prove adverse you are to expect an immediate dissolution this on the best authority I write to mention this as I may be too much hurried to morrow We were discussing this note when Wealdon arrived Well captain great news Sir The best thing I take it could have happened ministers ha ha ha A rotten house down with it blow it up three votes only but as good as three hundred for the purpose of the three hundred grant but three you know of course they don t think of resigning Oh dear no an immediate dissolution Read that said Lake tossing Gybes note to him Ho then we ll have the writs down hot and heavy We must be sharp The sheriff s all right that s a point You must not lose an hour in getting your committee together and printing your address Who s on the other side You ll have Jennings of course but they are talking of four different men already to take Sir Harry Twisden s place He ll resign that s past a doubt now He has his retiring address written Lord Edward Mordun read it and he told FitzStephen on Sunday after church that he d never sit again Here by Jove is a letter from Mowbray said Lake opening it All about his brother George Hears I m up for the county Lord George ready to join and go halves What shall I say Could not have a better man Tell him you desire no better and will bring it at once before your committee and let him know the moment they meet and tell him I say he knows Wealdon pretty well he may look on it as settled That will be a spoke in Sir Harry s wheel Sir Harry who said Lake Bracton I think it s only to spoil your game you see answered Wealdon Abundance of malice but I don t think he s countenanced He ll try to get the start of you and if he does one or other must go to the wall for Lord George is too strong to be shook out Do you get forward at once that s your plan captain Then the captain recurred to his letters which were a larger pack than usual this morning chatting all the time with Wealdon and me on the tremendous topic and tossing aside every letter that did not bear on the coming struggle Who can this be said Lake looking at the address of one of these Very like my hand and he examined the seal It was only a large wafer stamp so he broke it open and drew out a shabby very ill written scroll He turned suddenly away talking the while but with his eyes upon the note and then he folded or rather crumpled it up and stuffed it into his pocket and continued his talk but it was now plain to me there was something more on his mind and he was thinking of the shabby letter he had just received But no matter the election was the pressing topic and Lake was soon engaged in it again There was now a grand coup under discussion the forestalling of all the horses and vehicles along the line of railway and in all the principal posting establishments throughout the county They ll want to keep it open for a bid from the other side It is a heavy item any way and if you want to engage them now you ll have to give double what they got last time But Lake was not to be daunted He wanted the seat and would stick at nothing to secure it and so Wealdon got instructions in his own phrase to go the whole animal As I could be of no possible use in local details I left the council of war sitting intending a stroll in the grounds In the hall I met the mistress of the house looking very handsome but with a certain witch like beauty very pale something a little haggard in her great dark eyes and a strange listening look Was it watchfulness was it suspicion She was dressed gravely but richly and received me kindly and strange to say with a smile that yet was not joyful I hope she is happy Lake is such a beast I hope he does not bully her In truth there were in her exquisite features the traces of that mysterious misery and fear which seemed to fall wherever Stanley Lake s ill omened confidences were given I walked down one of the long alleys with tall close hedges of beech as impenetrable as cloister walls to sight and watched the tench basking and flickering in the clear pond and the dazzling swans sailing majestically along What a strange passion is ambition I thought Is it really the passion of great minds or of little Here is Lake with a noble old place inexhaustible in variety with a beautiful and I was by this time satisfied a very singular and interesting woman for his wife who must have married him for love pure and simple a handsome fortune the power to bring his friends those whom he liked or who amused him about him and to indulge luxuriously every reasonable fancy willing to forsake all and follow the beck of that phantom Had he knowledge public talents training Nothing of the sort Had he patriotism any one noble motive or fine instinct to prompt him to public life The mere suggestion was a sneer It seemed to me simply that Stanley Lake was a lively amusing and even intelligent man without any internal resource vacant peevish with an unmeaning passion for corruption and intrigue and the sort of egotism which craves distinction So I supposed Yet with all its weakness there was a dangerous force in the character which on the whole inspired an odd mixture of fear and contempt I was bitten however already by the interest of the coming contest It is very hard to escape that subtle and intoxicating poison I wondered what figure Stanley would make as a hustings orator and what impression in his canvass The latter I was pretty confident about Altogether curiosity if no deeper sentiment was highly piqued and I was glad I happened to drop in at the moment of action and wished to see the play out At the door of her boudoir Rachel Lake met Dorcas I am so glad Radie dear you are come You must take off your things and stay You must not leave me to night We ll send home for whatever you want and you won t leave me Radie I m certain I ll stay dear as you wish it said Rachel kissing her Did you see Stanley I have not seen him to day said Dorcas No dear I peeped into the library but he was not there and there are two men writing in the Dutch room very busily It must be about the election What election dear asked Rachel There is going to be an election for the county and only think he intends coming forward I sometimes think he is mad Radie I could not have supposed such a thing If I were he I think I should fly to the antipodes I should change my name sear my features with vitriol and learn another language I should obliterate my past self altogether but men are so different so audacious some men at least and Stanley ever since his ill omened arrival at Redman s Farm last autumn has amazed and terrified me I think Radie we have both courage you have certainly you have shown it darling and you must cease to blame yourself I think you a heroine Radie but you know I see with the wild eyes of the Brandons I am grateful Dorcas that you don t hate me Most women I am sure would abhor me yes Dorcas abhor me You and I against the world Radie said Dorcas with a wild smile and a dark admiration in her look and kissing Rachel again I used to think myself brave it belongs to women of our blood but this is no common strain upon courage Radie I ve grown to fear Stanley somehow like a ghost I fear it is even worse than he says and she looked with a horrible enquiry into Rachel s eyes So do I Dorcas said Rachel in a firm low whisper returning her look as darkly What s done cannot be undone said Rachel sadly after a little pause unconsciously quoting from a terrible soliloquy of Shakespeare I know what you mean Radie and you warned me with a strange second sight before the evil was known to either of us It was an irrevocable step and I took it not seeing all that has happened it is true but forewarned And this I will say Radie if I had known the worst I think even that would not have deterred me It was madness it is madness for I love him still Rachel though I know him and his wickedness and am filled with horror I love him desperately I am very glad said Rachel that you do know everything It is so great a relief to have companionship I often thought I must go mad in my solitude Poor Rachel I think you wonderful I think you a heroine I do Radie you and I are made for one another the same blood something of the same wild nature I can admire you and understand you and will always love you I ve been with William Wylder and Dolly That wicked attorney mister Larkin is resolved on robbing them I wish they had anyone able to advise them Stanley I am sure could save them but he does not choose to do it He was always so angry when I urged him to help them that I knew it would be useless asking him I don t think he knows what mister Larkin has been doing but Dorcas I am afraid the very same thought has been in his mind I hope not Radie and Dorcas sighed deeply Everything is so wonderful and awful in the light that has come That morning poor William Wylder had received a letter from Jos Larkin esquire mentioning that he had found Messrs Burlington and Smith anything but satisfied with him the vicar What exactly he had done to disoblige them he could not bring to mind But Jos Larkin told him that he had done all in his power to satisfy them of the bona fide character of his reverend client s dealings from the first But they still express themselves dissatisfied upon the point and appear to suspect a disposition to shilly shally I have said all I could to disabuse them of the unpleasant prejudice but I think I should hardly be doing my duty if I were not to warn you that you will do wisely to exhibit no hesitation in the arrangements by which your agreement is to be carried out and that in the event of your showing the slightest disposition to qualify the spirit of your strong note to them or in anywise disappointing their client you must be prepared from what I know of the firm for very sharp practice indeed What could they do to him or why should they hurt him or what had he done to excite either the suspicion or the temper of the firm They expected their client the purchaser in a day or two He was already grumbling at the price and certainly would stand no trifling Neither would Messrs Burlington and Smith who he must admit had gone to very great expense in investigating title preparing deeds c and who were noted as a very expensive house He was aware that they were in a position to issue an execution on the guarantee for the entire amount of their costs but he thought so extreme a measure would hardly be contemplated notwithstanding their threats unless the purchaser were to withdraw or the vendor to exhibit symptoms of he would not repeat their phrase irresolution in his dealing He had however placed the vicar s letter in their hands and had accompanied it with his own testimony to the honour and character of the reverend William Wylder which he was happy to say seemed to have considerable weight with Messrs Burlington and Smith There was also this passage Feeling acutely the anxiety into which the withdrawal of the purchaser must throw you though I trust nothing of that sort may occur I told them that rather than have you thrown upon your beam ends by such an occurrence I would myself step in and purchase on the terms agreed on This will I trust quiet them on the subject of their costs and also prevent any low dodging on the part of the purchaser This letter would almost seem to have been written with a supernatural knowledge of what was passing in Gylingden and was certainly well contrived to prevent the vicar from wavering But all this time the ladies are conversing in Dorcas s boudoir This election frightens me Radie everything frightens me now but this is so audacious If there be powers either in heaven or hell it seems like a defiance and an invocation I am glad you are here Radie I have grown so nervous so superstitious I believe watching always for signs and omens Oh darling the world s ghastly for me now I wish Dorcas we were away as you used to say in some wild and solitary retreat living together two recluses but all that is visionary quite visionary now Dorcas sighed You know Rachel the world must not see this we will carry our heads high Wicked men and brave and suffering women that is the history of our family and men and women always quite unlike the rest of the world unlike the human race and somehow they interest me unspeakably I wish I knew more about those proud forlorn beauties whose portraits are fading on the walls Their spirit I am sure is in us Rachel and their pictures and traditions have always supported me When I was a little thing I used to look at them with a feeling of melancholy and mystery They were in my eyes reserved prophetesses who could speak if they would of my own future A poor support Dorcas a broken reed I wish we could find another the true one in the present and in the coming time Dorcas smiled faintly and I think there was a little gleam of a ghastly satire in it I am afraid that part of her education which deals with futurity had been neglected I am more likely to turn into a Lady Macbeth than a devote said she coldly with the same painful smile I found myself last night sitting up in my bed talking in the dark about it There was a silence for a time and Rachel said It is growing late Dorcas But you must not go Rachel you must stay and keep me company you must indeed Radie said Dorcas So I will she answered but I must send a line to old Tamar and I promised Dolly to go down to her to night if that darling little boy should be worse I am very unhappy about him And is he in danger the handsome little fellow said Dorcas Very great danger I fear said Rachel Doctor Buddle has been very kind but he is I am afraid more desponding than poor William or Dolly imagines Heaven help them But children recover wonderfully What is his ailment Gastric fever the doctor says I had a foreboding of evil the moment I saw him before the poor little man was put to his bed Dorcas rang the bell Now Radie if you wish to write sit down here or if you prefer a message Thomas can take one very accurately and he shall call at the vicar s and see Dolly and bring us word how the dear little boy is And don t fancy darling I have forgotten what you said to me about duty though I would call it differently only I feel so wild I can think of nothing clearly yet But I am making up my mind to a great and bold step and when I am better able I will talk it over with you my only friend Rachel And she kissed her CHAPTER LXVII mister LARKIN IS VIS A VIS WITH A CONCEALED COMPANION The time had now arrived when our friend Jos Larkin was to refresh the village of Gylingden with his presence He had pushed matters forward with wonderful despatch The deeds with their blue and silver stamps were handsomely engrossed having been approved in draft by Crompton S Kewes the eminent Queen s Counsel on a case furnished by Jos Larkin esquire The Lodge Brandon Manor Gylingden on behalf of his client the Reverend William Wylder and in like manner on behalf of Stanley Williams Brandon Lake of Brandon Hall in the county of esquire In neither draft did Jos Larkin figure as the purchaser by name He did not care for advice on any difficulty depending on his special relations to the vendors in both these cases He wished as was his custom everything above board and such an opinion as might be published by either client in the Times next day if he pleased it Besides these matters of Wylder and of Lake he had also a clause to insert in a private Act on behalf of the trustees of the Baptist Chapel at Naunton Friars a short deed to be consulted upon on behalf of his client Pudder Swynfen esquire of Swynfen Grange in the same county and a deed to be executed at Shillingsworth which he would take en route for Gylingden stopping there for that night and going on by next morning s train Those little trips to town paid very fairly In this particular case his entire expenses reached exactly Lfive three s and what do you suppose was the good man s profit upon that small item Precisely Lsixty two seven s The process is simple Jos Larkin made his own handsome estimate of his expenses and the value of his time to and from London and then he charged this in its entirety shall we say integrity to each client separately In this little excursion he was concerned for no less than five His expenses I say reached exactly Lfive three s But he had a right to go to Dondale s if he pleased instead of that cheap hostelry near Covent Garden He had a right to a handsome lunch and a handsome dinner instead of that economical fusion of both meals into one at a cheap eating house in an out of the way quarter He had a right to his pint of high priced wine and to accomplish his wanderings in a cab instead of as the Italians say partly on foot and partly walking Therefore and on this principle mister Jos Larkin had no difficulty in acting His savings if the good man chose to practise self denial were his own and it was a sort of problem while he stayed and interested him curiously keeping down his bill in matters which he would not have dreamed of denying himself at home The only client among his wealthy supporters who ever went in a grudging spirit into one of these little bills of Jos Larkin s was old Sir Mulgrave Bracton the defunct parent of the Sir Harry with whom we are acquainted Don t you think mister Larkin you could perhaps reduce this just a little Ah the expenses Well yes mister Jos Larkin smiled the smile said plainly what would he have me live upon and where We do meet persons of this sort who would fain fill our bellies with the husks that swine digest what of that we must remember who we are gentlemen and answer this sort of shabbiness and every other endurable annoyance as Lord Chesterfield did with a bow and a smile I think so said the baronet in a bluff firm way Well the fact is when I represent a client Sir Mulgrave Bracton of a certain rank and position I make it a principle and as a man of business I find it tells to present myself in a style that is suitably handsome Oh an expensive house where was this now Oh Sir Mulgrave pray don t think of it I m only too happy pray draw your pen across the entire thing I think so said the baronet unexpectedly Don t you think if we said a pound a day and your travelling expenses Certainly any thing what ever you please Sir And the attorney waved his long hand a little and smiled almost compassionately and the little alteration was made and henceforward he spoke of Sir Mulgrave as not quite a pleasant man to deal with in money matters and his confidential friends knew that in a transaction in which he had paid money out of his own pocket for Sir Mulgrave he had never got back more than seven and sixpence in the pound and what made it worse it was a matter connected with the death of poor Lady Bracton And he never lost an opportunity of conveying his opinion of Sir Mulgrave sometimes in distinct and confidential sentences and sometimes only by a sad shake of his head or by awfully declining to speak upon the subject In the present instance Jos Larkin was returning in a heavenly frame of mind to the Lodge Brandon Manor Gylingden Whenever he was away he interpolated Brandon Manor and stuck it on his valise and hat case and liked to call aloud to the porters tumbling among the luggage Jos Larkin Esquire Brandon Manor if you please and to see the people read the inscription in the hall of his dingy hostelry Well might the good man glow with a happy consciousness of a blessing In small things as in great he was prosperous This little excursion to London would cost him as I said exactly Lfive three s It might have cost him Lthirteen ten s and at that sum his expenses figured in his ledger and as he had five clients on this occasion the total reached Lsixty seven ten s leaving a clear profit as I have mentioned of Lsixty two seven s on this item But what was this little tip from fortune compared with the splendid pieces of scrivenery in his despatch box The white parchment the blue and silver stamps in the corner the German text and flourishes at the top and those broad horizontal lines of recital habendum and so forth marshalled like an army in procession behind his march of triumph into Five Oaks to take the place of its deposed prince From the captain s deed to the vicar s his mind glanced fondly He would yet stand the highest man in his county He had found time for a visit to the King at Arms and the Heralds Office He would have his pictures and his pedigree His grandmother had been a Howard Her branch indeed was a little under a cloud keeping a small provision shop in the town of Dwiddleston But this circumstance need not be in prominence She was a Howard that was the fact he relied on no mortal could gainsay it and he would be first J Howard Larkin then Howard Larkin simply then Howard Larkin Howard and the Five Gaks Howards would come to be very great people indeed And the Brandons had intermarried with other Howards and Five Oaks would naturally therefore go to Howards and so he and his with clever management would be anything but novi homines in the county He shall be like a tree planted by the water side that will bring forth his fruit in due season His leaf also shall not wither So thought this good man complacently He liked these fine consolations of the Jewish dispensation actual milk and honey and a land of promise on which he could set his foot Jos Larkin esquire was as punctual as the clock at the terminus He did not come a minute too soon or too late but precisely at the moment which enabled him without fuss and without a tiresome wait to proceed to the details of ticket luggage selection of place and ultimate ascension thereto So now having taken all measures gliding among the portmanteaus hand barrows and porters and the clangorous bell ringing he mounted lithe and lank into his place There was a pleasant evening light still and the gas lamps made a purplish glow against it The little butter cooler of a glass lamp glimmered from the roof mister Larkin established himself and adjusted his rug and mufflers about him for notwithstanding the season there had been some cold rainy weather and the evening was sharp and he set his two newspapers his shilling book and other triumphs of cheap literature in sundry shapes in the vacant seat at his left hand and made everything handsome about him He glanced to the other end of the carriage where sat his solitary fellow passenger This gentleman was simply a mass of cloaks and capes culminating in a queer battered felt hat his shoulders were nestled into the corner and his face buried among his loose mufflers They sat at corners diagonally opposed and were therefore as far apart as was practicable an arrangement not sociable to be sure but on the whole very comfortable and which neither seemed disposed to disturb mister Larkin had a word to say to the porter from the window and bought one more newspaper and then looked out on the lamplit platform and saw the officials loitering off to the clang of the carriage doors then came the whistle and then the clank and jerk of the start And so the brick walls and lamps began to glide backward and the train was off Jos Larkin tried his newspaper and read for ten minutes or so pretty diligently and then looked for a while from the window upon receding hedgerows and farmsteads and the level and spacious landscape and then he leaned back luxuriously his newspaper listlessly on his knees and began to read instead at his ease the shapeless wrapt up figure diagonally opposite The quietude of the gentleman in the far corner was quite singular He produced neither tract nor newspaper nor volume not even a pocket book or a letter He brought forth no cigar case with the stereotyped Have you any objection to my smoking a cigar He did not even change his attitude ever so little A burly roll of cloaks rugs capes and loose wrappers placed in the corner and tanquam cadaver passive and motionless I have sometimes in my travels lighted on a strangely shaped mountain whose huge curves and sombre colouring have interested me indefinably In the rude mass at the far angle mister Jos Larkin I fancy found some such subject of contemplation And the more he looked the more he felt disposed to look As they got on there was more night fog and the little lamp at top shone through a halo The fellow passenger at the opposite angle lay back all cloaks and mufflers with nothing distinct emerging but the felt hat at top and the tip it was only the tip now of the shining shoe on the floor The gentleman was absolutely motionless and silent And mister Larkin though his mind was pretty universally of the inquisitive order began in this particular case to feel a special curiosity It was partly the monotony and their occupying the carriage all to themselves as the two uncommunicative seamen did the Eddystone Lighthouse but there was beside an indistinct feeling that in spite of all these wrappers and swathings he knew the outlines of that figure and yet the likeness must have been of the rudest possible sort He could not say that he recognised anything distinctly only he fancied that some one he knew was sitting there unrevealed inside that mass of clothing And he felt moreover as if he ought to be able to guess who he was CHAPTER LXVIII THE COMPANION DISCLOSES HIMSELF But this sort of musing and wonderment leads to nothing and mister Jos Larkin being an active minded man and practical withal in a little while shook it off and from his breast pocket took a tiny treasure of a pocket book in which were some bank notes precious memoranda in pencil and half a dozen notes and letters bearing upon cases and negotiations on which at this juncture he was working Into these he got and now and then brought out a letter bearing on some point of speculation and read it through and then closed his eyes for three minutes at a time and thought But he had not his tin boxes there and with a man of his stamp speculation which goes upon guess as to dates and quantities which are all ascertainable by reference to black and white soon loses its interest And the evidence in his pocket being pretty soon exhausted he glanced again at his companion over the way He had not moved all this while He had a high stand up collar to the cape he wore which covered his cheeks and nose and outside was loosely swathed a large cream coloured cashmere handkerchief The battered felt hat covered his forehead and eyebrows and left in fact but a narrow streak of separation between Through this however for the first time Jos Larkin now saw the glitter of a pair of eyes gazing at him he fancied At all events there was the glitter and the gentleman was awake Jos returned the gentleman s gaze It was his lofty aristocratic stare and he expected to see the glittering lights that peeped through the dark chink between brim and collar shut up under its rebuke But nothing of the kind took place and the ocular exercises of the attorney were totally ineffectual If the fellow knew that his fixed stare was observed through his narrow embrasure and Larkin thought he could hardly be insensible to the reproof of his return fire he must be a particularly impertinent person It would be ridiculous however to continue a contest of this kind so the attorney lowered the window and looked out Then he pulled it up and took to his newspaper again and read the police cases and a very curious letter from a poor house doctor describing a boy who was quite blind in daylight but could see very fairly by gas or candle light and then he lighted upon a very odd story and said to be undergoing special sifting at the hands of Sir Samuel Squailes of a policeman on a certain beat in Fleet Street not far from Temple Bar who every night saw at or about the same hour a certain suspicious looking figure walk along the flag way and enter a passage Night after night he pursued this figure but always lost it in the same passage On the last occasion however he succeeded in keeping him in view and came up with him in a court when he was rewarded with a sight of such a face as caused him to fall to the ground in a fit This was the Clampcourt ghost and I believe he was left in that debatable state and never after either exploded or confirmed So having ended all these studies the attorney lifted up his eyes again as he lowered his newspaper and beheld the same glittering gaze fixed upon him through the same horizontal cranny He fancied the eyes were laughing He could not be sure of course but at all events the persistent stare was extremely and perhaps determinedly impertinent Forgetting the constitutional canon through which breathes the genuine spirit of British liberty he felt for a moment that he was such a king as that cat had no business to look at and he might perhaps have politely intimated something of the kind had not the enveloped offender made a slight and lazy turn which burying his chin still deeper in his breast altogether concealed his eyes and so closed the offensive scrutiny In making this change in his position slight as it was the gentleman in the superfluous clothing reminded mister Jos Larkin very sharply for an instant of some body There was the rub who could it be The figure was once more a mere mountain of rug What was the peculiarity in that slight movement something in the knee something in the elbow something in the general character Why had he not spoken to him The opportunity for the present was past But he was now sure that his fellow traveller was an acquaintance who had probably recognised him Larkin except when making a mysterious trip at election times or in an emergency in a critical case was a frank and as he believed could be a fascinating compagnon de voyage such and so great was his urbanity on a journey He rather liked talking with people he sometimes heard things not wholly valueless and once or twice had gathered hints in this way which saved him trouble or money which is much the same thing Therefore upon principle he was not averse from that direst of bores railway conversation And now they slackened speed with a long piercing whistle and came to a standstill at East Had don with a jerk upon the last syllable East Had don East Had don as the herald of the station declared and Lawyer Larkin sat straight up very alert with a budding smile ready to blow out into a charming radiance the moment his fellow traveller rose perpendicular as was to be expected and peeped from his window But he seemed to know intuitively that Larkin intended telling him apropos of the station that story of the Haddon property and Sir James Wotton s will which as told by the good attorney and jumbled by the clatter was perhaps a little dreary At all events he did not stir and carefully abstained from wakening and in a few seconds more they were again in motion They were now approaching Shillingsworth where the attorney was to get out and put up for the night having a deed with him to be executed in that town and so sweetening his journey with this small incident of profit Now therefore looking at his watch and consulting his time table he got his slim valise from under on top of the seat before him together with his hat case despatch box stick and umbrella and brushed off with his handkerchief some of the gritty railway dust that lay drifted in exterior folds and hollows of his coat rebuttoned that garment with precision arranged his shirt collar stuffed his muffler into his coat pocket and made generally that rude sacrifice to the graces with which natty men precede their exit from the dust and ashes of this sort of sepulture At this moment he had just eight minutes more to go and the glitter of the pair of eyes staring between the muffler and the rim of the hat met his view once more mister Larkin s cigar case was open in his hand in a moment and with such a smile as a genteel perfumer offers his wares with he presented it toward the gentleman who was built up in the stack of garments He merely shook his head with the slightest imaginable nod and a wave of a pudgy hand in a soiled dog skin glove which emerged for a second from under a cape in token that he gratefully declined the favour mister Larkin smiled and shrugged regretfully and replaced the case in his coat pocket Hardly five minutes remained now Larkin glanced round for a topic My journey is over for the present Sir and perhaps you would find these little things entertaining And he tendered with the same smile Punch the Penny Gleaner and Gray s Magazine a religious serial They were however similarly declined in pantomime He s not particularly polite whoever he is thought mister Larkin with a sniff However he tried the effect of a direct observation So getting one seat nearer he said Wonderful place Shillingsworth Sir one does not really until one has visited it two or three times over at all comprehend its wealth and importance and how justly high it deserves to hold its head amongst the provincial emporia of our productive industry The shapeless traveller in the corner touched his ear with his pudgy dogskin fingers and shook his hand and head a little in token either that he was deaf or the noise such as to prevent his hearing and in the next moment the glittering eyes closed and the pantomimist appeared to be asleep And now again the train subsided to a stand still and Shillingsworth resounded through the night air and Larkin scrambled forward to the window by which sat the enveloped gentleman and called the porter and with many unheeded apologies pulled out his various properties close by the knees of the tranquil traveller So mister Larkin was on the platform and his belongings stowed away against the wall of the station house He made an enquiry of the guard with whom he was acquainted about his companion but the guard knew nothing of the party neither did the porter to whom the guard put a similar question So as Larkin walked down the platform the whistle sounded and the train glided forward and as it passed him the gentleman in the cloak and queer hat was looking out A lamp shone full on him mister Larkin s heart stood still for a moment and then bounded up as if it would choke him It s him by and mister Larkin forgetting syntax and propriety and religion all together and making a frantic race to keep up with the train shouted Stop it stop it hollo stop stop ho stop But he pleaded with the winds and before he had reached the end of the platform the carriage windows were flying by him with the speed of wheel spokes and the end of the coupe with its red lantern sailed away through the cutting Forgot summat Sir said the porter touching his hat Yes signal stop him can you The porter only scratched his head under his cap and smiled sheepishly after the train Jos Larkin knew the next moment he had talked nonsense I I yes I have have you an engine here express I ll pay anything But no there was no engine not nearer than the junction and she might not be spared How far is the junction Nineteen and a half Nineteen miles They ll never bring me there by horse under two hours they are so cursed tedious Why have not you a spare engine at a place like this Shillingsworth Nice management Are you certain Where s the station master All this time he kept staring after the faint pulsations on the air that indicated the flight of the engine But it would not do The train the image upon earth of the irrevocable the irretrievable was gone neither to be overtaken nor recalled The telegraph was not then as now whispering secrets all over England at the rate of two hundred miles a second and five shillings per twenty words Larkin would have given large money for an engine to get up with the train that was now some five miles on its route at treble quadruple the common cost of such a magical appliance but all was vain He could only look and mutter after it wildly Vain to conjecture for what station that traveller in the battered hat was bound Idle speculation Mere distraction Only that mister Larkin was altogether the man he was I think he would have cursed freely CHAPTER LXIX OF A SPECTRE WHOM OLD TAMAR SAW Little Fairy all this while continued in our Church language sick and weak The vicar was very sorry but not afraid His little man was so bright and merry that he seemed to him the very spirit of life He could not dream of his dying It was sad to be sure the little man so many days in his bed too languid to care for toy or story quite silent except when in the night time those weird monologues began which showed that the fever had reached his brain The tones of his pleasant little voice in those sad flights of memory and fancy busy with familiar scenes and occupations sounded wild and plaintive in his ear And when Wapsie was mentioned sometimes the vicar s eyes filled but he smiled through this with a kind of gladness at the child s affection It will soon be over my darling You will be walking with Wapsie in a week again The sun could as soon cease from shining as little Fairy from living The thought he would not allow near him Doctor Buddle had been six miles away that evening with a patient and looked in at the vicar s long after the candles were lighted He was not satisfied with little Fairy not at all satisfied He put his hand under the clothes and felt his thin slender limbs thinner than ever now Dry and very hot they were and little man babbling his nonsense about little boys and his Wapsie and toys and birds and the mill stream and the church yard of which with so strange a fatality children not in romance only but reality so often prattle in their feverish wanderings He felt his pulse He questioned his mamma and cross examined the nurse and looked grave and very much annoyed and then bethought him of something to be tried and having given his directions to the maid he went home in haste and returned in half an hour with the something in a phial a few drops in water and little man sat up leaning on his Wapsie s arm and took it very good his nurse said approvingly and he looked at them all wonderingly for two or three moments and so tired and they laid him down again and then his spoken dreams began once more Doctor Buddle was dark and short in his answers to voluble little missus Wylder though of course quite respectful and the vicar saw him down the narrow stairs and they turned into the study for a moment and said Buddle in an under tone He s very ill I can say nothing else And there was a pause The little colour he had receded from the vicar s face for the looks and tones of good natured Buddle were not to be mistaken He was reading little Fairy s death warrant I see doctor I see you think he ll die said the vicar staring at him Oh doctor my little Fairy The doctor knew something of the poor vicar s troubles of course in a village most things of the kind are known and often in his brisk rough way he thought as with a nod and a word he passed the lank cleric under the trees or across the common with his bright prattling sunny haired little boy by the hand or encountered them telling stories on the stile near the castle meadow what a gleam of sunshine was always dancing about his path in that smiling wayward loving little fellow and now a long Icelandic winter was coming and his path was to know that light no more With children you know I I always say there s a chance but you are right to look the thing in the face and I ll be here the first call in the morning and you know where to find me in the meantime and the doctor shook hands very hard with the vicar at the hall door and made his way homeward the vicar s eyes following him till he was out of sight Then William Wylder shut the hall door and turned about Little Fairy s drum was hanging from a peg on the hat stand the drum that was to sound no more in the garden or up and down the hall with the bright haired little drummer s song There would be no more interruption now the vicar would write his sermons undisturbed no more consolations claimed no more broken toys to be mended some of the innocent little rubbish lay in the study It should never move from that nor his drum nor that little hat and cape hanging on their peg with the tiny boots underneath No more prattling at unseasonable times no more crying no more singing no more laughing all these interruptions were quiet now and altogether gone Little man little Fairy Oh was it possible But memory would call up the vicar from his half written sermon He would miss his troublesome little man when the sun shone out that he used to welcome when the birds hopped on the window stone to find the crumbs that little man used to strew there and when his own little canary Birdie he used to call him would sing and twitter in his cage and the time came to walk out on his lonely visits He must walk alone by the shop doors where the little man was so admired and up the mill road and in the castle meadow and over the stile where they used to sit Poor Dolly Her Willie would not tell her yet He kneeled down in the study Little man s top and some cut paper nondescripts were lying where he had left them at his elbow and he tried to pray and then he remembered that his darling ought to know that he was going into the presence of his Maker Yes he would tell poor Dolly first and then his little man He would repeat his hymn with him and pray and so he went up the nursery stairs Poor Dolly very tired had gone to lie down for a little He would not disturb her no let her enjoy for an hour more her happy illusion When he went into the nursery little Fairy was sitting up taking his medicine the nurse s arm round his thin shoulders He sat down beside him weeping gently his thin face turned a little away and his hand on the coverlet Little man looked wonderingly from his tired eyes on Wapsie and his thin fingers crept on his hand and Wapsie turned about drying his eyes and said Little man my darling He s like himself Sir while he s sitting up his little head quite right again My head s quite right Wapsie the little man whispered sadly Thank God my darling said the vicar The tears were running down his cheeks while he parted little Fairy s golden hair with his fingers When I am quite well again whispered the little man won t you bring me to the castle meadow where the wee river is and we ll float races with daisies and buttercups the way you did on my birthday They say that little mannikin suddenly the vicar stopped They say that little mannikin won t get well And am I always to be sick here in my little bed Wapsie whispered little Fairy in his dreamy earnest way that was new to him No darling not always sick you ll be happier than ever but not here little man will be taken by his Saviour that loves him best of all and he ll be in heaven and only have a short time to wait and maybe his poor Wapsie will come to him please God and his darling mamma and we ll all be happy together for ever and never be sick or sorry any more my treasure my little Fairy my darling And little man looked on him with his tired eyes not quite understanding what it meant nor why Wapsie was crying and the nurse said He d like to be dozin Sir he s so tired please So down the poor little fellow lay his Wapsie praying by his bedside When in a little time poor Dolly returned her Willie took her round the waist as on the day when she accepted him and led her tenderly into the other room and told her all and they hugged and wept together Oh Dolly Dolly Oh Willie darling Oh Willie our precious treasure our only one And so they walked up and down that room his arm round her waist and in that sorrowful embrace murmuring amid their sobs to one another their thoughts and remembrances of little man How soon the treasure grows a retrospect Then Dolly bethought her of her promise to Rachel She made me promise to send for her if he was worse she loved him so everyone loved him they could not help oh Willie our bright darling I think Dolly we could not live here I d like to go on some mission and maybe come back in a great many years maybe Dolly when we are old I d like to see the place again and and the walks but not I think for a long time He was such a darling Perhaps the vicar was thinking of the church yard and how he would like when his time came to lie beside the golden haired little comrade of his walks So Dolly despatched the messenger with a lantern and thus it was there came a knocking at the door of Redman s Farm at that unseasonable hour For some time old Tamar heard the clatter in her sleep disturbing and mingling with her dreams But in a while she wakened quite and heard the double knocks one after another in quick succession and huddling on her clothes and muttering to herself all the way she got into the hall and standing a couple of yards away from the door answered in shrill and querulous tones and questioning the messenger in the same breath How could she tell what it might or might not portend Her alarms quickly subsided however for she knew the voice well So the story was soon told Poor little Fairy it was doubtful if he was to see another morning and the maid being wanted at home old Tamar undertook the message to Brandon Hall where her young mistress was and sallied forth in her cloak and bonnet under the haunted trees of Redman s Dell Tamar had passed the age of ghostly terrors There are a certain sober literality and materialism in old age which abate the illusions of the supernatural as effectually as those of love and Tamar though not without awe for darkness and solitude even were there no associations of a fearful kind in the locality are suggestive and dismal to the last Her route lay as by this time my reader is well aware by that narrow defile reached from Redman s Farm by a pathway which scales a flight of rude steps the same which Stanley Lake and his sister had mounted on the night of Mark Wylder s disappearance Tamar knew the path very well It was on the upper level of it that she had held that conference with Stanley Lake which obviously referred to that young gentleman s treatment of the vanished Mark As she came to this platform round which the trees receded a little so as to admit the moonlight the old woman was tired She would have gladly chosen another spot to rest in but fatigue was imperious and she sat down under the gray stone which stood perpendicularly there on what had once been the step of a stile leaning against the rude column behind her As she sat here she heard the clank of a step approaching measuredly from the Brandon side It was twelve o clock now the chimes from the Gylingden church tower had proclaimed that in the distance some minutes before The honest Gylingden folk seldom heard the tower chimes tell eleven and gentle and simple had of course been long in their beds The old woman had a secret hatred of this place and the unexpected sounds made her hold her breath She peeped round the stone in whose shadow she was sitting The steps were not those of a man walking briskly with a purpose they were the desultory strides of a stroller lounging out an hour s watch The steps approached The figure was visible that of a short broadish man with a mass of cloaks rugs and mufflers across his arm Carrying them with a sort of swagger he came slowly up to the part of the pathway opposite to the pillar where he dropped those draperies in a heap upon the grass and availing himself of the clear moonlight he stopped nearly confronting her It was the face of Mark Wylder she knew it well but grown fat and broader and there was but this she could not see distinctly a purplish scar across his eyebrow and cheek She quivered with terror lest he should have seen her and might be meditating some mischief But she was seated close to the ground several yards away and in the sharp shadow of the old block of stone He consulted his watch and she sat fixed and powerless as a portion of the block on which she leaned staring up at this to her terrific apparition Mark Wylder s return boded she believed something tremendous She saw the glimmer of the gold watch and distinctly the great black whiskers and the face pallid in the moonlight She was afraid for a minute during which he loitered there that he was going to seat himself upon the cloaks which he had just thrown upon the ground and felt that she could not possibly escape detection for many seconds more But she was relieved for after a short pause leaving these still upon the ground he turned and walked slowly like a policeman on his beat toward Brandon With a gasp she began to recover herself but she felt too faint and ill to get up and commence a retreat towards Redman s Farm Besides she was sure he would return she could not tell how soon and although the clump of alders hid her from view she could not tell but that the next moment would disclose his figure retracing his leisurely steps and ready to pursue and overtake if by a precipitate movement she had betrayed her presence In due time the same figure passing at the same rate did emerge again and approached just as before only this time he was carelessly examining some small but clumsy steel instrument which glittered occasionally in the light From Tamar s description of it I conclude it was a revolver He passed the pile of cloaks but a few steps and again turned toward Brandon So soon as he was once more concealed by the screen of underwood old Tamar now sufficiently recovered crept hurriedly away in the opposite direction half dead with terror until she had descended the steps and was buried once more in friendly darkness Old Tamar did not stop at Redman s Farm she passed it and the mills and never stopped till she reached the Vicarage In the hall she felt for a moment quite overpowered and sitting in one of the old chairs that did duty there she uttered a deep groan and looked with such a gaze in the face of the maid who had admitted her that she thought the old woman was dying Sick rooms even when palpably doctors nurses friends have all ceased to hope are not to those who stand in the very nearest and most tender relations to the patient altogether chambers of despair There are those who hover about the bed and note every gleam and glow of subsiding life and will read in sunset something of the colours of the dawn and cling wildly to these hallucinations of love and no one has the heart to tear them from them Just now Dolly fancied that little man was better the darling the treasure oh precious little man He was coming back So she ran down with this light of hope in her face and saw old Tamar in the hall and gave her a glass of the wine which Rachel had provided and the old woman s spirit came again She was glad yes very glad She was thankful to hear the dear child was better But there was a weight upon her soul and a dreadful horror on her countenance still Will you please Ma am write a little note my old hand shakes so she could hardly read my writing to my mistress Miss Radie Ma am I see pen and ink on the table there I was not able to go up to the Hall Ma am with the message There s something on the road I could not pass Something What was it said Dolly staring with round eyes in the old woman s woeful face her curiosity aroused for a moment Something Ma am a person I can t exactly tell above the steps in the Blackberry path It would cost my young mistress her life For Heaven s sake Ma am write and promise if you send for her she shall get the note So Dolly made the promise and bringing old Tamar with her into the study penned these odd lines from her dictation merely adjusting the grammar MISS RADIE DEAR If coming down to night from Brandon this is to tell you it is as much as your life is worth to pass the Blackberry walk above the steps My old eyes have seen him there walking back and forward lying at catch for some one this night the great enemy of man you can suppose in what shape Your dutiful and loving servant TAMAR So old Tamar after a little took her departure and it needed a great effort to enable her to take the turn up the dark and lonely mill road leading to Redman s Farm so much did she dread the possibility of again encountering the person she had just described CHAPTER LXX THE MEETING IN THE LONG POND ALLEY I suppose there were few waking heads at this hour in all the wide parish of Gylingden though many a usually idle one was now busy enough about the great political struggle which was to muster its native forces both in borough and county and agitate these rural regions with the roar and commotion of civil strife But generals must sleep like other men and even Tom Wealdon was snoring in the fairy land of dreams The night was very still a sharp night with a thin moon like a scimitar hanging bright in the sky and a myriad of intense stars blinking in the heavens above the steep roofs and spiral chimneys of Brandon Hall and the ancient trees that surrounded it It was late in the night as we know The family according to their custom had sought their slumbers early and the great old house was perfectly still One pair at least of eyes however were wide open one head busy and one person still in his daily costume This was mister Larcom the grave major domo the bland and attached butler He was not busy about his plate nor balancing the cellar book nor even perusing his Bible He was seated in that small room or closet which he had years ago appropriated as his private apartment It is opposite the housekeeper s room a sequestered philosophic retreat He dressed in it read his newspaper there and there saw his select acquaintance His wardrobe stood there The iron safe in which he kept his keys filled one of its nooks He had his two or three shelves of books in the recess not that he disturbed them much but they were a grave and gentlemanlike property and he liked them for their binding and the impression they produced on his visitors There was a meditative fragrance of cigars about him and two or three Havannah stumps under the grate The fact is he was engaged over a letter the writing of which considering how accomplished a gentleman he was he had found rather laborious and tedious The penmanship was I am afraid clumsy and the spelling here and there irregular It was finished however and he was now reading it over with care It was thus expressed RESPECTET SIR In accordens with your disier i av

disier there beeing a deel to regret for frends of the old famly i feer in a sertun resent marrege if I shud lern be chance contense of letter i will sewer rite you i Remane your humbel servant JOHN LARCOM Just as grave mister Larcom had ended the perusal of this bulletin he heard a light step on the stair at the end of the passage which made his manly heart jump unpleasantly within his fat ribs He thrust the unfolded letter roughly into the very depths of his breeches pocket and blew out both candles and then listened as still as a mouse What frightened him was the certainty that the step which he well knew was Stanley Lake s And Stanley being a wideawake and violent person and his measures sharp and reckless mister Larcom cherished a nervous respect for him He listened the captain s step came lightly to the foot of the stairs and paused mister Larcom prepared to be fast asleep in the chair in the event of the captain s making a sudden advance and entering his sanctum But this movement was not executed There was a small door at the foot of the stairs It shut with a spring lock of which Captain Lake had a latch key mister Larcom accidentally had another a cylindrical bit of steel with a hinge in the end of it and a few queer wards Now of this little door he heard the two iron bolts stealthily drawn and then the handle of the spring lock turned and the door cautiously opened and as gently closed mister Larcom s fears now naturally subsided and curiosity as naturally supervened He drew near his window and it was well he had extinguished his lights for as he did so Captain Lake s light figure in a gray paletot and cloth cap glided by like a spirit in the faint moonlight This phenomenon excited the profoundest interest in the corresponding friend of the family who fumbling his letter between his finger and thumb in his breeches pocket standing on tip toe with mouth agape and his head against the shutter followed the receding figure with a greedy stare mister Larcom had no theory whatsoever to account for this procedure on the part of his master It must be something very extraordinary and well worth investigating of course for the benefit of the family which could have evoked the apparition which had just crossed his window With his eyes close to the window pane he saw his master glide swiftly along the short terrace which covers this side of the house and disappear down the steps like a spectre sinking into the earth It is a meeting thought mister Larcom taking courage for he already felt something of the confidence and superiority of possessing a secret and as quickly as might be the trustworthy man with his latch key in his pocket softly opened the portal through which the object of his anxiety had just emerged closed the door behind him and stood listening intently in the recess of the entrance where he heard the now more careless step of the captain treading as he thought the broad yew walk which turns at a right angle at the foot of the terrace step The black yew hedge was a perfect screen Here was obviously resented a chance of obtaining the command of a secret of greater or less importance It was a considerable stake to play for and well worth a trifling risk He did not hesitate to follow but with the soft tread of a polite butler doing his offices over the thick carpet of a drawing room and it was in his mind Suppose he does discover me what then I m as much surprised as he Thomas Brewen the footman who is under notice to leave has twice to the captain s knowledge played me the same trick and stole out through the gunroom window at night and denied it afterwards so I sat up to detect him and hearing the door open and a step I pursued and find I ve made a mistake and beg pardon with proper humility supposing the master is on the same errand what can he say It will bring me a present and a hint to say nothing of my having seen him in the yew walk at this hour Of course he did not run through all this rigmarole in detail but the situation the excuse and the result were present to his mind and filled him with a comfortable assurance Therefore with decision and caution he followed Captain Lake s march and reaching the yew walk he saw the slim figure in the cap and paletot turn the corner and enter the broad walk between the two wall like beech hedges which led direct to the first artificial pond a long narrow parallelogram round which the broad walk passed in two straight lines fenced with the towering beech hedges shorn as smooth as the walls of a nunnery When the butler reached the point at which Captain Lake had turned he found himself all at once within fifty steps of that eccentric gentleman who was talking but in so low a tone that not even the sound of the voices reached him with a rather short broad shouldered person buttoned up in a surtout and wearing a queer Germanesque felt hat battered and crushed a good deal mister Larcom held his breath He was profoundly interested After a while with an oath he exclaimed That s him Then after another pause he gasped another oath It is him The square built man in the surtout had a great pair of black whiskers and as he stood opposite Lake conversing with now and again an earnest gesture he showed a profile which mister Larcom knew very well and now they turned and walked slowly side by side along the broad walk by that perpendicular wall of crisp brown leaves he recognised also a certain hitch in his shoulder which made him swear and asseverate again He would have given something to hear what was passing He thought uneasily whether there might not be a side path or orifice anywhere through which he might creep so as to get to the other side of the hedge and listen But there was no way and he must rest content with such report as his eyes might furnish They re not quarrelling no ways murmured he And indeed they walked together stopping now and again as it seemed very amicably Captain Lake seemed to have most to say He s awful cowed he is I never did think to see mister Wylder so affeard of Lake he is affeard yes he is that he is And indeed there was an indescribable air of subservience in the demeanour of the square built gentleman very different from what Mark Wylder once showed He saw the captain take from the pocket of his paletot a square box or packet it might be jewels or only papers and hand them to his companion who popped them into his left hand surtout pocket and kept his hand there as if the freightage were specially valuable Then they talked earnestly a little longer standing together by the pond and then side by side they paced down the broad walk by its edge It was a long walk Honest Larcom would have followed if there had been any sort of cover to hide his advance but there being nothing of the kind he was fain to abide at his corner Thence he beheld them come at last slowly to a stand still talk evidently a little more and finally they shook hands an indefinable something still of superiority in Lake s air and parted The captain was now all at once walking at a swift pace alone towards Larcom s post of observation and his secret confederate nearly as rapidly in an opposite direction It would not do for the butler to be taken or even seen by Lake nor yet to be left at the outside of the door and barred out So the captain had hardly commenced his homeward walk when Larcom though no great runner threw himself into an agitated amble and reached and entered the little door just in time to escape observation He had not been two minutes in his apartment again when he once more beheld the figure of his master cross the window and heard the small door softly opened and closed and the bolts slowly and cautiously drawn again into their places Then there was a pause Lake was listening to ascertain whether anyone was stirring and being satisfied re ascended the stairs leaving the stout and courteous butler ample matter for romantic speculation It was now the butler s turn to listen which he did at the half opened door of his room When he was quite assured that all was quiet he shut and bolted his door closed the window shutters and relighted his pair of wax candles mister Larcom was a good deal excited He had seen strange things that night He was a good deal blown and heated by his run and a little wild and scared at the closeness of the captain s unconscious pursuit His head beside was full of amazing conjectures After a while he took his crumpled letter from his pocket unfolded and smoothed it and wrote upon a blank half page RESPECTED SIR Since the above i ave a much to tel mos surprisen the gentleman you wer anceous of tiding mister M W is cum privet and him and master met tonite nere two in morning in the long pond allee so is near home then we suposed no more at present Sir from your humbel servent JOHN LARCOM i shall go to dolington day arter to morrow by eleven o clock trane if you ere gong Sir When the attorney returned between eleven and twelve o clock next morning this letter awaited him It did not of course surprise him but it conclusively corroborated all his inferences Here had been Mark Wylder He had stopped at Dollington as the attorney suspected he would and he had kept tryst in the Brandon grounds with sly Captain Lake whose relations with him it became now more difficult than ever clearly to comprehend Wylder was plainly under no physical coercion He had come and gone unattended For one reason or other he was at least as strongly interested as Lake in maintaining secrecy That Mark Wylder was living was the grand fact with which he had just then to do How near he had been to purchasing the vicar s reversion The engrossed deeds lay in the black box there And yet it might be all true about Mark s secret marriage At that moment there might be a whole rosary of sons small and great to intercept the inheritance and the Reverend William Wylder might have no more chance of the estates than he had of the crown What a deliverance for the good attorney His money was quite safe The excellent man s religion was we know a little Jewish and rested upon temporal rewards and comforts He thought I am sure that a competent staff of angels were placed specially in charge of the interests of Jos Larkin esquire who attended so many services and sermons on Sundays and led a life of such ascetic propriety He felt quite grateful to them in his priggish way their management in this matter had been so eminently satisfactory He regretted that he had not an opportunity of telling them so personally I don t say that he would have expressed it in these literal terms but it was fixed in his mind that the carriage of his business was supernaturally arranged Perhaps he was right and he was at once elated and purified and his looks and manner that afternoon were more than usually meek and celestial CHAPTER LXXI SIR HARRY BRACTON S INVASION OF GYLINGDEN Jim Dutton had not turned up since and his letter was one of those mares nests of which gentlemen in mister Larkin s line of business have so large an experience Of Mark Wylder not a trace was discoverable His enquiries on this point were of course conducted with caution and remoteness Gylingden however was one of those places which if it knows anything is sure to find a way of telling it and the attorney was soon satisfied that Mark s secret visit had been conducted with sufficient caution to baffle the eyes and ears of the good folk of the town Well one thing was plain The purchase of the reversion was to wait and fraudulent as was the price at which he had proposed to buy it he was now resolved to get it for less than half that sum and he wrote a short note to the vicar which he forthwith despatched In the meantime there was not a moment to be lost in clenching the purchase of Five Oaks And mister Jos Larkin with one of his young men with him in the tax cart reached Brandon Hall in a marvellously short time after his arrival at home Jos Larkin his clerk and the despatch box had a short wait in the Dutch room before his admission to the library where an animated debate was audible The tremendous contest impending over the county was of course the theme In the Dutch room where they waited there was a large table with a pyramid of blank envelopes in the middle and ever so many cubic feet of canvassing circulars six chairs and pens and ink The clerks were in the housekeeper s room at that moment partaking of refreshment There was a gig in the court yard with a groom at the horse s head and Larkin as he drew up saw a chaise driving round to the stable yard People of all sorts were coming and going and Brandon Hall was already growing like an inn How d ye do dear Larkin said Captain Brandon Stanley Lake the hero of all this debate and commotion smiling his customary sly greeting and extending his slim hand across the arm of his chair I m so sorry you were away this thing has come after all so suddenly we are getting on famously though but I m awfully fagged And indeed he looked pale and tired though smiling I ve a lot of fellows with me they ve just run in to luncheon won t you take something But Jos Larkin smiling after his sort excused himself He was glad they had a moment to themselves He had brought the money which he knew would be acceptable at such a moment and he thought it would be desirable to sign and seal forthwith to which the captain a little anxiously agreed So he got in one of the clerks who were directing the canvassing circulars and gave him the draft approved by his counsel to read aloud while he followed with his eye upon the engrossed deed The attorney told down the money in bank bills He fancied that exception might be taken to his cheque for so large a sum and was eager to avoid delay and came from London so provided The captain was not sorry for in truth he was in rather imminent jeopardy just then He had spoken truth strangely enough when he mentioned his gambling debts as an incentive to his marriage with the heiress of Brandon in that Sunday walk with Rachel in the park and hardly ten minutes had passed when Melton Hervey trustiest of aide de camps was on his way to Dollington to make a large lodgment to the captain s credit in the county bank and to procure a letter of credit for a stupendous sum in favour of Messrs Hiram and Jacobs transmitted under cover to Captain Lake s town solicitor The captain had signed sealed and delivered murmuring that formula about hand and seal and act and deed and Dorcas glided in like a ghost and merely whispering an enquiry to Lake did likewise the clerk deferentially putting the query this is your hand and seal c and Jos Larkin drawing a step or two backward Of course the lady saw that lank and sinister man of God quite distinctly but she did not choose to do so and Larkin with a grand sort of prescience foresaw a county feud between the Houses of Five Oaks and Brandon and now the lady had vanished The money carefully counted was rolled in Lake s pocket book and the bright new deed which made Jos Larkin of the Lodge esquire master of Five Oaks was safely locked into the box under his long arm and the attorney vanished bowing very much and concealing his elation under a solemn sort of nonchalance The note which by this time the vicar had received though short was on the whole tremendous It said Private reverend AND DEAR SIR I have this moment arrived from London where I deeply regret to state the negotiation on which we both relied to carry you comfortably over your present difficulties has fallen through in consequence of what I cannot but regard as the inexcusable caprice of the intending purchaser He declines stating any reason for his withdrawal I fear that the articles were so artfully framed by his solicitors in one particular which it never entered into my mind to refer to anything like trick or design that we shall find it impossible to compel him to carry out what in the strongest terms I have represented to Messrs Burlington and Smith as a bargain irrevocably concluded in point of honour and morality The refusal of their own client to make the proposed investment has alarmed those gentlemen I regret to add for the safety of their costs which as I before apprised you are though I cannot say excessive certainly very heavy and I fear we must be prepared for extreme measures upon their part I have carefully reconsidered the very handsome proposal which Miss Lake was so good as to submit but the result is that partly on technical and partly on other grounds I continue of the clear opinion that the idea is absolutely impracticable and must be peremptorily laid aside in attempting to arrive at an estimate of any resources which you may be conscious of commanding If under these deplorably untoward circumstances you still think I can be of any use to you may I beg that you will not hesitate to say how I remain my dear and reverend Sir with profound regrets and sympathy yours very sincerely JOS H LARKIN He had already imported the H which was to germinate in a little while into Howard When Jos Larkin wanted to get a man s property a bargain and he had made two or three excellent hits though comparatively on a very small scale he liked so to contrive matters as to bring his client to his knees begging him to purchase on the terms he wished and then Jos Larkin came forward in the interests of humanity and unable to resist the importunities of a party whom he respected he did what at the time appeared a very risky thing although it has turned out tolerably safe in the long run The screw was now twisted pretty well home upon the poor vicar who if he had any sense at all would remembering Larkin s expressions only a week before suggest his buying and so the correspondence would disclose in a manner most honourable to the attorney the history of the purchase But the clouds had begun to break and the sky to clear over the good vicar just at the point where they had been darkest and most menacing Little Fairy after all was better Good natured Buddle had been there at nine quite amazed at his being so well still reserved and cautious and afraid of raising hopes But when he came back at eleven and had completed his examination he told them frankly that there was a decided change in fact that the little man with of course great care might do very well and ought to recover if nothing went wrong Honest Buddle was delighted He chuckled over the little man s bed He could not suppress his grins He was a miracle of a child a prodigy By George it was the most extraordinary case he had ever met with It was all that bottle and that miraculous child they seemed made for one another From two o clock last night the action of his skin has commenced and never ceased since When he was here last night the little fellow s pulse was a hundred and forty four and now down to ninety seven The doctor grew jocular and who can resist a doctor s jokes when they garnish such tidings as he was telling Was ever so pleasant a doctor Laughter through tears greeted these pleasantries and oh such transports of gratitude broke forth when he was gone It was well for Driver the postmaster and his daughters that all the circulars made up that day in Brandon Hall were not despatched through the Gylingden post office It was amazing how so many voters could find room to one county Next day it was resolved the captain s personal canvass was to commence The invaluable Wealdon had run through the list of his to morrow s visits and given him an inkling of the idiosyncrasies the feuds and the likings of each elector in the catalogue Busy times Sir Tom Wealdon used to remark with a chuckle from time to time in the thick of the fuss and conspiration which was the breath of his nostrils and doubtless so they are and were and ever will be until the time honoured machinery of our election system has been overhauled and adapted to the civilisation of these days Captain Brandon Lake was as much as possible at head quarters in these critical times and suddenly mister Crump the baker and John Thomas of the delft ironmongery sponge and umbrella shop at the corner of Church Street in Gylingden were announced by the fatigued servant They bowed and stood grinning near the door and the urbane and cordial captain with all a candidate s good fellowship shook them both by the hands and heard their story and an exciting one it was Sir Harry Bracton had actually invaded the town of Gylingden There was a rabble of the raff of Queen s Bracton along with him He with two or three young swells by him had made a speech from his barouche outside the Silver Lion near the green and he was now haranguing from the steps of the Court House They had a couple of flags and some music It was a regular planned thing for the Queen s Bracton people had been dropping in an hour before The shop keepers were shutting their windows Sir Harry was chaffing the capting and hitting him very hard for a hupstart and in fact Crump was more particular in reporting the worthy baronet s language than was absolutely necessary And it was thought that Sir Harry was going to canvass the town The captain was very much obliged indeed and begged they would go into the parlour and take luncheon and forthwith Wealdon took the command The gamekeepers the fifty hay makers in the great meadow they were to enter the town from the top of Church Street where they were to gather all the boys and blackguards they could The men from the gas works the masons and blacksmiths were to be marched in by Luke Samways Tom Wealdon would himself in passing give the men at the coal works a hint Sir Harry s invasion was the most audacious thing on record and it was incumbent on Gylingden to make his defeat memorably disgraceful and disastrous His barouche was to be smashed and burnt on the green his white topcoat and hat were to clothe the effigy which was to swing over the bonfire The captured Bracton banners were to hang in the coffee room of the Silver Lion to inspire the roughs What was to become of the human portion of the hostile pageant Tom being an official person did not choose to hint All these and fifty minor measures were ordered by the fertile Wealdon in a minute and suitable messengers on the wing to see after them The captain accompanied by mister Jekyl myself and a couple of the grave scriveners from the next room were to go by the back approach and Redman s Dell to the Assembly Rooms which Crump and Thomas already on their way in the fly undertook to have open for their reception and furnished with some serious politicians from the vicinity From the windows the captain thus supported was to make his maiden speech one point in which Tom Wealdon insisted upon and that was an injunction to the men of Gylingden on no account to break the peace Take care to say it and we ll have it well reported in the Chronicle and our lads won t mind it nor hear it neither for that matter So there was mounting in hot haste in the courtyard of old Brandon and a rather ponderous selection of walking sticks by the politicians of whom I was one intended for the windows of the assembly room Lake rode Tom Wealdon myself and two scriveners squeezed into the dog cart which was driven by Jekyl and away we went It was a pleasant drive under the noble old trees But we were in no mood for the picturesque A few minutes brought us into the Blackberry hollow which debouches into Redman s Dell Here the road being both steep and rugged our speed abated The precipitous banks shut out the sunlight except at noon and the road through this defile overhung by towering trees and rocks was even now in solemn shadow The cart road leading down to Redman s Dell and passing the mills near Redman s Farm diverges from the footpath with which we are so well acquainted near that perpendicular block of stone which stands a little above the steps which the footpath here descends CHAPTER LXXII MARK WYLDER S HAND Just at the darkest point of the road a little above the rude column which I have mentioned Lake s horse a young one shied stopped short recoiling on its haunches and snorted fiercely into the air At the same time the two dogs which had accompanied us began to bark furiously beneath in the ravine The tall form of Uncle Lorne was leaning against a tree at the edge of the ravine with his left hand extended towards us and his right pointing down the precipice Perhaps it was this odd apparition that startled Lake s horse I told you he was coming up lend him a hand yelled Uncle Lorne in great excitement No one at such a moment minded his maunderings but many people afterwards thought that the crazed old man in one of his night rambles had seen that which till now no one had imagined and that Captain Lake himself whose dislike of him was hardly disguised suspected him at times of that alarming knowledge Lake plunged the spurs into his beast which reared so straight that she toppled backward toward the edge of the ravine Strike her on the head jump off shouted Wealdon But he did neither D it put her head down lean forward bellowed Wealdon again But it would not do With a crash among briars and a heavy thump from beneath that shook the earth the mare and her rider went over A shout of horror broke from us all and Jekyl watching the catastrophe was very near pulling our horse over the edge and launching us all together like the captain into the defile In a moment more we were all on the ground and scrambling down the side of the ravine among rocks boughs brambles and ferns in the deep shadows of the gorge the dogs still yelling furiously from below Here he is cried Jekyl How are you Lake Much hurt old boy By Jove he s killed I think Lake groaned He lay about twelve feet below the edge The mare now lying near the bottom of the gorge had I believe fallen upon him and then tumbled over Strange to say Lake was conscious and in a few seconds he said in reply to the horrified questions of his friend I m all smashed Don t move me and in a minute more Don t mind that d d brute she s killed Let her lie It appeared very odd but so it was he appeared eager upon this point and faint as he was almost savage Tell them to let her lie there Wealdon and I however scrambled down the bank He was right The mare lay stone dead on her side at the bottom He lifted her head by the ear and let it fall back In the meantime the dogs continued their unaccountable yelling close by What the devil s that said Wealdon Something like a stunted blackened branch was sticking out of the peat ending in a set of short thickish twigs This is what it seemed The dogs were barking at it It was really a human hand and arm disclosed by the slipping of the bank undermined by the brook which was swollen by the recent rains The dogs were sniffing and yelping about it It s a hand cried Wealdon with an oath A hand I echoed We were both peering at it having drawn near stooping and hesitating as men do in a curious horror It was indeed a human hand and arm disclosed from about the elbow enveloped in a discoloured coat sleeve which fell back from the limb and the fingers like it black were extended in the air Nothing more of the body to which it belonged except the point of a knee in stained and muddy trousers protruding from the peat was visible It must have lain there a considerable time for notwithstanding the antiseptic properties of that sort of soil mixed with the decayed bark and fibre of trees a portion of the flesh of the hand was decomposed and the naked bone disclosed On the little finger something glimmered dully In this livid hand rising from the earth there was a character both of menace and appeal and on the finger as I afterwards saw at the inquest glimmered the talismanic legend Resurgam I will rise again It was the corpse of Mark Wylder which had lain buried here undiscovered for many months A horrible odour loaded the air Perhaps it was this smell of carrion from which horses sometimes recoil with a special terror that caused the swerving and rearing which had ended so fatally At that moment we heard a voice calling and raising our eyes saw Uncle Lorne looking down from the rock with an agitated scowl I ve done with him now emeritus he touches me no more Take him by the hand merciful lads or they ll draw him down again And with these words Uncle Lorne receded and I saw him no more As yet we had no suspicion whose was the body thus unexpectedly discovered We beat off the dogs and on returning to Lake found Jekyl trying to raise him a little against a tree We were not far from Redman s Farm and it was agreed on hasty consultation that our best course would be to carry Lake thither at once by the footpath and that one of us Wealdon undertook this should drive the carriage on and apprising Rachel on the way of the accident which had happened and that her brother was on his way thither should drive on to Buddle s house sending assistance to us from the town It was plain that Stanley Lake s canvass was pretty well over There was not one of us who looked at him that did not feel convinced that he was mortally hurt I don t think he believed so himself then but we could not move him from the place where he lay without inflicting so much pain that we were obliged to wait for assistance D the dogs what are they barking for said Lake faintly He seemed distressed by the noise There s a dead body partly disclosed down there some one murdered and buried but one of mister Juke s young men is keeping them off Lake made an effort to raise himself but with a grin and a suppressed moan he abandoned it Is there no doctor I m very much hurt said Lake faintly after a minute s silence We told him that Buddle had been sent for and that we only awaited help to get him down to Redman s Farm When Rachel heard the clang of hoofs and the rattle of the tax cart driving down the mill road at a pace so unusual a vague augury of evil smote her She was standing in the porch of her tiny house and old Tamar was sitting knitting on the bench close by Tamar they are galloping down the road I think what can it mean exclaimed the young lady scared she could not tell why and old Tamar stood up and shaded her eyes with her shrunken hand Tom Wealdon pulled up at the little wicket He was pale He had lost his hat too among the thickets and could not take time to recover it Altogether he looked wild He put his hand to where his hat should have been in token of salutation and said he I beg pardon Miss Lake Ma am but I m sorry to say your brother the captain s badly hurt and maybe you could have a shakedown in the parlour ready for him by the time I come back with the doctor Ma am Rachel she did not know how was close by the wheel of the vehicle by this time Is it Sir Harry Bracton He s in the town I know Is Stanley shot Not shot only thrown Miss into the Dell his mare shied at a dead body that s there You d better stay where you are Miss but if you could send up some water I think he d like it Going for the doctor Ma am good bye Miss Lake And away went Wealdon wild pale and hatless like a man pursued by robbers Oh Tamar he s killed Stanley s killed I m sure he s killed and all s discovered and Rachel ran wildly up the hill a few steps but stopped and returned as swiftly Thank God Miss said old Tamar lifting up her trembling fingers and white eyes to Heaven Better dead Miss than living on in sin and sorrow better discovered than hid by daily falsehood and cruelty Old Tamar s tired of life she s willing to go and wishin for death this many a day Oh Master Stanley my child Rachel went into the parlour and kneeled down with white upturned face and clasped hands But she could not pray She could only look her wild supplication deliverance an issue out of the terrors that beset her and oh poor miserable lost Stanley It was just a look and an inarticulate cry for mercy An hour after Captain Stanley Brandon Lake whose election address was figuring that evening in the Dollington Courier and in the County Chronicle lay with his clothes still on in the little drawing room of Redman s Farm his injuries ascertained his thigh broken near the hip and his spine fractured No hope no possibility of a physical reascension this time Meanwhile in the Blackberry Dell Doctor Buddle was assisting at a different sort of inquisition The two policemen who constituted the civil force of Gylingden two justices of the peace the doctor and a crowd of amateurs among whom I rank myself were grouped in the dismal gorge a little to windward of the dead body which fate had brought to light while three men were now employed in cautiously disinterring it When the operation was completed there remained no doubt whatever on my mind discoloured and disfigured as were both clothes and body I was sure that the dead man was no other than Mark Wylder When the clay with which it was clotted was a little removed it became indubitable The great whiskers the teeth so white and even and oddly enough one black lock of hair which he wore twisted in a formal curl flat on his forehead remained undisturbed in its position as it was fixed there at his last toilet for Brandon Hall In the rude and shallow grave in which he lay his purse was found and some loose silver mixed in the mould The left hand on which was the ring of the Persian magician was bare the right gloved with the glove of the other hand clutched firmly in it The body was got up in a sheet to a sort of spring cart which awaited it and so conveyed to the Silver Lion in Gylingden where it was placed in a disused coach house to await the inquest There the examination was continued and his watch the chain broken found in his waistcoat pocket In his coat pocket were found of course in no very presentable condition his cigar case his initials stamped on it for Mark had in his day a keen sense of property his handkerchief also marked a pocket book with some entries nearly effaced and a letter unopened and sealed with Lord Chelford s seal The writing was nearly washed away but the letters lwich or twich were still legible near the corner and it turned out to be a letter to Dulwich which Mark Wylder had undertaken to put in the Gylingden post office on the last night on which he appeared at Brandon The whole town was in a ferment that night Great debate and conjecture in the reading room and even on the benches of the billiard room The Silver Lion did a great business that night Mine host might have turned a good round sum only by showing the body were it not that Edwards the chief policeman had the keys of the coach house Much to ing and fro ing there was between the town and Redman s Farm the respectable inhabitants all sending or going up to enquire how the captain was doing At last Doctor Buddle officially interfered The constant bustle was injurious to his patient An hourly bulletin up to twelve o clock should be in the hall of the Brandon Arms and Redman s Dell grew quiet once more When William Wylder heard the news he fainted not altogether through horror or grief though he felt both but the change in his circumstances was so amazing and momentous It was a strange shock immense relief immense horror quite overwhelming Mark had done some good natured things for him in a small five pound way he had promised him that loan too which would have lifted him out of his Slough of Despond and he clung with an affectionate gratitude to these exhibitions of brotherly love Besides he had accustomed himself the organ of veneration standing prominent on the top of the vicar s head to regard Mark in the light of a great practical genius natus rebus agendis he knew men so thoroughly he understood the world so marvellously The vicar was not in the least surprised when Mark came in for a fortune He had always predicted that Mark must become very rich and that nothing but indolence could prevent his ultimately becoming a very great man The sudden and total disappearance of so colossal an object was itself amazing There was another person very strongly though differently affected by the news Under pretext of business at Naunton Jos Larkin had driven off early to Five Oaks to make inspection of his purchase He dined like a king in disguise at the humble little hostelry of Naunton Friars and returned in the twilight to the Lodge which he would make the dower house of Five Oaks with the Howard shield over the door He was gracious to his domestics but the distance was increased he was nearer to the clouds and they looked smaller Well missus Smithers said he encouragingly his long feet on the fender for the evening was sharp and missus S knew that he liked a bit of fire at his tea any letters any calls any news stirring No letters nor calls Sir please except the butcher s book I s pose Sir you were viewing the body What body mister Wylder s please Sir The vicar exclaimed mister Larkin his smile of condescension suddenly vanishing No Sir mister Mark Wylder please the gentleman Sir as was to av married Miss Brandon What the devil do you mean woman ejaculated the attorney his back to the fire standing erect and a black shadow over his amazed and offended countenance The devil in such a mouth was so appalling and so amazing that the worthy woman gazed thunder struck upon him for a moment Beg your pardon Sir but his body s bin found Sir You mean mister Mark Yes please Sir in a hole near the mill road it s up in the Silver Lion now Sir It must be the vicar s it must said Jos Larkin getting his hat on sternly and thinking how likely he was to throw himself into the mill race and impossible it was that Mark whom he and Larcom had both seen alive and well last night the latter indeed this morning could possibly be the man And thus comforting himself he met old Major Jackson on the green and that gentleman s statement ended with the words and in an advanced stage of decomposition That settles the matter said Larkin breathing again and with a toss of his head and almost a smile of disdain for I saw mister Mark Wylder late last night at Shillingsworth Leaving Major Jackson in considerable surprise mister Larkin walked off to Edwards dwelling at the top of Church Street and found that active policeman at home In his cool grand official way mister Larkin requested mister Edwards to accompany him to the Silver Lion where in the same calm and commanding way he desired him to attend him to view the corpse In virtue of his relation to Mark Wylder and of his position as sole resident and legal practitioner he was obeyed The odious spectacle occupied him for some minutes He did not speak while they remained in the room On coming out there was a black cloud upon the attorney s features and he said sulkily to Edwards who had turned the key in the lock and now touched his hat as he listened Yes there is a resemblance but it is all a mistake I travelled as far as Shillingsworth last night with mister Mark Wylder he was perfectly well This can t be he But there was a terrible impression on mister Jos Larkin s mind that this certainly was he and with a sulky nod to the policeman he walked darkly down to the vicar s house The vicar had been sent for to Naunton to pray with a dying person and mister Larkin disappointed left a note to state that in writing that morning as he had done in reference to the purchase of the reversion through Messrs Burlington and Smith he had simply expressed his own surmises as to the probable withdrawal of the intending purchaser but had received no formal nor indeed any authentic information from either the party or the solicitors referred to to that effect That he mentioned this lest misapprehension should arise but not as attaching any importance to the supposed discovery which seemed to imply mister Mark Wylder s death That gentleman on the contrary he had seen alive and well at Shillingsworth on the night previous and he had been seen in conference with Captain Lake at a subsequent hour at Brandon From all this the reader may suppose that mister Jos Larkin was not quite in a comfortable state and he resolved to get the deeds and go down again to the vicar s and persuade him to execute them He could make William Wylder of course do whatever he pleased There were a good many drunken fellows about the town but there was an end of election demonstrations in the Brandon interest Captain Lake was not going in for that race he would be on another errand by the time the writ came down CHAPTER LXXIII THE MASK FALLS There was a stop press that evening in the county paper We have just learned that a body has been disinterred early this afternoon under very strange circumstances in the neighbourhood of Gylingden and if the surmises which are afloat prove well founded the discovery will set at rest the speculations which have been busy respecting the whereabouts of a certain gentleman of large property and ancient lineage who some time since mysteriously disappeared and will no doubt throw this county into a state of very unusual excitement We can state upon authority that the coroner will hold his inquest on the body to morrow at twelve o clock in the town of Gylingden There was also an allusion to Captain Lake s accident with the expression of a hope that it would prove but a trifling one and an assurance that his canvass would not be prevented by it although for a few days it might not be a personal one But his friends might rely on seeing him at the hustings and hearing him too when the proper time arrived It was quite well known however in Gylingden by this time that Captain Lake was not to see the hustings that his spine was smashed that he was lying on an extemporised bed still in his clothes in the little parlour of Redman s Farm cursing the dead mare in gasps railing at everybody shuddering whenever they attempted to remove his clothes hoping in broken sentences that his people would give Bracton and good licking Bracton s outrage was the cause of the entire thing and so help him Heaven so soon as he should be on his legs again he would make him feel it one way or other Buddle thought he was in so highly excited a state that his brain must have sustained some injury also He asked Buddle about ten o clock having waked up from a sort of stupor what about Jim Dutton and then whether there was not some talk about a body they had found and what it was So Buddle told him all that was yet known and he listened very attentively But Larkin has been corresponding with Mark Wylder up to a very late day and if this body has been so long buried how the devil can it be he And if it be as bodies usually are after such a time how can anybody pretend to identify it And I happen to know that Mark Wylder is living he added suddenly The doctor told him not to tire himself talking and offered if he wished to make a statement before a magistrate to arrange that one should attend and receive it I rather dislike it because Mark wants to keep it quiet but if on public grounds it is desirable I will make it of course You ll use your discretion in mentioning the subject So the captain was now prepared to acknowledge the secret meeting of the night before and to corroborate the testimony of his attorney and his butler Stanley Lake had now no idea that his injuries were dangerous He said he had a bad bruise under his ribs and a sprained wrist and was a little bit shaken and he talked of his electioneering as only suspended for a day or two Buddle however thought the case so imminent that on his way to the Brandon Arms meeting Larkin going attended by his clerk again to the vicar s house he stopped him for a moment and told him what had passed adding that Lake was so frightfully injured that he might begin to sink at any moment and that by next evening at all events he might not be in a condition to make a deposition It is odd enough very odd said Larkin It was only an hour since in conversation with our policeman Edwards that I mentioned the fact of my having myself travelled from London to Shillingsworth last night with mister Mark Wylder who went on by train in this direction I presume to meet our unfortunate friend Captain Lake by appointment Thomas Sleddon of Wadding Hall at this moment in the Brandon Arms is just the man if you mention it to him he ll go up with you to Redman s Farm and take the deposition Let it be a deposition do you mind a statement is mere hearsay Comforted somewhat reassured in a certain way and in strong hopes that at all events such a muddle would be established as to bewilder the jury mister Jos Larkin with still an awful foreboding weighing at his heart knocked at the vicar s door and was shown into the study A solitary candle being placed to make things bright and pleasant for the visitor who did not look so himself the vicar very pale and appearing to have grown even thinner since he last saw him entered and shook his hand with an anxious attempt at a smile which faded almost instantly I am so delighted that you have come I have passed a day of such dreadful agitation Poor Mark There is no doubt Sir whatsoever that he is perfectly well Three different persons unexceptionable witnesses can depose to having seen him last night and he had a long conference with Captain Lake who is by this time making his deposition It is with respect to the other little matter the execution of the deed of conveyance to Messrs Burlington and Smith s clients You know my feeling about the note I wrote this morning a little I will not say incautiously because with a client of your known character and honour no idea of the sort can find place but I will say thoughtlessly If there be any hanging back or appearance of it it may call down unpleasant indeed to be quite frank ruinous consequences which I think in the interest of your family you would hardly be justified in invoking upon the mere speculation of your respected brother s death There was a sound of voices at the door Do come in pray do was heard in Dolly s voice Won t you excuse me but pray do Willie darling don t you wish him to come in Most particularly Do beg of him in my name and I know mister Larkin would wish it so much And so Lord Chelford with a look which at another time would have been an amused one quite conscious of the oddity of his introduction came in and slightly saluted mister Larkin who was for a few seconds pretty obviously confounded and with a pink flush all over his bald forehead tried to smile while his hungry little eyes searched the viscount with fear and suspicion Larkin s tone was now much moderated Any sort of dealing was good enough for the simple vicar but here was the quiet sagacious peer who had shown himself on two remarkable committees so quick and able a man of business and the picture of the vicar s situation and of the powers and terrors of Messrs Burlington and Smith were to be drawn with an exacter pencil and far more delicate colouring Lord Chelford listened so quietly that the tall attorney felt he was making way with him and concluded his persuasion by appealing to him for an opinion That is precisely as I said I knew my friend mister Larkin would be only too glad of an opinion in this difficulty from you threw in the vicar The opinion came very clear very quiet very unpleasant dead against mister Larkin s view and concluding with the remark that he thought there was more in the affair than had yet come to light I don t see exactly how my lord said mister Larkin a little loftily and redder than usual Nor do I mister Larkin at present but the sum offered is much too small and the amount of costs and other drawbacks utterly monstrous and the result is after deducting all these claims including your costs mister Larkin Here mister Larkin threw up his chin a little smiling and waving his long hand and saying Oh as to mine in a way that plainly expressed They are merely put down for form s sake It is playing at costs You know Jos Larkin he never so much as dreamed of looking for them There remain hardly nine hundred and fifty pounds applicable to the payment of the Reverend mister Wylder s debts a sum which would have been ample before this extraordinary negotiation was commenced to have extricated him from all his pressing difficulties and which I would have been only too happy at being permitted to advance and which and a great deal more Miss Lake whose conduct has been more than kind quite noble wished to place in your client s hands That said the attorney flushing a little I believe to have been technically impossible and it was accompanied by a proposition which was on other grounds untenable You mean Miss Lake s proposed residence here an arrangement it appears to me every way most desirable I objected to it on I will say moral grounds my lord It is painful to me to disclose what I know but that young lady accompanied mister Mark Wylder my lord in his midnight flight from Dollington and remained in London under I presume his protection for some time That statement Sir is I happen to know utterly contrary to fact The young lady you mention never even saw mister Mark Wylder since she took leave of him in the drawing room at Brandon and I state this not in vindication of her but to lend weight to the caution I give you against ever again presuming to connect her name with your surmises The peer s countenance was so inexpressibly stern and his eyes poured such a stream of fire upon the attorney that he shrank a little and looked down upon his great fingers which were drumming let us hope some sacred music upon the table I am truly rejoiced my lord to hear you say so Except to the young party herself and in this presence I have never mentioned it and I can show you the evidence on which my conclusions rested Thank you no Sir my evidence is conclusive I don t know what mister Larkin would have thought of it it was simply Rachel s letter to her friend Dolly Wylder on the subject of the attorney s conference with her at Redman s Farm It was a frank and passionate denial of the slander breathing undefinably but irresistibly the spirit of truth Then am I to understand in conclusion said the attorney that defying all consequences the reverend mister Wylder refuses to execute the deed of sale Certainly said Lord Chelford taking this reply upon himself You know my dear mister Wylder I told you from the first that Messrs Burlington and Smith were in fact a very sharp house and I fear they will execute any powers they possess in the most summary manner The attorney s eye was upon the vicar as he spoke but Lord Chelford answered The powers you speak of are quite without parallel in a negotiation to purchase and in the event of their hazarding such a measure the reverend mister Wylder will apply to a court of equity to arrest their proceedings My own solicitor is retained in the case mister Larkin s countenance darkened and lengthened visibly and his eyes assumed their most unpleasant expression and there was a little pause during which forgetting his lofty ways he bit his thumb nail rather viciously Then I am to understand my lord that I am superseded in the management of this case said the attorney at last in a measured way which seemed to say you had better think twice on this point Certainly mister Larkin said the viscount I m not the least surprised knowing I am sorry to say a good deal of the ways of the world and expecting very little gratitude for either good will or services This was accompanied with a melancholy sneer directed full upon the poor vicar who did not half understand the situation and looked rather guilty and frightened The reverend mister Wylder very well knows with what reluctance I touched the case a nasty case and I must be permitted to add that I am very happy to be quite rid of it and only regret the manner in which my wish has been anticipated a discourtesy which I attribute however to female influence The concluding sentence was spoken with a vile sneer and a measured emphasis directed at Lord Chelford who coloured with a sudden access of indignation and stood stern and menacing as the attorney with a general bow to the company and a lofty nonchalance made his exit from the apartment Captain Lake was sinking very fast next morning He made a statement to Chelford who was a magistrate for the county I suppose to assist the coroner s inquest He said that on the night of Mark Wylder s last visit to Brandon he had accompanied him from the Hall that Mark had seen some one in the neighbourhood of Gylingden a person pretending to be his wife or some near relative of hers as well as he Captain Lake could understand and was resolved to go to London privately and have the matter arranged there He waited near the White House while he Stanley Lake went to Gylingden and got his tax cart at his desire He could give particulars as to that Captain Lake overtook him and he got in and was driven to Dollington where he took the up train That some weeks afterwards he saw him at Brighton and the night before last by appointment in the grounds of Brandon and that he understood Larkin had some lights to throw upon the same subject The jury were not sworn until two o clock The circumstances of the discovery of the body were soon established But the question which next arose was very perplexed was the body that of mister Mark Wylder There could be no doubt as to a general resemblance but though marvellously preserved in its then state certainty was hardly attainable But there was a perfectly satisfactory identification of the dress and properties of the corpse as those of mister Mark Wylder On the other hand there was the testimony of Lord Chelford who put Captain Lake s deposition in evidence as also the testimony of Larkin and the equally precise evidence of Larcom the butler The proceedings had reached this point when an occurrence took place which startled Lord Chelford Larkin Larcom and every one in the room who was familiar with Mark Wylder s appearance A man pushed his way to the front of the crowd and for a moment it seemed that Mark Wylder stood living before them Who are you said Lord Chelford Jim Dutton Sir I come by reason of what I read in the Chronicle over night about mister Mark Wylder being found Do you know anything of him asked the coroner Nowt answered the man bluffly only I writ to mister Larkin there as I wanted to see him I remember him well when I was a boy I seed him in the train from Lunnon t other night and he seed me on the Shillingsworth platform and I think he took me for some one else I was comin down to see the Captain at Brandon and seed him the same night Why have you come here asked the coroner Thinkin I might be mistook answered the man I was twice here in England and three times abroad For whom mister Mark Wylder answered he It is a wonderful likeness said Lord Chelford Larkin stared at him with his worst expression and Larcom I think thought he was the devil I was as much surprised as any for a few seconds But there were points of difference Jim Dutton was rather a taller and every way a larger man than Mark Wylder His face too was broader and coarser but in features and limbs the relative proportions were wonderfully preserved It was such an exaggerated portrait as a rustic genius might have executed upon a sign board He had the same black curly hair and thick black whiskers and the style of his dress being the same helped the illusion In fact it was a rough but powerful likeness startling at the moment unexceptionable at a little distance but which failed on a nearer and exacter examination There was beside a scar which however was not a very glaring inconsistency although it was plainly of a much older standing than the date of Mark s disappearance All that could be got from Jim Dutton was that he thought he might be mistook and so attended But respecting mister Mark Wylder he could say nowt He knew nowt Lord Chelford was called away at this moment by an urgent note It was to request his immediate attendance at Redman s Farm to see Captain Lake who was in a most alarming state The hand was Dorcas s and Lord Chelford jumped into the little pony carriage which awaited him at the door of the Silver Lion When he reached Redman s Farm Captain Lake could not exert himself sufficiently to speak for nearly half an hour At the end of that time he was admitted into the tiny drawing room in which the captain lay He was speaking with difficulty Did you see Buddle just now No not since morning He seems to have changed bad opinion unless he has a law object those d d doctors never can know Dorcas thinks I ll do no good Don t you think he may have an object and not believe I m in much danger You don t Lake s hand with which he clutched and pulled Chelford s was trembling You must reflect my dear Lake how very severe are the injuries you have sustained You certainly are in danger great danger Lake became indescribably agitated and uttered some words not often on his lips that sounded like desperate words of supplication Not that seaworthy faith which floats the spirit through the storm but fragments of its long buried wreck rolled up from the depths and flung madly on the howling shore I d like to see Rachel at last he said holding Chelford s hand in both his very hard She s clever and I don t think she gives me up yet no a drink and they think I m more hurt than I really am Buddle you know only an apothecary village and he groaned His old friend Sir Francis Seddley summoned by the telegraph was now gliding from London along the rails for Dollington station but another a pale courier on the sightless coursers of the air was speeding with a different message to Captain Stanley Lake in the small and sombre drawing room in Redman s Dell I had promised Chelford to run up to Redman s Farm and let him know if the jury arrived at a verdict during his absence They did so finding that the body was that of Marcus Wylder Esquire of Raddiston and that he had come by his death in consequence of two wounds inflicted with a sharp instrument in the region of the heart by some person or persons unknown at a period of four weeks since or upwards Chelford was engaged in the sick room as I understood in conference with the patient It was well to have heard without procrastination what he had to say for next morning at a little past four o clock he died A nurse who had been called in from the county infirmary said he made a very happy ending He mumbled to himself in his drowsy state as she was quite sure in prayer and he made a very pretty corpse when he was laid out and his golden hair looked so nice and he was all so slim and shapely Rachel and Dorcas were sitting in the room with him not expecting the catastrophe then Both tired both silent the nurse dozing a little in her chair near the bed s head and Lake said in his clear low tone on a sudden just as he spoke when perfectly well Quite a mistake upon my honour As a clear voiced sentence sometimes speaks out in sleep followed by silence so no more was heard after this no more for ever The nurse was the first to perceive the change There s a change Ma am and there was a pause I m afraid Ma am he s gone said the nurse Both ladies in an instant were at the bedside looking at the peaked and white countenance which was all they were ever again to see of Stanley the yellow eyes and open mouth Rachel s agony broke forth in a loud wild cry All was forgotten and forgiven in that tremendous moment Oh Stanley Stanley brother brother oh brother There was the unchanged face gaping its awful farewell of earth All over never to stir more Is he dead said Dorcas with the peculiar sternness of agony There could be no doubt It was a sight too familiar to deceive the nurse And Dorcas closed those strange wild eyes that had so fatally fascinated her and then she trembled without speaking or shedding a tear Her looks alarmed the nurse who with Rachel s help persuaded her to leave the room And then came one of those wild scenes which close such tragedies paroxysms of despair and frantic love over that worthless young man who lay dead below stairs such as strike us sometimes with a desolate scepticism and make us fancy that all affection is illusion and perishable with the deceits and vanities of earth CHAPTER LXXIV WE TAKE LEAVE OF OUR FRIENDS The story which in his last interview with Lord Chelford Stanley Lake had related was probably as near the truth as he was capable of telling On the night when Mark Wylder had left Brandon in his company they had some angry talk Lake s object being to induce Mark to abandon his engagement with Dorcas Brandon He told Stanley that he would not give up Dorcas but that he Lake must fight him and go to Boulogne for the purpose and they should arrange matters so that one or other must fall Lake laughed quietly at the proposition and Mark retorted by telling him he would so insult him if he declined as to compel a meeting When they reached that lonely path near the flight of stone steps Stanley distinctly threatened his companion with a disclosure of the scandalous incident in the card room of the club which he afterwards related substantially as it had happened to Jos Larkin When he took this decisive step Lake s nerves were strung I dare say to a high pitch of excitement Mark Wylder he knew carried pistols and all things considered he thought it just possible he might use them He did not but he struck Lake with the back of his hand in the face and Lake who walked by his side with his fingers on the handle of a dagger in his coat pocket instantly retorted with a stab which he repeated as Mark fell He solemnly averred that he never meant to have used the dagger except to defend his life That he struck in a state of utter confusion and when he saw Mark dead with his feet on the path and his head lying over the edge he would have given a limb almost to bring him back The terror of discovery and ruin instantly supervened He propped the body against the bank and tried to stanch the bleeding But there could be no doubt that he was actually dead He got the body easily down the nearly precipitous declivity Lake was naturally by no means wanting in resource and a certain sort of coolness which supervened when the momentary distraction was over He knew it would not do to leave the body so among the rocks and brambles He recollected that only fifty yards back they had passed a spade and pick lying with some other tools by the side of the path near that bit of old wall which was being removed Like a man doing things in a dream without thought or trouble only waiting and listening for a moment before he disturbed them he took away the implements which he required and when about to descend a sort of panic and insurmountable disgust seized him and in a state of supernatural dismay he felt for a while disposed to kill himself In that state it was he reached Redman s Farm and his interview with Rachel occurred It was the accidental disclosure of the blood in which his shirt sleeve was soaked that first opened Rachel s eyes to the frightful truth After her first shock all her terrors were concentrated on the one point Stanley s imminent danger He must be saved She made him return she even accompanied him as far as the top of the rude flight of steps I have mentioned so often and there awaited his return the condition imposed by his cowardice and made more dreadful by the circumstance that they had heard retreating footsteps along the walk and Stanley saw the tall figure of Uncle Julius or Lorne as he called himself turning the far corner There was a long wait here lest he should return but he did not appear and Stanley though I now believe observed by this strange being executed his horrible task replaced the implements and returned to Rachel and with her to Redman s Farm where his cool cunning once more ascendant he penned those forgeries closing them with Mark Wylder s seal which he compelled his sister quite unconscious of all but that their despatch by post at the periods pencilled upon them was essential to her wretched brother s escape It was the success of this his first stratagem which suggested that long series of frauds which with the aid of Jim Dutton selected for his striking points of resemblance to Mark Wylder had been carried on for so long with such consummate art in a different field It was Lake s ungoverned fury when Larkin discovered the mistake in posting the letters in wrong succession which so nearly exploded his ingenious system He wrote in terms which roused Jim Dutton s wrath Jim had been spinning theories about the reasons of his mysterious though very agreeable occupation and announced them broadly in his letter to Larkin But he had cooled by the time he reached London and the letter from Lake received at his mother s and appointing the meeting at Brandon quieted that mutiny I never heard that Jim gave any member of the family the least trouble afterward He handed to Lord Chelford a parcel of those clever and elaborate forgeries with which Lake had last furnished him with a pencilled note on each directing the date and town at which it was to be despatched Years after when Jim was emigrating I believe Lord Chelford gave him a handsome present Lord Chelford was advised by the friend whom he consulted that he need not make those painful particulars public affecting only a dead man and leading to no result Lake admitted that Rachel had posted the letters in London believing them to be genuine for he pretended that they were Wylder s It is easy to look grave over poor Rachel s slight and partly unconscious share in the business of the tragedy But what girl of energy and strong affections would have had the melancholy courage to surrender her brother to public justice under the circumstances Lord Chelford who knew all says that she acted nobly Now Joseph being a just man was minded to put her away privily The law being what That she was to be publicly stigmatised and punished His justice being what Simply that he would have her to be neither but screened and parted with privily Let the Pharisees who would have summum jus against their neighbours remember that God regards the tender and compassionate who forbears on occasion to put the law in motion as the just man The good vicar is a great territorial magnate now but his pleasures and all his ways are still simple He never would enter Brandon as its master and never will during Dorcas Brandon s lifetime And although with her friend Rachel Lake she lives abroad chiefly in Italy and Switzerland Brandon Hall by the command of its proprietor lies always at her disposal I don t know whether Rachel Lake will ever marry The tragic shadow of her life has not chilled Lord Chelford s strong affection Neither does the world know or suspect anything of the matter Old Tamar died three years since and lies in the pretty little churchyard of Gylingden And Mark s death is by this time a nearly forgotten mystery Jos Larkins s speculations have not turned out luckily The trustees of Wylder a minor tried as they were advised they must his title to Five Oaks by ejectment A point had been overlooked as sometimes happens and Jos Larkin was found to have taken but an estate for the life of Mark Wylder which terminated at his decease The point was carried on to the House of Lords but the decision of the court below was ultimately affirmed The flexible and angry Jos Larkin then sought to recoup himself out of the assets of the deceased captain but here he failed In his cleverness lest the inadequate purchase money should upset his bargain he omitted the usual covenant guaranteeing the vendor s title to sell the fee simple and recited moreover that grave doubts existing on the point it was agreed that the sum paid should not exceed twelve years purchase Jos then could only go upon the point that it was known to Lake at the period of the sale that Mark Wylder was dead Unluckily however for Jos s case one of his clever letters written during the negotiation turned up and was put in evidence in which he pressed Captain Lake with the fact that he the purchaser was actually in possession of information to the effect that Mark was dead and that he was therefore buying under a liability of having his title litigated with a doubtful result the moment he should enter into possession This shut up the admirable man who next tried a rather bold measure directed against the Reverend William Wylder A bill was filed by Messrs Burlington and Smith to compel him to execute a conveyance to their client on the terms of the agreement The step was evidently taken on the calculation that he would strike and offer a handsome compromise but Lord Chelford was at his elbow the suit was resisted Messrs Burlington and Smith did not care to run the awful risk which mister Larkin behind the scenes invited them to accept for his sake There was first a faltering then a bold renunciation and exposure of mister Jos Larkin by the firm who though rather lamely exonerated themselves as having been quite taken in by the Gylingden attorney mister Jos Larkin had a holy reliance upon his religious reputation which had always stood him in stead But a worldly judge will sometimes disappoint the expectations of the Christian suitor and the language of the Court in commenting upon mister Jos Larkin was I am sorry to say in the highest degree offensive flagitious fraudulent and kindred epithets were launched against that tall bald head in a storm that darkened the air and obliterated the halo that usually encircled it He was dismissed in a tempest with costs He vanished from court like an evil spirit into the torture chamber of taxation The whole structure of rapine and duplicity had fallen through with a dismal crash Shrewd fellows wondered as they always do when a rash game breaks down at the infatuation of the performer But the cup of his tribulation was not yet quite full Jos Larkin s name was ultimately struck from the roll of solicitors and attorneys and there were minute and merciless essays in the papers surrounding his disgrace with a dreadful glare People say he has not enough left to go on with He had lodgings somewhere near Richmond as Howard Larkin esquire and is still a religious character I am told that he shifts his place of residence about once in six months and that he has never paid one shilling of rent for any and has sometimes positively received money for vacating his abode So substantially valuable is a thorough acquaintance with the capabilities of the law I saw honest Tom Wealdon about a fortnight ago grown stouter and somewhat more phlegmatic by time but still the same in good nature and inquisitiveness From him I learned that Jos Larkin is likely to figure once more in the courts about some very ugly defalcations in the cash of the Penningstal Mining Company and that this time the persecutions of that eminent Christian are likely to take a different turn and as Tom said with a gloomy shrewdness to end in ten years penal Some summers ago I was for a few days in the wondrous city of Venice Everyone knows something of the enchantment of the Italian moon the expanse of dark and flashing blue and the phantasmal city rising like a beautiful spirit from the waters Gliding near the Lido where so many rings of Doges lie lost beneath the waves I heard the pleasant sound of female voices upon the water and then with a sudden glory rose a sad wild hymn like the musical wail of the forsaken sea The spouseless Adriatic mourns her lord The song ceased The gondola which bore the musicians floated by a slender hand over the gunwale trailed its fingers in the water Unseen I saw Rachel and Dorcas beautiful in the sad moonlight passed so near we could have spoken passed me like spirits never more it may be to cross my sight in life End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Wylder s Hand by J Sheridan Le Fanu END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WYLDER S HAND
