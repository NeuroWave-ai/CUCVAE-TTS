none	none	Adams in he asked as the young lady arose to meet him What name please was the counter question and the young lady gave the visitor a keen glance Raymond Case The young man brought forth his card Tell mister Adams I am the son of the late Wilbur Case and wish to see him on important business The young lady disappeared through a door leading to an inner apartment From this she entered another apartment much larger and overlooking the little city park far below The room was filled with books and pictures and some wall brackets contained several bits of finely carved statuary There was one large roller top desk and three comfortable leather chairs At the desk sat a man of uncertain age with a strong face a somewhat bald head and eyes that were neither light nor dark The man was of ordinary height but muscular to a surprising degree His face showed a high order of intelligence and his mouth a determination not easily thrust aside A gentleman to see you said the young lady She placed the card before him He told me to tell you that he is the son of the late Wilbur Case and wishes to see you on important business The man at the desk drew a long breath and looked up from a slip of paper which he had been studying through a microscope Raymond Case eh All right Letty show him in In another moment the visitor was in the private office Adam Adams arose and gave him a warm handshake Glad to meet you mister Case he said cordially I knew your late father quite well a fine man a very fine man

none	none	and the office door was carefully closed Then came a brief pause during which Raymond Case cleared his throat several times mister Adams you do not know much about me but I know a great deal about you he commenced Three or four years ago you recovered some stolen mining shares for my father and last year you cleared up the Sandford mystery after the police and the other detectives had failed completely Adam Adams bowed He rarely spoke unless there was occasion for it May I ask if you are now at liberty pursued the young man At liberty Bless you no I have half a dozen cases on hand Two here in the city one over in New Jersey one in Yonkers and But you will undertake a case for me if I pay you well for it won t you interrupted the young man eagerly Don t say no please don t And there was a ring of agony in his speech I am depending upon you The detective paused before replying and looked the young man over with care The clean cut features showed not a sign of dissipation and the expression was honesty itself Certainly the young man had not gotten into trouble on his own account I should want to know something about the case before I promised to do anything Certainly of course The young man cleared his throat again You can tell me what the trouble is and if I decline to take the case I will give you my promise not to say a word to any outsider of what has passed between us
6701_71404_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh 
none	none	I know I can trust you mister Adams otherwise I should not have called here My father said you were the squarest man he had ever dealt with I came to see you about the Langmore affair You mean the murder of mister and missus Barry Langmore at Beechwood Hill Yes Adam Adams was surprised although he did not show it What had this rich young man who lived in Orange New Jersey and did business in Wall Street to do with that double tragedy which had so shocked the community I presume you know some of the particulars of the sad affair resumed Raymond Case The newspapers have been full of it I know that the pair were found murdered I have not looked into details being so busy with other matters It was an outrageous deed mister Adams cried the young man jumping up and beginning to pace the floor One of the foulest of which I have ever heard A murder is always foul no matter under what circumstances it is committed What do you wish me to do Find the murderer That may not be easy Are not other detectives already working on the case Yes but they are only local men and not worth their salt They may be doing all that can be done It is a mistake to presume that every mystery of this sort can be solved Here in New York men go to their death every year and nobody ever finds out
6544_71420_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 how 
none	none	or by what hand But the local men simply jump at conclusions They are a set of blind fools and The young man stopped short Adam Adams smiled faintly He knew something of the bungling work done by detectives of small caliber Had he not himself once saved a poor Jew from hanging after several country detectives had apparently proved the fellow guilty And had not those same sleuths of the law been angry at him ever since Excuse me mister Case but how is it that you take an interest in this affair he asked Are you related to the Langmores in any way I am not The young man began to blush Is it necessary that I tell you why he stammered It is not necessary for you to tell me anything responded the detective dryly I didn t mean to say Let me give you a word of advice

none	none	try to get a detective to do anything for you unless you are willing to tell him all you know and all you suspect It is generally hard enough to solve an enigma without having other mysteries attached to it The young man lowered his face and looked confused for a moment Then I will tell you everything he said You may take notes if you wish It is not necessary since I have a good memory The Langmores lived just on the outskirts of the town on the road leading to Sidham which is several miles distance I have a general idea of the location The house is a fine old fashioned stone mansion setting well back from the road and surrounded by a well kept lawn and numerous trees and bushes At the rear of the garden is a small stream which flows into the river a mile and a half below Is the place surrounded by a fence On two sides only In the front there is a hedge and in the rear the little stream forms the boundary of the property I understand At the time of the tragedy there were four persons in the house so far as known mister and missus Langmore mister Langmore s daughter Margaret and a servant Mary Billings Wait a moment You said mister Langmore s daughter Was she not missus Langmore s daughter also No You see mister Langmore was a widower when he married the present missus Langmore who was a widow There are two sets of children I understand When did the tragedy occur At some time between eleven and twelve in the morning During that time Margaret Langmore was in her room writing several letters and was practicing on the piano in the parlor The house is a large one with sixteen rooms and several hallways and stairs Where was the servant In the kitchen and out to the barn There are two other girls but one is in the hospital sick and the other was to town on an errand Where were mister and missus Langmore The daughter thought her stepmother had gone out to visit a neighbor as she had said something about doing so earlier in the morning mister Langmore had gone to the bank in town at nine o clock and Margaret saw him 
6544_71420_000018_000001	train-clean-360	come 
none	none	home about half past ten or eleven What was she doing at the time Practicing on the piano She heard her father go directly to his library which is situated across the hallway from the parlor She heard the door shut and then went on with her practicing Did she hear anything in the library She thinks she heard something but is not sure She was practicing a very difficult piece by Wagner And it was loud enough to drown out every other sound That s it When the clock struck twelve she stopped practicing to learn if lunch was ready She also wanted to speak to her father and so crossed the hallway and opened the library door The young man s voice began to tremble a little She found her father stretched lifeless in an armchair How had he been killed That is a part of the mystery He was either choked or smothered to death or else he was poisoned The doctors don t seem to be able to get at the bottom of it For the first time since Raymond Case had begun his recital Adam Adams began to show an interest If the man was strangled his throat should show the marks he observed There are no marks and the doctors have found no trace of poison Humph The detective rubbed his chin reflectively What next Margaret Langmore was so horrified she ran from the room screaming wildly Her shrieks brought the servant to the spot and a minute later two of the neighbors missus Bardon and her son Alfred came over from next door Where was missus Langmore at this time Nobody knew Alfred Bardon is a physician and thinking there might still be a spark of life in mister Langmore did all he possibly could to resuscitate the gentleman The servant girl ran upstairs to find some drugs for him and in the upper hallway stumbled over the dead body of missus Langmore And how had she died In the same manner as her husband This news of a double tragedy was too much for Margaret and she fainted The others notified more of the neighbors and the police and of course the news spread like wildfire I was stopping at the Beechwood Hotel at the time and as soon as I heard of the tragedy I jumped into an automobile that was handy and rode over Then you arrived at the house about as soon as the police A little before What did you see Just what I have told you The doctor had been trying to bring mister Langmore around but had suddenly been taken sick and could do nothing Humph sick eh Did he say what made him sick He did not know He thought it might be from leaning over the dead man or from working in that position I think the sudden sickness frightened him a little When the police arrived what did they find of importance Nothing Had anything been stolen Nothing so far as they could learn Of course you must have known these folks pretty well to take such an interest I knew mister Langmore very well and I was acquainted with his wife Adam Adams knit his brow for a moment and tapped lightly on his desk with his forefinger Have the police any idea as to how the murderer got into the house and got out again he asked At this question Raymond Case s face flushed They do not think the murderer left the house he answered in a low tone CHAPTER II LOVE UNDER A SHADOW Raymond Case dropped back into his chair and buried his face in his hands Adam Adams eyed him curiously and with something of a fatherly glance It is plain to see what his trouble is thought the detective He is in love He was right Raymond Case was furiously desperately hopelessly in love He had met Margaret Langmore at Bar Harbor but a few short weeks before and it had been a case of love at first sight upon both sides A few automobile rides and a few dances and he had proposed and been accepted and he had counted himself the happiest man in all this wide world And now Then they suspect the servant girl queried Adam Adams knowing they did nothing of the sort No came sharply They suspect Margaret Miss Langmore
6701_71402_000123_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah 
none	none	Yes It is is preposterous absurd but they insist And that is what has brought me to you I want to prove her innocence to the world Do that and you can name your own price mister Adams You have a high regard for the young lady you are close friends More I may as well tell you though so far Margaret and I have kept the matter more or less a secret I love her and we are engaged to be married Did mister Langmore know of his daughter s engagement He did and he approved of it And what of missus Langmore didn t she
6701_71401_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 approve 
none	none	She did not know of it Margaret did not tell her Why not Because well the young lady and her stepmother did not get along very well together Margaret wanted to be friendly but missus Langmore was very dictatorial and besides she loved her own children better than mister Langmore s Let me ask was the daughter on good terms with her father Yes excepting on one point He wished her to obey her stepmother and that
6701_71402_000122_000000	train-clean-360	 she was not 
none	none	always willing to do This brought on a run of petty quarrels which fairly made Margaret sick And this is the reason why the police think Miss Langmore the guilty person It is Their theory is that she first quarrelled with her stepmother and murdered her and then struck down her father to cover her guilt he having discovered what she was doing How old is Miss Langmore She has just passed her twenty third birthday Humph Rather young to commit such a cold blooded crime as this She never did do it I ll wager my life on it Oh it s absurd insulting But what are you going to do with a lot of pig headed country police How did they come to suspect her Was there nothing else Yes there was missus Bardon the woman who lives next door is a great gossip and one who is continually poking her nose into other folks business She told the police that she was out in the garden cutting a bouquet early in the morning and she heard a violent quarrel going on at the breakfast table between missus Langmore and Margaret and that mister Langmore took his wife s part Margaret wished to give a small house party and missus Langmore would not listen to it Did missus Bardon hear all that was said No only enough to make her run to the police with the tale Is any other house near by The Harrison mansion but it is locked up as the family is in Europe Did you hear if missus Bardon and her son were home all morning They were excepting when the doctor went out to make some calls between nine and eleven Did they see any suspicious characters around the Langmore mansion Not a soul Did Mary Billings the servant see anybody She thinks she saw somebody near the river but she is not sure in fact she is so scared that she is all mixed up She has told the police a thousand times that she had nothing to do with the crime Did Miss Langmore see anybody She saw a Doctor Bird pass in his buggy and a farmer named Carboy go by on foot When was this While she was at the piano She doesn t know the exact time There was a pause and the detective gave a faraway look out of the window and down the bustling thoroughfare So far as you are aware mister Case did mister Langmore have any personal enemies I never heard of any He was rich Yes What was his business He was a dealer in patents and a promoter Some thought he was rather eccentric but I never found him so He used to have an office here in New York but gave that up a year ago Well what is your idea of this crime I haven t any But I know Margaret Langmore is not guilty Evidently if they suspect her they have concluded that missus Langmore was killed first That is their idea but it looks to me as if both were killed at about the same time although I know that couldn t very well be No not if one was upstairs and the other down Do you think it possible that one killed the other and then committed suicide At this Raymond Case started back I had not thought of that he cried If it is true then that clears Margaret Evidently he was thinking only of the girl he loved everything else concerning the mystery was of secondary consideration Such a thing is possible although not probable unless the two had a bitter quarrel between themselves Every crime must have a motive People do not commit murder unless there is a reason for it or unless they are insane Motives may be divided into three classes jealousy revenge or gain In this instance I think we can throw out jealousy missus Langmore was jealous of Margaret And wasn t the young lady jealous of her stepmother in a way But she is not guilty I ll stake my life on her innocence Then let us come down to revenge or gain You say nothing was stolen Was there a safe in the house Yes and it is closed and will remain so until the experts open it Nobody knew the combination but mister Langmore That s it Margaret did know but her stepmother had her father change the combination and keep it to himself Had he much money in the house I think not Margaret says her father was in the habit of depositing cash in the bank as soon as he received it What sort of promoting did he do He organized companies to manufacture his patents He also speculated in real estate and in mortgages He owned two buildings in this city and several in the country Who are the other members of the family Margaret s married sister missus Andrew Wetherby of Sanhope and missus Langmore s two sons Tom and Dick Ostrello Where are these people located missus Wetherby is traveling with her husband in South America The Ostrello brothers are commercial travelers and somewhere on the road Then the Ostrellos are not rich No they are poor and missus Ostrello was poor too before she married mister Langmore There was another pause Can you tell me
6701_71404_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 anything else 
none	none	asked Adam Adams Nothing of much importance It s a deep mystery isn t it Yes it s very simplicity makes it deep The detective drew a long breath I was thinking of taking a vacation My doctor says I need it Oh There was a world of disappointment in the word Don t say that You must take hold of this I planned it all out as I came to town I know you can clear Margaret if you will only try Think of her position the disgrace my position Oh you can t refuse me mister Adams The young man came closer and caught the detective by the shoulder If it s money set your price If I take hold I ll charge you only what is fair mister Case But I never take a case unless Any request you have to make is already granted Unless I can first interview the person who stands accused of the crime You can see Miss Langmore at any time I told her that I was coming to town to interview you and that I would bring you back with me if you would come I told her what a wonderful man you were and what you had done for others I think it cheered her a little although she was terribly cast down You must not promise too much on my account young man I am no wizard and I cannot perform the impossible much as I might wish to do so But you will come Yes I will come At once cried Raymond Case impatiently At once CHAPTER III MARGARET LANGMORE As Raymond Case had said the Langmore mansion was a large one setting in the midst of an extensive lawn sprinkled here and there with maples and oaks and fine flowering bushes The hedge in front was well kept and the side fences were also in good repair In the rear was a stable and also an automobile shed for the late master of this estate had been fond of a dash in his runabout when time permitted Down by the brook back of the stable was a tiny wharf where a boat was tied up a craft which Margaret Langmore had occasionally taken down to the river for a row The mansion now looked dark and lonesome although many folks passed on the highway and whispered to each other that there was the spot where the gruesome tragedy had been committed And to think that the man s own daughter did it they would generally add Beats all how bloodthirsty some folks can get He must have cut her short on money or something and she was too high strung to stand it No it ain t that another would answer She s been flirting around with a certain young man a Wall Street gambler and her mother wouldn t have it and told her so That s the real trouble my way of thinking Inside of the house all was as quiet as a tomb save for the ticking of the long clock in the lower hall Below a single policeman was on guard in company with a woman who had been sent in to help Upstairs another woman was stationed to see that Margaret Langmore might not take it upon herself to leave for parts unknown Margaret sat in her own room in the wing on the second floor a dainty apartment trimmed in blue and containing all her girlish treasures On the walls were numerous photographs of her old schoolmates and the flag of the seminary she had attended And on the mantel rested the picture of Raymond Case the high polish of the surface marred in one spot where a tear had fallen upon it The girl was tall and slender with a wealth of light brown hair and eyes of deepest blue It was more than a pretty face for it had a certain sadness that was touching For several minutes the girl had not moved Now as the door opened and the woman who was on guard upstairs came in she gave a long sigh Can

none	none	anything asked the woman in a voice that was not unkindly Nothing thank you missus Morse Would you like a cup of tea or a bit of toast missus Jessup can make it easy enough she has nothing at all to do I do not care to touch a thing The answer came in a dreary monotone The girl s trials were beginning to tell upon her At first she had tried to bear up bravely and the words Raymond had spoken had comforted her but now he was gone and the whole world looked dark once more Has anybody called she asked at length Nobody to see you Nobody Margaret began to pace the floor When did the coroner say the examination was to be continued she went on To morrow morning at eleven o clock And who is to be put on the stand At this question the woman in charge began to fidget Excuse me miss but I was ordered not to answer questions I m sorry and I wish you wouldn t worry so much If I can do anything else You can do nothing At that moment came the sounds of carriage wheels and a cab from the depot drew up to the door Margaret looked through the slats of a blind and saw that the arrivals were Raymond Case and a stranger a man wearing a rather ordinary suit of clothing and a rough slouch hat Thank Heaven Raymond has brought somebody murmured the girl There was a short consultation at the front door and she heard the young man say He has a perfect right here and I demand admittance for us both Then another murmur followed and the pair came upstairs They knocked on the door of Margaret s room and were admitted and missus Morse was told that she might go This gentleman has come to give Miss Langmore some advice said Raymond Case If we want you we will call But I have orders Miss Langmore will remain in this room so you have nothing to fear She has a legal right to receive advice Oh if the gentleman is a lawyer I have nothing to say was the retort and missus Morse swept from the room The instant she was gone the young man closed the door and then rushed up to Margaret Langmore and kissed her I have succeeded he cried I told you I would This is mister Adam Adams mister Adams this is Miss Margaret Langmore Now I guess we are going to show these country bumpkins a thing or two he added earnestly The detective advanced and shook hands Margaret Langmore was a trifle disappointed in his appearance and her face clouded for an instant Raymond was quick to notice it You mustn t judge a man by his appearance mister Adams makes himself look that way on purpose He s the smartest swiftest That will do interrupted the detective with a brief smile Will you help me The girl eyed the detective squarely I I need help so much I must hear your story first Oh I thought Raymond would tell you everything He has told me all he knows But I want to hear the story from your own lips Something may have slipped him you know I will tell you everything Please sit down Margaret Langmore began her narrative It was fully an hour before she finished Occasionally the detective asked a question but for the most part he sat back with his eyes closed as if thinking of something else Now Miss Langmore he exclaimed as he straightened up at the conclusion of her recital whom do you suspect of this crime I suspect no one sir Have you any idea why this awful deed was committed The detective had been on the point of saying murder but had checked himself Not the least in the world Some of the windows were of course open What of the doors The front door and that to the side piazza were locked The back door was open Then a person might have sneaked in by the back way I presume so Your father was quite dead when you found him asked the detective quickly I I thought so The girl began to choke up and sob It it was such a shock I I She could not go on Adam Adams watched her keenly and noted how she trembled from head to foot Do not take it so hard Margaret put in Raymond Case placing his hand upon her shoulder 
6637_71405_000025_000003	train-clean-360	It will all come out right 
none	none	in the end I am sure of it But it will not bring back my father sobbed the girl And he was so dear to me And to think that we should quarrel at all The quarrel took place at the breakfast table so you said came from Adam Adams And you rushed out to get away from what your stepmother was saying to you Yes I could not bear it any longer Your father took missus Langmore s part He did but at the same time he told her not to be so hard on me that I had been without a mother to guide me so many years and all that Do you think they quarreled between themselves after you left or after your father came back from the bank I cannot say as to that mister Adams has an idea that possibly one or the other of them was responsible put in Raymond He thinks one might have killed the other and then committed suicide I do not think so I said it was possible corrected the detective In taking up an affair of this sort one must look at it from all sides I do not believe my father either killed her or committed suicide answered Margaret Langmore firmly Do you think missus Langmore would act in such a fashion The girl pondered for a moment Honestly I do not She may have killed my father but if so she would have run away The safe was closed at the time of the tragedy Yes And absolutely nothing was stolen Nothing so far as we have been able to ascertain Was anything out of order as if the assassin had been scared off while hunting around for something to steal I did not see anything But I was so upset I noticed scarcely anything That was natural of course The safe has not yet been opened No we are waiting for a man to come from the safe makers Now one thing more After you came back to the house before practicing what did you do I wrote some letters to girl friends telling them I could not give a house party And before that I I must I tell I threw myself on the bed yonder for a good cry It was silly I know but but Did you hear anything unusual while you were here Think carefully I have tried to think it out several times Sometimes I think I heard some sort of a shriek but I am not at all certain Then again I think I heard the fall of something heavy on the floor But it may be all fancy And that is all you can tell me Yes Margaret Langmore gave a long sigh Oh mister Adams can you not do something for me It is horrible to be suspected in this fashion I cannot make a move without being watched It is certainly a cruel situation The detective paused I am sure of one thing Miss Langmore And that is That you are innocent Those who think you are guilty are fools as mister Case says Yet more than half the folks around here think that way Let them We ll set to work to prove their mistake Good almost shouted Raymond Case and his face broke out into a look of relief Then you will take the case mister Adams I will I know you will succeed If you do succeed I shall be grateful to you all my life came from Margaret Langmore warmly CHAPTER IV DETECTIVE AND DOCTOR As already intimated Adam Adams in his career as an investigator and detective had solved many difficult criminal problems yet this somewhat remarkable individual realized that the mystery before him was as difficult of solution as any he had yet encountered The most tantalizing thing about the whole affair was its simplicity Two people had been murdered in their own home in broad daylight No one had been seen around the place and even the manner in which the foul deed had been committed was a secret A score of possibilities presented themselves to his mind when he left Margaret Langmore and Raymond Case to begin the task he had set before himself to clear the fair name of the beautiful girl who had placed her faith in him and his ability I ll take a look around the house first he reasoned Then I ll find out a little more about these dead folks and their connections Thinking that he must be some noted lawyer from New York missus Morse was very gracious to him and readily consented to show him around Here is the spot where missus Langmore s body was found said the woman leading the way to a bend in the upper hallway The servant girl tripped over it in her hurry and went sprawling She was about scared out of her wits Naturally enough Do you know how the body was lying At full length they say face downward and with the fists clenched Was that window open Yes but not the blinds Where does that door lead to missus Langmore s dressing room The door was open when they found her as if she had come out and was trying to get downstairs Humph The detective pushed the blinds of the window open and began to examine the carpet on the floor We ve looked around but we couldn t see a thing pursued the woman We Who The coroner and the police officers Oh You say the body was lying right here Yes the head there and the feet there I suppose you are going to try to clear Miss Langmore aren t you went on missus Morse curiously I am if she is innocent You ll have a task doing it Everybody around here thinks her guilty To this Adam Adams did not reply He was down on his hands and knees close to where the head of the murdered woman had rested He placed his nose to the carpet and drew in a long breath His olfactory nerves were sensitive and detected a certain pungent stinging odor of a sort not easily forgotten You must be pretty short sighted was the woman s comment The sight of the man on his hands and knees amused her Well I might have a better pair of eyes I admit From his examination of the carpet the detective turned to the window Outside was the roof to the side piazza of the mansion On the tin roof were some dried up spots of mud He looked them over carefully and came to the conclusion that they were footprints but how old was a question When did it rain last around here he asked We haven t had a real storm for ten days or two weeks We have had several showers though He took a glance into missus Langmore s dressing room Everything was in perfect order even to the powder box and the cologne bottles on the dresser That is all I wish to see up here he said and passed below where he encountered the policeman in charge Like the woman this officer had taken him to be a lawyer and he readily consented to let the detective inspect the library mister Langmore was found in that chair said he He looked as if he had suffered great pain before he died I think he was strangled although he didn t show the marks of it The library was a richly furnished apartment Along two walls were rows of costly volumes many relating to modern inventions On the walls hung some rare steel engravings including one of Fulton and his first steamboat There was a large library table with a student s lamp a mahogany roller top desk half a dozen comfortable chairs and a small but well built safe which as said before was closed and locked The coroner locked and sealed the desk and put all the loose papers in it said the policeman There were two windows to the library and one was close to the side porch the roof of which the detective had examined from above A person dropping from above could easily have entered the library by the window thus saving himself the trouble of walking through the halls and down the stairs Adam Adams looked outside and saw on the ground a number of footprints some running to a gravel path but a few feet away Where are the bodies he asked as he continued his examination of the room At Camboin s morgue The doctors have been looking for poison but they can t find any The detective got down in front of the safe and examined it critically Had it been opened after the murder and then closed again That was an important question but he was unable to answer it More by instinct than anything else he got down and peered under the safe A crumpled up bit of paper caught his eye and he picked it up and slipped it into his pocket without the policeman being the wiser Has anybody else been here he asked I mean any outsiders A good many folks from the village Anybody else Yes a detective from Brooklyn He thought there might be a job for him but there wasn t so he went away and the policeman smiled grimly What was his name I think he said it was Peterson Is that the Bardon house yonder And Adam Adams pointed through the window and across the side lawn Yes Doctor Bardon was the first to come over he and his mother So I heard I think I ll step over and speak to them a moment So you are working for Miss Langmore Yes in a way You ll have an uphill job clearing her The coroner thinks he has a clear case against her Do you know what evidence he possesses Not exactly He isn t telling all he knows returned the officer of the law There is the doctor now A buggy was coming down the road It turned in at the next house and a young man carrying a small case leaped out and disappeared into the dwelling In a few minutes more Adam Adams made his way next door An elderly servant admitted him and ushered him into the doctor s office where the young physician sat marking down some calls in his notebook This is Doctor Bardon I believe I just came over from the Langmore house I am working on this mystery and I understand you were the physician who tried to bring mister and missus Langmore to life after they were found I worked over mister Langmore yes was the young physician s answer I saw at once that it was impossible to do anything for his wife She had a weak heart naturally and was stone dead some time before I got there You thought you saw a spark of life in mister Langmore Not exactly a spark but I thought there might be hope But I was mistaken although I did everything I could I have been told that working over the corpse made you sick At these words the face of the young physician showed his annoyance He drew himself up Excuse me but you are and he paused inquiringly I am working on this case in the interests of Miss Langmore My name is Adams Oh What I would like to know is What made you sick Was it merely that a crime had been committed something you were not accustomed to No it was not mister Adams I am young I know but I have had a good hospital experience and such things do not unnerve me To be sure mister Langmore was a good neighbor and I thought much of him But it was not that Then 
6701_71404_000037_000001	train-clean-360	what was it 
none	none	It was something about the corpse As I worked I had to sneeze something seemed to get into my nose and throat and in a minute more I began to have cramps and grew deathly sick It was the queerest sensation I ever experienced in my life I haven t gotten over it yet You had to go out to get some fresh air I did If I had not I think I should have suffered much more And you found no trace of any poison or anything of that sort Not the slightest Another doctor was called in and then I went back The peculiar odor or whatever it was was gone and I could find no further trace of it You think it must have
6701_71401_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 evaporated 
6701_71402_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 What else 
none	none	is there to think The windows and blinds had been thrown wide open and the sun was shining into the room This was all the young doctor could tell and as he was in a hurry to get away on more business the detective did not detain him further He ascertained that missus Bardon was also away and then left the house In his pocket he still carried the bit of paper which he had picked up from under the safe It had evidently been part of the wrapper around some small object and bore the following printed in blue ink nder company ley Street ter N Y ark The paper might be valuable and it might be worthless It had evidently been around a small box or bottle The address was evidently that of some firm doing business in some town in New York State What the ark could stand for he could not surmise As the detective left the Bardon house he saw a middle aged man entering the Langmore mansion The man was well dressed and carried a dress suit case A visitor of some sort he mused Perhaps a relative When he stepped up on the piazza Raymond Case came out to meet him The young man wished to know if he had learned anything from the doctor Not a great deal answered Adam Adams Who was that man who just came in Thomas Ostrello one of missus Langmore s sons by her first husband Is he a frequent visitor here I believe not He is a commercial traveler and on the road nearly all the time Has he been here since the tragedy No He was here the day before it occurred but went away in the evening I suppose his mother s death has shocked him a good deal I believe you said the Ostrellos are not well off No they are poor so Margaret told me Both of the sons are on the road one for a paint house and this one for a drug house By the way I am going to town to see the coroner Do you want to come along No I ll see him later I want to take a walk around this place first I may pick up a stray clue Left to himself Adam Adams walked slowly around the mansion noting the several approaches He looked in at the stable and the automobile shed and strolled down to the brook He made no noise for it was his practice to move about as silently as possible and without attracting attention Suddenly he halted and stepped out of sight behind some bushes not far away from the brook He heard a splashing which told him that somebody was near CHAPTER V THE MAN AT THE BROOK Beside the brook stood a shabbily dressed man apparently fifty five or sixty years old 
6674-71396-0000	train-other-500	He wore an old rusty black coat and a soft hat with a hole in it His face was tanned and partly covered with a beard The man was acting in a manner to excite anybody s curiosity He carried a stick in his hand and was poking around in the water with it
none	none	 Every once in a while he looked around to see if anybody was observing him 
6674-71396-0001	train-other-500	Straining his eyes Adam Adams saw a strip of white floating on the water Once or twice it disappeared Finally the end of the strip caught on an overhanging bush and then the strange man withdrew his cane from the brook
6674-71396-0002	train-other-500	As he turned around the detective dodged out of sight Apparently satisfied that he was not observed the strange man leaned down at the bank of the brook took something from his pocket and placed it down on the moist dirt
6674-71396-0003	train-other-500	Then he took another object from his pocket and repeated the operation Can they be shoes he has in his hands mused the detective And if they are what is he doing with them
6674-71396-0004	train-other-500	Hearing the slamming of a door at the mansion Adam Adams drew still further back among the bushes A minute later he saw the man make a long leap clear the brook and hurry away among the trees and brushwood on the other side
6674-71396-0005	train-other-500	Humph Perhaps this is worth investigating mused the detective and made his way to the spot the strange individual had occupied On the bank of the brook he saw the marks of the man s broad shoes
6674-71396-0006	train-other-500	and also some prints made by smaller shoes The latter prints were irregular and at once arrested the detective s attention He smiled grimly to himself Clue number one he muttered Adam Adams looked around in the water
6674-71396-0007	train-other-500	Soon he came upon the strip of white and pulling on it brought to light a white silk shirtwaist torn to ribbons in front and at one sleeve He wrung the water and mud from the garment and examined it
6674-71396-0008	train-other-500	Inside of the collar band were the initials M A L Margaret A Langmore he murmured Those initials are hers If the shirtwaist was hers how did that fellow get possession of it And did he place it here or find it here
6674-71396-0009	train-other-500	Drying the garment as much as possible he placed it in his pocket and continued his search around the vicinity He spent fully an hour in the locality and then walked back the way he had come and into the mansion
6674-71396-0010	train-other-500	There he found Thomas Ostrello In conversation with the policeman It is a terrible blow to me the commercial traveler was saying
none	none	 And to think I was here just the day before it happened 
6674-71396-0011	train-other-500	If I had remained here over night it might not have occurred at all Well that s the way things happen answered the policeman Once I was at one end of my beat when a thief broke into a store at the other end and stole sixteen dollars and two hams
6674-71396-0012	train-other-500	And I suppose they blamed you for it Sure they did I was laid off for a week without pay If anything happens it is always the poor copper who is to blame Well the family are not blaming you for this They can t
6674-71396-0013	train-other-500	especially as they ve got the person who did the deed At this Thomas Ostrello shrugged his shoulders I don t know about that You don t No I d hate to believe any girl could do such a fearful thing as this The commercial traveler paused
6701_71404_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know 
none	none	about that You don t No I d hate to believe any girl could do such a fearful thing as this The commercial traveler paused 
6674-71396-0014	train-other-500	I m going to take a look around I suppose it s all right Certainly mister Ostrello answered the policeman and then the commercial man stepped into the library closing the door after him Adam Adams had passed into the dining room just back of the library
6674-71396-0015	train-other-500	but had heard what was said Now looking through the doorway which had a sliding door and a heavy curtain the latter partly drawn he saw the man glance around hurriedly moving from one object to another in the library
none	none	 He looked under the table and the chairs in the corners 
6674-71396-0016	train-other-500	and even into the various bookcases
none	none	 Then he came and knelt down before the safe 
6674-71396-0017	train-other-500	and tried the knob of the combination half a dozen times He is more than ordinarily interested reasoned the detective But then it was his own mother who was murdered
6674-71396-0018	train-other-500	The commercial man continued his search until he had covered every object in the room several times He even looked behind the pictures and into the drawer of the table something which had escaped the coroner s eye when sealing up the desk
6674-71396-0019	train-other-500	Adam Adams saw him shake his head in despair He took a turn up and down the apartment and clenched his hands nervously Gone he muttered to himself What could have become of it
6674-71396-0020	train-other-500	He drew from his pocket a notebook he carried and studied several items carefully A long sigh escaped from his lips as he restored the notebook to his pocket
6674-71396-0021	train-other-500	As the commercial traveler moved toward the dining room the detective stepped into a side apartment used in the winter as a conservatory He saw Thomas Ostrello make an examination of several places including a sideboard
6674-71396-0022	train-other-500	Then the woman who had been placed in charge of the downstairs portion of the mansion entered Won t you have a bite to eat mister Ostrello she asked Perhaps so later on I do not feel like eating now Can I take a look at my mother s room
6674-71396-0023	train-other-500	Why yes I suppose you know where it is Certainly I often visited her there when she was not feeling well He passed out without another word and was soon mounting the heavily carpeted stairs Once in the room he closed the door tightly
6674-71396-0024	train-other-500	Coming up softly after him Adam Adams tried the door and found it locked More interested than ever the detective just avoiding missus Morse who was passing through the hallway slipped Into the adjoining room and finding as he had imagined
6674-71396-0025	train-other-500	a door between the two applied his eye to the keyhole This might mean nothing and it might mean everything He saw missus Langmore s son moving around the dressing room precisely as he had moved around the library
6674-71396-0026	train-other-500	He heard the bureau drawers opened and shut and then heard the squeak of a small writing desk that stood in a corner as the leaf was turned down Then came a rattle of papers and a sudden subdued exclamation
6674-71396-0027	train-other-500	The desk was closed again and the man came out of the room leaving the hall door partly open Whatever he was looking for he must have found it reasoned the detective Now what was it
6674-71396-0028	train-other-500	He waited in the hallway and heard Thomas Ostrello enter the dining room A minute later came the rattle of dishes Then missus Morse confronted him Back again I see she said rather sharply
6674-71396-0029	train-other-500	Yes I wish to have another talk with Miss Langmore he returned and brushing her aside knocked on the girl s door and was admitted The woman pursed up her lips How very important some of those city lawyers are she muttered
6674-71396-0030	train-other-500	Think they know it all I guess Well he ll have a job clearing her if what Coroner Busby says is true Oh I did not know you were coming back exclaimed Margaret Has anything happened
none	none	 I want to know something about this Miss Langmore and he brought out the torn and wet shirtwaist 
6674-71396-0031	train-other-500	Is it yours Oh certainly but where did it come from And it is all torn too It was almost new when I had it on last When was that The girl thought for a moment and then turned pale On the morning that that
6674-71396-0032	train-other-500	That the tragedy occurred Yes I don t know what made me put it on but I did And when did you take it off Why let me see Some time in the afternoon I think I I fainted and it got dirty
6674-71396-0033	train-other-500	and so I put on another and threw this in the clothes closet Are you certain you put it in the clothes closet Positive Where did you find it Never mind that just now
none	none	 Do you keep your shoes in that closet 
6674-71396-0034	train-other-500	I do But why Will you kindly see if all of your shoes are there The girl ran over opened the closet door and began an immediate examination One pair is missing a pair I use a great deal too she said a minute later
6674-71396-0035	train-other-500	Oh mister Adams what does this mean
none	none	 I don t know yet 
6674-71396-0036	train-other-500	While you are at it you might let me know if anything else is missing Margaret began a close examination of everything in the closet the detective watching her as keenly as he had before She is either innocent or else the greatest actress I ve ever met
6674-71396-0037	train-other-500	was his mental conclusion I think her innocent but the best of us get tripped up at times If she is innocent that evidence was manufactured to prove her guilty
none	none	 If only I had followed that man up 
6674-71396-0038	train-other-500	I might have learned something worth knowing Nothing else seems to be missing announced the girl at length Very well then don t waste time by searching further By the way did you know mister Thomas Ostrello had arrived
6674-71396-0039	train-other-500	Yes I told Raymond to telegraph for him He used to call quite often to see his mother What about the other son Dick I do not know where he is Didn t he come here He came once
6674-71396-0040	train-other-500	But he is a dissipated young man and I do not think my stepmother cared much for him But she did think a good deal of the one who is now downstairs Yes although they occasionally had their quarrels just as we had ours
6674-71396-0041	train-other-500	Tom would plead for his brother Dick who seemed to be always wanting money Once my father took a hand and said his wife shouldn t give Dick a cent more as he only squandered it That made Tom angry
none	none	 and he had a quarrel with my father 
6674-71396-0042	train-other-500	and after that when Tom came he would ask to see only his mother although he and I remained on fairly good terms Tom was here the day before the tragedy Yes I think he came to see his mother about some private business
6674-71396-0043	train-other-500	They had a long talk in her room and she seemed to be quite excited when he went away I don t know what it was all about But mister Adams are you not hungry and won t you have a lunch Thanks I ll take a bite
6674-71396-0044	train-other-500	The lunch was served in Margaret s apartment and the detective did ample Justice to it for he never allowed business to interfere with his appetite As he ate the girl watched him curiously mister Adams she said presently
none	none	 do you know you do not seem a bit like a detective to me I mean like the detectives you read about 
6674-71396-0045	train-other-500	the men going about in wonderful disguises and the like and doing marvelous things And yet I know you have a wonderful reputation Raymond told me about it At that he smiled broadly Wonderful disguises eh
6674-71396-0046	train-other-500	Well I use them when I think them necessary and not otherwise When I started out years ago I used a great many more than I do now To me a mystery of this sort is a good deal like a cut up picture that you give a child to put together
6674-71396-0047	train-other-500	First you want to make sure you have all the pieces and then you want to sit down put on your thinking cap and match the pieces together To you this is an awful tragedy his tone softened greatly
6674-71396-0048	train-other-500	to me it is another case nothing more Work such as I have done is bound to harden a fellow
6701_71404_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 nothing more 
none	none	Work such as I have done is bound to harden a fellow in spite of all of his finer feelings 
6674-71396-0049	train-other-500	But I feel for you and you have my sympathy And you will aid me You said you would she pleaded I am going to do what I can
none	none	 no man can do more CHAPTER VI THE MYSTERY DEEPENS From the Langmore mansion Adam Adams went to town and at the morgue made a careful inspection of the pair who had been the victims of the tragedy 
6674-71397-0001	train-other-500	This critical examination brought nothing new to light and he turned away from the place with something of disappointment I ll take a look around that brook again and see if that strange man is anywhere in sight he told himself and got back to the vicinity without delay
6674-71397-0002	train-other-500	Fortune favored him for once for scarcely had he reached the back of the Langmore mansion when he saw the stranger leap the brook again and come up towards the house Just in time murmured the detective He shall not slip me again in a hurry
none	none	 The stranger was very much on his guard and Adam Adams had all he could do to keep out of his sight 
6674-71397-0003	train-other-500	It was now growing dark especially under the trees which surrounded the mansion At length the fellow gained a point almost under one of the library windows He gazed around sharply and then appeared to be searching for something on the ground
6674-71397-0004	train-other-500	The detective saw him start to pick something up but at that moment the side door of the mansion opened and the policeman came out
none	none	 Hullo What are you doing here 
6674-71397-0005	train-other-500	demanded the officer Oh that s all right was the low answer Don t mind me But what are you doing here Just looking around that s all You haven t any right in this yard I think I have Who are you
6674-71397-0006	train-other-500	My name is Watkins Jack Watkins and then some words followed which Adam Adams did not catch Oh then I suppose that makes a difference
none	none	 came from the policeman in a more humble tone Do you want to come in the house and see Miss Langmore 
6674-71397-0007	train-other-500	No I don t want to see the girl But I ll come into the house answered the strange man and walked up the piazza steps and into the mansion with the policeman by his side
6674-71397-0008	train-other-500	As soon as the fellow was ought of sight Adam Adams drew closer and looked under the bushes where the other had been searching At first he saw nothing but then his keen eye detected a bit of paper caught at the foot of some shrubbery
6674-71397-0009	train-other-500	More documentary evidence perhaps he murmured as he shoved the paper into his pocket I wonder if this connects with the piece I found under the safe He approached the window the blinds of which were closed and peered through the slats
6674-71397-0010	train-other-500	A light had been lit and the policeman and the stranger had just entered the room I don t think you ll find much to interest you said the officer All of the others have hunted around and they didn t find much
6674-71397-0011	train-other-500	The stranger walked around the apartment slowly and then sank into an armchair Sit down and have a smoke with me he said pulling out his cigar case You ve got a long night before you I am not going to stay up all night
6674-71397-0012	train-other-500	The women folks and me are going to take turns They should have sent another man here but the Chief couldn t spare him two of the men being sick Cigars were lit and the pair smoked away for several minutes talking of the case in all of its details
6674-71397-0013	train-other-500	Evidently the stranger agreed with the general public regarding Margaret Langmore s guilt Of course she ll put on a good front
none	none	 said he blowing a ring of smoke into the air 
6674-71397-0014	train-other-500	She s that sort so I ve heard What does her stepbrother say about it Not much now At first he didn t think her guilty but after he talked with me and the women folks he changed his mind I reckon
6674-71397-0015	train-other-500	It s a blow to him for he thought a good deal of the old lady mister Sudley came a call from the hallway mister Sudley where are you It was one of the women who was calling and laying down his cigar the policeman left the library to see what she wanted
6674-71397-0016	train-other-500	The door had scarcely closed on the officer when the demeanor of the other man changed He arose looked into the dining room and listened at the hall doorway for a second Then he recrossed the apartment and knelt before the safe
6674-71397-0017	train-other-500	Adam Adams heard him mutter something to himself as he twirled around the knob of the combination
none	none	 Twice he tried the door and failed to open it 
6674-71397-0018	train-other-500	but the third effort was successful But before he could do more than glance into the strong box there was a noise in the hallway Instantly he shut the door again dropped into his chair and resumed his smoking Women folks are a regular nuisance
6674-71397-0019	train-other-500	was the policeman s comment on coming back Want you to do this and then that keep you on the go all the time I m tired of it Take my advice and don t marry was the rejoinder with a laugh Too late I ve got a wife and five children already
none	none	 But I ve got to go to the barn Will you come along 
6674-71397-0020	train-other-500	Why er I suppose so The stranger hesitated I ll have to be going pretty soon Going to stay in this room all night No I m going to lock up and go upstairs That s right nothing like resting on a good bed
6674-71397-0021	train-other-500	I don t think the girl will try to run away She can t we re watching her too closely The pair left the library Scarcely had they gone when Adam Adams opened one of the blinds made a quick leap and came inside
6674-71397-0022	train-other-500	That fellow will bear watching no matter who he claims to be the detective told himself But there is no use of following him now for he will be back sooner or later He did not open this safe for nothing
6674-71397-0023	train-other-500	With the policeman and the stranger gone the lower portion of the mansion appeared deserted
none	none	 Adam Adams looked to make sure that he was not observed and then went to the safe 
6674-71397-0024	train-other-500	As he had anticipated the door now came open with ease The detective felt that he was in a ticklish position Had he a right to examine the contents of this strong box If discovered by any one what would be the outcome
6674-71397-0025	train-other-500	Even the fact that he was in a way connected with the law might not clear him But he felt he must take some risks He knew the sentiment against Margaret Langmore and knew that sentiment in a country place is almost equal to a conviction
6674-71397-0026	train-other-500	The coroner had convinced himself that the girl was guilty and would go to any extremity to prove the correctness of his theory The safe was divided into several compartments and on one side was a set of three metallic drawers
6674-71397-0027	train-other-500	The open side contained several account books and legal and patent papers The top drawer contained some old jewelry and a gold watch the middle drawer some bank bills not over a hundred dollars all told The bottom drawer was locked
6674-71397-0028	train-other-500	but the key for it lay in the middle drawer so Adam Adams opened the receptacle with ease As he did so a cry of astonishment came to his lips and he repressed it with difficulty
6674-71397-0029	train-other-500	The drawer was packed with new and crisp one hundred dollar bills all on the same bank the Excelsior National of New York City There were thirty of the bills and evidently not one of them had been in circulation
6674-71397-0030	train-other-500	The detective started as he took them up held them to the somewhat dim light and started again He paused for a moment as if deciding a weighty question Then he placed the package of bank bills in the inner pocket of his coat
6674-71397-0031	train-other-500	These have no right to be here he muttered The only place for them is in the hands of the federal authorities Under the bills lay several legal documents One was labeled
6674-71397-0032	train-other-500	Mortgage of Matlock Styles to Barry S Langmore eight thousand dollars There were likewise two other mortgages between the same parties one for three thousand dollars and the other for five thousand dollars
6674-71397-0033	train-other-500	Whoever Matlock Styles is he evidently owes the Langmore estate sixteen thousand dollars the detective told himself that is if the obligations have not been cancelled I wonder what the mortgages were doing in with those bills
6674-71397-0034	train-other-500	mister Adams A soft call from the window made the detective turn swiftly To his surprise he saw Raymond Case peering at him through the blinds The young man s face showed his perplexity What brought you
none	none	 asked the detective 
6674-71397-0035	train-other-500	He did not relish being caught off his guard I couldn t think of going to bed at the hotel I was so upset I thought if I came over here I might discover something of value or help you in some way
6674-71397-0036	train-other-500	I see you ve managed to get that safe open It was certainly a clever piece of work As it happens opening the safe was not my work was the answer Another man opened it and I took the liberty of looking inside But I can t talk about that here
6674-71397-0037	train-other-500	Wait a minute and I ll join you outside Adam Adams swung the door of the safe open once more As he surmised the combination could be set to a new series of numbers with ease He fixed it to correspond with the numbers of his own office safe then closed the door
6674-71397-0038	train-other-500	gave the knob a twirl and hurried from the room by the same opening by which he had entered When I first came up I thought somebody was robbing the safe said Raymond Case when the pair were at a distance from the house What did you see me do
none	none	 Take out a package of bankbills and put them into your pocket 
6674-71397-0039	train-other-500	Oh I know it must be all right mister Adams But it looked queer I took them for safe keeping Look at them for a moment I ll strike a match behind this clump of trees Count them over too It may be as well to have a witness for this
6674-71397-0040	train-other-500	Raymond Case took the crisp bills and did as requested Three thousand dollars he said All brand new bills and each for a hundred dollars Exactly and each on the same bank So they are
6674-71397-0041	train-other-500	That s rather odd isn t it And all of the same serial number Gracious mister Adams Wait mister Case I am going to trust you even as you have trusted me I want you to keep this a secret Certainly but
none	none	 The bills are counterfeit CHAPTER VII ONE OF THE PROFESSION Counterfeit bank bills gasped the young man And in mister Langmore s possession Taken from his safe What does it mean That remains to be found out This is is astounding You don t suspect that he was in the habit I mean that he Raymond Case did not know how to go on It s too early to form a conclusion But one thing is certain the counterfeits were in his private safe and from all accounts that safe had not been opened since his death Consequently he must have placed them there I don t believe he dealt in counterfeits returned the young man bluntly Facts are stubborn things to overcome Down in the town I learned that mister Langmore used to be a comparatively poor man All his wealth has come to him in the past six years He made his money out of his patents and out of various other schemes All of his wealth has come to him in the past six years pursued the detective I happen to know something about these counterfeits which the federal authorities have been trying to trace to their source The first of these bogus one hundred dollar bills appeared about six years ago at a bank in Brooklyn The heart of the young man sank within him and as he spoke his lips began to quiver mister Adams are you going to give this news to the world at large to the United States authorities are you going to brand Margaret s father as a counterfeiter or a passer of queer money If you do that even if you clear Margaret you ll break her heart I am going to do nothing at present but keep on investigating We have not yet reached the end of this string by any means Did I not tell you that another opened the safe a fellow who has been acting queerly ever since I caught sight of him He is connected with this complicated affair although how still remains to be seen Who was the man He gave his name to the policeman as Jack Watkins I never heard that name before How does he look Adam Adams described the fellow minutely but Raymond Case shook his head I can t place him But that is not strange he added I know very few folks in this neighborhood Do you know a man named Matlock Styles Not very well I met him once when he was calling on mister Langmore on business He is an Englishman fairly well to do who lives in an old colonial house on the Harper road a mile and a half I should say from here Do you know what business this Styles had with mister Langmore I don t remember very well but hold up yes I do He owed mister Langmore some money The two put through some sort of real estate deal How much did Styles owe mister Langmore I don t know exactly but it was a large amount fifteen or twenty thousand dollars What sort of a man would you take this Styles to he Oh he is a big overbearing Englishman one of the kind with mutton chop whiskers and a red nose He is a great chap for fast horses and I ve heard he has quite a stable of them over to his place He is also a dog fancier Has he been here lately I don t know Perhaps Margaret could tell you But what has this to do Nothing at all perhaps In the safe with the bankbills were some mortgage papers given to mister Langmore by this Matlock Styles But the two may not have the least connection with each other The two had been walking away from the house and now the detective turned back As he did so he thought of the bit of paper he had picked up in the shrubbery He struck a match with one hand and held up the slip with the other It was a memorandum running as follows eight thousand dollars five thousand three thousand sixteen thousand dollars three four hundred eighty dollars Adam Adams studied the memorandum with interest The amounts at the top were those of the mortgages given by Matlock Styles to Barry Langmore Evidently somebody had figured out what the interest would be at three per cent What is that asked Raymond Case A bit of paper I picked up around here It doesn t seem to amount to anything But I think we had better part now mister Case If I have anything to report I ll see you to morrow at the Beechwood Hotel The pair separated and Adam Adams watched the young man disappear down the road the latter feeling that he ought not to interfere with the work of the man he had engaged to unravel the mystery In deep thought the detective went back to the neighborhood of the mansion and stationed himself where he could get a look at the library windows Adam Adams felt that the case was growing deeper and deeper The finding of the counterfeit banknotes In Barry Langmore s safe was astonishing Where this thread of the skein would lead to he could not imagine I seem to be uncovering more than I bargained for he mused If the man was innocent of all wrong doing why didn t he turn those bills over to the authorities Were he alive we should certainly say he was caught with the goods If this comes out it will create as much of a sensation as the murder itself Two hours went by and still the detective kept to his post He was used to waiting had he not waited in the bitter cold six hours to clear that poor Jew and he knew that sooner or later the man calling himself Jack Watkins would reappear A light flared up in the library and then was turned lower He crept to the window and looked in as before The strange man was at the safe working the combination knob backward and forward In spite of the seriousness of the situation Adam Adams was forced to smile The man worked hurriedly and tried the combination a score of times He muttered something under his breath which may well be omitted from these printed pages He even got into a heavy perspiration and had to pause to wipe his forehead with his handkerchief Hang the luck he went on I had it open before What s got into the confounded combination Again he tried to work the figures But it was all of no avail and at last he arose fists clenched and with a face full of baffled anger He stalked around the library gazed at the strong box several times and then quit the apartment Waiting once more the detective presently saw the man come from the house and walk toward the road Following he saw the fellow hurry past the Bardon home and then into a patch of timber Here he had a horse and in a moment more would have been in the saddle had not Adam Adams caught him by the arm Hi what s this a hold up cried the man evidently frightened Let go of me And he tried to pull away and then attempted to draw a revolver from a hip pocket Stop I am not going to hurt you was the calm reply from the detective I want to talk to you that s all Really came with a sneer A fine time of night to hold a man up Be quick for I am in a hurry I want you to explain several things to me went on Adam Adams calmly Explain To you That is what I said You can take your choice Either explain or consider yourself under arrest Eh Say are you crazy Not at all An officer of the law I suppose I am in a way Working on this Langmore affair Yes Have you been following me I ve done more than that I ve been watching you What How long Quite a long while I saw you in the library twice and down to the brook The man started and was evidently much put out Then he forced a smile to his face Much obliged for playing the spy he murmured Down at the brook you had a pair of Miss Langmore s shoes What were you doing with them Did you see me with the shoes I did and I saw you with the silk shirtwaist Ah Anything else I saw you at the safe in the library of the mansion When now Now and some hours ago You may as well make a clean breast of it I will If you will tell me who you are I am Adam Adams of New York City The strange man let out a hissing sound between his teeth Then of a sudden he gave a wild unnatural laugh Shake hands mister Adams he said putting out his hand I know you by reputation even if not personally You see your reputation is so much larger than my own He laughed again a sound which grated on the detective s nerves I am John S Watkins of Bryport I am connected with the United States secret service CHAPTER VIII WHAT CEPHAS CARBOY SAW There was a brief pause after the man from Bryport made his announcement Adam Adams tried hard to see his face clearly but in the gloom this was impossible Perhaps you do not believe me said John Watkins I can easily prove what I say Why shouldn t I believe you Because you were on the point of arresting me which proves that you took me to be something else How long have you been connected with the secret service About three years That is why I know you so well Did your work as a secret service man bring you to this place Excuse me but that is my business If you are working on this case well and good But it is not fair to try to steal any of my thunder So far as I am concerned you shall get full credit for what you may do on this case mister Watkins said Adam Adams stiffly But I should like to understand several points About the shoes and the shirtwaist I suppose I got the shoes from the house to make certain that some footprints on the bank of the brook had been made by Miss Langmore What about the shirtwaist It was there when I came and I left it there as it did not seem to have much of a connection with the affair Do you think you had a right to tamper with the safe in the library Considering certain circumstances which I do not intend just now to disclose to you I think I had a right Did you take anything from the safe Not a thing In fact I couldn t get the safe open You must know this if you saw me a while ago You opened the door the first time I do not deny it The policeman interrupted me and I shut the box up When I came back the combination had gotten away from me There was a pause Where are you stopping mister Watkins in case I wish to communicate with you again At Hager s Hotel in Sidham But I am on the jump nearly all the time and the secret service man laughed again Anything else No Then I ll be going I ve got to send a long secret message before I go to bed and it takes time to follow the code you know that Good night and in a moment more John Watkins was on his horse and riding away at a good rate of speed Adam Adams watched his departure with a variety of thoughts chasing each other through his mind The man must be what he claimed he had shown his badge on the inside of his coat and been perfectly willing to prove his words If he is honest he must be on the trail of those counterfeits and perhaps it was my duty to tell him of my discovery mused the detective It is curious how these two cases have wound around each other or is it all one case Concluding that there was nothing more to be done that night Adam Adams took himself to the Beechwood Hotel secured a room and was soon in the land of dreams He arose early obtained his breakfast and without waiting to meet Raymond Case started off to interview Doctor Bird one of the two persons Margaret Langmore had seen go past the mansion about the time the tragedy was occurring He found the doctor an individual with an exaggerated idea of his own importance It was hard to bind him down to tell what he actually knew and it took the detective the best part of an hour to learn that the physician knew nothing of real importance A short while later Adam Adams learned that the farmer who had been seen going past the mansion was named Cephas Carboy He was a strange individual of no education who lived on a hillside road running some distance to the rear of the Langmore house When the detective arrived there he found Carboy sitting under a tree smoking a short clay pipe The farm was a neglected one the house about ready to tumble down and in the dooryard were half a dozen dirty and ragged children who scampered out of sight on the approach of a stranger Good morning said Adam Adams cheerfully He saw at a glance that the fellow before him was a thoroughly shiftless character Mornin to you was the short response This is mister Cephas Carboy Cephas Carboy s my name ain t much of a mister to it and the man grinned feebly You re the man I want to see Carboy and the detective took a seat on a log close by Want to see me What fer I don t know you I want to see you about that Langmore murder The shiftless man stared and withdrew his pipe from his mouth with trembling fingers I didn t have nuthin to do with that They can t pitch it onto me nohow I came past the house that s all I did I didn t go inside the gate I didn t It was Miss Langmore did that murder or else Mary Billings Did you see anybody round the place when you went past Not a soul What were you doing around there Are you an an officer Perhaps I am Anyway you had best answer my questions I went down to Hopgood s place to sell some fish I had caught mister Hopgood can prove it Then I came straight home Which way did you go to get to Hopgood s Took the road yonder around the hill and crossed the brook at Peabody s bridge Peabody can prove that too He was out in the hayfield and saw me Adam Adams took a look at the road mentioned At a turn there was a cleared spot through the woods and a fair sight could be caught of the rear of the Langmore mansion and of the automobile shed Come here he called to Cephas Carboy and when the shiftless man had shuffled up he continued You say you walked this way When you got to this spot did you happen to look over to the Langmore house I er I did What did you see Come now tell me the exact truth and Adam Adams put as much of sternness as possible in his tone I saw See here I don t want to get in no trouble I don t I m a peaceful man an I tend to my own business I do You ain t a goin to drag me into court I don t want to get you into trouble Carboy but I must know the truth of this I take it that you are poor Am I right Humph Do I look like I was rollin in wealth Then a five dollar bill means something to you eh The shiftless man opened his eyes widely Does it Say I ain t had a fiver in my fist fer a month two months Farmin don t pay an it ain t easy to git work outside the season s been that poor If you Tell me all you know and perhaps I ll give you five dollars Ain t foolin No There s a dollar on account and the detective passed over the bill The shiftless man clutched it eagerly looked at it to make certain that it was real money and rammed it into the pocket of his greasy vest Thanks sir he murmured Then he ran his hand through his somewhat matted hair Mind now I can t give you this fer dead certain he commenced What do you mean by that I think it happened but I can t swear to it That house is putty far off remember What do you think you saw I saw a man run across the garden He had a satchel in his hand and he was in a hurry He slipped and fell and his hat rolled off Then he got up put on his hat and I lost sight of him behind the bushes How did the man look Wait up that ain t all I m certain of that part of it but I ain t so sure of the rest I waited here a minit because my wife was calling to me to git some groceries when I came back I just started to fill my pipe when I looked over there again and I saw a man run from the automobile shed to the house The bushes was in the way but hang me if I don t think he went in by a winder instead of a door You are sure you saw him go toward the house Yes that was plain enough although he seemed to be sneakin along the bushes Was it the same man It must have been but I couldn t see his valise because he was behind the bushes How did the man look He was a putty heavy fellow and he was dressed in a light gray suit and wore a soft hat to match Was the valise a light or a dark one Light Could you see anything else No Did the man have anything besides the valise Not that I could see When he fell and his hat flew off I saw that he had a head of heavy dark hair And you are certain about the suit being a light gray one and the soft hat matched it Yes I m dead sure of that What time was this About half an hour before I passed the house I stopped at Peabody s to chat a while before I crossed his bridge Did you ever see the man before Not that I remember You didn t see him after that No Adam Adams drew out a roll of bills and counted out four dollars which amount he passed over to the fellow he had been interviewing That makes the five I promised you Carboy Now then will you do me a favor Certainly sir anything you want I merely want you to keep what you have told me to yourself for the present Oh that s easy unless somebuddy tries to git me into trouble I don t think that will happen if you keep your mouth shut Then I ll be as mum as an oyster answered Cephas Carboy decidedly I may be along to see you again soon continued Adam Adams and then he drove away in the buggy that had brought him to the vicinity He allowed his horse to walk for he was in a more thoughtful mood than ever He was thinking of a man he had met the day before in a suit of gray and with a soft hat of the same color The man had been Tom Ostrello CHAPTER IX ON THE TRAIN This is clearing itself by growing more complicated Such was the deduction of the detective after he had reviewed the situation carefully 
6674-71400-0001	train-other-500	Was it possible that the son of the woman who had been murdered was guilty of the double tragedy He remembered what he had been told about Tom Ostrello and his wayward brother Dick
6674-71400-0002	train-other-500	and how mother and son had had an exciting meeting on the day previous to the tragedy I rather think it will pay to investigate a little further along this line thought Adam Adams
6674-71400-0003	train-other-500	More than likely he came here for money either for himself or his brother Dick If his mother did not have it and wanted it she would have to go to mister Langmore for it That might cause a bitterness all around Or again
6674-71400-0004	train-other-500	he might have thought that if his step father were dead his mother would inherit his money and so plotted one murder which when he was discovered ended in a second It will do no harm to have a talk with this young man
6674-71400-0005	train-other-500	He reached the Langmore mansion once more to find that Tom Ostrello had departed for the city on necessary business but was coming back before night Then at the hotel he found a message from his own office calling him to New York
none	none	 You are going away mister Adams said Raymond Case who chanced to see him departing 
6674-71400-0006	train-other-500	Not for long I ll be back to night or to morrow Anything new Nothing worth talking about yet I must hurry to catch the train
none	none	 What are you going to do 
6674-71400-0007	train-other-500	I am waiting for the inquest It will be a terrible trial for Margaret And the young man s face showed his concern Tell her for me to make the best of it answered Adam Adams and hurried to the depot
6674-71400-0008	train-other-500	The train was just coming in and he saw Tom Ostrello get on board and he entered the car directly behind the commercial traveler The young man passed through to the smoker and the detective did the same
6674-71400-0009	train-other-500	Two seats were vacant directly across the aisle from each other and each took one Presently Ostrello looked at Adam Adams and started slightly and then bowed Excuse me but I think I saw you up to the Langmore house he began
6674-71400-0010	train-other-500	Yes I called on Miss Langmore I believe you are missus Langmore s son Yes Come over won t you Ostrello moved towards the window of the car I ve got to have a smoke to quiet my nerves I m so upset Will you have one
6674-71400-0011	train-other-500	And he presented a case full of choice Havana cigars It must have upset you it s enough to upset anybody answered Adam Adams as they lit up It s a fearful happening fearful You are acting for Margaret I heard
6674-71400-0012	train-other-500	Yes if there is a chance to do anything Do you know anything of the tragedy Not a thing outside of what I have heard When I got the telegram I was fairly stunned But let me tell you one thing Well
6674-71400-0013	train-other-500	I don t think Margaret is guilty A girl like her couldn t do such a cold blooded deed
none	none	 Why it s enough to make a man shiver to think of it 
6674-71400-0014	train-other-500	It would take a hardened criminal to do such a thing
none	none	 It s absurd to even suspect her 
6674-71400-0015	train-other-500	What is your theory of the murders I hardly know what to think If the house had been robbed I would say tramps did it But how I don t know excepting the er both were smothered
6674-71400-0016	train-other-500	But let us change the subject It breaks me all up to think about it I thought a whole lot of my mother Where is your brother I don t know exactly He was in Los Angeles the last I heard of him
6674-71400-0017	train-other-500	I have sent messages to half a dozen places but so far have received no reply He is a commercial traveler like yourself He was up to two weeks ago
none	none	 Traveled for a paint house but he and the firm had a row and Dick quit 
6674-71400-0018	train-other-500	He s a rolling stone and that is why I can t just locate him Do you represent a paint house too questioned Adam Adams after a pause during which he appeared to enjoy the really fragrant Havana Tom Ostrello had tended him
none	none	 No I m with a drug house and have been for four years one of the best in the country Alexander Company of Rochester New York I am their salesman for New York and the Eastern States We make some of the most noted preparations in the trade Alexander Company of Rochester mused Adam Adams thinking of the bit of paper he had picked up from under the safe I believe I have seen their place Let me see what street is it on 
6674-71400-0021	train-other-500	Wadley street and runs through to Hill a fine six story concern with a laboratory that is second to none Yes I remember it now I suppose you must have a pretty good position with them
6674-71400-0022	train-other-500	Fair I think they ought to raise my salary answered Tom Ostrello He stretched himself I feel sleepy didn t get a wink last night
none	none	 When this affair is over I am going to ask for a week s vacation 
6674-71400-0023	train-other-500	I don t blame you answered Adam Adams with a quiet smile
none	none	 He settled back to smoke and his companion did the same 
6674-71400-0024	train-other-500	and thus the remainder of the trip to the city passed
none	none	 As he smoked the detective revolved the new revelation in his mind 
6674-71400-0025	train-other-500	Tom Ostrello represented the very drug firm whose advertisement had appeared in part on the bit of paper picked up from under the library safe And he was there hunting for something thought the detective
6674-71400-0026	train-other-500	Was it for that bit of paper or for the something that he secured in his mother s room At the depot the pair separated Adam Adams lost no time in visiting his office where his assistant awaited him anxiously Well Letty how are you this morning
6674-71400-0027	train-other-500	he said pleasantly as he dropped into his chair He gave the girl a bright smile and she smiled in return Letty Bernard was an orphan the daughter of one of his former friends and he took a fatherly interest in her
6674-71400-0028	train-other-500	She lived with a second cousin but wished to be independent and so the detective had given her the position in his office a place she filled with credit
none	none	 She was short and plump and had a wealth of curly hair that strayed over her forehead 
6674-71400-0029	train-other-500	The Chief asked me to give you these papers said the assistant You are to sign all three Um Then that s the end of the Soper case Anything else Glackey was in
6674-71400-0030	train-other-500	He told me he had tracked the German and would report in full by to morrow He thinks you were right and the German is the man What else A missus Caven Demuth was here
none	none	 Wished to know if you ever found lost dogs Great Scott Dogs She said her pet cocker spaniel had disappeared and she was willing to spend five hundred dollars on finding him I am no dog detective Send her to McMommie McMommie was as it is easy to guess a rival 
6674-71400-0032	train-other-500	I sent her to police headquarters And is that all mister Folett telegraphed that he would be here at ten It s after that now it s nearly noon You can go to lunch if you wish
none	none	 There s the door 
6674-71400-0033	train-other-500	Hullo it s mister Folett now Be back in an hour Yes Uncle Adam answered the girl She always called him uncle since he had taken such an interest in her She went out as the caller entered and left the two men talking over a business matter
6701_71401_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Uncle Adam 
none	none	answered the girl She always called him uncle since he had taken such an interest in her She went out as the caller entered and left the two men talking over a business matter which has nothing to do with our story It was two o clock before Adam Adams found himself free once more 
6674-71400-0034	train-other-500	He procured a lunch and then took a subway train halfway uptown He walked two blocks westward and ascended the steps of a fine brown stone residence He asked for Doctor Calkey and was ushered into a private den where the doctor
6674-71400-0035	train-other-500	a tall spare man of sixty soon joined him My good friend Adams cried the doctor shaking hands warmly Where have you kept yourself
none	none	 Surely you have not been to see me for a year or is it longer 
6674-71400-0036	train-other-500	I have missed you so much and the comforting smokes we had together Why did you desert me You knew I could not come to you that I never go out And you do not bring any business to me I had none to bring and I have been very busy
6674-71400-0037	train-other-500	But I have missed our meetings I must confess Ah I am glad to learn I was not entirely forgotten And you have been busy and still nothing for Rudolph Calkey to do nothing to analyze nothing to dissect I ve got a knot now for you Good good
6674-71400-0038	train-other-500	I trust it is a good complication I love them so there is such a satisfaction when the end is reached But not yet no not yet A glass of wine first something prime I imported it myself so that I would know what I am getting
6674-71400-0039	train-other-500	The wine was soon forthcoming and then a cigar for the detective and a pipe for the doctor At last the latter threw himself into an old easy chair and gazed at his caller expectantly I am ready to untie the knot he said
none	none	 What is it 
6701_71401_000001_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER X
6701_71401_000002_000000	train-clean-360	AN AFFAIR OF THE HEART
6701_71401_000003_000000	train-clean-360	There was a moment of silence 
6701_71402_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 silence 
6701_71402_000099_000000	train-clean-360	 silence 
6701_71401_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Briefly put doctor the case is this said Adam Adams 
none	none	I want to know if there is anything known to the medical world a powder or something of that sort strong enough to kill a person if he should breathe of it
6701_71401_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 A powder strong enough to kill a person The brow of the old physician contracted 
none	none	It would have to be very powerful to do that You mean if a person was boxed up with it like one killed by gas
6701_71401_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 No not at all 
6701_71401_000006_000001	train-clean-360	I mean a powder that could be held to a person s nose and mouth in the open when it would make that person sick and give him cramps perhaps 
6701_71401_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 And kill him 
none	none	Yes 
6701_71401_000009_000000	train-clean-360	The old doctor rubbed his hands in thought 
6701_71401_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 That is a subject for speculation 
6701_71401_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Certain cyanide compounds might be powerful enough to do so under certain conditions 
6701_71401_000009_000003	train-clean-360	Any real dry powder would choke a person if he got a big dose of it 
6701_71401_000009_000004	train-clean-360	I heard of a boy who came near dying as the result of breathing in a quantity of extra dry licorice powder But he was smothered and did not have cramps 
6701_71401_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing in the shape of any foreign compound 
none	none	You once showed me a Turkish liquid that burnt when water was poured on it and dyed everything blood red Ah yes the fozeska something truly dangerous 
6701_71401_000011_000001	train-clean-360	But I know of nothing But hold 
6701_71401_000011_000002	train-clean-360	The doctor clapped his hands together 
none	none	Yes yes 
6701_71401_000011_000004	train-clean-360	That would do it that and that only 
none	none	What
6701_71401_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I had a sample of it given to me some six months ago 
none	none	It was called yamlang peholo and was made in China from the roots of the yamlang bush a rare growth found only in the western part of the country By many Chinamen the yamlang bush is supposed to be accursed and whenever they come near one they utter a prayer for deliverance from its evils If you sleep near the yamlang bush it will make you very sick
6701_71401_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 And that powder what did it look like 
6701_71401_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 It was blue at first but on contact with the air quickly changed to brownish white and lost itself it was so fine 
none	none	Evaporated
6701_71401_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 You can call it that if you wish 
6701_71401_000017_000001	train-clean-360	It was intense 
6701_71401_000017_000002	train-clean-360	I held it at arms length yet it made me sick and I had cramps for over an hour afterwards 
6701_71401_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 It would have killed you if you had placed it to your mouth or nose 
6701_71401_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Not the slightest doubt of it 
6701_71401_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 May I ask where you got the stuff 
6701_71401_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 It was imported into this country by a drug firm merely as a curiosity 
6701_71401_000021_000001	train-clean-360	They put it up in tiny vials which I suppose were sent around to different persons like myself 
6701_71401_000021_000002	train-clean-360	It was a dangerous piece of business and I gave them no credit for doing it 
none	none	What was the name of the firm
6701_71401_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 I would not tell everybody but I know I can trust you to keep a secret 
6701_71401_000023_000001	train-clean-360	The firm was Alexander Company of Rochester who stand very high in the trade 
none	none	I buy many things from them from time to time and their traveling man a mister Ostrello gave me the powder when he called He told me how the firm had experimented on a dog and an ox 
6701_71401_000023_000003	train-clean-360	Both died in less than two minutes and each with cramps 
6701_71401_000023_000004	train-clean-360	But after death neither animal showed the least trace of the poison 
none	none	Wasn t this Ostrello afraid to handle the stuff Not as much as I was 
6701_71401_000025_000001	train-clean-360	He said he was a bit used to it 
6701_71401_000025_000002	train-clean-360	I told him I didn t want to get used to it 
6701_71401_000025_000003	train-clean-360	Have another glass of wine 
6701_71401_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 No I prefer to smoke thanks just the same 
none	none	I am interested in this yamlang as you call it 
6701_71401_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Where can I get the stuff 
none	none	No more of it can be had 
6701_71401_000027_000001	train-clean-360	I rather think they got afraid of it Wait I ll get the vial it was in 
6701_71401_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Perhaps there is a whiff left in it 
6701_71401_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Thanks but do you think I want to die queried the detective and gave a laugh 
6701_71401_000029_000000	train-clean-360	When the empty vial was produced he opened it and took a short sniff Then he drew his breath in sharply 
6701_71401_000029_000001	train-clean-360	A faint odor was perceptible the same odor he had detected in the carpet on the upper hallway of the Langmore mansion 
6701_71401_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you smell it questioned the physician 
none	none	Yes but not very well 
6701_71401_000031_000001	train-clean-360	I don t think it will affect me much 
6701_71401_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 I trust not my dear Adams 
6701_71401_000032_000001	train-clean-360	We cannot afford to lose you 
6701_71401_000032_000002	train-clean-360	Now what is it all about 
6701_71401_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Another case that s all 
6701_71401_000033_000001	train-clean-360	I don t feel like talking about it just yet 
6701_71401_000033_000002	train-clean-360	I ll give you the particulars some other time 
6701_71401_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 And have I helped you 
none	none	I think you have
6701_71401_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course there are other powders and there is chloroform 
6701_71401_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 I think we have struck a clue in this 
6701_71401_000037_000001	train-clean-360	But I must be going 
6701_71401_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 What so soon Rudolph Calkey looked hurt 
6701_71401_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 I was thinking you d stay the day out 
6701_71401_000038_000002	train-clean-360	We could chat over old times I ll order an extra supper 
6701_71401_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 No not to day 
6701_71401_000039_000001	train-clean-360	When this case is settled I ll come over and we ll make an evening of it And then the detective had to fairly tear himself from the doctor and the house 
6701_71401_000039_000002	train-clean-360	They were old friends and had worked on many a case together 
6701_71401_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Once back in his office Adam Adams smiled grimly to himself 
none	none	Now
6701_71401_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Tom Ostrello 
none	none	it looks as if we had you good and hard he murmured
6701_71401_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 You were seen around the place at the time of the murder by Cephas Carboy you left the bit of paper in the library you quarrelled at one time with mister Langmore and also quarrelled with your mother The murder was committed by means of that deadly Chinese powder and you are one of the few persons in this country who knew of the heathenish compound 
none	none	If you are innocent I rather reckon you have a heap of explanations to make There were two callers who took an hour of the detective s time and then he prepared to return to Sidham to learn if possible more concerning Tom Ostrello and if anybody besides Cephas Carboy had seen him around that vicinity on the morning of the tragedy Letty I may not be back to night he remarked as he came out into the general office
6701_71401_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 And it may be that I ll not be back to morrow 
6701_71401_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 All right Uncle Adam 
6701_71401_000044_000001	train-clean-360	What shall I tell mister Capes 
6701_71401_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Tell him that that bond matter must wait 
6701_71401_000045_000001	train-clean-360	He ll have to get those numbers if he possibly can 
6701_71401_000045_000002	train-clean-360	The other record was destroyed 
6701_71401_000046_000000	train-clean-360	As Adam Adams spoke he drew closer to the desk at which his assistant was sitting 
6701_71401_000046_000001	train-clean-360	He glanced down at an envelope lying there and started slightly 
6701_71401_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Where did this come from Letty he questioned 
none	none	The envelope was postmarked New York and the upper left hand corner bore the notice Return in ten days to Alexander Company Wholesale Druggists twenty two thirty two Wadley Street Rochester N Y 
6701_71401_000049_000000	train-clean-360	The girl glanced at the envelope and then at her employer and blushed deeply 
6701_71401_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh why that that is a note from a friend of mine 
none	none	A gentleman friend I suppose Yes Uncle Adam 
6701_71401_000052_000001	train-clean-360	I met him last winter at missus Dally s reception He is a traveling salesman for this house she pointed to the notice on the envelope 
6701_71401_000052_000002	train-clean-360	 He wants me to go to the theatre with him and I expect to go 
none	none	missus Dally says he is a very nice young man We we have been out a number of times And the girl blushed again
6701_71401_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 I know some parties connected with that firm 
6701_71401_000053_000001	train-clean-360	What s the young man s name Letty 
none	none	mister Tom Ostrello Indeed 
6701_71401_000055_000001	train-clean-360	And he has invited you to go to the theatre with him 
none	none	Yes 
6701_71401_000056_000001	train-clean-360	Then you know him Uncle Adam 
6701_71401_000056_000002	train-clean-360	I didn t dream of that 
6701_71401_000056_000003	train-clean-360	Don t you think he is is rather nice 
6701_71401_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Evidently you think so For some reason the detective could scarcely steady his voice 
6701_71401_000057_000001	train-clean-360	He was a bachelor with only some distant relatives and he thought a good deal of his protegee and her welfare 
6701_71401_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 I I do Uncle Adam 
6701_71401_000058_000001	train-clean-360	He treats me so nicely 
6701_71401_000058_000002	train-clean-360	I I don t you approve of him she went on hastily searching his face for the smile that usually rested there when he spoke to her 
6701_71401_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Why I er I don t know him so well as all that Letty For the first time in his life he was visibly confused 
6701_71401_000059_000001	train-clean-360	 You say he has called on you a number of times 
6701_71401_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes and he has taken me out let me see I guess it must be a dozen times all told 
6701_71401_000060_000001	train-clean-360	I I wanted to speak of this before but I well I couldn t bring it around 
6701_71401_000060_000002	train-clean-360	I hope you ll approve Uncle Adam 
none	none	Approve 
6701_71401_000061_000001	train-clean-360	Of your going out with him 
6701_71401_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes and and 
6701_71401_000062_000001	train-clean-360	The girl hesitated again 
none	none	Then she arose and buried her face on his shoulder
6701_71401_000062_000003	train-clean-360	 Oh don t you understand Uncle Adam 
none	none	Letty
6701_71401_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 He is very nice I know you ll like him when you get to really know him 
6701_71401_000064_000001	train-clean-360	Of course he hasn t much money but I don t care for that 
none	none	You always said money didn t count for so much anyway that it was character and he s got that Hum For the life of him Adam Adams could not speak 
6701_71401_000065_000001	train-clean-360	He felt himself growing hot and cold by turns 
6701_71401_000065_000002	train-clean-360	He caught the girl closer Never had he loved his friend s daughter so much as now 
6701_71401_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 I hoped you would approve she went on shyly 
6701_71401_000066_000001	train-clean-360	 I of course I didn t want to leave you you ve been so very good to me since papa and mamma died 
6701_71401_000066_000002	train-clean-360	But but Tom doesn t seem to want to wait 
6701_71401_000066_000003	train-clean-360	He has asked me twice now and and I don t know how I am going to put him off 
6701_71401_000066_000004	train-clean-360	He seems so miserable when I say wait 
6701_71401_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Asked you to marry him 
none	none	Yes
6701_71401_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 And he wants you to go to the theatre with him now 
6701_71401_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 The invitation is for to night he sent it last week 
6701_71401_000070_000001	train-clean-360	He has been traveling out of town but he said he would be back some time to day I want you to meet him She paused 
6701_71401_000070_000002	train-clean-360	 Isn t it all right Uncle Adam 
6701_71401_000071_000000	train-clean-360	He did not answer and she gazed at him curiously 
6701_71401_000071_000001	train-clean-360	Then the look in his face made her draw back slowly and uncertainly 
6701_71401_000071_000002	train-clean-360	At that moment he felt that the occupation of a detective was the most detestable in the world 
6701_71401_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 You you know something she gasped 
6701_71401_000072_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh Uncle Adam what is it 
6701_71402_000001_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XI
6701_71402_000002_000000	train-clean-360	AT THE CORONER S INQUEST
6701_71402_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Sidham was in a state of keen excitement 
6701_71402_000003_000001	train-clean-360	No such mystery as the double tragedy had occurred in that neighborhood before and all of the inhabitants were anxious to hear the latest news and learn what the coroner and the police were going to do 
6701_71402_000003_000002	train-clean-360	A hundred theories were afloat all centering on the one object to find the murderer 
6701_71402_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Find him or her and swing him or her to the nearest tree was the verdict of many 
6701_71402_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 The law is all well enough but this dastardly crime demands an object lesson 
6701_71402_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Coroner Jack Busby who was a dealer in horses had never had a murder case before and was uncertain as to the method of procedure 
none	none	But with the eyes of the whole community on him he realized his importance as he ran hither and thither to arrange for the inquest 
6701_71402_000005_000002	train-clean-360	He felt that his own little office was altogether too small for the occasion and so arranged to bring off the affair in the general courtroom 
6701_71402_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The place was soon crowded with people and another crowd gathered outside 
6701_71402_000006_000001	train-clean-360	The hour for opening the inquest was at hand and the majority of the witnesses were present 
6701_71402_000006_000002	train-clean-360	The coroner short fat and bald headed looked around anxiously and then turned to the chief of police who was near at hand 
6701_71402_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t see Miss Langmore 
6701_71402_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Neither do I answered the guardian of the law with a shrug of his shoulders as if it was none of his especial business 
6701_71402_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but ahem you are ahem responsible 
6701_71404_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 ahem 
none	none	you are ahem responsible
6701_71402_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 She ll be here coroner don t worry 
6701_71402_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 You have had her properly guarded 
none	none	Yes 
6701_71402_000012_000001	train-clean-360	I reckon she s coming now and the chief of police nodded towards a side door of the courtroom 
6701_71402_000013_000000	train-clean-360	There was a slight commotion and Margaret entered escorted by Raymond Case and followed by one of the women and the policeman who had been on guard at the Langmore mansion 
6701_71402_000013_000001	train-clean-360	The crowd arose to gaze at the girl and to pass various comments 
6701_71402_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Mighty pale ain t she 
none	none	Wouldn t think a girl like that could do such an awful thing Humph you can t tell about these high toned folks They d do anything Didn t one of them millionaires run over two of my hens with his automobile an never stop to settle the damage 
6701_71402_000016_000003	train-clean-360	Don t tell me 
none	none	Yes and she detested her step mother the hired girl told missus Brown so an she told me Well Coroner Busby will git to the bottom of it putty quick He told Lem Hansom he knew what he was doin
6701_71402_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 He must know if he s as slick at tryin folks as he is in a hoss dicker returned an old farmer who had made a trade of steeds which had proved unprofitable for him 
none	none	Margaret was shown to a chair and sat down with Raymond beside her The young man was plainly nervous yet he did what he could to comfort his companion
6701_71402_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Courage Margaret he whispered 
6701_71402_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 It is bound to come out right in the end 
6701_71402_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I can scarcely see a friendly face she faltered taking a shy look around 
6701_71402_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 They all think I am She could not finish but had to bite her lip to keep the tears from flowing 
6701_71402_000023_000000	train-clean-360	The coroner mounted the platform and rapped on a desk with his knuckles 
none	none	The ahem courtroom will come to order he called out gazing around on all sides 
6701_71402_000025_000000	train-clean-360	There was a final buzz and then the place became quiet broken only by the ticking of a big round clock on the wall 
6701_71402_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 We are gathered here ahem to inquire into the mysterious deaths of mister and missus Barry Langmore went on the coroner 
6701_71402_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 That s so an we want plain facts put in an old farmer sitting well up front 
6701_71402_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Silence cried the coroner 
6701_71402_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 We must have silence 
6701_71402_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 All right Jack replied the farmer 
6701_71402_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 I won t say another word 
none	none	Silence 
6701_71402_000030_000001	train-clean-360	We cannot go on if there is not silence 
none	none	Ahem ahem Miss Langmore 
6701_71402_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Margaret arose and bowed slightly 
6701_71402_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Then the coroner swore her in as a witness and told her to relate her story 
6701_71402_000031_000002	train-clean-360	She could scarcely stand and Raymond brought her chair forward 
none	none	You wish me to tell all I know she asked in a faint but clear voice
6701_71402_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Everything was Coroner Busby s answer 
6701_71402_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Pausing for a moment to collect her thoughts she plunged into the recital her tale being merely a repetition of that given to Adam Adams 
6701_71402_000034_000001	train-clean-360	When she came to tell how her father had been found her voice broke and it was fully a minute before she could go on 
6701_71402_000034_000002	train-clean-360	When she had finished the courtroom was as still as a tomb save for the ticking of the clock now sounding louder than ever 
6701_71402_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Is that all asked the coroner after a painful pause 
none	none	Yes sir
6701_71402_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 They say Miss Langmore that you were not on good terms with your stepmother 
6701_71402_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Who says so 
none	none	It is an ahem a common rumor What have you to say on that point
6701_71402_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 It is true sir answered Margaret after another pause during which the eyes of all in the courtroom were fixed upon the girl 
6701_71402_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 It is said that you had violent quarrels pursued the coroner 
6701_71402_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 No very violent quarrels 
6701_71402_000042_000001	train-clean-360	Sometimes we did not speak to each other for days 
6701_71404_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 we did 
none	none	not speak to each other for days
6701_71402_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Then you admit that you did quarrel 
none	none	I do
6701_71402_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 And you also quarreled with your father 
none	none	No sir
6701_71402_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 What not at all queried Coroner Busby elevating his eyes in surprise either real or affected 
6701_71402_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 We held different opinions upon certain questions but we did not quarrel 
none	none	Hum The coroner mused for a moment
6701_71402_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 That is all for the present he added and Margaret moved back to where she had been first sitting 
none	none	I am glad that is over whispered Raymond Can I do anything

none	none	CHAPTER XII FOR AND AGAINST There was a moment of intense silence throughout the courtroom Every eye was turned on Mary Billings who pursed up her lips more closely than ever You ll not answer thundered Coroner Busby mister Coroner began Raymond rising is it legally necessary that she answer Remember she is here without proper legal council Silence I ahem yes she must answer or I shall have to commit her as a witness if for nothing else Girl are you going to answer or not Sure an Oi Chief will you call a policeman went on the coroner turning to the chief of police He was a fairly good judge of human character At the sight of the bluecoat the domestic wilted and began to sob Ohone Ohone don t take me to prison she wailed You prefer to answer Yis if Oi must But Oi think Miss Margaret the swatest little lady Never mind that When did the girl and her stepmother quarrel last Come now tell me the plain truth and the coroner put as much of sternness as possible in his voice Well thin if yez has got to know it was on the marnin av the murders sur sniffled the servant girl When was this Right afther breakfast They had some words at the table too What was said Repeat the exact words if you can and the coroner leaned forward expectantly while many in the courtroom held their breath missus Langmore said she wished Miss Margaret was off the face of the earth an that she d be afther seein that the dear girrul wasn t in the house much longer Twas a very bitter scene an me heart wint out to the dear girrul And what did Miss Margaret reply to that She said it was her father s house an she would stay as long as her father wished her to An it was her father s house too And after that A whole lot more followed which Oi didn t catch fer Oi am no avesdropper But Oi did hear missus Langmore in a perfect rage cry out that she d kill Miss Margaret if the girrul didn t moind her And then Miss Margaret said she would do as she pl ased that she was her own mistress an Oi was glad to hear her say it missus Langmore went on wid her quarrel sure an she had the divil s own tongue so she had Thin she must have caught hould av Miss Margaret fer Oi heard the girrul cry out to lit go or she d stroike her down Thin there was more wurruds hotter an hotter an missus Langmore said she would make the girrul mind as sure as fate an thin Miss Margaret got roused up an she said fer missus Langmore to beware that she had Southern blood in her veins an she wouldn t be accountable fer what she did if her stepmother wint too far There was a pause and a murmur ran the round of the little courtroom The testimony seemed to be highly important and many shook their heads The girl and her stepmother had certainly had a bitter quarrel the girl had hot Southern blood in her veins and the bitterness had ended in the tragedy In the minds of many it was only a question of what the extenuating circumstances might be Was mister Langmore present at this quarrel asked the coroner after another pause He was at the breakfast table but afther that he wint to the bank Did you hear anything more Not right away sur Oi wint to me work Whin mister Langmore came from the bank Oi heard him talkin to Miss Margaret What was said then Oi dunno exactly exceptin that he said he was sorry she an her stepmother had quarreled an he wanted her to make it up wid his woife And what did Miss Margaret say to that She said that all she wanted was to be left alone What else Oi didn t hear anything more as Oi wint to the ciller fer coal By an by Oi see Miss Margaret in the garden cryin Oi wanted to go to her but missus Langmore kim to the kitchen an Oi had to attind to me wurruk How did missus Langmore seem to appear when she came to the kitchen Sure an she was very excited an findin more fault than iver She stayed only a few minutes an thin wint to the library an that was the very last Oi saw av her Oi m sorry she s dead but she had that divil s own temper And the domestic heaved a long sigh That will do You may sit down The coroner looked around the courtroom Is Doctor Bardon present For reply the young physician came forward from one side of the room He looked pale and slightly troubled In a low voice he corroborated the testimony already given regarding the finding of the two bodies and told what he had done in his effort to restore mister Langmore to life I thought there might be a spark there still but I was mistaken he went on He looked so natural and missus Langmore looked natural too for the matter of that But both were stone dead What was the cause of death That is something of a mystery I have tried my best to get at the bottom of it but I cannot nor can my colleague Doctor Soper Were the pair strangled smothered poisoned suggested the coroner I have a theory that they were poisoned but not in an ordinary way Neither Doctor Soper nor myself could find any traces of ordinary poison What is your theory Something was used to stupefy them and so much was used that it killed them In that case the murder might have been unintentional Yes Somebody might have thought to stupefy mister Langmore and then rob him But the drug being too powerful or used too long might have done its deadly work Then the crime may have been discovered by missus Langmore and the murderer might have turned on her to conceal his first wrongdoing Hum Have you ahem any idea of the nature of the poison No excepting that it had a very powerful odor When I bent over mister Langmore I got several whiffs of it and it made me sick at the stomach But the odor was soon gone And you have no idea what the poison was No nor has Doctor Soper It may be something new or something little known Chemists are constantly discovering new things went on the young physician bound to clear himself of any suspicion of ignorance concerning medical matters You found no marks of violence as if there had been a struggle The only marks I found were two scratches on the right arm of missus Langmore right above the wrist and a scratch on mister Langmore s left cheek Finger nail scratches Possibly or else they may have been made by a ring or bracelet if there was a struggle Hum Have you anything else to tell doctor I have not I am willing to tell all I know There was another pause as the young physician stepped back The coroner was about to call one of the women set to guard Margaret and the Langmore mansion when he suddenly turned Miss Langmore you will please take the stand again he said and the girl did so throwing aside her veil Are you in the habit of wearing finger rings and bracelets It was a leading question and several gasped as they heard it Raymond started to rise up but then sank back again I do not wear bracelets answered Margaret I have two rings What kind of rings are they One is a plain gold band It was my mother s wedding ring The girl s voice sank low suddenly The other is a diamond ring as you can see and she held up her hand Will you let me have the diamond ring Yes sir She took it off But please be careful of it for it it is very precious to me The coroner nodded That is all just now and as Margaret let fall the veil again he called Doctor Bardon to his side A whispered conversation ensued and the young physician left with the precious circlet Margaret s engagement ring in an envelope Margaret you should not have let him have that ring whispered Raymond How could I help it was the low answer Oh this is terrible I feel as if everybody was trying to look me through and through I can t understand why mister Adams is not here went on the young man Perhaps he has found some important clew and is following it up he added hopefully They are bound to convict me Raymond Isn t it horrible They shall never do it never cried the young man And then a sharp rapping on the desk terminated the brief conversation and restored quietness to the little courtroom CHAPTER XIII

6701_71404_000003_000000	train-clean-360	The next witness called was missus Morse who told briefly how she had been placed in charge of the upper part of the Langmore mansion shortly after the tragedy and how she had been watching Margaret 
6701_71404_000003_000001	train-clean-360	She said the girl had had only a few visitors mentioning Raymond Case and a stranger from New York 
6701_71404_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Who was the stranger asked Coroner Busby 
6701_71404_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 A mister Adams

6701_71404_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 What did she say about missus Langmore 
6701_71404_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 She does not seem to care much about her stepmother 
6701_71404_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Have you discovered anything unusual missus Morse that had to do with this tragedy 
6701_71404_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I don t know 
6701_71404_000015_000001	train-clean-360	I have looked around a bit and among other things I found this 
6701_71404_000015_000002	train-clean-360	It was in Miss Langmore s dressing case 
6701_71404_000016_000000	train-clean-360	As she spoke the woman held up a small bottle 
6701_71404_000016_000001	train-clean-360	It was marked chloroform and was empty 
none	none	Anything else
6701_71404_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 With the empty bottle I found the half of a big silk handkerchief 
6701_71404_000018_000001	train-clean-360	It was wrapped around the bottle and had Miss Langmore s monogram in the corner 
6701_71404_000018_000002	train-clean-360	I went on hunting around the house and I found the other half of the handkerchief in a dark corner of the upper hallway not far from where missus Langmore s body was found 
6701_71404_000019_000000	train-clean-360	At this announcement there was a buzz of excitement 
none	none	All present looked at the witness and then at Margaret 
6701_71404_000019_000002	train-clean-360	The girl had thrown aside her veil once more and was standing up with a face as pale as death itself 
none	none	I I may I speak she faltered Yes
6701_71404_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I bought that chloroform a month ago and used it to put a sick canary and a sick parrot out of their misery 
6701_71404_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Mary Billings saw me chloroform the parrot 
6701_71404_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 When did you do the chloroforming 
6701_71404_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 About a week ago on the parrot 
6701_71404_000024_000001	train-clean-360	The canary I chloroformed when I obtained the drug 
6701_71404_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Sure and that s roight sur broke in the servant girl 
6701_71404_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Then you know all about using chloroform remarked the coroner dryly 
6701_71404_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 The druggist told me 
6701_71404_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Did it take all you had for the birds 
none	none	No
6701_71404_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 What did you do with what remained 
6701_71404_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 I threw it away for I had no further use for it 
none	none	Hum The coroner turned to Mary Billings
6701_71404_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 Did you see her throw the chloroform away 
none	none	N no stammered the servant girl
6701_71404_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 But if she says she did she did she added stoutly 
6701_71404_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Now missus Morse did you find anything else of value 
6701_71404_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I did not but missus Gaspard who was in charge downstairs did 
6701_71404_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Very well you may step down 
6701_71404_000036_000001	train-clean-360	missus Gaspard And the other woman came forward to face the coroner and his jury and was sworn 
6701_71404_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 missus Morse says you found something of importance 
none	none	What was it
6701_71404_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 It was this mister Busby and the woman held out a sheet of note paper I came across it on the stairs leading to Miss Langmore s room 
6701_71404_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Shall I read it And as the coroner nodded the woman read as follows 
6701_71404_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Since you refuse to open your room door to me let me give you fair warning 
6701_71404_000039_000001	train-clean-360	You must either obey your mother that now is and me or leave this house 
6701_71404_000039_000002	train-clean-360	I have had enough of your willfulness and I shall not put up with it any longer 
6701_71404_000040_000000	train-clean-360	As the woman finished reading she handed the paper to the coroner 
none	none	Ahem 
6701_71404_000041_000001	train-clean-360	missus Gaspard do you know who wrote this note asked the latter 
6701_71404_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 The handwriting is exactly like mister Langmore s 
none	none	I have compared the two and so have missus Morse and mister Pickerell the schoolmaster 
6701_71404_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Again all eyes were bent upon Margaret 
6701_71404_000043_000001	train-clean-360	She had again arisen and was swaying from side to side 
6701_71404_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 My father never never sent me never wrote such a note she gasped and then sank back and would have fallen had not Raymond supported her 
6701_71404_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 A glass of water quick cried the young man and it was handed to him and also a bottle of smelling salts 
6701_71404_000045_000001	train-clean-360	In a moment more Margaret revived 
none	none	Take me away she moaned
6701_71404_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 I am sorry but that cannot be allowed replied the coroner 
none	none	You will have to remain until this session is over
6701_71404_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 It s an outrage exclaimed Raymond his eyes flashing 
none	none	You are all against her and you are going to prove her guilty if you possibly can The whole proceedings is a farce
6701_71404_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Silence young man or I ll have you removed by an officer 
6701_71404_000049_000001	train-clean-360	You have interrupted the proceedings several times 
6701_71404_000049_000002	train-clean-360	I do not know what interest you have 
none	none	I am not ashamed to tell you of my interest sir 
6701_71404_000050_000001	train-clean-360	I am engaged to this young lady 
6701_71404_000050_000002	train-clean-360	I know she is innocent 
6701_71404_000050_000003	train-clean-360	It is preposterous to imagine that she would kill her own father 
6701_71404_000050_000004	train-clean-360	They loved each other too much 
6701_71404_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but this note piped in missus Gaspard 
6701_71404_000051_000001	train-clean-360	She was a strong believer in Margaret s guilt 
6701_71404_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 I know nothing about that 
6701_71404_000052_000001	train-clean-360	It may be a forgery 
6701_71404_000052_000002	train-clean-360	I know Miss Langmore is innocent 
6701_71404_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 To merely say a thing does not prove it came from the coroner 
none	none	We want facts nothing else and we are bound to have em He began to warm up also
6701_71404_000053_000002	train-clean-360	 I m here to do my duty regardless of you or anybody else 
6701_71404_000053_000003	train-clean-360	I ain t going to shield anybody rich or poor high or low known or unknown 
6701_71404_000053_000004	train-clean-360	Now you sit down and let the inquest proceed And Raymond sat down but with a great and growing bitterness filling his heart 
6701_71404_000053_000005	train-clean-360	He looked at Margaret and saw that she was trembling from head to foot 
6701_71404_000054_000000	train-clean-360	There was an awkward pause 
none	none	missus Gaspard did mister Pickerell say he thought mister Langmore had written this note questioned the coroner
6701_71404_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 He said the two handwritings were exactly alike 
6701_71404_000056_000001	train-clean-360	Here is a letter written and signed by mister Langmore 
6701_71404_000056_000002	train-clean-360	You can compare the two if you wish 
6701_71404_000057_000000	train-clean-360	The letter was passed over and not only the coroner but also his jury looked at both documents carefully 
6701_71404_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Pretty much the same thing whispered one man 
6701_71404_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Exactly the same added another and the rest nodded 
6701_71404_000060_000000	train-clean-360	The coroner looked around the courtroom and then at the jury 
none	none	Have any of you any questions to ask he queried of the men
6701_71404_000061_000001	train-clean-360	 If not we ll take a brief recess until Doctor Bardon returns 
6701_71404_000062_000000	train-clean-360	One after another the jurors shook their heads 
6701_71404_000062_000001	train-clean-360	Whatever the coroner did was sufficient for them 
none	none	Coroner Busby had picked men he knew would agree with him 
6701_71404_000063_000000	train-clean-360	The recess had lasted but a few minutes when Doctor Bardon reappeared His face wore a knowing look that was almost triumphant 
6701_71404_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 You will please take the stand again doctor was the request 
6701_71404_000064_000001	train-clean-360	 I wish to ask you if a person could be smothered by chloroform 
6701_71404_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Certainly under certain conditions 
6701_71404_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you think it possible that mister and missus Langmore could have been smothered in that way 
6701_71404_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Possibly yes although I did not see any traces 
6701_71404_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 Would there have been traces 
6701_71404_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes and no it would depend on circumstances 
none	none	Hum 
6701_71404_000070_000001	train-clean-360	Now about the diamond ring belonging to Miss Langmore which I gave you a short while ago to examine 
none	none	Have you ahem examined it
6701_71404_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 I have and so has Doctor Soper 
6701_71404_000071_000001	train-clean-360	We used a magnifying glass and made several tests 
6701_71404_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 Did you find anything unusual 
none	none	We did 
6701_71404_000073_000001	train-clean-360	In the first place two of the prongs which hold the diamond in place are bent out and up in such a fashion that each forms a sharp point 
6701_71404_000073_000002	train-clean-360	We next looked under the stone and found there a substance which both of us are convinced is a bit of dried up blood 
6701_71404_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 You are sure it is blood 
none	none	Yes 
6701_71404_000075_000001	train-clean-360	I can illustrate it scientifically if you desire 
6701_71404_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 It will not be necessary just now 
6701_71404_000076_000001	train-clean-360	When you say blood do you mean human blood 
6701_71404_000077_000000	train-clean-360	At this the young physician shrugged his shoulders 
6701_71404_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 I am not prepared to go as far as that 
6701_71404_000078_000001	train-clean-360	We should have to make another test 
6701_71404_000078_000002	train-clean-360	The amount was so very small 
6701_71404_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 Might be blood from a mosquito muttered Raymond 
6701_71404_000079_000001	train-clean-360	 There are enough around here 
6701_71404_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 You may think as you please said the young doctor 
6701_71404_000080_000001	train-clean-360	 I am only stating the facts 
6701_71404_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 Have you anything else to say doctor came from the coroner 
none	none	Nothing more 
6701_71404_000082_000001	train-clean-360	Here is the ring 
6701_71404_000082_000002	train-clean-360	We have kept what we found under the stone 
none	none	Very well 
6701_71404_000083_000001	train-clean-360	Miss Langmore you may have the ring back It was passed out and Raymond took it and slipped it back on Margaret s hand which was cold and nerveless 
6701_71404_000083_000002	train-clean-360	The girl was sitting as motionless as a marble statue 
6701_71404_000084_000000	train-clean-360	There was another pause and then one after another several minor witnesses were brought up and examined 
6701_71404_000084_000001	train-clean-360	At four o clock the coroner began to sum up the evidence to which the jury listened with close attention 
6701_71404_000084_000002	train-clean-360	Then the jurors filed out into a side room the door to which was tightly closed 
6701_71404_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 Is is it over faltered Margaret 
none	none	Wha what will they do next
6701_71404_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 We must wait for the finding of the jury Margaret 
6701_71404_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 How long will that take 
none	none	I don t know mister 
6701_71404_000089_000001	train-clean-360	Adams did not show himself 
6701_71404_000089_000002	train-clean-360	I thought he would help us in some way 
6701_71404_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 He must have a good reason for staying away 
6701_71404_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you think the jury will do 
6701_71404_000092_000000	train-clean-360	At this direct question the young man gave an inward groan 
6701_71404_000092_000001	train-clean-360	 I don t know he answered in an unnatural voice 
6701_71404_000092_000002	train-clean-360	 We must hope for the best 
6701_71404_000093_000000	train-clean-360	In less than an hour it was announced that the jury had arrived at a verdict 
none	none	Those who had left the courtroom returned and the jurymen filed in 
6701_71404_000093_000002	train-clean-360	The excitement was subdued but plainly at a white heat The coroner took his place at the desk 
6701_71404_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 Gentlemen of the jury have you agreed upon a verdict was the question put 
6701_71404_000095_000000	train-clean-360	 We have was the unanimous answer 
6701_71404_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 Who will speak for you 
6701_71404_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Blackwell our foreman 
none	none	Very well Ahem 
6701_71404_000098_000002	train-clean-360	mister Blackwell what is the verdict 
none	none	mister Blackwell a well known citizen of the town stood up 
6701_71404_000099_000001	train-clean-360	The courtroom became intensely silent 
6701_71404_000100_000000	train-clean-360	 We find that mister and missus Barry Langmore came to their deaths either by being smothered chloroformed poisoned or in some similar fashion the direct means not yet being brought to light and we find that the evidence points to Margaret Langmore as the one who committed the murders 
6701_71404_000101_000000	train-clean-360	Hardly was the verdict rendered than a wild cry rang out through the courtroom 
none	none	Margaret staggered to her feet put out her hands in an uncertain fashion and then dropped senseless into Raymond s arms 
6637_71405_000008_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XIV
6637_71405_000009_000000	train-clean-360	IS THIS MADNESS 
none	none	Instantly there was wild confusion and half a dozen persons sprang forward to assist Raymond with his burden But he waved them back Let her have air he said Don t crowd so close 
6637_71405_000011_000002	train-clean-360	She must have air and he moved towards a window 
none	none	The crowd separated to let him pass and allowed him the use of an entire bench while more water was brought and the bottle of smelling salts was again produced In the meantime the coroner whispered to the chief of police who in turn whispered to a policeman and the two minions of the law followed Raymond Margaret lay like one dead every particle of color having forsaken her cheeks 
6637_71405_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Raymond waited anxiously and then applied his ear to her heart 
none	none	A doctor he cried hoarsely A doctor for Heaven s sake She is dying 
6637_71405_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Doctor Bardon came forward followed by Doctor Bird and both looked at the unconscious one closely and critically 
6637_71405_000014_000001	train-clean-360	There was no shamming here the shock had been heavy the bolt had struck home 
none	none	This is serious truly murmured the older physician We had better remove her to a side room and loosen up her garments Many were willing to assist but Raymond shook them off and he and Doctor Bird carried Margaret into the room where the jury had arrived at the verdict which had so stunned her Then a nurse who happened to be in the court room was called in and she and the physician began to work over the suffering girl Doctor Raymond could scarcely speak
6637_71405_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 She will will come around all right 
none	none	Why I guess so She has swooned that is all The trial was too much for her And then there was such a crowd and the ventilation being poor The young man waited five ten fifteen minutes it was as an eternity The doctor still continued to work and so did the nurse Then the latter whispered something and Raymond caught the words a mental shock by her eyes
6637_71405_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 What s that he questioned 
none	none	He looked at Margaret and saw that her eyes were wide open and she was staring hard at him Margaret 
6637_71405_000021_000000	train-clean-360	She did not answer but continued to stare turning from him to the nurse and then to the old doctor 
none	none	The chief of police was at the doorway and she gave him a look that fairly froze his blood Who she began and stopped short How light it is 
6637_71405_000022_000002	train-clean-360	What struck me 
none	none	Why are you all staring at me in this manner 
6637_71405_000022_000004	train-clean-360	What have I done Where am I Have I been sick 
6637_71405_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Margaret Raymond came closer and took her hand 
none	none	Margaret She stared at him and flung his hand away I ve had a horrible dream I dreamed papa was murdered that somebody had strangled him Strangled him to get my engagement ring from me And there was blood there blood and nobody could come to the lawn party Oh if they knew and my poor head it swims so 
6637_71405_000024_000004	train-clean-360	And the bottle the handkerchief 
6637_71405_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Margaret Margaret 
none	none	Don t go on so He caught her hand again and sank down on his knees beside her Be calm It will all come out right You fainted that s all Don t you remember Margaret Yes yes I remember You said you would marry me and then you said you she tore her hand away and pointed her finger at him you said I had murdered papa and murdered her Oh the shame of it the shame And then she gave a shriek and began to rave tearing at her clothes and her hair until the latter fell all over her face 
6637_71405_000026_000003	train-clean-360	The paroxysm lasted for several minutes and then she fainted once more 
none	none	I shall have to give her something to quiet her said the doctor She is in a worse state than I at first imagined The strain has been entirely too much for her nervous system We must get her to some quiet spot Shall we take her home asked Raymond No I would not advise that mister My name is Raymond Case My home is a quiet one spoke up the nurse If you wish you can take her there It is
6544_71420_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 not very far 
none	none	from here
6637_71405_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Besides the old doctor paused 
none	none	The coroner has something to say about it Coroner Busby has turned the prisoner over to me came from the chief of police and he advanced a few feet into the room The prisoner faltered Raymond
6637_71405_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh yes I suppose that is right But you can t take her to jail 
none	none	I ll go her ball for any amount he may fix Sorry mister Case but they don t take bail on such a charge as murder But you can t lock her up in this condition it would be inhuman I ll have her taken to some quiet place and you can have a guard set I ll pay all the bills Ask the coroner if that won t do She isn t going to run away She looks now more as if she might die and he gave a groan that came straight from his heart The chief of police had once been young and in love with a pretty girl and his face softened Then he remembered what Raymond had said about paying the bills I ll fix it up with Busby he said Go ahead and do what you wish only don t take her out of town A little later a carriage was brought around and Margaret was placed inside and driven rapidly to the home of Martha Sampson the nurse She began to rave again but the physician gave her a quieting potion which put her in a sound but unnatural sleep She was placed in a pretty and comfortable bedroom on the second floor in the rear so that she might not be annoyed by those passing the house in front Two policemen in plain clothes were put on guard one relieving the other In the meantime the news that Margaret had been adjudged guilty by the coroner s jury spread like wild fire and the curiosity seekers could scarcely be kept away from the place to which the poor girl had been taken The grand jury can t do anything but indict her said more than one And if there is any justice left she ll surely be electrocuted It was a bitter blow to Raymond to have Margaret thought guilty but he did not think of that as he sat by her side or walked up and down in the little hallway just outside of her door Her staring eyes haunted him and he longed for a look that should tell him her reason had once more asserted itself The doctor had come and gone twice and had promised to come again that evening Slowly the hours wore away The nurse had gone below to prepare herself something to eat and Raymond stood by the suffering one s bedside 
6637_71405_000043_000003	train-clean-360	He saw the eyelids of the one he loved quiver slightly 
none	none	Margaret he said softly bending over her There was no response and he repeated the name several times Then her eyes opened full Where am I she asked vacantly You are safe with me he answered and took her hand
6637_71405_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 With you Raymond 
none	none	Where At the home of a lady who is going to take care of you for the present How queer I thought I was at my own home
6637_71405_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 We thought it best to bring you here 
none	none	Miss Sampson will do all she can for you 
6637_71405_000051_000002	train-clean-360	The doctor said you must be kept very quiet He smoothed down her hair 
none	none	You have had a terrible trial my dear A trial 
6637_71405_000052_000001	train-clean-360	I don t remember it 
none	none	What was it She stared vacantly at him Oh how queer my head feels And she put one cold hand to her temple Never mind trying to think now Margaret Just take it easy The doctor will come back in a little while and he will give you something that will make you all right again How long have I been here Only four hours Now please don t worry I can t I can t think it s all like a terribly dark cloud Raymond She stared in a wild fashion and then a look of untold horror crossed her drawn features Ah Yes yes I remember now I remember She shook from head to foot I remember The courtroom And those many men and women And the ring our engagement ring think of that Raymond 
6637_71405_000056_000008	train-clean-360	They found blood on it blood And she shivered again 
none	none	Margaret dearest you must try to keep quiet he interrupted soothingly It will all come out right I feel certain of it Right I don t know what you mean by that word Was I on trial or what No not on trial It was simply the coroner s inquest 
6637_71405_000059_000002	train-clean-360	But don t think of it dear He tried to brush back her hair but she stopped him 
none	none	The wild look in her eyes was increasing The inquest Oh yes I know now and they said they said She gave a piercing scream They said I had killed her and killed my own father Yes that I had killed them Do you hear Raymond I had killed them She sat up and motioned him away
6637_71405_000060_000005	train-clean-360	 Do not touch me 
6637_71405_000060_000006	train-clean-360	Do not come near me 
none	none	Margaret he interrupted appealingly
6637_71405_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 No no 
6637_71405_000062_000001	train-clean-360	It is too late too late Her voice sank to a hoarse whisper 
none	none	I see it all the blood on the ring the chloroform our quarrels and what she said to me and then and then She gave another scream Go away go away You must not come near me again
6637_71405_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 But Margaret dear 
6637_71405_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 No I cannot listen 
none	none	You must go away and let them take me to prison let them hang me if they will Her voice sank still lower There is nothing else to do I see the end They have cornered me have found me out Yes they have found me out She gave a wild uncanny laugh that made his flesh creep Ha ha I thought they could not do it but they did They have found me out They have found me out And then with another scream she pitched back and lay again like one dead CHAPTER XV LOVE VERSUS BUSINESS Uncle Adam you must tell me everything Do you hear everything But my dear Letty I am not sure of these things I only want you to wait That s easy enough isn t it It will be if you tell me everything But I can t wait if I am kept in the dark The girl raised her tear stained face to that of the detective Oh I am sure you will do the best you can and all that you have always been so kind to me But but I must know the details A half hour had passed since he had discovered that Letty Bernard was in love with Tom Ostrello that she had been in love with the traveling man ever since they had first met He had heard her whole tale how the young man had taken her out and how they had planned for the future a tale not uncommon even in these plain common sense days when Romance lingers only on the outskirts of society He had been tremendously interested as much so as if the girl was his own flesh and blood Of course he invited me to the theatre before he knew of the death of his mother Letty went on And I suppose he has been so upset he hasn t thought to notify me But he might have sent me word she added wistfully I should have done so if it was my mother He is not like you Letty Well he is just as good That remains to be seen Are you going to tell me what you have in your mind or not Uncle Adam He gazed at her fondly How could he tell her And yet if his suspicions were correct it would be better for her to know the truth now than to be struck down by it later on There is nothing very definite Letty he said slowly You know that all detectives get on the wrong trail at times I have made a mess of more than one case you know that even if the general public doesn t Then he is suspected of these murders she said boldly If you must have the whole story I ll tell it to you It is certainly a curious situation At first suspicions pointed to mister Langmore s daughter now they appear to point to missus Langmore s son For your sake and for the sake of Miss Langmore who appears to be a very nice young lady I trust we shall be able to prove some outside party guilty Tom isn t guilty I am sure of that And Raymond Case is equally certain that Miss Langmore isn t guilty He is the young man who came here and engaged you Yes Is he engaged to her Yes Then of course he thinks her innocent I think her innocent myself Do you think Tom is guilty At this direct question Adam Adams winced He saw before him a disagreeable duty which must be performed I see I must give you the facts Letty But I will do so on one condition only and that is that you keep what I have to say to yourself considering them as office secrets Very well Uncle Adam I ll promise she answered with a pale face upturned to him He bent down and kissed her on the forehead Then he locked the office door sat down in an armchair and let her sit on his lap just as she had done since childhood His recital took the best part of an hour and he gave all the particulars of his interview with Cephas Carboy and with Doctor Calkey and told of the finding of the bit of paper with the address of the drug firm on it and of the strange Chinese poison At the mention of the fatal drug she drew a sharp breath I I she began and stopped short Do you know anything of that drug Letty Perhaps he spoke to you about it He did once when we were speaking of poisons He said he was glad his firm had decided not to handle it for it was too dangerous It has a power that most folks do not know about The power to kill people I suppose No not that He said it was a fatal drug but more than that he said it had a strange power according to the Chinese chemists who manufactured it That power was if it was used on a person and did not kill it would in a few days or a week make that person mad Humph Worse and worse Such a drug should be banished by law But to go on with my story if you must hear the whole of it I am fairly certain it was that drug which was used to kill mister and missus Langmore But Tom did not use it she insisted Somebody else must have gotten the drug from him or from his traveling sample case That is possible Now there is another side to this case which I cannot understand at all And then he told of the counterfeit bank bills Counterfeits she exclaimed and the color began to leave her face once more What kind of bills were they Uncle Adam They were one hundred dollar bills on the Excelsior National Bank of New York City She gave a gasp and clenched her little hands to control herself He could not help but notice her increased agitation What is it Letty Do you know Oh Uncle Adam do not ask me she gasped I I there is some mistake Tom did not she failed to go on and looked at the detective hopelessly What do you know about these counterfeits Come it is best that you tell me everything he continued kindly but firmly To Tom had a counterfeit one hundred dollar bill He we went to the theatre and he got into some trouble over it until he convinced the ticket seller that he did not know it was bad Did he tell you where he got the bill No he said he got stuck that s all Do you know what he did with it He said he was going to give it back and get a good one for it if he could At that moment a postman s whistle sounded in the hallway and several letters dropped through the slit in the door The girl glanced at them and uttering a faint cry arose and picked them up Here is one from Tom now She tore it open and glanced at it hastily I knew it she went on He is all upset because of the murder and scarcely knows what to do He had an important engagement in Albany for yesterday and one in New York for to day but has broken both He says he will come to me as soon as he can and adds a postscript asking me to look in the papers for the particulars of the awful affair You read it Uncle Adam That doesn t look much as if he were guilty does it The detective took the communication and scanned it with care It had evidently been penned in a hurry and was signed Your own Tom One line read I hope with all my heart that the authorities bring the guilty party to justice How could he pen that if he was guilty himself said Letty pointing to the line Oh Uncle Adam you must look elsewhere for the one who did this foul deed I wish I knew where he got that counterfeit Perhaps I can find out for you Can you tell me where he stays when in New York At the Kingdon House on Broadway Then I may look him up Cannot I do something Yes wait and keep quiet Letty But you will try to clear him if you can won t you I am going to try to find the guilty party It is dreadful to remain here and do nothing with such a cloud hanging over one Then take a vacation It will do you good Get Miss Harringford to come in here she knows the ropes and you go off in the country or to the seashore I ll make you an allowance of fifty dollars for the trip Take it out of the cash on hand And Letty don t worry too much The girl smiled but it was not a smile to please one Very well I ll go off she said and turned back to her desk I ll take the time off to help clear poor Tom she murmured to herself CHAPTER XVI SOMETHING ABOUT A SECRET SERVICE MAN On the following morning the newspapers brought to Adam Adams the full particulars of the Langmore inquest with the finding of the coroner s jury 
6695-71407-0000	train-other-500	The papers also described how Margaret Langmore had fainted and been placed at a nurse s residence under the care of a physician and guarded by the police By a few it was supposed that the girl s illness was genuine
6695-71407-0001	train-other-500	but the general opinion was that it was assumed in order to draw public sympathy Raymond Case was pictured as a loyal but misguided young man and it was hinted that his relatives were much chagrined to see him remaining at the accused girl s side
6695-71407-0002	train-other-500	in view of the evidence which had been brought to light The detective read the accounts with interest and then leaned back in his office chair in a thoughtful mood Letty had absented herself and in the outer office was another girl
none	none	 who had done substitute work before Suddenly the detective arose with decision went to the telephone and rang up Central Hullo Give me forty five thousand six hundred seventy eight Park There was a buzz and then a heavy voice came over the phone 
6695-71407-0004	train-other-500	Hullo Is that you Vapp Yes Is this mister Adams Yes Are you particularly busy Not if there is any money afloat and a chuckle came over the wire I want you to do some shadowing for me
6695-71407-0005	train-other-500	I don t know how long it will take It s a man a commercial traveler You can pick out your own make up When am I on Right away Want me up there first I think it will be best I want to give you some details
none	none	 I ll be there in half an hour and all ready for the job Adam Adams busied himself in various ways and at the end of half an hour a well dressed middle aged man came in carrying a small sample case in one hand Hullo going to be a commercial traveler yourself eh commented the detective 
6695-71407-0006	train-other-500	It will give me an easy way to get around answered Charles Vapp I m Andy Weber representing the Boxton Seed Company
none	none	 A seed man can go anywhere in the city and the country I got the outfit from old Boxton himself 
6695-71407-0007	train-other-500	He thinks it a good joke and he will keep mum Now what s the game I want you to do some shadowing for me All right that s my line This is a bit out of the ordinary Vapp Well that makes it more interesting Who is the party
6695-71407-0008	train-other-500	The fellow s name is Tom Ostrello
none	none	 Foreigner eh 
6695-71407-0009	train-other-500	No he is American born the son of missus Langmore You don t mean the woman who was murdered with her husband Yes He is a commercial traveler for a drug concern Good I m glad I elected to be a traveler myself
6695-71407-0010	train-other-500	As I said Vapp this is no ordinary case I want you to keep track of this man day and night I ll do it if it can be done I want you to note every person he communicates with
none	none	 I ll do that too And here is another thing of great importance If he spends money 
6695-71407-0011	train-other-500	try to find out if it is good money
none	none	 Eh The shadower looked surprised for an instant 
6695-71407-0012	train-other-500	You want me to look out for counterfeits Exactly That is not so easy but I ll do my best went on Charley Vapp and then he asked a number of questions regarding Tom Ostrello all of which Adam Adams answered as well as he was able
6695-71407-0013	train-other-500	You are to stay on this case until I tell you to drop it said the detective And remember if anything unusual occurs let me know as soon as you can reach me I understand Anything more Adam Adams mused for a moment
6695-71407-0014	train-other-500	Yes You know Miss Bernard who works for me here Sure Well take care that she doesn t see you shadowing Ostrello I m wise answered the shadower smiling and the next moment he was gone
6695-71407-0015	train-other-500	He was not flustered by what was before him for he had been shadowing people for eleven years and as long as there was five dollars per day and his expenses in the work he was willing to continue indefinitely
none	none	 With the shadower gone Adam Adams meditated for a moment and then donned his walking coat and his hat 
6695-71407-0016	train-other-500	In his pockets he placed several large but rather flat packages I am going out Miss Harringford he said to the clerk If I am not back by five o clock you may lock up and go home Be on hand as usual in the morning
6695-71407-0017	train-other-500	Down in the street he hopped aboard a passing car and rode eight blocks He entered an office building went up in an elevator to the third floor and took himself to a suite of offices occupied by certain United States secret service officers
6695-71407-0018	train-other-500	I want to see mister Breslow he said and was shown to a private apartment
none	none	 where an elderly man sat studying several reports How are you Adams was the greeting 
6695-71407-0019	train-other-500	Rather busy to day but what can I do for you I want to sell you some bank bills was the reply and Adam Adams dumped the package on the desk mister Breslow opened it and examined the contents
6695-71407-0020	train-other-500	By the jumping Judas Where did you get those Say this is worth while I guess you haven t rounded up quite as many as I have have you said the detective with a grim smile As many Why man
6695-71407-0021	train-other-500	we ve only run across sixteen so far and you ve got thirty They are such a clever counterfeit that even the banks get nipped This is wonderful I didn t know you were following this trail
none	none	 Why didn t you say something before 
6695-71407-0022	train-other-500	Or maybe you wanted to spring a surprise and make some of the boys down here feel cheap No it was nothing but blind luck I wasn t on the trail at all I simply stumbled over the bills Did you get your man There was no man to get
6695-71407-0023	train-other-500	Do you mean to say you found the bills I did and I didn t They were in the safe of a man who was murdered I guess I ll have to tell you the best part of the story and Adam Adams did so This is of course confidential he went on
6695-71407-0024	train-other-500	Trust me for that Adams Strange complication as you just remarked I suppose you are going to follow up the murder mystery Will you follow this up too I think so I can t get it out of my head that the two are related to each other
6695-71407-0025	train-other-500	More than likely Now you just said you wanted to know something
none	none	 I want to know about this John S Watkins of Bryport Um If I give you his record you ll of course keep it to yourself You know how the department is about such things 
6695-71407-0026	train-other-500	You are safe with me I ll have the record brought in There was a wait of several minutes
none	none	 and then a big book was produced from one of the safes Here you are Adams John S Watkins Bryport Born at New Haven October four eighteen sixty two Former occupation model maker and cabinet maker Private detective for four years 
6695-71407-0028	train-other-500	and one year with the Cassell agency Entered the United States service three years ago Never been advanced Cases forty five thousand two hundred fifty four forty seven thousand seven hundred thirty two
6695-71407-0029	train-other-500	forty six thousand eight hundred twenty nine Wait till I see what those cases are Then three other records were brought forth and examined Humph all small affairs No wonder he hasn t been promoted
6695-71407-0030	train-other-500	The first is that of a young woman who used washed postage stamps They found four dollars worth of washed stamps in her possession The next is the arrest of a cigar dealer who used stamped boxes more than once
6695-71407-0031	train-other-500	He was a fellow sixty eight years old and got two years The last case is a mail order swindle a ten cent puzzle a small affair run by a nineteen year old boy and sentence was suspended
6695-71407-0032	train-other-500	Not a very brilliant record was Adams s comment It s a wonder he can hold his job It is a wonder But he may have political influence or something else or it is barely possible that he may be doing some work that is not on record here
6695-71407-0033	train-other-500	That is all I can tell you What is his salary A thousand or twelve hundred a year Not a very elaborate income
none	none	 No wonder he would like to run down those counterfeiters It would be a feather in his cap eh Most assuredly Do you expect to double up with him 
6695-71407-0034	train-other-500	Of course it s none of my business and you needn t answer if you don t care to I don t know what I ll do yet This is a complication I want to study first I see Well if we can help you I ll send word don t fear
6695-71407-0035	train-other-500	And if I do send word I want you to act on the jump Don t worry about that I know if you send word it means business answered the secret service officer with a laugh An hour later found Adam Adams on a train bound for Bryport
6695-71407-0036	train-other-500	He reached that city in the evening and from a directory he learned where the secret service man resided A street car brought him to within two blocks of the dwelling It was a building of no mean pretentions and on a corner which looked to be valuable
6695-71407-0037	train-other-500	Walking along the side street he saw that two domestics were at work in the kitchen and dining room He certainly lives in style mused Adam Adams Wonder if he manages it on twelve hundred a year
none	none	 As it was a warm night the windows were open and by going close to the house he could hear the conversation being carried on by the servants as they moved back and forth between the two rooms 
6695-71407-0038	train-other-500	From their talk he learned that missus Watkins and her two daughters were at Saratoga
none	none	 and that it was expected that the husband would join his family there soon 
6695-71407-0039	train-other-500	And we ll have good times when he s gone ain t that so Caddie said one of the domestics That we will was the answer Better times than now anyway when you can t tell when he is coming in and when he is going out
none	none	 It is a queer way he has with him lately I guess he is worried over his money 
6695-71407-0040	train-other-500	Why what do you know about that Caddie Dix What do I know Nellie Casey Tim Corey told me missus Watkins didn t git a cent of the old grandfather s money although she said she did and so did the master say so
none	none	 It all went to the other part of the family Then where did mister Watkins git his money I d like to know 
6695-71407-0041	train-other-500	Don t ask me Tim says he is flush enough at the club and other places The government must pay him more than most folks imagine Is Tim goin to the Rosebud s picnic Yes and Dan s goin too and Dan wants me to bring you went on one of the domestics
6695-71407-0042	train-other-500	and then the talk drifted into a channel which was of no further interest to Adam Adams He rightfully surmised that John Watkins was not home and was somewhat puzzled to decide what he should do next It was a long journey from Bryport to Sidham
none	none	 and it was a question if he could accomplish anything at the scene of the tragedy during the night Perhaps it will pay just as well to go to a hotel and go to bed he told himself 
6695-71407-0043	train-other-500	He had just come out to the corner of the street and was halting at the curb when he saw two men approaching One of the pair was John Watkins and the other was a heavy set stranger with bushy hair and a round red nose and mutton chop whiskers
6695-71407-0044	train-other-500	Here we are Styles said John Watkins It s a little late but I reckon the girls can fix us up something to eat It s better than going to a restaurant Anything will do me if you ve got a glass of ale to go with it was the reply
none	none	 Got to have a real Englishman s drink eh said the secret service man with a short laugh 
6695-71407-0045	train-other-500	Well I ve remembered you and I can fix you up to the queen s taste Come on inside
none	none	 And then the pair entered the house CHAPTER XVII AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION Adam Adams had watched the appearance and disappearance of the two men with interest He remembered that Matlock Styles the man who owed the Langmore estate sixteen thousand dollars on three mortgages was an Englishman with mutton chop whiskers Evidently the man who had arrived with the secret service employee was the same individual This being so the question at once arose what had brought the pair together Matlock Styles lived in an old colonial mansion so Raymond Case had said a mile and a half from the Langmore estate Did his coming to Bryport have anything to do with the tragedy or with the counterfeits Going close to the house once more he heard the two men enter the parlor and heard Watkins order supper Then followed a conversation in such a low tone that he could only catch an occasional word He heard something about mortgages and then a safe was mentioned but he could not catch the direct connection Evidently though they were discussing the Langmore affair In a short while supper was served and the two men passed to the dining hall Here while the girls were near they spoke of matters in general The meal finished John Watkins invited his visitor up to his den on the second floor As said before the house was on a corner and by the lighting up of a room above Adam Adams located the den just behind the main front corner room and close to a tree which grew along the side street Looking around the detective made certain that nobody was observing him and then began to climb the tree with the agility of a schoolboy One heavy branch ran out close to the building and standing on this brought him to within three feet of the window which was screened and open from the bottom to admit the air The curtain was down to within three inches of the window sill thus affording the detective a chance to peep into the apartment without running much risk of being discovered Then you say the mortgages have not been paid came from John Watkins No blast the luck growled Matlock Styles I didn t think he wanted the cash so I let them run on Have you any idea how the estate is to be divided I understand the girl gets half The wife s half will go to her two sons now That is lucky for them I reckon Dick Ostrello can use all the money he can lay hands on He s a wild one if ever there was one Don t Tom spend his money Not lately I understand he is saving up to marry some girl in New York Humph There was a pause during which time both men lit cigars How is the bloody business going asked Matlock Styles presently Oh I manage to earn my salary answered the secret service man with a dry laugh I don t get promoted though You ought to try to unearth some big mystery That would get your name in the papers I don t want my name in the papers I am doing well enough Ain t I on the track of those counterfeits What more do you want Yes but you haven t got them yet blast the luck And you say you had the safe open I did Then why didn t you look inside I should have done so I thought I d get a better chance later on But when I went back hang me if I could work the combination again Have the safe makers opened the safe yet I think so but if the counterfeits were found the local authorities haven t said a word Somebody must be laying low There was another pause and then Matlock Styles brought some papers from his pocket You might glance over these bloody things while you have time he observed Perhaps they ll give you a clue to work on You see I believe in helping a detective all I can and he chuckled broadly As Adam Adams could see the documents were of legal aspect and with them were several letters Then the deal goes through said John Watkins Doesn t that look like it And the patent is yours Yes I wonder what Barry Langmore would say to this if he was alive He wouldn t like it at all Do you think you can make any money out of the patent Money I hope to make a fortune out of it Say Styles you re a lucky dog and always were It s because I watch my bloomin chances answered the Englishman By the way were you at the inquest Sure I didn t see you No but you spoke to me I did You re mistaken Don t you remember the farmer who asked you for a chew of terbacker Was that you exclaimed Matlock Styles If it was you re improving The first thing you know you ll be the real thing and getting a head position at Washington I shouldn t mind that answered John Watkins Where are you going to morrow To New York to nose around Want to locate the counterfeits I want to see if they have been reported I ve got a certain idea about them but I am not sure if I am right What s the idea That Langmore girl has engaged a detective named Adam Adams to clear her if he can He was dodging around the house when I was there and somehow it s got into my head that he knows about the counterfeits Does he belong to the secret service No he s a private detective I don t know much about him but they say he s a pretty good one continued John Watkins You think he opened the safe I m thinking that perhaps he was at the safe after I opened it The safe is of a make in which the combination can be changed with ease He could have looked into it and then have changed the numbers I certainly didn t forget the old combination it was so easy four on forty three on thirty and two on twenty but that wouldn t open it when I went back Can t you get in with him and find out what s what suggested Matlock Styles You can tell him that you are working up this case of the counterfeits I may do that The trouble is these private detectives don t like to go in with an outsider they are too much afraid of losing the credit for what they are trying to do Is anybody else on the case Not that I know of If there was At that moment the door bell of the house rang and soon one of the girls came upstairs mister Martin is below said she to John Watkins Is that so Tell him I will see him in a minute The secret service man turned to the Englishman He is a real estate man who is going to sell this house for me I d forgotten that I had an appointment with him Never mind give me that money you promised and I ll be going answered Matlock Styles I ve got a lot of things to attend to in the next few days I ll give it to you in the library The money is in the safe was the answer and then both of the men left the room Adam Adams descended to the ground and walked slowly to the front of the house In a few minutes he saw the Englishman step out on the front piazza followed by the secret service man Where are you going now asked the latter Home and to bed was the reply Goodnight Will I see you to morrow Either to morrow or the day after I want to settle up this real estate deal I promised my wife I d do it The Englishman came away from the house and hurried along the street to where the trolley car ran He boarded a car moving towards the depot and Adam Adams did the same At the depot Matlock Styles took a train for home Adam Adams made his way to a hotel in a thoughtful mood The conversation he had overheard interested him greatly He decided to learn more concerning the pair and especially Matlock Styles without unnecessary delay CHAPTER XVIII A GIRL S RAVINGS Raymond Case passed a sleepless night watching over Margaret The doctor called once more as he had agreed and left another soothing powder which the nurse administered with difficulty She shook her head when she came out of the sick room What do you think questioned the young man pleadingly To tell the truth it looks like a bad case to me mister Case was the reply I may be mistaken but I ve had a pretty large hospital experience She doesn t seem to respond to treatment as she should Don t you think I ought to call in a specialist Martha Sampson shrugged her shoulders That is for you to say It wouldn t be proper for me to say anything against Doctor Bird I ll send for a specialist at once said Raymond and hurried off to the nearest telephone station He had some difficulty in getting the proper connection with New York and then had to hold the wire until the specialist could be roused up The expert s fee was large but once guaranteed he promised to come by the first train He ll be here by seven o clock said the young man on returning to the house Will you let Doctor Bird know Yes as soon as the specialist gets here I want to be sure of my new man first It was six o clock when Margaret roused up once more Raymond was dozing in an armchair the nurse having retired to get a short sleep The young man was instantly at the sufferer s side All the color had left Margaret s face and she was deathly pale Her eyes were as bright as stars and had a look in them that Raymond had never before seen Are you better Margaret he asked softly I I don t know she answered slowly I I feel very strange all over me Perhaps you had better go to sleep again No I don t want to sleep any more Raymond I want to know something What is it dear Will they make me go to the funerals Her face began to show signs of worriment You ll not have to go if you don t wish to he answered and gave a slight shiver in spite of himself for the question was such an unexpected one I can t go I can t look at them And then the crowd would stare so Oh Raymond the crowd is the worst of all Hundreds of eyes boring one through and through I can t stand that You ll not have to stand that Margaret But go to sleep do It will do you a world of good and he smoothed down her hair fondly No I ve slept enough I want to talk Oh I am not afraid to talk now she added sitting up I thought it all out while I was sleeping Isn t it funny that one can think a thing out in one s sleep And it s so very clear now as clear as crystal and it was so dark and muddled before Will they give me a trial He started in spite of himself Please don t think of that now Margaret I beg of you Lie down and try to sleep I have sent for another doctor a specialist He will be here soon A specialist How can he help me You hired that mister Adam Adams but he has deserted me But then but then he must have learned the truth She gave a sob and buried her face in her hands Yes he must have learned the truth Margaret do keep quiet please he pleaded You need rest you must have rest No I want to talk to tell you something Raymond I I want you to go away Away Oh Margaret Yes away you mustn t come near me any more You are innocent and it isn t right that you should suffer with me You must go away and forget me I ll never do that You mustn t even dream of such a thing We are going to get you well and we are going to prove your innocence to the world My innocence Oh Raymond don t speak so it cuts me like a knife But I mean it he said firmly Yes yes I know you are so good hearted so true But haven t I told you Must I go over it again The ring the blood Margaret And that note and the quarrels and all Didn t they prove that I was guilty Yes they proved it and I must must Will they hang me or electrocute me I wonder how it feels to be hung or electrocuted She gave a hollow bitter laugh I ll soon know I suppose And then she fell back on her pillow exhausted The nurse had been aroused by the talking and stood in the doorway She gazed questioningly at the young man Did you wake her up No she roused up and insisted upon talking She ought to be kept quiet I ll give her another powder Had you not better wait until the specialist arrives Well we can do that if he isn t delayed too long After that the time dragged heavily Just before train time Raymond took a coach to the depot and there met the specialist and told his story as the pair were driven rapidly to the house It is a purely nervous shock undoubtedly said the specialist I will first find out from the nurse what the other doctor has given her He was soon in consultation with Martha Sampson In the midst of this Doctor Bird arrived The local physician was willing enough to transfer the case to new hands I am of the opinion that she is guilty he said in private to the specialist mister Case of course thinks differently You can figure it out to suit yourself and he told exactly what he had done and then went away not to return Doctor Fanning watched at the sufferer s side for over an hour before Margaret roused up again The girl was very weak and spoke disconnectedly but always in the same strain She went over the scene at the inquest several times and spoke of the blood on the engagement ring as if that was the crown of her misfortunes Then she sat up suddenly and looked at the new doctor Are you the judge she demanded If you are I will tell you all I am guilty they proved it I am guilty guilty guilty she repeated the words over and over again until she fell back on the pillow as before Then she became delirious and it took both the nurse and Raymond to hold her The doctor speedily opened up his case of medicines and gave her a hypodermic injection in the forearm Then he made an examination of the patient lasting some time I will be plain with you mister Case he said drawing the young man to another room This is a serious matter a very serious matter indeed I believe you think the young lady innocent of the crime of which she is accused I am willing to stake my life on it She is raving now that is all Um The specialist nodded slowly and thoughtfully Well then we can only hope for the best I had better stay with her at least to day and to morrow there may be another turn to her condition shortly Do your best doctor I am willing to foot the bill no matter what it is If I was certain she was innocent I am certain of it You have the proofs No not that But I understand your situation mister Case and I honor you for the stand you have taken At the same time I feel it my duty to tell you something It is about a case that came under my notice three years ago An old man was murdered and his wife was suspected of the crime She declared that she was innocent and many believed her But soon the evidence began to accumulate against her and she had the same kind of a shock that Miss Langmore has experienced She raved and at last cried out that she was guilty And was she guilty It was never proven although matters looked black against her The case hung fire because the old woman kept growing worse The doctors who were in attendance did all that medical science could suggest to bring the old woman out of her peculiar state But it was of no avail And the end doctor the end questioned the young man eagerly It s a sorry thing to tell you but it is best to be warned The old woman went mad and while in that condition she one night committed suicide by leaping out of a window It is a sad case but it may act as a warning Someone must be on hand to watch Miss Langmore constantly A long conversation followed and the specialist gave minute direction to the nurse who promised to get another nurse to relieve her Then the medical man mixed up several drugs and placed the mixture in a glass with some water The talk left Raymond in low spirits and the young man walked up and down in the parlor below in a thoughtful mood The outlook was certainly gloomy enough What if the shock should prove so severe that Margaret would never get over it In that case it would matter little even if her innocence was established In the midst of his meditations he saw a man come up on the porch and he opened the door to admit Adam Adams and ushered the detective in the parlor I understand Miss Langmore was brought here said Adam Adams dropping into a chair Yes and Raymond told his story We looked for you at the trial he added I had other things to do mister Case and I read the most of the testimony in the newspapers But I am sorry to learn that Miss Langmore is in this condition and I trust the specialist pulls her through in good shape Yes yes so do I But we must clear her mister Adams it must be done I said I would do my best But this is going to be no ordinary mystery to unravel It is deeper than most folks suspect A deep motive was the cause of the double murder a motive I hope to unearth before I am through Unless the mystery is speedily cleared up I am afraid Miss Langmore will go raving mad and the specialist is afraid so too Yes such things have happened before the mental strain is too great for sensitive nerves to bear So I must lose no time Now to come to business I want you to tell me all you can about mister Langmore s life and his business dealings with people in this vicinity CHAPTER XIX ADAM ADAMS MAKES A NEW MOVE It was not until an hour later that Adam Adams left Martha Sampson s cottage He had gained from Raymond all the information he could and also the names and addresses of half a dozen people he thought to interview He spent what was left of the forenoon in the town calling at the bank and on a lawyer and one of the merchants and about three o clock in the afternoon made his way once more to the vicinity of the Langmore mansion Here to his surprise he ran into Charles Vapp Is your man around here he asked as the pair met in the shadow of some bushes Yes went into the house five minutes ago Have you learned anything unusual Not much He has been around arranging his business affairs and he met Miss Bernard and the two had a confidential talk but I couldn t get close enough to hear what was said After that he came out to Sidham and there met a man named Matlock Styles Go on The two had a long talk and Ostrello seemed to be angry about something Then this Styles seemed to threaten Ostrello and the young man seemed to lose all his nerve and wilt I never saw a fellow change so You can t do it I heard him say and Styles answered I can and I will if you try to interfere with my business Then they talked in a low tone and Styles went off in a buggy saying he was going home Ostrello walked up the street and down again as if he didn t know what to do At last he hired a rig and came out here He went into the house and I was just going to change my disguise and take a look around when you came up I see Well Vapp if he meets this Styles again you do your level best to hear what is said I did it before but they kept in a corner of a building and I couldn t get near without attracting their attention I tried it once but both of them gave me such a suspicious look I had to move on That s all He sent three letters and a telegram The telegram was to the firm he works for something about an order for quinine pills I heard it clicked off at the telegraph office Well you can stay here and I ll go into the house If he comes out you follow him said Adam Adams The detective found the mansion in charge of the policeman and missus Morse Both looked at him questioningly as he entered Nothing is to be touched said the policeman Them s orders from headquarters Is anybody here missus Morse and myself that s all No visitors at all No sir That s queer Haven t seen anything of missus Langmore s son to day The policeman shook his head You haven t seen him have you he asked of the woman No and I don t want to see him she answered tartly I don t want anybody to bother me and she looked directly at the detective I shan t bother you was the quick reply But as I am working on behalf of Miss Langmore and as this was her father s house and the one in which she lived I think I shall take a look around he went on in a slightly stiffer voice But orders began the policeman You may go around with me so that you can be sure I do not touch anything Well I dunno began the bluecoat His speech was cut short by the banging of a rear door as the wind caught it missus Morse gave a cry What was that I didn t leave any door open She ran to the rear of the mansion and the policeman followed Adam Adams stepped to the front door and then out on the lawn He was in time to see a man leap a side fence and start down the road A moment later Charles Vapp was following the disappearing individual The detective stepped into the house again Well that s mighty queer muttered the policeman as he came back It is queer answered Adam Adams eying him sternly You had better explain it if you want to keep out of trouble Explain what came from missus Morse You just told me that nobody was in the house Well A man just left by the back door and ran away Either you knew he was here or else you are not taking proper care of these premises Why sir began the woman but then her eyes dropped before the steady gaze of the detective I that is Who was that man Come answer me truthfully or I shall report this and let me say my word will carry great weight Oh well if you must know it was mister Ostrello missus Langmore s son He wanted er some books he left here some time ago I don t know why he left in such a hurry Perhaps because he didn t wish to meet you Then you admit you lied to me do you At this the woman broke down completely and began to cry I didn t want to do any wrong sir He said he wanted to get the books and he didn t want every Tom Dick and Harry to know he was here those are his own words He s a very nice gentleman and so so I said what I did You let him go through the house He had that right It was his mother s home wasn t it Yet you didn t want me to go through A relative is different Nevertheless I think I ll take a look around now he has gone returned Adam Adams To this the woman felt she could no longer object and the policeman merely shrugged his shoulders From the pair the detective learned that the safe had been opened by an expert in the presence of the coroner and chief of police who had then had the combination set to suit themselves A tour of the mansion brought nothing new to light and Adam Adams left by the back way and walked down to the brook Then he leaped the stream and took to a narrow path leading through the woods beyond Deep in the woods he paused to make several changes in his appearance putting on a light wig and blue goggles and also an old fashioned collar and necktie Then he rubbed a little brown powder on his hands and face rendering his complexion several shades darker than ordinary From a map of the county he had studied the surrounding roads thoroughly and soon came out on a highway leading to Matlock Styles residence He was more than ever interested in the Englishman and wondered what John Watkins Tom Ostrello and Styles might have in common In the distance he presently beheld a house he knew must be the Styles place There was a turn in the road and instead of going up to the house by the front way the detective leaped a fence and passed through a wheatfield Beyond this and quite close to the house and the out buildings was a field planted with corn between the rows of which were pumpkins and squashes He had hoped to gain the vicinity of the residence without being observed as it was now growing darker but he was not yet halfway through the cornfield when the deep baying of a mastiff burst upon his ear coming nearer and nearer Hullo this is something I didn t bargain for he muttered He did not wish to shoot a valuable dog and at the same time he did not intend to run the risk of being bitten and perhaps torn to pieces He halted and drew his pistol and a second later the dog burst into view He was a full blooded mastiff and a magnificent creature in every way He came to a halt and showed his teeth and presently his mate also appeared Back there cried the detective Back I say But the dogs only came closer baying loudly and eying him in anything but a friendly fashion Hi there Nelson came a voice from the other side of the cornfield Hi Queen what s the matter Call off your dogs unless you want me to shoot them exclaimed Adam Adams Blast you don t you shoot my dogs was the answer and in a moment more Matlock Styles put in an appearance He carried a dog whip and motioned the animals away Back Nelson you bloody brute Back Queen And both animals slunk to his rear Thanks I am glad you came said Adam Adams and slipped his pistol back into his pocket Are you sneered the Englishman If you had killed one of those dogs you would have gotten into a mess I can warrant They are worth a hundred pounds five hundred dollars each Great smoke I m glad I didn t touch em sir I couldn t pay for one leg and the detective grinned What are you doing in this field I thought I d take a short cut to the Knoxbury road It s getting late and I want to get back to the tavern there The Knoxbury road Why man you re a good three miles out of your bloomin way The Knoxbury road isn t this way it s over there and Matlock Styles pointed with his whip Is that so Then I m twisted Too bad I m so dog tired I can t walk much further either Been taking a constitutional That and I walked over to look at the place where that double murder took place Awful crime that eh Made me shiver just to look at the house I suppose you ve heard about it Yes everybody knows about it around here They say the man s daughter did it If she did they ought to string her up for it growled Matlock Styles Such a blasted cold blooded crime as that was Was you to the inquest No Our coroner got her to rights He s a sharp one While the two were talking they were walking towards the house which was a pretentious affair but closed up on one side They halted near a side porch If I am three or four miles from the Knoxbury road I d like to get something to eat and rest a bit before I start out again said the detective Could you supply me with a bite I m willing to pay whatever s fair I fancy so answered the Englishman after a slight hesitation during which he eyed Adam Adams keenly Polly he called and an old woman with a wrinkled face and a tangle of gray hair appeared holding a cup in one hand and a towel in the other What are ye wantin now Mat she croaked Here s a gentleman has lost his way He wants a bite to eat before he starts again Fix him up some sandwiches and some milk and whatever else you have handy that s good Where is Paul Gone to town And Fred Gone to see the Garrison girl The woman disappeared from view and a moment later Matlock Styles and Adam Adams entered the dining room of the abode CHAPTER XX A QUEER TURN OF AFFAIRS The detective felt that he was on delicate as well as dangerous ground Nothing had been said to arouse his suspicions but he could feel by instinct that the Englishman was growing distrustful of him Take off your coat it s bloomin warm in here said Matlock Styles as he proceeded to shed his outer garment Thanks but I d just as soon keep my coat on was the answer I am used to it Fine farm you have here Pretty fair Raise much grain Only for the stock I deal mostly in horses and in fancy dogs I used to own a fancy dog myself said Adam Adams smoothly and mentioned the fine points The Englishman seemed to warm up to this subject and spoke of the many dogs he had and of the prices some had brought him In the midst of the conversation a lunch was brought in and the detective sat down to eat Then with great care Adam Adams brought the talk around once more to the Langmore tragedy But Matlock Styles at once grew cold The girl did it he reaffirmed They have her cornered It won t be possible for her to clear herself even with the best lawyers in the country Do they suspect anybody else I think not By the way did you say you were at the house Oh I walked around the place that s all I saw a policeman on guard there Anybody else No Did you come across the stream asked the Englishman quickly Yes I thought it was a short cut but I got left You came right from the brook to my place Well not exactly I got tangled up in the woods before I got on the path that brought me here See anything strange around the Langmore house any tracks or anything like that Why do you ask that I thought you were sure Miss Langmore was guilty So I am but a fellow makes some bloomin mistakes sometimes I am not interested very much though continued Matlock Styles and gave a yawn I saw nothing out of the ordinary There were a good many footprints Running this way Running every way I thought What kind of a man was this Barry Langmore A fairly good sort He wanted everything that was coming to him and so did his wife She was a tartar and so was the girl I shouldn t have wanted to live in the house with them At that moment another man appeared at the doorway Hullo got company he called out Not exactly Bart answered Matlock Styles Excuse me for a moment he continued to the detective and passed out of the room and to the kitchen with the newcomer He was gone for several minutes and during that time Adam Adams finished his lunch and took a good look at the room he occupied There was nothing unusual about the apartment and his survey was finished before the Englishman returned Now I think I ll pay you and be on my way said Adam Adams rising There seemed to be no excuse for his lingering longer How much do I owe you Not a blasted farthing Then I am much obliged Will you have a smoke and Adam Adams handed forth a couple of choice Havana cigars I don t know as I care to smoke mister You didn t give me your name Robert Dixon And yours Matlock Styles I don t care to smoke Bart At the call the other man came in from the kitchen To his surprise Adam Adams saw that he carried a rope in one hand and a pistol in the other He was followed by the mastiff Nelson Don t you dare to stir you bloody rascal went on Matlock Styles to the detective Why what s the matter now queried Adam Adams The turn of affairs puzzled him not a little You ll soon see what s the matter said the man called Bart I must say I don t understand you Maybe you ll understand when you are a prisoner put in Matlock Styles A prisoner What for You know well enough I am entirely in the dark See here is this a hold up Yes for we are going to hold you up you bloody villain said the Englishman with a chuckle Don t dare to resist or it will be the worse for you and he drew a pistol from his pocket But what does it mean It means that I have found you out You are the murderer of mister and missus Langmore What For the instant Adam Adams was truly surprised It was such a turn of affairs as he had not anticipated He looked at Matlock Styles keenly Could the Englishman really mean what he said He certainly appeared sincere enough You have made a great mistake sir said the detective I know nothing more of the murders than I have already related I think differently my fine fellow What makes you imagine I am guilty Never mind that now Why I can prove an alibi Then you ll have to prove it and a bloody strong one too before I let you go I ve seen you sneaking around before That s a wig you are wearing Bart bind him and do it bloomin tight too I ll do it tight enough answered the other man pocketing his pistol Hold out your hands he went on to the detective Adam Adams looked around to see if there was some means of escape But he realized that between the two men and the somewhat savage mastiff he was squarely cornered I suppose I ll have to submit he said But let me tell you that you are making a big mistake and it will cost you dear if you make me submit to this indignity I ll sue you for a good round sum At this Matlock Styles winced Evidently he was one who did not like to have his pocketbook touched But then he stiffened again I am willing to run the risk Go ahead Bart Adam Adams was compelled to hold out his hands and to his astonishment not to say chagrin his arms and also his legs were tightly bound Going to search him asked the fellow called Bart Of course answered Matlock Styles and went through the detective s pockets one after the other Fortunately Adam Adams had but little with him outside of a roll of bankbills and the material for several disguises Matlock Styles allowed him to keep his money but placed the disguises on the table That looks as if you were an honest man said he with a sneer Honest men don t go around in this fashion You re the man beyond a bloody doubt and I am going to hand you over to the police Nelson At the call the mastiff came up and looked inquiringly at his master Sit down in that chair continued the Englishman to Adam Adams shoving him backward on a seat Now Nelson watch him Watch him old boy Don t let him get up And the dog growled In response The Englishman then motioned to the other man and the pair went out together closing the door after them Listening the detective heard a murmur of voices in the kitchen of the house and then all became quiet Adam Adams was angry and that anger was directed entirely at himself In the easiest possible manner he had allowed himself to be outwitted and exposed Could the Englishman be honest in what he said or was he playing a deep game That was a question which could not as yet be answered If the fellow was honest he was most likely now getting ready to take his prisoner to the Sidham lockup The absurdity of such a move compelled Adam Adams to smile bitterly To escape was out of the question He could not slip from the cords which bound him and at his slightest move the mastiff growled and showed an inclination to leap at his throat So the detective considered discretion the better part of valor and remained quiet It was fully an hour before Matlock Styles returned He was alone and carried a lantern on his arm for it was now dark outside I can t take you to town to night he said I am going to keep you here until morning You haven t any right to keep me at all I ll risk that I ll make you comfortable don t you fear Adam Adams thought rapidly Perhaps to remain a prisoner at the farmhouse would be better than to be taken to town During the night he might get the opportunity to escape Matlock Styles untied the end of the rope which bound the detective s legs and ordered the prisoner to follow him And don t try to run away unless you want Nelson to make a meal of you he added grimly Where are you going to take me You ll soon see The Englishman led the way out of the farmhouse and past the barn and several other out buildings Then he took to a path leading to the river and presently came to a halt in front of an old deserted mill The building was dark and forbidding and an owl hooting in a nearby tree added to the loneliness of the situation I don t understand this said the detective as Matlock Styles came to a halt The Englishman did not answer Instead he set down his lantern and proceeded to bind the detective s legs once more His manner was now rough and he acted as if he was somewhat desperate He shoved open a door to the mill and peered around inside Then he stepped back put his lantern over his arm and caught Adam Adams up by the middle and threw the detective over his shoulder as if his prisoner were a log of wood There was no use arguing and Adam Adams did not attempt it Indeed he was rather curious to see what the fellow would do next Matlock Styles entered the old mill and then descended a flight of stone steps Below was a sort of cellar damp and musty Crossing the cellar the Englishman opened an iron door in a brick wall and literally threw Adam Adams into the inky darkness beyond Now stay there until I get ready to take you to jail cried the man He banged the heavy iron door shut and bolted it The next instant the detective heard him cross the cellar He mounted the stairs banged the door above and all became quiet CHAPTER XXI CLOSE TO DEATH For several seconds after being forced into the darkness beyond the iron door Adam Adams stood perfectly still He heard Matlock Styles go upstairs and was fairly well satisfied that the Englishman had left the old mill That man has something up his sleeve as sure as fate murmured the detective to himself He is playing a game and a deep one too The darkness was absolute and although he strained his eyes to the utmost he could not see a single thing surrounding him To all appearances he was in a veritable dungeon He sat down on the cement floor and bending forward managed after much labor to loosen the rope around his legs with his teeth Then he began to twist and turn at the rope which held his arms and presently that also came away His efforts lacerated his wrists and ankles but to the pain he paid no attention With caution he moved around until his hands came in contact with a stone wall He paused for a moment and then moved along the wall feeling carefully so that he might not miss any opening which might present itself and keeping one hand in front of him so that he might not run into anything The wall was smooth and apparently solid Suddenly he put out his foot and stepped upon nothing but air He tried to draw back but it was too late and with a cry that could not be suppressed he went down into pitch black space He struck on some sharp rocks and then his senses forsook him The fall was a perilous one and it was only by good luck that Adam Adams did not have his brains dashed out As it was he remained unconscious for fully half an hour and came to his senses to find a large lump on his head and the blood flowing over his face His left shoulder was lame and for the time being he was afraid it was broken The rocks upon which he had fallen rested in several inches of water and with this water he washed off the blood and bathed his hurts as best he could in the darkness The mishap made him reach but one conclusion Matlock Styles had placed him there so that he might injure if not kill himself The rascal muttered the detective If I ever get out of here he shall suffer for this if for nothing else It took him some time to pull himself together and get his breath Then he felt around cautiously being careful to take no more steps until he was sure of his footing In a quarter of an hour he knew he was a prisoner in a circular cistern perhaps twelve feet in diameter and of uncertain depth The walls were perpendicular smooth and covered with slime so to crawl up was totally out of the question A pretty fix to be in he mused If Styles had wanted to kill and bury me he couldn t have started out better Ha What s that He listened and then smiled grimly to himself Rats I suppose there are scores of them around this place I must see to it that they don t get a chance to feed upon my body What was the best way to get out For some minutes the detective studied the situation In one of his pockets he had stuffed the rope taken from his legs thinking it might come in handy in some way He made a small loop at one end of this rope and threw it upward a dozen times or more At last it caught on something and held fast Being on guard in case he might fall backward Adam Adams pulled himself up on the rope It had caught on a sharp stone close to the top of the cistern and with an effort he drew himself to the flooring above Thank Heaven for that he murmured I must steer clear of such pitfalls in the future If only I had a light But his pocket light as well as his pistol had been taken from him Whatever was to be done must be accomplished in the darkness and once more he set out on his tour of exploration but this time with added caution It was not long before he found a place where the cellar sloped downward At the end was a semi circular opening not unlike a huge drain I ll follow this and see where it leads to he told himself and went ahead a distance of thirty feet when he found himself wading into water that was fairly clean and sweet I must be close to the river now he reasoned I wonder if I can swim out to the stream He hesitated for a minute and then resolved to make a dive for liberty Down he went into the water and plunged along until he was over his head Then he struck out as well as circumstances permitted It was a truly perilous thing to attempt but the detective was on his mettle and desperate Twenty feet were passed and then the force of the water seemed to drive him upward There was now no turning back and holding his breath with difficulty he swam on and on rising steadily until his head struck an iron obstruction He put up his hands and found that it was a grating Opening his eyes he made out that the grating was less than three inches from the surface of the river Beyond he could see the open sky and the stars shining brightly With might and main he tried to push the grating aside It refused to budge and he grew frantic for his breath was fast leaving him It looked as if he would be drowned like a rat in a trap Desperately and with all of his remaining strength he threw himself at the grating It bent at one end and came loose Then he made another attack and the grating dropped to one side and his body shot upward to the surface of the river out into the life giving air He gasped spluttered almost tumbled down again and then staggered to the shore which was close at hand He had been under water less than three minutes yet the time had seemed an age He sat on the grassy bank for a long time trying to get back his strength and wondering what he had best do next All was silent around him saving for the hooting of some owls and the occasional far off cry of a whip poor will He gazed around but not a light was in sight The old mill was beyond him partly screened by a number of trees Should he return to the vicinity of Matlock Styles house and set a watch This he thought a good idea but there were two objections He was wet to the skin and wanted some dry clothes and he did not relish running into one or more of the Englishman s savage dogs when he had nothing with which to defend himself As he sat there meditating a stream of light shot across his feet and then disappeared It had come from an upper window of the old mill and he scrambled to his feet to see what it meant In a moment more he saw another stream of light and then a curious white cloud floated up from another window of the mill At the same time he heard loud groans and then a hoarse note coming from what appeared to him to be a fog horn The groans and the white vapor lasted for several minutes and then died away together It was a most uncanny happening and made his heart beat a little quicker than was its usual habit Then of a sudden his face brightened and he smiled to himself Make believe ghosts and nothing more he mused I wonder who is trying to scare folks away from the old mill Most likely it is this Matlock Styles and it is part of another game of his He must have gotten his idea from the old miser in the Chimes of Normandy only he works his ghostship a little differently He was about to move forward when a sound reached his ears which caused him to pause A dog was approaching one of the mastiffs he had met before The animal growled ominously and would have attacked Adam Adams had not the detective leaped into the water and begun to swim away The dog halted on the edge of the bank and then there seemed nothing for the detective to do but to swim to the other side of the river which he did and then disappeared into the bushes I think this investigation will keep at least for to night he reasoned I may as well get back to town get some dry clothes and go to bed His adventures had tired him and he was thoroughly exhausted by the time he reached the Beechwood Hotel Here he explained that he had slipped into the river and readily obtained some dry garments after which he went to bed sleeping soundly until sunrise He obtained an early and substantial breakfast and then visited a clothing establishment for another suit of clothing and a hat From the clothing store he stepped into a drug shop purchasing a number of chemicals and also an atomizer Then he visited a barber shop and got a close hair cut At the post office he received a letter dropped by Charles Vapp the evening before It was short and to the point The man is keeping me on the jump He went to see Matlock Styles and Styles threatened him with something again and Ostrello was greatly disturbed After that Ostrello sent a money order to his brother Dick for fifty dollars He is now going to New York again and I shall follow This communication set Adam Adams to thinking once more That Tom Ostrello and Matlock Styles had something in common there could be no doubt The question was What As the detective was walking back to the hotel he saw Raymond Case approaching and went to meet the young man Oh mister Adams I am glad to meet you cried Raymond Have you learned anything new A little but not a great deal How is Miss Langmore this morning Raymond drew a long sigh I do not think she is much better She is more quiet but She is not clear in her mind That s it She is now thoroughly convinced that she is guilty And you do not believe her
6544_71420_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course not 
6544_71420_000048_000001	train-clean-360	Of course not 
none	none	I know she is innocent Come now honestly don t you think so yourself I do I knew it The young man s face brightened for an instant But it is going to be no easy thing to prove pursued the detective This crime was no simple matter I am certain it was carefully planned and just as carefully executed Those who committed it made it look as simple as possible for a purpose And you are on the track I am on several tracks I am not sure of the right one yet Do you think those counterfeits had anything to do with the crime Undoubtedly You say Miss Langmore seems to be resting easier Slightly If it would not hurt I should like to have a few words with her Then come along and we can ask the specialist I have called in from New York Placing his purchases in the room at the hotel Adam Adams accompanied Raymond to Martha Sampson s residence They found the nurse and the doctor discussing the case and the detective was introduced and he mentioned the object of his visit It will do no harm to speak to Miss Langmore so long as you do not excite her said the specialist But do not dwell on the subject of the murder too long I shall not mention the murder was the reply When Adam Adams entered the sick room he found Margaret sitting up in bed with several pillows behind her head She gazed at him in perplexity and then gave a slight shiver You you have come to take me to prison she cried Not at all Miss Langmore he answered dropping into a chair by her side You shall never go to prison if I can prevent it But I came to see you about something else Do you feel a bit stronger No I feel very weak What do you want to see me about if not about the Oh I want to ask you about some of the men with whom your father did business Didn t you ask me that before Perhaps I did But I want you to give me all the information you possibly can I will In the first place you know Matlock Styles Why yes I know him fairly well He had some business dealings with your father Yes he owed my father money on several mortgages Did they have any other business relations I think mister Styles had some interest in one of my father s patents or at least he claimed an interest He and my father had some differences of opinion in the matter Was the patent matter settled up I do not know but I do not think so Can you tell me anything else about mister Styles The girl hesitated and then a flush mounted to her face Yes I can I I did not wish to speak of it before yet I see no harm in doing so About four months ago mister Styles asked me to marry him I told him I could not do so He was very persistent and said he had more money than I imagined I told him that that would make no difference that I did not love him and did not wish him to mention the matter again How did he take your refusal He was very bitter and overbearing He said I had better think it over and he hinted something about having my father in his power He did not say it in just so many words but he hinted at it Did he mean about the patent No I think it was something else But I did not pay much attention for I thought he was talking merely to get me to consider his suit and I did not wish to consider it for I had become acquainted with Raymond Did he ever bother you after that Only once when I met him on the road Then he asked me again and said I d be sorry some day if I refused him Humph Adam Adams mused for a moment Now to change the subject When did Matlock Styles last call on your father He called several times last week I don t know exactly when he called last But I do know that my father was greatly excited over something and that he called in my stepmother and she was excited too I was not told what it was about Well to drop him do you know a man named John Watkins of Bryport Watkins Yes I do He once called on my father about the same time that mister Styles called last Do you know why he called I do not I thought it was about a patent I learned that mister Watkins worked for the United States government and I thought it was for the patent office Then that is all Miss Langmore The detective arose and held out his hand Now take good care of yourself and do not worry Matters are bound to come out right in the end But how can they be better for me Margaret s face took on its worried look again They have proved that I am guilty You are not guilty said Adam Adams firmly and looking her squarely in the eyes You are not guilty I say so and I know Do not worry Rest quietly and soon everything shall be made plain to you And then before she could answer he was gone She sank back among the pillows closed her eyes and heaved a sigh It cannot be she murmured It is too late I am guilty I am guilty CHAPTER XXII AN UNDERGROUND MYSTERY Late that afternoon a burly negro plainly dressed and wearing a slouch hat made his way along the river road in the direction of the old mill He kept as much as possible in the shade of the bushes and trees and when close to the mill sank low in the tall grass that he might not be seen by anyone who was passing The negro was Adam Adams and his disguise was perfection itself The detective was heavily armed and carried in his pockets several things which were unusual to him He waited around the old mill until the sun went down and the stars began to come out one by one No one was in sight but this did not ruffle him He was ready to play a waiting game and take whatever was to come even at the risk of his life Presently he heard a whistle at a distance Then a man appeared whom he rightfully took to be the fellow called Bart This individual passed up and down the road near the mill and also came down to the water s edge to gaze at the footpath on the other side of the river The man had the mastiff Queen with him and the dog came within a hundred feet of where Adam Adams was in hiding Quickly the detective pulled a large atomizer from his pocket Then as the man walked back to the Styles farmhouse the dog turned and disappeared in the bushes as if following a trail Don t come here old lady muttered the detective as he stood on guard with the atomizer ready for use If you do you ll be sorry The mastiff was following Adam Adams trail and in a minute more she came up and set up a fierce growl Then she made a savage leap forward The detective might have finished her with a shot from his pistol for he was an expert marksman But he had come prepared to strike a blow without making any noise As the mastiff sprang at him he held the atomizer at full length and let a portion of the contents fly full into the animal s face There was a snarl and a gasp and the magnificent canine fell over on her side Leaping forward the detective held the atomizer at the dog s nostrils and used it vigorously for a few seconds It was more than sufficient for his purpose and soon the animal stiffened out in death It s a shame to kill so fine a brute but it can t be helped he muttered as he restored the atomizer to his pocket He had used a mixture of chloroform carbolic acid and other drugs and the dog had been blinded as well as smothered by the application He left the mastiff where she had fallen and as the darkness increased drew closer to the mill Then he saw a man approaching and recognized Matlock Styles The Englishman entered the old mill closing the door carefully behind him More ghost work I suppose murmured the detective but he was mistaken no such manifestations occurring Evidently they were to take place later Without making a sound he crawled up to a side door of the old mill It was unfastened and pushing it open he entered the lower floor of the building All was silent He waited and after awhile heard a step overhead and a low murmur of voices Then a man came down a narrow stairs carrying a pole a white sheet and a round flat pan in which evidently something had been burnt Looks like the ghost outfit thought Adam Adams as he crouched down behind some empty boxes and bins The fellow was tall broad shouldered and powerful looking and Adam Adams felt certain he was not Matlock Styles He wore a thin white bag over his head with two holes for seeing purposes and in one hand carried a flash lantern To the detective matters seemed to be growing tremendously interesting The man placed the things he carried in a closet partly filled with rubbish Then he flashed his light around carefully Adam Adams got down out of sight and placed his hand on the butt of his pistol He was resolved to take no more risks than were absolutely necessary Presently the light was lowered and taking a peep Adam Adams saw the man kneeling down and tugging away at an iron ring in the floor Soon a trapdoor came up and the man taking up his lantern disappeared from view closing the trapdoor behind him The detective waited for several minutes and then stole forward in the utter darkness He had measured the distance perfectly and found the iron ring with ease He pulled upon it gently but firmly and raised the secret door several inches A look below showed nothing but darkness He strained his ears and heard a faint noise at a distance but could not determine whether it was the flowing of the river over the stones or something else He got out his pistol and examined it with care to make certain that it was ready for use Then with a quick motion he threw up the trapdoor dropped below and closed the opening above him He felt as does a lion tamer stepping into a cage of beasts new to him He realized that he was on the verge of some important discovery but that this investigation might cost him his life He was on a narrow staircase There were but ten steps and then he found himself between two stone walls with the roof just above his head Not caring to take another drop into the unknown he advanced slowly taking no step until he was sure of it Presently he came to a turn and then another He could now see a light shining ahead coming from under a heavy wooden door The barrier was tightly closed He tried it softly to find it fastened on the other side There was a strange whirr and a clicking in the apartment beyond as if some machinery was in motion But then came a loud voice and the other sounds stopped By getting down on his hands and knees Adam Adams was enabled to hear nearly all that was said in the place beyond the barred door I will listen to reports said a voice which sounded much like that of Matlock Styles Number One have you performed the ghostly manifestations I have chief was the answer Did you notice anything unusual A boy and a girl on the other side of the river ran away as if the Old Nick were after them Anything else No but it s Number Three s turn after tonight Very well Number Three take notice of that Number Two there are but six of you here to night What of the other two A note was left at the foot of the tree They could not come for one had business in New York and the other business in New Haven Very well Number Three what of the goods you shipped to Philadelphia day before yesterday I have a telegram that it was safely received and payment will be made to morrow How much Two thousand dollars That is fine We are doing better than we did I ll try to get more next time Do so by all means The more we get the better off we shall be and the sooner we can retire Number Four what have you to report I haven t heard from Albany yet I think I ll hear to morrow What have you to say Number Five I met my man last night He won t touch the stuff says it is too risky Humph What does he expect A fortune for nothing What have you to say Number Six I got a long letter from Denver The man out there will take twenty thousand dollars worth at fifteen per cent Didn t you tell him our rate was twenty five per cent I did but he won t bite at that figure He says he will go elsewhere Where can he go He didn t say but he swears he can get the goods Not as good as ours However let him have the stuff at fifteen per cent for the present There was a pause Now has anybody got anything to say I have spoke up the man called Number Three I say we must be careful That tragedy at the Langmore house has brought a lot of detectives to this vicinity Yes I know that One of them came over to the farm answered the leader and now Adam Adams was sure he was Matlock Styles Came to the farm What did you say to him I put him off the track He will never bother us again to my way of thinking That s sure asked another of the men Bloody sure We must make certain began another of the number when a noise outside of the door caused an interruption So interested had Adam Adams become in the conversation that he had not noticed the advance of two burly men upon him and he was not aware of their presence until one pounced on his back and made him a prisoner What s the row out there came from within the room A spy boys Open the door and help capture him Instantly there was wild confusion The door was flung open and seven men poured forth each armed and all wearing the white head coverings such as has already been described It was a battle of one man against nine and the space was so small that Adam Adams could not turn himself He drew his pistol but while one man held his wrist another wrenched the weapon from his grasp Then the detective went down and was severely kicked and pummelled until to resist further was out of the question He ought to be killed cried one man That s right kill him put in several No no not yet We must question him first said another The band surrounded Adam Adams and several pistols were leveled at his head as he arose It s funny how the nigger got down here began one of the men Nigger broke in another He is no nigger See how the black has rubbed off his face The men stepped closer and then one of them gave a start It s the same man he cried excitedly He turned to another I thought you said I did was the agitated answer There s a bloomin mystery here He couldn t get out He was bound and the door was locked I locked it myself Go and make sure Matlock Styles for it was he ran from the room and was gone several minutes When he came back he was more disturbed than ever You are right he is gone he gasped Can this be the same man He made another examination of Adam Adams Yes you are right Well he shall not get away again he added significantly CHAPTER XXIII THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MARGARET Tom I tell you the best you can do is to make a clean breast of it and get Uncle Adam 
6676-71414-0001	train-other-500	to help you It was Letty Bernard who spoke
none	none	 and she addressed Tom Ostrello The two were seated on a bench in the park where they had gone to talk matters over without fear of interruption 
6676-71414-0002	train-other-500	or of being overheard The conversation had lasted over two hours and in that time the girl had learned many of the young man s secrets and in return
6676-71414-0003	train-other-500	had told him a few things which had astonished and disturbed him He was much downcast and with good reason For the past month many things had gone wrong with him
6676-71414-0004	train-other-500	The one bright spot had been Lefty s love for him pure and strong helping him to carry his burdens
6676-71414-0005	train-other-500	That s an easy thing to say Letty he answered But it is not such an easy thing to do Poor Dick is deep enough in the mud as it is
6676-71414-0006	train-other-500	and it will not be to my credit to mention my connection with Matlock Styles Yes but Tom you you Oh how can I explain
6676-71414-0007	train-other-500	Can t you trust me when I tell you that I am speaking for your own good I I know many things of which you are ignorant Then why don t you tell me Letty
6676-71414-0008	train-other-500	Is it fair for you to keep silent No but then you must remember that I am mister Adams private clerk and he is working on this case in the interests of Miss Langmore
none	none	 I know he is working for her 
6676-71414-0009	train-other-500	and I hope he clears her I always thought she was a pretty nice kind of a girl and
none	none	 I can t believe that she is guilty Tom did you ever imagine they would think you were guilty 
6676-71414-0010	train-other-500	and she gazed at him earnestly as If to search his very soul He started Me
none	none	 Why why 
6676-71414-0011	train-other-500	should anybody imagine I was guilty It s it s out of all reason He drew a quick breath Letty do you mean to insinuate that mister Adams imagines
6676-71414-0012	train-other-500	You mustn t ask me questions Tom
none	none	 But think over what you have told me 
6676-71414-0013	train-other-500	of that letter your brother Dick wrote asking for money
none	none	 and how you visited the house on the very morning of the murder to get the money and how mister Langmore took the letter from your mother and tore it in half 
6676-71414-0014	train-other-500	and the scene afterwards Yes I know But And then think of the way by which mister Langmore and your mother died Killed by a curious poison
6676-71414-0015	train-other-500	something that they inhaled which when the doctor got a whiff of it gave him cramps in the stomach a curious drug not generally known to medical science
6676-71414-0016	train-other-500	a drug He caught her by the wrist and looked fearfully frightfully into her face
none	none	 Letty My God 
6676-71414-0017	train-other-500	A short silence followed and she saw that he was thinking deeply swiftly The cold perspiration stood out on his forehead but he did not appear to notice it
6676-71414-0018	train-other-500	He dropped her wrist and his hand fell as if made of stone Now you understand Tom I I am speaking for I I
6676-71414-0019	train-other-500	want you to clear yourself Then it has gone as far as this He gave a groan It was that drug Letty
none	none	 are you sure they have found out about that drug 
6676-71414-0020	train-other-500	Yes but do not say I said so
none	none	 That drug is accursed 
6676-71414-0021	train-other-500	a Chinese student told me so
none	none	 I laughed at him then 
6676-71414-0022	train-other-500	but now I believe it The first time I carried it around with me I was wrecked in a railroad accident and had my arm hurt Then two weeks later when I had it with me
6676-71414-0023	train-other-500	I got caught in that hotel fire in Buffalo After that a vial once broke on me and if I hadn t gotten away in a hurry I should have been smothered And now
6676-71414-0024	train-other-500	Have you carried any of It lately No not for a month
none	none	 I was afraid of it 
6676-71414-0025	train-other-500	and so was the firm
none	none	 We got rid of it and I was glad of it He bit his lip 
6676-71414-0026	train-other-500	meditatively And they think they suspect that that drug was used It may be Cannot you trace where the drug went to Tom
6676-71414-0027	train-other-500	That might be possible although a good many people saw and heard of it while our firm handled it Was any of it sold or used in the vicinity of Sidham No but
6676-71414-0028	train-other-500	The young commercial traveler stopped short I think But no it can t be And yet What Tom she asked eagerly He shook his head
6676-71414-0029	train-other-500	What s the use It would only drag me into the mud deeper I really can t see what s to do
none	none	 he went on with something of anguish in his tones 
6676-71414-0030	train-other-500	I am certain the very best thing you can do is to go to Uncle Adam and tell him everything He will help you and clear up this great mystery But he is working for Margaret
none	none	 Yes 
6676-71414-0031	train-other-500	but I know he will work for you after he has heard your story But you must tell him everything Where is he now Somewhere around your mother s home or in Sidham I think
6676-71414-0032	train-other-500	I can find out for you Very well I will go to him and ask him if he is willing to side with me as well as with Margaret But watt
6676-71414-0033	train-other-500	I think I ll go and see Margaret first You can send word to mister Adams that I want to see him Tell him I will be at the Beechwood Hotel He can send me a message there
6676-71414-0034	train-other-500	Tell him I can clear up some points which may seem queer to him I will Tom Letty looked much relieved Oh I am sure he will help you
6676-71414-0035	train-other-500	He has never yet failed to accomplish anything he has undertaken An hour later saw Tom Ostrello on his way to Sidham His face was careworn
6676-71414-0036	train-other-500	and he looked to be ten years older than he had a week before He was in a thoughtful mood and scarcely looked out of the car window as the train
6676-71414-0037	train-other-500	rushed onward to its destination Arriving at the town he speedily learned that Margaret had been taken to the home of Martha Sampson and was said to be in a serious
6676-71414-0038	train-other-500	if not dangerous state This caused him to halt and he was half inclined to give up the idea of interviewing her It will only make her condition worse
6676-71414-0039	train-other-500	he mused And poor girl she seems to have suffered more than her share already Perhaps I had better wait until I hear from Adam Adams But then
6676-71414-0040	train-other-500	he determined to learn exactly how she was anyway
none	none	 and turned his footsteps toward the cottage 
6676-71414-0041	train-other-500	which stood on a side street of the town backed up by a patch of woods leading to the river He was just in sight of the place when he heard a cry
6676-71414-0042	train-other-500	and a man came running out of the cottage followed by a woman and a policeman Where is she Where is she cried the man and Tom Ostrello recognized Raymond Case Hullo
none	none	 What s up 
6676-71414-0043	train-other-500	queried the commercial traveler Margaret She is gone cried Raymond He ran back of the house I can t see anything of her he added with a groan
6676-71414-0044	train-other-500	Margaret gone I thought she was sick So she is
none	none	 She was out of her mind and slipped out of her room 
6676-71414-0045	train-other-500	while the nurse went downstairs for some broth I was in the parlor writing a letter And I was on guard in the hallway put in the policeman She didn t pass me that I ll swear to
6676-71414-0046	train-other-500	I was only gone a few minutes said the nurse And I am sure she did not go through the kitchen How long ago was this
none	none	 asked Tom Ostrello 
6676-71414-0047	train-other-500	Only a few minutes ago Oh we must find her answered Raymond If she wanders off in her present state of mind there is no telling what will happen to her The four scattered
none	none	 and a vigorous search was instituted for the missing girl 
6676-71414-0048	train-other-500	Soon the news spread and the chief of police came hurrying to the scene Collins
none	none	 you are responsible for this escape 
6676-71414-0049	train-other-500	said he sternly to the policeman I did the best I could sir was the nervous answer She was that sick sir I didn t think she could get out of bed
6676-71414-0050	train-other-500	much less walk off Perhaps she is hiding in the house The building was searched from cellar to garret and so were several other buildings in that vicinity
6676-71414-0051	train-other-500	but without avail Then the gathering crowd scattered through the woods and along the river I don t believe she was as sick as they pretended said one of the number
6676-71414-0052	train-other-500	This is only a bluff to let her get away I said all along she was a sly one Perhaps she pulled the wool over the doctor s eyes came from another
6676-71414-0053	train-other-500	And over the eyes of that young fellow who s in love with her too Raymond heard some of these remarks and they made his face burn He longed to knock some of the speakers down
none	none	 but held his temper in check as best he could 
6676-71414-0054	train-other-500	He realized that no argument he might advance would make an impression where opinions were so set Tom Ostrello joined in the search as diligently as the rest
6676-71414-0055	train-other-500	and he and Raymond ran through the woods from end to end several times Then they procured a boat and rowed up and down the river and crossed over to the other side
6676-71414-0056	train-other-500	She could not have gone far said Raymond Her strength was not equal to it It was dark by the time they came back to the river to cross to the town side
6676-71414-0057	train-other-500	As they rowed along slowly and silently Tom Ostrello noticed something floating on the water He steered toward the object and picked it up It was a girl s
6676-71414-0058	train-other-500	summer hat Margaret s hat cried Raymond He dropped his oar and his face turned as white as death I know the truth now
none	none	 She has drowned herself in the river CHAPTER XXIV ONE AGAINST MANY Surrounded by his enemies Adam Adams stood in the center of the stone room under the old mill speculating upon what was to happen next He saw that the men were thoroughly aroused and ready for any crime Although all were masked by the hoods over their heads each showed his rage and temper by his movements and his tone of voice Well now you are in our power what have you to say for yourself came from Matlock Styles after a pause What do you want me to say returned the detective You have the best of the game just now so it would seem You re right and we mean to keep it eh boys That s so answered several As a spy he must suffer the fate of a spy put in one of the number Unless he consents to join us added another I d never trust this bloody rascal broke in Matlock Styles He s too sharp for us He s a detective If you don t mind telling what is your business down here Matlock Styles asked Adam Adams He thought it best to put on a bold front even with matters looking as black as they did Ha So you think you know me questioned the Englishman harshly Of course I know you Well it don t matter much now was the significant return Are you transacting business down here Don t you know I do not In that case it s best to keep you ignorant That s right don t tell him a thing came from one of the men who had first caught the detective I want to know why you followed me up continued Matlock Styles You ll find it to your interest to answer me I might answer as you have done and say it is best to keep you in ignorance But I won t do it I followed you up because I think you were connected with the Langmore murders At this Matlock Styles started but quickly recovered What made you think that Certain things I discovered around the mansion
6544_71420_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 Bah 
none	none	That shows how you detectives often miss it I was not near the Langmore house when the murders were committed You can prove that questioned Adam Adams curiously Of course I can I was over to Stony Hill with my team doing some trading I stopped at the tavern and at the hardware store and had quite a chat with several people there I left home at eight o clock in the morning and didn t get back until one o clock in the afternoon If you had taken the trouble you could easily have found out that what I have told you is the truth You can prove that you were at Stony Hill from ten to twelve that morning I can easily do it You can ask Doc Mason at the hardware shop Sam Ross at the tavern and Dick Stout at the stables besides a dozen others Why I was even talking to mister Anderson the minister He is thinking of buying a horse from me That detective ain t going to prove anything broke in one of the men That s right came from another He has got to take his medicine as a spy Of course said Matlock Styles I only wanted to satisfy his curiosity Maybe he ll die feeling easier now His cold blooded way of speaking made a chill run down Adam Adams backbone He was beginning to see the Englishman in a new light The man was a master of deception not as clumsy in thought and action as he assumed to be And he was as heartless as a stone Would you murder me asked the detective It is the rule of our order that no man who acts the spy on us shall get away to tell of what he has discovered How did you get away after I put you in that other room in the dark It was an easy trick Won t you explain I might but it would hinder my getting away in the present instance You ll not get away again never fear Perhaps he didn t come alone exclaimed one of the other men He may have others with him and they may have helped him to escape in the first place He was alone when he came to the farm answered the Englishman And then he added Bind him and Number Three and Number Four shall remain on guard to watch him Where shall we take him questioned Number Four Take him to the last chamber But blindfold him first He has seen enough already In a moment Adam Adams was seized and bound in such a fashion that he could scarcely move a hand or a foot Then a bag was placed over his head with the eye holes to the back so that he could see absolutely nothing He was led away through a door opposite to the one he had entered and along a stone passageway When the party came to a halt they were in a stone chamber not over twelve feet square Here the detective was tied fast to a ring in the wall and the two men sat down on a bench to guard him lighting pipes and smoking in the meanwhile Are you going to keep me blindfolded asked the detective We are was the surly response For how long Until we get orders to do otherwise Matlock Styles is your master is he He is our chief But you needn t to ask any questions about him I don t intend to but if you ll take this off my head I ll tell you something worth knowing went on Adam Adams smoothly Is this a game growled the fellow known as Number Three Because if it is I warn you it won t work We ve got pistols and we can shoot How can I play any game on you tied up in this fashion No I want to see a little and get more air and I want to get square on Matlock Styles The two guards consulted together and finally came to the conclusion to remove the head covering The men had a lantern with them and one glance around showed the detective to what a stronghold he had been brought Now what have you got to say about Matlock asked one of the men You say he is your chief Have you any idea as to whether he is treating you fairly Why do you ask that Well perhaps it is nothing to me but if I was taking the risks you take I d want all that was coming to me We get our share How do you know I once exposed a gang of counterfeiters in Maine and I found that the chief Bill Davidson was getting the lion share of the returns More than that when the exposure came Davidson tried his best to get out of it by turning State s evidence And did he get out asked one of the men becoming interested No he did not I would not allow it I got two of the other men to tell the truth and Davidson got twenty years And what of the other men One got scared and ran away and the authorities let him slide The other man was not prosecuted The rest of the gang four of them got from five to twelve years each Are you a government detective Not exactly although I occasionally work for the government Here is another thing I want you two fellows to know The government has been hot footed after your counterfeits ever since they were first marketed Humph they ain t found out much You are mistaken they have found out a great deal I am only at one end of this game and I must say I have put my foot into it bad That s right commented Number Three He was a small built man and evidently of a vicious temper I am sorry in more ways than one continued the detective not appearing to notice the interruption I d like to get out of this mess and get ahead of the other fellows working on this case It would mean great credit to me and a big reward besides The gang is bound to be rounded up very soon now and when one or two are caught they ll tell on the others If I could get somebody to help me out of this scrape and put me next to the whole game I d pay him well and see that he got out with a whole skin in the bargain Look here you can t bribe me so don t try it growled Number Three I m in this game to a finish see I never got caught yet and I don t intend to begin now All counterfeiters get caught sooner or later Adam Adams directed his words especially to Number Four a big boned young man who was plainly nervous The fellow fumbled with his pipe but made no reply I always help the man who helps me went on the detective And I am so well known in my profession that my word counts for a great deal I can save a man if he will only put his trust in me I have done it many a time Ah I don t want to hear your fairy stories growled Number Three but Number Four merely shrugged his shoulders knocked his pipe clean and restored the article to his pocket The detective continued to talk in a low and earnest manner He was really pleading for his life for he realized that it was not Matlock Styles intention to let him escape again As soon as the counterfeiters were sure the coast was clear outside they would turn again to the prisoner and settle his fate Thus an hour passed and then came a low whistle A minute later Matlock Styles entered the stone chamber We ll get to business again he said shortly We have no time to spare What are you going to do next asked Number Four and Adam Adams thought he detected a tremor in the tones We are going to draw lots as to who is to dispose of the prisoner How is he to be killed asked Number Three That can be decided by the man who draws the red ball was the Englishman s cold blooded response CHAPTER XXV IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY If I can t get away now I am doomed It was Adam Adams who uttered the words in a low but firm voice He sat on a small bench in the stone chamber His feet were bound with a rope and his hands were chained to a ring in the wall behind him The counterfeiters had started to draw lots to see who should be the one to do the detective to death Then had come an interruption in the shape of an important message and the detective had been bundled off by himself while the communication was under discussion Adam Adams knew that his situation was a desperate one The counterfeiters were a gang who would stop at nothing to keep their secrets The only one who appeared to be at all timid was the fellow known as Number Four Possibly if he could get this fellow alone and work on his feelings Number Four might aid him But just now such a course seemed out of the question The detective listened attentively but only a faint murmur of voices reached his ears The counterfeiters were having an animated discussion over something but they were on their guard so that not even their prisoner might hear Wonder why they are so careful mused the detective grimly If they are going to take my life I don t see what difference it will make whether I know their secrets or not Adam Adams was not the man to give in easily Upon every case where his services were called for he usually kept at it until every possibility was exhausted He did not give in now yet it must be confessed being but human his heart was somewhat heavy I ll have to take chances he told himself Anything is better than to let them kill me in cold blood He waited for a few minutes to find out if anybody was coming to watch him One of the counterfeiters came in looked him over in silence and then passed out again this time closing the door more tightly than before As soon as the fellow had departed Adam Adams commenced to work on his bonds He had studied all sorts of handcuffs and knew well how to manage his hands and wrists when being fastened He had not been able to get the better of the fellow at the cottage but now it was different and with a twist of his wrists he withdrew first one hand and then the other With his hands free it was an easy matter to untie his feet This done he arose and tiptoed his way to the door He opened the barrier with caution and peered out The sight that met his gaze was not a reassuring one The counterfeiters sat on all sides of the room and each had a pistol where it could be gotten at with ease It s got to be done Matlock Styles was saying It should have been done long ago All right I ll do it grumbled another member of the band But I ll be running a big risk Not half the bloomin risk I ve been running grumbled the Englishman What about the word from Buffalo asked another We ll settle that to night after we have settled about our prisoner I ve got to get back to New York How soon Just as soon as possible Do you want to take the letter along Yes I gave my word I d bring the letter All right then we ll have to write the letter and each man sign it said Matlock Styles But I must say I don t like this way of doing things No more do I growled another of the band It s putting a fellow s head under the axe came from Number Four Oh don t get scared came from another I know Luffer he s O K Everybody is O K until he gets in a tight corner and squeals grumbled Number Four Kicking again eh roared Matlock Styles glaring sourly at Number Four Oh no I ll do as the others say answered the big boned young man but with a slight tremble in his voice Then all of the counterfeiters gathered around a table to dictate and sign a certain letter some outside party had demanded Adam Adams did not stop to listen to all of this conversation He felt that if he was to get away he must lose no time in making the attempt For a moment he thought to rush past the counterfeiters and try to gain the regular entrance to the den but then he realized the foolishness of such an attempt Before he got a dozen steps they would fire at him and most likely kill him He closed the door gently and seeing a small stick of wood on the floor stuck this under the barrier and shoved it as tight as possible Then he took up the bench and braced this under the handle of the door so that to shove the door inwards would be all but impossible Now then to see if there is some other way out he mused A lantern hanging on a nail lit up the stone chamber Taking the light in hand he commenced a rapid but thorough investigation of his prison The walls were practically solid the only break being at the door and on the opposite side where there had once been another door This second doorway had been bricked up to within six inches of the top which had been left open probably for ventilation Standing on tiptoes Adam Adams held up the lantern and looked through the ventilating space Some cool air coming in told him that the passageway beyond must lead to the outer world If that opening was only a bit larger a fellow might crawl through was what he told himself He set the lantern down and felt of the wall putting his arm through the opening It was about a foot thick and the bricks were well laid in good cement Not much show there he reasoned grimly If a fellow had time it could be done But it would take hours with only a pocketknife and they d be sure to hear the noise I must see if there isn t some other way He listened at the door for a moment The counterfeiters were still at work over the letter and another angry discussion was in full sway Then he held up the lantern looking at the flooring over his head The planks were heavy but old and several of them looked to be pretty well rotted Picking up a stick that was handy he poked at one plank after another It was not long before he came to one that was so far decayed that the end of the stick went through it with ease There was nothing to stand upon but the bench and so he took it away from the door and placed it directly under the decayed plank Then he stood up and pushed on the plank with both hands It gave way sending down a shower of dust and mold in his face and almost blinding him He had made considerable noise but angry words between the men in the other chamber drowned out the sounds Catching up the lantern once more he lifted it through the opening over his head and tried to look around He could see but little excepting boxes and barrels some as decayed as was the floor Evidently the apartment above had once been a store room but had not been used for years Adam Adams did not speculate long over what to do next He felt that the farther he got from the counterfeiters the better off he would be Setting the lantern on the floor above he took a firm hold on a plank that looked fairly strong and drew himself up It was a tight squeeze but he had been through many tight squeezes before so did not mind it Once in the storeroom his next move was to place what was left of the broken plank into position and on it he piled several empty boxes and barrels That may keep them guessing as to how I got out of the room below he thought They ll find out sooner or later but the later the better Lantern in hand he moved cautiously around the old storeroom There were many empty boxes and barrels and also sacks that contained musty flour Rats were in evidence and they scurried hither and thither as the detective moved around It was not long before he discovered two doors One was nailed up and where it led to he could not surmise The other stood partly open and through it came a whiff of fresh air That smells like liberty he thought as he breathed in the fresh air He looked down a passageway with a flooring partly of brick and partly of stone Where it led to there was no telling Feeling that it would be unwise to use the light longer he put it out But he kept the lantern in his hand for possible use in the future either to show the way or as a weapon The passageway made several turns and in the darkness he had to feel his way along Then he reached a flight of stone steps leading downward I don t want to go down I want to go up he reasoned But there seemed no help for it and down he went sixteen steps to land in a small room at the bottom Here all was pitch dark and for the moment he stood still not knowing in what direction to move next All around him were stone walls Presently he felt a small iron door He took bold of the handle and found the door locked Curious to learn his whereabouts he felt for a match struck it and lit the lantern once more A brief glance at the door caused a look of wonder to overspread his face The door was locked with a combination lock similar in make up to the lock on a safe He gazed around and soon learned that there was no exit from where he was save by the flight of stone steps To get out he would have to go back He gazed again at the small iron door set in an iron frame embedded in the stone wall What could be behind that barrier Most likely something of great value On the floor at his feet was a bit of dirty white paper Mechanically he picked it up and looked it over On it was the following O four L two twelve R three fifty three L two forty four The combination he murmured Somebody had it on that paper and dropped it Shall I try to work it or try to get out His better judgment told him he should try to make his escape But he was curious to know what was behind that iron door and setting the lantern down he commenced to work the combination knob He twirled the knob around four times and stopped at O Then he began on the combination proper twice to the left stopping at twelve three times to the right stopping at fifty three and then twice to the left again stopping at forty four Then he came around slowly to O again There followed a click The combination was off He twisted the handle of the iron door and pulled upon it It came open noiselessly revealing a stone chamber beyond eight feet square and equally high Lantern in hand Adam Adams stepped into the vault and gazed around eagerly On two sides were wooden shelves six in number On the shelves rested several boxes of wood and of metal He opened one of the boxes and gazed at the contents with interest It contained a quantity of haired paper almost an exact duplicate of the haired paper used in the making of banknotes He looked at another box This also contained paper The third box held a quantity of counterfeits the amount of which made even the matter of fact detective gasp If they ever floated these they would be the richest gang of counterfeiters in the world was his mental comment He had no idea of the exact amount but saw that it would total up to a tremendous sum He turned to one of the metal boxes It was empty and he set it down again Then he took up another box that was fairly heavy and threw open the cover There resting on some thick blotting paper was a counterfeit plate a plate undoubtedly used for printing the backs of the spurious one hundred dollars bills Adam Adams could not help but gaze at that plate with interest How the Secret Service men had worked to bring that plate to light and arrest the users And here he in following up the clues of one crime had stumbled upon the broad trail of another As he put the plate down a noise reached his ears By instinct he blew out the lantern and listened The noise was that from footsteps at a distance Then he heard a murmur of voices quickly growing louder They have discovered my escape he told himself And then he blamed himself for not having made better use of his time in an endeavor to get away He stepped out of the vault and listened with strained ears The counterfeiters had separated and were searching in all directions for him If they come this way I ll have to fight he reasoned I might as well die that way as to be killed in cold blood But then a sudden idea came to him and as quickly as he had left the vault he returned to it Footsteps were coming closer and he had no time to spare One of the shelves of the vault was close to the top and very broad Up on this climbed the detective and laid out at full length as close to the wall as possible In front of him he held two of the wooden boxes containing the haired paper Somebody came closer and he heard talking in the passageway at the foot of the stone steps A hand was placed on the door of the vault Who left this unlocked came in Matlock Styles voice Is it unlocked asked another of the band Yes That is strange It was locked yesterday I am sure of it Maybe that bloody rascal got here growled the Englishman How could he work the combination Oh some of those chaps are keener than you think Wait hold up the light Matlock Styles opened the door and gazed into the vault For the moment he saw nothing Not here he said briefly Come on we ll have to look elsewhere CHAPTER XXVI DOOMED TO DIE Wait a minute came from the other man as Matlock Styles was on the point of coming out of the vault What do you want I want to get some of that new paper Oh you can get there after we have caught our man I ll take it now it won t take a minute The man pushed his way into the vault He took hold of a box Then he suddenly backed away He s in there he gasped In there Where There on the shelf Look out Ha So he is ejaculated Matlock Styles He too leaped back I ve got him too the skunk Both of the counterfeiters leaped into the passageway Adam Adams came down from the shelf But the movement was not swift enough As he leaped towards the iron door it was banged shut in his face Then the combination knob was twirled around Ha ha That s the time we caught you like a rat in a trap sang out the Englishman in triumph Sure it was our man queried his companion I didn t get a very good look Yes it was our man the bloody villain He s a slick one So he is but he ll not get away again Go and tell the others that it is all right that we have him went on Matlock Styles You are sure he can t get out of there Not in a hundred years He d have to blast his way out to do it Then it s all right returned the other man and walked away up the flight of stone steps Now then you have come to the end of your rope you bloomin bloody rascal cried Matlock Styles when he was left alone in front of the vault You ll not get out of there until I open the door Styles supposing we talk this matter over suggested Adam Adams as calmly as he could Talk it over What do you mean Let me out and I ll explain I ll not let you out It won t do you any good to keep me in here I know better Don t think that I am alone on this case for I am not If you harm me you ll take the consequences Bah You can t scare me I m not a baby If you weren t alone some of your chums would be after you long ago You thought to run me and my gang down single handed and have your praises sung in every bloomin newspaper of the country I know your kind But I ve got you now like a rat in a trap And you ll get out like the rat does after he s dead You won t talk then No at least not now Perhaps I ll talk later But I ll not give you your liberty and thus speaking Matlock Styles tried the door of the vault to make certain that it was secure and walked away It must be confessed that Adam Adams felt that he was in a dangerous situation a situation in which the majority of men would have given up utterly He still had his lantern and this he lit once more and by its rays examined every foot of the vault in which he was a prisoner He saw little that gave him encouragement The sides and flooring were of stone and brick well put together and strong The ceiling was likewise of brick resting on arches of iron Looks as If I was booked to stay here he muttered grimly as he viewed the situation No getting out as I got out of that other hole He noticed that the air was not good and this soon gave him cause for additional alarm If he could not get any fresh air he might smother before anybody came to release him Once more he went over the walls and the flooring and even pounded on the iron door It was all to no purpose He was as close a prisoner as if encased in a stone tomb Perhaps they will leave me here until I either smother or starve to death he reasoned It would be an easy way of disposing of me And Miss Langmore and mister Case would wonder how I came to disappear so mysteriously He set the boxes on the floor and standing on one of them proceeded to examine the roofing of the vault more carefully He found one of the iron arches a bit loose at one end and pulled upon it with all his might The result was greater than he had anticipated The iron brace came down and with it fell several dozens of brick some hitting the detective on the legs and feet He shrank back against the shelves and so avoided getting the shower on his head The lantern was smashed leaving him in total darkness As soon as the fall was over he pulled the boxes from beneath the bricks and piled them one on top of the other Mounting as high as he could he felt around secured a hold on some bricks and stones above and hauled himself upward Now to get out somehow he told himself No more lingering in this den of criminals He felt around as he moved forward On all sides the walls were wet and slimy He advanced with care resolved to avoid all pitfalls were it possible to do so He was in a place where the roofing was no higher than his shoulders so he had to stoop as he progressed A moment later he found himself in a narrow passageway with rocks on one side and a heavy wooden partition on the other Through a slit in the partition a faint light was streaming Adam Adams tiptoed his way to the slit and looked through Beyond he made out the printing room of the counterfeiting plant Only one man was present the big boned fellow known as Number Four He was seated on the corner of a rude table idly tearing some paper into strips and evidently thinking deeply As the detective was about to move on another person entered the printing room Did they get him asked Number Four eagerly Yes was the short reply Where was he You d never guess At the river No in the vault What How did he get there Nobody knows He must have found the door open But it s against the rules for anybody to leave that door unlocked I know that said Number Four and heaved a deep sigh Say you don t like your job do you went on the other counterfeiter with a sniff Would you like it demanded Number Four half angrily Well not particularly When I joined this gang I did it to make money both ways I didn t join to kill folks Sure that s true But the fellow deserves what he ll get He is a spy and when a fellow spies on the likes of us he takes his life in his hands and he knows it Well that may be so Just the same I m sorry I drew the red ball went on Number Four Ain t going to back out are you Humph How can I back out Styles wouldn t allow it You bet he wouldn t and none of us would for that matter If I had drawn the red ball I would have done what was asked of me and no shirking and you ve got to do the same I ain t shirking growled Number Four I ll do my duty But I don t like the job and then he arose and left the room Adam Adams had moved on too down the dark passageway Soon he came to a place so narrow that he squeezed through with difficulty Here he stepped into a nest of rats and one bit him in the ankle causing him to give an involuntary cry of pain The rats were all around and he had to hiss quite loudly to make them keep their distance He could now smell the water and knew he must be close to the river Once in the stream he felt that he could swim to safety But he must look our for more traps Another turn and he found the water flowing at his feet Far ahead was a faint glimmer of light He entered the water and pushed forward Then of a sudden he came to a halt He had heard the sound of somebody rowing The small boat passed and all became silent once more Again he pushed on and presently reached a spot at the edge of the old mill He was under a dock Close at hand rested a rowboat with the oars across the seats The boat for mine if I can get into it without being seen the detective told himself With added caution he waded around to the stern of the rowboat and peered around carefully Not a soul seemed to be in sight and with care he climbed over the stern of the craft Stop came a cry Here he is He turned and leaped to the oars As he did this something whizzed through the air It struck him on the head and over he went across the seats of the boat He clutched wildly at the air and then his senses forsook him Who is it came another call That rascal who escaped It can t be he is in the vault Come see for yourself Quick Three men came rushing to the spot and the rowboat was hauled close to the dock The counterfeiters pounced upon Adam Adams and by the time he had recovered his senses he was again a close prisoner Then Matlock Styles appeared He is a wizard ejaculated the Englishman But he shall not get away again I ll guard him myself until Number Four finishes him CHAPTER XXVII TOM OSTRELLO S STORY On the following evening at exactly seven o clock an old man came to the depot at Sidham and met the incoming train He was rather feeble in his movements and hobbled rather than walked to meet a man who came in with a portfolio under his arm Excuse me but is this mister Granby he asked in a quavering voice That s my name said the new arrival with a slight start How are the sketches getting along I hope you are making a good picture of my daughter Very good I think sir If you will come to my room I will show you my proof All right sir answered the old man The two men left the depot and crossing the roadway walked to a hotel on the next block They ascended to the third floor and made their way to a fine apartment in the front Here the door was locked the curtains drawn and the gas was lit Then both men removed wigs and false whiskers and there stood revealed Charles Vapp and Adam Adams You are on time I see said the latter as he dropped into an easy chair and lit a cigar Yes I was lucky enough to get your telegram directly after it came in The trail took me near the office and Frank passed it to me What of the man you have been following He is looking for you Do you know the reason Yes He has had several talks with Letty Bernard and she has advised him to speak to you and tell you everything whatever that may mean The girl told him that you could clear him Humph She takes a good deal for granted Anything else Do you know that Margaret Langmore has disappeared So I heard less than an hour ago They say she ran away to escape trial Perhaps so but if she did she was out of her head It is too bad for it complicates matters By your telegram I see that you want me to turn to something else went on Charles Vapp after a pause I do Adam Adams drew a long breath Charley wonderful things can happen in twenty four hours I know that Adam Last night I was doomed to die I was in the hands of one of the worst band of evil doers I ever ran across They drew lots as to who should slay me just as the Anarchists draw lots to kill one who has been marked by them And you escaped If I hadn t I shouldn t be here It s a long story As luck would have it the foul deed fell to the lot of a fellow known as Number Four He was a weak kneed chap and I had previously spoken to him about getting caught and imprisoned and I said I would befriend anybody who would befriend me He was to shoot me tie my body in a bag with rocks and sink me to the bottom of the river He said he would do the job only when alone and the others took him at his word When he got me where he wanted me he told his story He used to be poor but honest and was once sent up for a theft that he had not committed The gang got hold of him when he came out of prison and he was made to join the band He said he did not want to kill anyone that he was sick of what he had been doing and wanted to reform I promised him a thousand dollars if he would let me go and promised not to testify against him if he would tell me all he knew He took me at my word and sank a sack full of grass and stones to the bottom of the river instead of yours truly Then he came away with me told me some astonishing things took his thousand dollars and I haven t seen him since and I doubt if he will ever show himself again You were more than lucky But what is this band if it is any of my business Adam Adams leaned forward Don t breathe it to a soul not even at headquarters he whispered I have located a band of counterfeiters the makers of that clever counterfeit bill on the Excelsior National Bank of New York You ve heard of it the one they said was printed from the Racksburg plates Sure the one Fields tried to run to earth last year The same That s a big feather in your cap In following up one thread I seem to have gotten away from another I started out to find the murderer of mister and missus Langmore I thought I had a line on one fellow but it would seem now that he can readily prove a complete alibi What do you want me to do I want you to keep your eyes on certain people in and around this town and especially on that Matlock Styles If you see any indications of his running away arrest him on the spot Here is a list of the men to be watched Adam Adams brought out a slip of paper Then he described the old mill The counterfeiters rendezvous is under that mill he continued They make folks think the place is haunted and Styles has savage dogs on his farm near by and that keeps the curious away I want you to watch the mill too if you can But keep out of all danger If any of the gang try to trap you shoot them down for if they catch you they won t be apt to let you get away alive If you wish get Strong to help you I understand and I ll be on my guard said the assistant After that the pair conversed for a quarter of an hour longer and then after making some changes in his disguise Charles Vapp hurried from the hotel and out into the darkness of what looked as if it would prove a stormy night As soon as Vapp had gone Adam Adams sat down and penned a brief note This he sent out by a hotel messenger and then sank back in his easy chair to smoke and to meditate The detective had learned much yet about certain things he was in the dark as much as ever The mysterious Number Four he had not asked the penitent for his name had given him the names and addresses of fourteen men connected with the band of counterfeiters Eleven of these individuals were makers of the bogus bank bills and the other three operated in the big cities disposing of the goods in bulk to others who in their turn fed the bad bills to the general public So far as Number Four knew Matlock Styles was the head of the gang but the man had said there was another individual to whom Styles often went for advice This man was considered to be very shrewd but what his name was there was no telling Number Four ventured a guess that he might be connected with the United States treasury department After his escape from the den Adam Adams had gone to Stony Hill in secret and there verified Matlock Styles story that the Englishman had not been near the Langmore mansion during the time the murders were committed So from that crime at least the counterfeiter was apparently cleared But this only made the mystery connected with the counterfeits in the safe so much deeper Number Four had never mentioned Barry Langmore when speaking of the members of the gang and when questioned about the man said he had known him by sight and that was all Less than an hour after he had sent out the messenger there came a knock on the door and Tom Ostrello presented himself You are the gentleman that wishes to see me he inquired I believe you wish to see me was the reply as the detective closed the door and locked it again Sit down mister Ostrello I am Adam Adams Oh I er I didn t quite recognize you in that dress I suppose not There was a brief pause mister Ostrello if you wish to speak to me I am at your disposal for the next hour Thank you The young commercial traveler cleared his throat You are I mean I believe you know the relationship between Miss Bernard and myself She has told me something about that She tells me you are her closest friend that you have really been a father to her since her own parent died And she tells me that you are one of the greatest detectives in the world I wish I had known that when we first met I should have engaged you to clear up the mystery of this sad affair The young man paused again Evidently it was hard work for him to get directly at the subject on hand Adam Adams remained silent I did not imagine that I well that I would be connected with this great crime I mean that anybody would suspect that I had done the deed It is a fearful thought That I would kill my own mother I know such things have been done but they must have been done by beasts not men I know I should have spoken of the visit that very morning to my mother Then you admit that you called at the house Yes You were dressed in a gray suit and wore a slouch hat and you entered by the back way How did you learn all that cried the young commercial traveler in astonishment Never mind In coming away you slipped and fell and your hat dropped off Tom Ostrello nodded I understand that somebody must have noticed me after all I came in by the back way because I missed the train for Sidham and took that which stops only at Chester It is a short cut through the woods from Chester Station to the Langmore place When I came away I had just time enough to catch another train at Chester and I was very anxious to get back to the city for I had an important engagement with one of my customers I understand Proceed please I came to the house for two reasons In the first place as perhaps you know my brother Dick is a spendthrift and works occasionally only He got into a scrape in Los Angeles and telegraphed me to help him out financially It was an old plea but I thought if I left him to himself my mother would not forgive me I did not have money enough to help him by myself for my capital was tied up in such a fashion that I could not get at it More than that I had in my possession two one hundred dollar bills which my mother had gotten from mister Langmore and both of these were counterfeits One of those bills you had tried to pass at a theatre eh Ha You know that too Then you have been following me up The United States Government has been trying to follow up those bills for several years I came to the house and saw my mother mister Langmore had gone to the bank There had been a family row but that was not all of the trouble mister Langmore was strangely excited so my mother said and had declared he was going to have somebody arrested before the week was out On account of the counterfeits Either that or on account of a patent She said he had sent off several letters and was also going to telegraph to somebody She said he had asked her to give back the hundred dollar bills and had been much disturbed when she told him that I had them She took the bills back and gave me good money for them and also gave me two hundred dollars more to forward to my brother Dick which I did adding a hundred of my own Did your mother tell you anything more about the counterfeits No Did you see Miss Langmore I did not nor did I see the servant I was in a hurry and so I came away as soon as my business was accomplished When you came away from the house and dropped your hat did you go back again crawling along by the bushes I certainly did not Did you see any other man around Not there I caught a glimpse of a man when I was hurrying through the woods to the station When you came to the house after the tragedy mister Ostrello what were you so anxious about You mean what was I looking for Yes A letter Dick had sent me It told about his trouble I thought at first it might be in the library but I found it in my mother s room It contained an account of the scandal he had gotten into I did not wish that scandal to become public property I can show you that letter if you wish to see it Lately you have had some trouble with a man named Matlock Styles What was that about It was over a patent I thought of an idea for a machine to box up pills in a new way and spoke to mister Langmore about it I left some papers with mister Langmore and I think Styles got hold of them and applied for the patent We had several disputes and at last he threatened to get me into trouble with the firm I represent He said he had influence and as I didn t want to lose my job I didn t press him about the patent He acts like a farmer but he is a shrewd fellow and not to be trusted You went back to the house lately on the sly told missus Morse you wanted some books I admit it I wanted to get some of my mother s private papers Now she is dead I wish to look out for any share of the estate that may be coming to my brother Dick and myself Isn t that natural It was foolish of me to run away as I did but well I was nervous This tragedy has completely unnerved me and I hardly know what I am doing How about this bit of wrapping paper and Adam Adams brought forth the piece he had found under mister Langmore s safe I do not know where that came from but it is evidently a part of some of my firm s advertising The first three lines are the name and address The last line reads Keep dark I found this under the library safe That is not to be wondered at Some time ago I remember I got some powders for mister Langmore for headaches I remember the box had a wrapper of that sort on it The powders lose their strength if exposed to the sunlight And that reminds me you you think these murders were committed through the agency of a Chinese powder yamlang peholo a powder my firm once introduced in this country The evidence points that way I know of nobody around that house who had any of the accursed stuff for it certainly was accursed I never took any there or at least if I ever did I do not remember taking it out of my grip Can you furnish me with a list of people who received this stuff from you or from others I can On my way to Sidham I made out this list and here it is and the young man brought it forth Adam Adams glanced at it quickly and read over the long line of names and addresses doctors druggists and private individuals Suddenly he paused and a smile of triumph lit up his features Good he almost shouted You have discovered something asked Tom Ostrello quickly Yes I have discovered a great deal I think the murder mystery is as good as solved CHAPTER XXVIII WHAT HAPPENED TO MARGARET It is said by specialists that the human brain can stand just so much and no more The tension becomes so great something snaps and then The question is one hard if not impossible to answer So it was with poor Margaret hounded by the well meaning but ignorant officers of the law of the community in which the double crime had been committed So searching had been the questions put so strong the accusations that the reasoning powers of the girl were completely shattered She imagined herself guilty imagined herself being taken to prison to be hung or electrocuted and in a hundred ways suffered the mental tortures of the eternally condemned Then came a change when she grew hysterical and laughed softly to herself No no she must not let them hang or electrocute her It would be too much of a disgrace She must escape such a fearful fate But how There could be but one answer to that question She must contrive in some way to outwit her enemies she must escape must fly to some place where they would never be able to find her It is said that those who are insane are usually shrewd and so it was in Margaret s case She prepared to run away but she did not allow the nurse or the doctor to become aware of what she was doing She waited until the doctor had made another call and then asked the nurse to fix her something special to eat Why yes I ll get whatever you wish my dear said the nurse and went below to prepare the food No sooner had the woman disappeared than Margaret leaped from her bed and began to dress All of her things even to her hat were in a closet of the bedroom so this was easy How shall I go she asked herself She knew from the talk she had heard that a policeman was somewhere around watching the house She looked out of a window and saw him leaning against a fence taking occasional sly puffs from a pipe he held in the hollow of his hand She did not dare descend the stairs She looked out of the window It was not very far to the roof of a porch and against the porch was a trellis with a wealth of honeysuckle growing upon it How she did it Margaret could not afterwards remember But she crawled forth from the window and climbed down the trellis as if it were a ladder The sweet scent of the honeysuckle made her sick and she came close to falling in a faint at the foot of the vines Reaching the ground she stared around like a frightened fawn seeking to hide from the hunters Then without knowing why she sped for the river bank The water looked cool and inviting and for several minutes the beautiful girl stood there gazing steadily down into those depths Should she make a leap and end it all It would be the easiest way out of it she moaned to herself The easiest way and nobody would care But as she bent lower she seemed to see reflected not her own face but the face of Raymond With a cry of despair she shrank back as if struck a blow No no It will not do she moaned Not that Not that She ran along the river bank until she came to where a rowboat was tied up On the seats were the oars and scarcely knowing what she was doing she leaped into the craft untied the painter and took up the oars The fresh air seemed to give her strength and she pulled on and on She grew thirsty and stopped to drink some of the water and to bathe her face and hands While doing this her hat slipped overboard and drifted away but she did not notice this Presently she took up the oars once more and rowed along the stream until she reached a spot where there was an island Here she went ashore hiding the rowboat in the bushes It was only a small island but in the center some boys had erected a hut where they had once camped out Margaret dragged herself to this shelter Her strength was almost gone now and as she dropped on a rude bench her senses forsook her She did not remain unconscious long but during that time she had a dream or vision She imagined that she was back home once more and that her father and her stepmother were alive and well and that the bitter quarrelling had come to an end She sat up and brushed the tumbled hair from her forehead It it must have been a dream she murmured It can t be true that daddy is dead I I must go home and find out She was surprised to find herself on the island but the sight of the rowboat brought with it a memory of how she had used the craft and once again she got in and rowed away This time she headed for the Langmore mansion and it was not long before she came within sight of the well known dock where her own tiny craft still rested She looked around Not a soul seemed to be in sight With a cunningness far out of the ordinary the poor girl crept along the shrubbery in the direction of the barn This structure was locked up From the barn she turned to the house and watching her chance she entered by the cellar way which chanced to be standing open It was dark and damp below stairs and the girl shivered as she stood there trying to make up her mind what to do next Should she go right up and try to find her father Supposing her stepmother was there would she try to make more trouble Margaret mounted the stairs and entered the lower hall of the house The blinds were closed and all was dark She moved towards the room where the body of her father had been found At that moment the woman who had been left at the mansion came from the kitchen She caught one glimpse of the girl and set up a shriek It s a ghost she cried A ghost Heaven help me The cry was so piercing and so genuine it roused Margaret from the stupor in which she was moving My father He is dead after all Oh daddy she screamed and then turned brushed past the woman and sped out of the back door of the mansion What s the matter came from the policeman who was on guard She a ghost stammered missus Morse I saw her Her Who Margaret Langmore Or else her ghost The woman had gone white and was shaking from head to feet Where Here When Just now It can t have been the girl She is in bed under the doctor s care But I saw her insisted the woman We ll take a look around answered the guardian of the law They commenced the search but long before this was done Margaret had run back to the river She dropped into the rowboat and rowed off as swiftly as her failing strength would permit Daddy is dead after all she moaned over and over again And she is dead too I remember it all now And the blood Oh I must get away or they will hang me or electrocute me Five minutes more and the rowboat came to grief on some rocks close to the side of the stream It commenced to fill with water and Margaret had to wade ashore which she did slowly and deliberately like one in a dream Then she passed into the woods Coming to a thick clump of bushes she sank down exhausted and there merciful sleep overtook her How long she slept she did not know The low growl of a dog aroused her She sat up and the growl of the dog became a heavy bark Looking from out of the clump of bushes she saw a mastiff standing there eying her suspiciously What is it boy she heard a heavy voice ask A woodchuck Never mind now come on But the mastiff continued to bark and came close enough to sniff at Margaret s foot She essayed to draw back but was too weak to do so Won t come eh cried the man What s the bloomin reason I d like to know He came closer and then caught sight of Margaret For a second he stared in amazement then uttered an exclamation You How did you get here Oh she fairly screamed She recognized Matlock Styles and knew not what to say For some reason she felt as does the bird in the net of the fowler This is bloomin strange went on the Englishman I thought you were down in the village under the care of the doctors I was she managed to falter How did you get here run away Yes Why I I do not know I they have found me out They are going to hang me or electrocute me I I couldn t stand it How do you know that Oh I know only too well So you ran away did you Twas a bloody cute thing to do Margaret Say your dress is wet he went on wonderingly Yes I was in a rowboat and had to wade ashore She looked at him with a face full of wild misery Oh please go away and leave me Leave you Yes yes I can t do that Margaret You must But you are not fit to be left alone You re sick Never mind only leave me Better let me take care of you And now having stopped the barking of the mastiff he came and sat down by her side No no She tried to shrink away but was too weak to succeed So you ran away eh Are they after you I don t know I I suppose so How did you get out of the house I climbed out of a window when the nurse and the policeman were not looking Bloomin clever that he murmured His eyes were watching her closely and to himself he was saying Gad what a beauty she is in spite of what she has suffered I am going away far away she went on in a low voice Oh I cannot cannot stay here You can t travel in your condition Margaret He pulled thoughtfully at his mutton chop whiskers You let me help you You Yes Come give me your arm and he caught hold of her as if to assist her to arise No no Please leave me she begged I can take care of myself Only give me the chance to get away Margaret You are out of your mind No I am not I know better And I am not going to let you go away You shall go with me Oh mister Styles Please go away No he answered firmly Come you have got to go

6544_71420_000009_000000	train-clean-360	A GLASS OF POISON
6544_71420_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Margaret could do nothing but stare at the man before her 
none	none	He was heavy set and powerful and wont to having his own way
6544_71420_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Styles she began but he put his hand over her mouth 
6544_71420_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 You are sick out of your head he interrupted 
6544_71420_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 I know what is best and you must do as I say 
6544_71420_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Come on And he pulled her forward by the hand 
6544_71420_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Where to 
none	none	Not very far
6544_71420_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 I I do not wish to go to your home 
6544_71420_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll not take you there don t fear 
6544_71420_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 You are going to hand me over to the the authorities 
none	none	Never Come 
6544_71420_000018_000002	train-clean-360	I won t hurt you 
6544_71420_000019_000000	train-clean-360	He led the way through the woods across a small stream and past a spot where some wild berries grew 
6544_71420_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Then they struck a trail leading up a hillside 
6544_71420_000019_000002	train-clean-360	The place was new to her 
6544_71420_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 I want to know where you are taking me she said presently and came to a halt 
6544_71420_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 To a place where you will be safe 
6544_71420_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 That isn t answering the question 
none	none	We ll be there in a few minutes and then you can see for yourself Margaret 
6544_71420_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Cannot you trust me girl 
6544_71420_000023_000002	train-clean-360	I m not going to hurt you 
6544_71420_000023_000003	train-clean-360	I love you and I ll do all I can to help you 
6544_71420_000023_000004	train-clean-360	Come And again he made her move on 
6544_71420_000024_000000	train-clean-360	At last they came in sight of a tumbled down cottage on the edge of what had once been a clearing but which was now overgrown with weeds and brushwood 
6544_71420_000024_000001	train-clean-360	As they came up Margaret s strength gave out and suddenly she sank down on her knees 
6544_71420_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 All in are you he said not unkindly and stooping he picked her up bodily 
6544_71420_000025_000001	train-clean-360	She tried to resist but could not and he took her into the cottage and placed her on a couch 
6544_71420_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll get you a nurse he said noting her extreme paleness 
6544_71420_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 You need one 
none	none	A a woman Yes
6544_71420_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you she murmured and then closed her eyes for she was too far gone to say more or to make a move 
none	none	He was as good as his word and when she roused up once more an old woman was at Margaret s side 
6544_71420_000030_000001	train-clean-360	She had administered some sort of drug what the girl did not know and it had put her into a sound sleep 
6544_71420_000031_000000	train-clean-360	When Margaret looked around again she was surprised to see that it was morning 
6544_71420_000031_000001	train-clean-360	She tried to think but her mind was almost a blank 
6544_71420_000031_000002	train-clean-360	Outside of the broken window a wild bird was singing gayly 
6544_71420_000031_000003	train-clean-360	She looked around The old woman was not in sight 
6544_71420_000032_000000	train-clean-360	She had been put to bed and sat there trying to think for several minutes 
6544_71420_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Then she gave a low call and the old woman appeared in the doorway 
none	none	Come awake have ye miss said she
6544_71420_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Where am I asked Margaret feebly 
6544_71420_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 You re safe enough never fear 
6544_71420_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Margaret said no more and the woman went about some little work Presently the girl arose and dressed herself 
6544_71420_000036_000001	train-clean-360	She felt much stronger than when at the home of Martha Sampson in spite of what she had experienced in running away 
6544_71420_000036_000002	train-clean-360	She sank down in a rocking chair to think matters over 
6544_71420_000037_000000	train-clean-360	How far was she from Sidham 
6544_71420_000037_000001	train-clean-360	She knew she must have come a long distance but could not tell if it was five miles or fifty 
6544_71420_000037_000002	train-clean-360	She looked out of the window but the scenery was strange to her 
6544_71420_000038_000000	train-clean-360	As she sat there she reviewed what had passed her mind becoming clearer as she thought 
6544_71420_000038_000001	train-clean-360	She remembered the scene at the inquest and remembered how she had fainted and how Raymond had supported her and taken her to the nurse s house 
none	none	Then she remembered how the coroner s jury had accused her of the terrible crime and she gave a deep shudder
6544_71420_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Poor dear father she murmured 
6544_71420_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 Who could have been so wicked as to take your life 
6544_71420_000040_000000	train-clean-360	An hour went by and she prepared to leave the cottage when a shadow fell across the window and Matlock Styles appeared 
6544_71420_000040_000001	train-clean-360	He spoke a few low words to the old woman and the latter walked away 
6544_71420_000041_000000	train-clean-360	As the man entered the room Margaret arose and faced him 
6544_71420_000041_000001	train-clean-360	The Englishman was well dressed and newly shaven and wore a rosebud in his buttonhole 
none	none	Evidently he had spent some time over his toilet in honor of the occasion
6544_71420_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 I m glad to see you up and looking so well he said pleasantly 
6544_71420_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 I was afraid your running away would hurt you 
6544_71420_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 I I must thank you for what you have done for me mister Styles she answered 
6544_71420_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh that s all right Miss Margaret 
none	none	I d do as much for you any day I think it s a bloomin shame the way you have been treated
6544_71420_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I suppose it cannot be helped 
6544_71420_000045_000001	train-clean-360	But I must be getting back soon You will show me the road 
6544_71420_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t be in a hurry to go 
6544_71420_000046_000001	train-clean-360	You re not strong enough to go Besides the Englishman paused impressively 
6544_71420_000046_000002	train-clean-360	 What s the use of going back 
6544_71420_000046_000003	train-clean-360	Don t you know things look beastly black for you 
6544_71420_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps but I am not afraid now 
6544_71420_000047_000001	train-clean-360	I am not guilty mister Styles 
none	none	Of course not Of course not 
6544_71420_000048_000002	train-clean-360	I knew that from the start 
6544_71420_000048_000003	train-clean-360	But things do look black no use of talking 
6544_71420_000048_000004	train-clean-360	I want to help you He came closer at which she retreated a step 
6544_71420_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you but I do not see what you can do 
6544_71420_000049_000001	train-clean-360	I must go back and give myself up 
6544_71420_000049_000002	train-clean-360	I I was not myself when I ran away 
6544_71420_000049_000003	train-clean-360	It was a very foolish thing to do 
6544_71420_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 If you go back do you know what they will do 
6544_71420_000050_000001	train-clean-360	They will surely hang you 
6544_71420_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh merciful Heaven 
6544_71420_000051_000001	train-clean-360	Do not say that 
6544_71420_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 I wouldn t if it wasn t so 
6544_71420_000052_000001	train-clean-360	But I ve been talking to the coroner and the chief of police and they have all of the evidence as straight as a string 
none	none	I am innocent
6544_71420_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 I feel that you are and that is why I side with you 
6544_71420_000054_000001	train-clean-360	Besides you know my feeling for you 
6544_71420_000054_000002	train-clean-360	I ve loved you for a long time I told you so before He took hold of her arm 
6544_71420_000054_000003	train-clean-360	 If you ll do what I wish I ll see to it that you escape that you are never bothered any more 
6544_71420_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 How can you do that 
6544_71420_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Never mind how it can be done 
6544_71420_000056_000001	train-clean-360	Promise to give up Case and be my wife and I will attend to all of the rest 
6544_71420_000056_000002	train-clean-360	And I ll promise you more than that 
6544_71420_000056_000003	train-clean-360	Listen do you know that I am immensely wealthy 
6544_71420_000056_000004	train-clean-360	It is so and I can easily prove it 
6544_71420_000056_000005	train-clean-360	Look here He drew a big roll of bank bills from his pocket each bill of a large denomination 
6544_71420_000056_000006	train-clean-360	 I have ten thousand dollars here 
6544_71420_000056_000007	train-clean-360	It shall be yours for the taking if you will marry me 
6544_71420_000056_000008	train-clean-360	I can easily raise five times this amount in forty eight hours 
6544_71420_000056_000009	train-clean-360	We can go to Europe or Australia or anywhere we wish 
6544_71420_000056_000010	train-clean-360	Isn t that far better than to stay here to be hung by a lot of country bumpkins who don t understand the matter at all 
6544_71420_000057_000000	train-clean-360	She put up her hands and waved him away 
6544_71420_000057_000001	train-clean-360	Then she burst into tears 
6544_71420_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t speak so please don t 
6544_71420_000058_000001	train-clean-360	I I cannot bear it I have gone through so much already 
none	none	Won t you listen to reason Matlock Styles face darkened
6544_71420_000059_000001	train-clean-360	 I am giving you everything I have my wealth my honor everything 
6544_71420_000059_000002	train-clean-360	Can a man do more than that 
6544_71420_000059_000003	train-clean-360	I love you love you more than Raymond Case ever did or will 
6544_71420_000060_000000	train-clean-360	She wrung her hands and his dark eyes seemed to pierce her very soul She felt faint and sank on a bench 
6544_71420_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Come will you accept Margaret 
none	none	No no I cannot
6544_71420_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 But think of what is before you 
6544_71420_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 If I tried to escape they would soon be on my track 
6544_71420_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 No I can prevent that 
none	none	How
6544_71420_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Because the world will know that you are innocent 
6544_71420_000068_000000	train-clean-360	She gave a start and looked at him wildly pleadingly 
6544_71420_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Then you know the real murderer she panted 
6544_71420_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 If I answer that question will you become my wife 
6544_71420_000071_000000	train-clean-360	Again she shrank back 
6544_71420_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 You know the murderer she repeated 
6544_71420_000072_000001	train-clean-360	 Perhaps you committed the foul deeds yourself 
6544_71420_000073_000000	train-clean-360	He took a step back as if struck a blow 
6544_71420_000073_000001	train-clean-360	Then he recovered quickly and smiled a bitter smile 
6544_71420_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 No I was not near the place I can prove it 
6544_71420_000074_000001	train-clean-360	Besides your folks and myself were on good terms 
6544_71420_000074_000002	train-clean-360	There is somebody else who was around the house when the affair happened somebody you know well a person who would know all about the drug with which your father and missus Langmore were killed 
6544_71420_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 Who was it 
6544_71420_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 Will you consent to marry me 
6544_71420_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 Tell me first 
6544_71420_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 No afterwards 
6544_71420_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 You are fooling me 
6544_71420_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 I swear I am not Margaret 
6544_71420_000080_000001	train-clean-360	Marry me and I will clear you as surely as the sun is shining 
6544_71420_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 And if I refuse 
6544_71420_000082_000000	train-clean-360	He came and caught her by the arm his face blazing with sudden passion 
6544_71420_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 Do not dare to do that 
6544_71420_000083_000001	train-clean-360	Don t you understand the matter 
6544_71420_000083_000002	train-clean-360	You are in my power in my power absolutely 
6544_71420_000083_000003	train-clean-360	I can hand you over to the police whenever I will 
6544_71420_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 That will not be such a hardship 
6544_71420_000084_000001	train-clean-360	I said I was going back 
none	none	Bah 
6544_71420_000085_000001	train-clean-360	If I tell them that I caught you that you begged me to let you get away that you even said you would marry me if I would aid you what then 
6544_71420_000085_000002	train-clean-360	Everybody will think you guilty and Raymond Case will never come near you again 
6544_71420_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 You you monster 
6544_71420_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps I am a monster when aroused 
none	none	You had better think this matter over
6544_71420_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 I do not want to think it over 
6544_71420_000088_000001	train-clean-360	My mind is made up 
none	none	I shall never marry you never no matter what happens 
6544_71420_000088_000003	train-clean-360	I loathe and despise you 
6544_71420_000089_000000	train-clean-360	There was a moment of silence and his dark face turned a sickly white and then red 
6544_71420_000089_000001	train-clean-360	He breathed heavily through his set teeth 
none	none	You mean that he said finally his eyes shining like those of a serpent I do 
6544_71420_000092_000000	train-clean-360	He glared at her steadily 
6544_71420_000092_000001	train-clean-360	Then in a burst of rage he caught her by the throat and threw her backward to the floor 
6544_71420_000092_000002	train-clean-360	She offered no resistance and pausing in his madness he realized that she had swooned away 
6544_71420_000093_000000	train-clean-360	 Fainted he hissed between his set teeth 
6544_71420_000093_000001	train-clean-360	 I wish she was dead Curse her and her beauty 
6544_71420_000094_000000	train-clean-360	He waited and as she did not return to consciousness he picked her up and placed her on the bed 
6544_71420_000094_000001	train-clean-360	Then he hurried outside 
6544_71420_000095_000000	train-clean-360	 Go back to the house he said to the old woman 
6544_71420_000095_000001	train-clean-360	 You ll not be needed here any more 
6544_71420_000095_000002	train-clean-360	And see that you keep your jaw closed over this he added harshly 
6544_71420_000095_000003	train-clean-360	And the woman slunk away as if struck like a dog 
6544_71420_000096_000000	train-clean-360	Once inside of the cottage he took up a glass of water standing on the table and to this added a powder taken from his pocket stirring it up well 
6544_71420_000096_000001	train-clean-360	Then he looked around to see that there was no other water around the building 
6544_71420_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 When she rouses up she will be dry and she will drink this he muttered to himself 
6544_71420_000097_000001	train-clean-360	 Half a glass will do the work and she will never bother me or anybody else any more 
6544_71420_000098_000000	train-clean-360	He paused again and took from his pocket several sheets of paper closely and carelessly written upon in pencil 
6544_71420_000098_000001	train-clean-360	The first sheet was headed 
none	none	Dying Confession of Margaret Langmore
6544_71420_000100_000000	train-clean-360	 A fine forgery if I do say so myself he mused 
6544_71420_000100_000001	train-clean-360	 Mat you always were a plum with the pen 
6544_71420_000100_000002	train-clean-360	I ll add a line telling where she can be found and then send it to the coroner

6544_71420_000101_000001	train-clean-360	Then he took the glass and poured half the contents down her throat 
none	none	She spluttered but swallowed and he let her form drop back on the bed He was in a cold perspiration now and in sudden fear he fairly rushed out of the cottage and down the hillside in the direction of his home CHAPTER XXX RAISING THE CURTAIN As soon as his interview with Tom Ostrello was at an end Adam Adams asked the young man to leave him I am going to follow up this clew he said And the quicker the better He looked over a valise he carried and selected a number of things he wanted Midnight found him at the depot boarding a train for Fairfield At the latter place he changed and took another train for Bryport Arriving at that city he located at a hotel and went to bed He was up at sunrise and procured an early breakfast Then he returned to his room and spent a full hour in donning another outfit and in powdering his face and adjusting a wig and a reddish moustache The same car that had taken him to the vicinity of John Watkins residence before took him there again As he approached the house he saw the secret service man coming forth Excuse me mister Watkins but I must see you said he in a low and suggestive tone To see me questioned the man What about Well I must see you alone The sky may be rather red you know At the last words the secret service man started slightly That s true and I don t like a red sky he answered Come into the house You just caught me in time He led the way inside and up to his den closing and locking the door after him Now then what do you want to see me about he demanded sharply Don t you recognize me I must say I do not although your face seems familiar I am Number Four There was a pause and Adam Adams studied the face before him closely Well came from the secret service man coldly There has been trouble mister Watkins Matlock Styles sent me to you The dickens you say What right has he He had to do it Things are getting warm He should have come himself He couldn t do it The detectives are shadowing every movement he makes He didn t even dare to drop you a letter What s the cause of the trouble Those queers in the safe Then the authorities got them Yes and they ve sent down some New York detectives who are watching everybody Bah Styles must be getting nervous He told me to tell you something more They found something else It s about the poison powder that was used You made some kind of a mistake John Watkins leaped to his feet and turned pale I made a mistake he cried How For Heaven s sake man tell me all He went to a cupboard got out some brandy and drank a stiff portion That is what Styles wants to find out He thinks you put out some clews that point to him He says if you did he will blow you sky high He wants the truth from you and he wants it right away Clews Against him He is crazy I never put out a single clew against him Why should I Wasn t it arranged that we should fix it against the girl and didn t I even go to the trouble to spy on Langmore and get the combination of the safe although it didn t do any good And then after the job was done didn t I The secret service man came to an abrupt stop as if fearing he had said too much Look here did he tell you all this or is this some game Hey exclaimed Adam Adams pretending to be amazed Did he tell me See here I don t care if you are the boss I am not going to run the risk of being sent up for twenty years for you I came to help Styles out that s all I had the devil s own job getting out of Sidham without being followed To morrow I am going to take my money and move West You won t trust a fellow and yet you expect Never mind Pink don t get on your ear so quick Ain t I got a right to get on my ear You go and poison two people and then Who said I did the poisoning John Watkins was plainly agitated Didn t Styles tell all of us He wasn t going to have those clews pointing to him He says you bungled He is a calf roared John Watkins Where is the nerve he used to have So he told all of you that I did the job eh Well I ll square things with him for that He wouldn t care if you hadn t made some sort of a botch I A botch Say don t you believe what he tells you because it isn t true Well he says I don t care what he says I didn t do the job and I am not going to let him shift the responsibility on my shoulders He s a fool Don t everybody think the girl is guilty and if they clear her isn t there another string to the bow You mean Tom Ostrello That s it So he told you about that too came from the secret service man bitterly Well he isn t the man I thought he was I suppose he has gone and blabbed right and left Only to the band We knew something was on the carpet and we cornered him and then he had to speak Why one of the New York detectives found our place under the old mill and we had to do him to keep the thing a secret You got him out of the way Yes Did Styles do that job No We had to draw lots I ain t saying who drew the red ball Maybe you drew it yourself Maybe I did and maybe I didn t What I want to know is What are we to do The crowd don t like Styles much and I can tell you confidentially that for two pins we would throw him over that is if you will stand by us You want to elect a new leader Yes But with the understanding that the crowd is to be let in on the ground floor after this No more working in the dark Even yet we don t know why those murders were committed and yet it looks as if all of us might suffer unless you pull us through O K Didn t Styles tell you why No although he hinted at something Well I ll tell you Pink and you can tell the rest Barry Langmore had some dealings with Styles about patents and mortgages One day Styles drank a little too much and went to Langmore to pay a bill He had two packages of money with him each for several thousand dollars One package was good money and the other was our own brand Styles also had some loose bills with him He paid part of a mortgage and also something on an invention When he went away he saw that he had made a mistake and given Langmore the counterfeit bills He went back the next day but Langmore had gone away on a short vacation When he came back Styles went to him and they had a pretty stormy scene Langmore had tried to pass a bill and learned it was a counterfeit Styles pretended that he didn t know the money was bad but Langmore wouldn t believe him Some of the money had gone to missus Langmore too Styles begged to get the money back and offered Langmore his rights in an invention if only Langmore would keep quiet Langmore said he would think it over but I am inclined to think he communicated with the police instead although I have no proof Anyway we made up our minds that Langmore knew too much and so did his wife Then well they were found dead that s all And you say you didn t commit the deed I did not Then Styles must have done the job since there was no one else Didn t he tell you that he can prove an alibi That he was over to Stony Hill at the time the deed was done Yes but if that is true then you are guilty You got that poison from Henry Bloom and he told Tom Ostrello that he let you have it There is where you blundered Ostrello and others are on your track You can t escape unless you can prove an alibi too Again John Watkins shrank back as if struck a blow Who who told this who says he began hoarsely Matlock Styles Then he can go to perdition I ll not stand up for him a minute longer Yes I got the poison but I gave it to him I can prove it by the old woman who works for him if I have to wring her neck to make her speak She heard me tell him how to use it He trusts her because he has her where the hair is short She killed a child years ago when she ran a baby farm And then about that alibi The secret service man laughed bitterly So that s his game if it comes to a showing of hands Well I can put a spoke in his wheel He was at Stony Hill was he Well so was I I can prove that too There was a pause during which the secret service man took another drink of liquor He was plainly very nervous With great deliberation Adam Adams drew from one pocket a pistol and from another a pair of handcuffs The scene is ended mister Watkins he said coolly I want you to slip on those and come with me And he threw the handcuffs on the table and leveled the pistol at the fellow s head The man staggered and threw up his hands half expecting a shot He suddenly began to tremble as if with the ague What do you mean Wh who are you he faltered I am Adam Adams I believe we have met before Adams The secret service man sank back in an armchair And you you are here to arrest me Exactly As I said before the whole game is up Inside of half an hour you will be safe in prison and then we shall round up such other members of the gang as are still at large Unless you want to make a confession you will have to stand trial for the murder of mister and missus Langmore Never I ll I ll tell all I know first The man s lips were white and his eyes full of commingled rage and fear You will make a clean and clear statement Yes Clearing up the murder mystery Yes CHAPTER XXXI LIGHT AT LAST CONCLUSION As soon as Adam Adams returned to Sidham he communicated with the chief of police and with several other persons and also sent two telegrams to New York He tried to find Charles Vapp but could not locate his assistant The detective s plans were laid with care and he gave the posse of men under him minute instructions as to what to do In the midst of the work Raymond and Tom Ostrello appeared Let me go along said Raymond I want to do my little towards rounding that gang up And so do I came from the young commercial traveler You may go as far as Styles farm if you wish said Adam Adams But why not look for Miss Langmore instead At this Raymond s face grew troubled We have looked everywhere he began As you please It was not long after this that a portion of the party set out to be followed presently by the rest The men did not keep together but scattered in a wide semicircle and then in a circle which completely surrounded the Styles farm and the old mill and its vicinity As they approached the farm they saw the man called Bart come out and walk towards the barn He was promptly arrested by Adam Adams and was asked where Matlock Styles could be found I don t know he answered sullenly I don t know why you are arresting me I haven t done anything wrong We ll see about that later returned the detective and when the man wanted to blow a whistle he carried promptly prevented it and took the whistle away Then the man was compelled to quiet the dogs which he did with bad grace In the kitchen of the house they found the old woman who gave a cry of alarm when told that she must give herself up to the law Sure I didn t have anything to do with it she wailed I I didn t touch the young lady What s that cried Raymond stepping forward I didn t touch the young lady sir I offered her something to eat that s all Can she mean Margaret whispered Tom Ostrello Where did you meet Miss Langmore demanded Raymond sharply Up at the old cottage on the hill I I didn t take her there It was She stopped short I can t tell you Mat would kill me she whined See here tell all you know came sternly from Adam Adams I know you You once ran a baby farm and a baby died and I know how The old woman gave a shriek and fell on her knees rocking to and fro I knew it I knew it would come It can t be hid any longer Yes I did it Where is Miss Langmore demanded Raymond impatiently At the cottage on the hill Mat took her there He s in love with her Oh dear Oh dear she began to rock to and fro again I knew it would come Murder will out they say Take us to that cottage and be quick about it said Raymond Will you go along he asked of Adam Adams and Tom Ostrello They said they would and set off without delay It was rather a long walk and the old woman was out of breath when they reached the building near the top of the hill Watch her said the detective to Tom Ostrello and he and Raymond entered the cottage As they did so they stumbled over a person lying on the floor Margaret burst out the young man and caught his sweetheart in his arms Then he gave a gasp and staggered with his burden to the bed She is dead Dead ejaculated Adam Adams You are certain He placed his ear to her heart No she still lives But what does this mean Margaret Margaret Speak to me What has happened to you The girl offered no reply nor did she open her eyes She rested on him and on the bed like a leaden weight He kissed her fondly a great agony filling his soul Adam Adams looked around the room On the table rested a glass with a dirty substance at the bottom He tasted the stuff It was sweetishly bitter He ran outside Tell me at once did Matlock Styles say anything about poisoning this young lady he demanded catching the old woman by the arm The truth now remember No he didn t say anything But he had some poison a powder you put it in water It kills a person in six to ten hours sure We must have a doctor Tom Ostrello had heard the talk and saw what had happened I ll get a doctor if you ll watch the old woman I can get a horse at Styles farm Do it and hurry cried Raymond Take the best horse and bring the doctor at once Tell him it is poison a powder in water Offer him any amount of money I will Ostrello shouted back He was running down the hill path with the swiftness of a college sprinter In a moment the bushes hid him from sight Adam Adams was talking to the old woman You know about the poison Is there nothing we can give her to counteract the effects Do something and I ll not be so hard on you when you stand up for trial I can do nothing But wait yes I can Make a fire and boil some water She ran to the back of the cottage and to some bushes growing close at hand With her bare hands she dug at the roots and tore them up stripping off the bark with her teeth Adam Adams comprehended and lit a fire and set on the kettle to boil Then the roots were placed in the boiling water Make her drink it will do her good said the old woman I swear it will help at least a little until the doctor comes And with shaking hands she poured the concoction she had made into a saucer to cool It was no easy matter to get Margaret to swallow but after a while it was accomplished and her heart appeared to beat a trifle more steadily But still she did not rouse up or open her eyes and Raymond was as depressed as before We can t overcome the effects of the drug he groaned Oh if only the doctor would come Give her some more said the old woman Give her all of it and this was done Slowly the time dragged by until they heard a shouting in the distance followed by a pistol shot Then two horses burst into view one ridden by Ostrello and the other by a doctor who lived not a great distance away I will do all I can said the physician as he leaped to the ground He set to work at once meanwhile questioning the old woman regarding what had already been done That was all right it has helped to put the patient into a perspiration and keep up the heart action Another doctor is also coming said Ostrello to Raymond and the detective In that case I ll join my men came from Adam Adams By that pistol shot something must be doing I will be back later See that that old woman does not get away And he was off Something was indeed doing The old mill had been surrounded and the chief of police had entered the building followed by several other men of the party The counterfeiters were taken by surprise but they did not give up at once Some began to fight and in the melee two were seriously wounded Then all but three surrendered these three doing what they could to get out by a back way One of the three was Matlock Styles The three men came out in the woods and one was quickly shot in the leg and fell headlong among the trees Seeing this the second man shouted that he would surrender and threw up his arms as a signal You bloomin fool I ll not surrender cried Matlock Styles and ran on through the woods and up the hill that led to the cottage He was still some distance off when Adam Adams saw him coming The detective had his pistol in his hand Stop Styles or I ll fire on you he called out For an answer the Englishman raised his own pistol and fired point blank the bullet cutting through the loose flap of Adam Adams coat Then the Englishman went down with a bullet in his left side When Adam Adams ran up to him he was twisting and breathing heavily You ve done me up hang you he gasped Oh if I only could get at you and he tried to crawl towards his pistol but Adam Adams promptly kicked it out of the way You re down and out Styles said the detective It won t do you any good to squirm You re in the hands of the law What for counterfeiting That and worse Worse Yes a good deal worse Murder By nightfall all of the prisoners were either in the jail or at the hospital at Sidham Some of the secret service authorities from New York had arrived and to them Adam Adams turned over the case so far as it related to the counterfeiters I did not start out to round up such a gang he said in speaking of the affair to mister Breslow some days later I came here to clear up the murder mystery But you get the credit Adams said the head of the secret service detail And you deserve it But do you think you are going to convict Matlock Styles of the tragedy It s a sure thing The alibi won t bother me for I can now prove it was a bogus one John Watkins got the poison for him and promised to impersonate him at Stony Hill while the crime was being committed He did it but I have found two people who thought it was not Styles after all Watkins himself is willing to testify that he did the impersonating How did they happen to use that strange powder Watkins got it from a friend of his who afterwards mentioned the fact to Tom Ostrello When Styles got it I suppose he thought the use of it might throw suspicion on Ostrello which it did Then suspicion was also thrown on Miss Langmore so that the general public might get tangled up Did Styles write that note which was supposed to have been written by mister Langmore saying she must obey or leave the house Yes He is an expert penman and most likely a regular forger as well as counterfeiter He only made a mistake when he drank too much Did Watkins know any of the details of the murder Yes After it was over Styles came to him and told his story being half drunk at the time He said he left home and came through the woods where he saw Tom Ostrello just coming from the Langmore mansion As soon as the coast seemed clear he ran past the bushes and got in the house by a window He found mister Langmore in the library and asked again for the counterfeits Langmore said he was going to give them to the authorities and expose Styles Then the Englishman said he would explain and Langmore sat down in his chair to listen Styles turned around took some cotton from his pocket and saturated it with the powder and sprang at Langmore from behind The victim struggled and got his face scratched from the Englishman s ring Langmore was no match for his assailant and in a minute the murder was done Then Styles ran upstairs He knew the servant was in the barn and he heard Miss Langmore playing on the piano in the parlor He met missus Langmore just coming from her room She was scared but before she could scream or resist he gave her what was left of the powder and she fell over where she was found Then he stepped out of an upper window to the top of the piazza and dropped to the ground and came away across the brook and through the woods Then you are bound to convict him What of Watkins I ll use him as a witness against Styles in the murder trial and then you can have him tried as a counterfeiter The old woman will also prove a good witness She is so old and has promised to reform so there is no use of our pushing a charge against her The rest of the crowd will all get what they deserve I m glad we got the bogus printing plates Have you heard anything of the Langmore estate Yes mister Langmore left his wife her legal share and the balance to his daughters Margaret getting a little the larger portion missus Langmore leaves her money to her sons one fourth to Dick the spendthrift and three fourths to Tom I have also rooted out some papers among Styles effects which will give Tom Ostrello his patent back and also give some patent rights to mister Langmore s estate I can tell you Matlock Styles was a deep one It was only once in a great while that he drank and bungled Well the greatest of criminals have their weak spots you know that as well as I do Styles I suppose also got up that bogus confession signed in Miss Langmore s name He did When he found the girl wouldn t marry him he was wild and ready for any treachery And how is the girl doing I am going to see now When out on the street Adam Adams ran into Tom Ostrello arm in arm with Letty He was amazed for an instant and then his face broke into a smile I just couldn t help it Uncle Adam cried the girl I had to come here to congratulate Tom on his escape Well I don t blame you Letty Yes it has turned out well for you I hope it turns out as well for Miss Langmore and mister Case Margaret was again at Martha Sampson s cottage When the detective entered he heard a murmur of voices in one of the upper rooms He ran upstairs to find the girl sitting up in bed and Raymond by her side The young man s face was filled with happiness Come in Come in he cried joyously She has come around all right mister Adams She is a little weak still but the doctor says she will be well as ever in a week or ten days The good news has braced her up wonderfully And all due to you mister Adams said the girl Oh how can I ever thank you enough She clasped his hand warmly You are so good This is certainly famous he replied sitting down at the foot of the bed It s the best news yet I have just left one happy couple and here I find another You mean Tom Ostrello and that young lady from your office asked Raymond And then as the detective nodded he went on I met them and I asked them to come here Margaret wanted to see them I wish Tom to know that I want to be friends always said Margaret We have had enough of trouble in the family And when he gets married I want to be friends with his wife too I am glad to hear that for I know it will please Letty and she is a good girl It may be Here they come now A minute later the newcomers were ushered into the sick room and the two girls who had never met were introduced to each other It was a happy meeting all around and the lovers were all as devoted as lovers can well be Seeing this Adam Adams thought it about time to leave I am going now he said and stopped at the door So soon asked Margaret Yes I have another important case on hand answered Adam Adams Another case queried Tom Ostrello Well I wish you luck I am sure We all do chimed in Raymond What is it queried Letty Adam Adams smiled broadly As you are no longer connected with the office I cannot tell you he said Maybe I can guess it cried Raymond The disappearance of John Darr the case all New York is talking about Adam Adams smiled faintly You ve struck it he said It is a wonderful case and will demand all of my attention But I ll be back tomorrow In the meantime I want you all to remember that you owe me an invitation An invitation to what asked both girls in a breath and knowing perfectly well what he meant An invitation to the weddings when they come off Oh came in a little feminine shriek Well you get them said Raymond Indeed he does said Tom And he did END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MANSION OF MYSTERY This file should be named sixteen thousand two
